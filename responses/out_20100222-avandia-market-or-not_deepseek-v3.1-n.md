# Avandia: Off the Market or Not? (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 article discusses the controversy surrounding Avandia (rosiglitazone), a diabetes drug from GlaxoSmithKline, following a leaked Senate report. The report revealed an internal FDA recommendation to remove the drug from the market due to cardiovascular safety concerns, noting that competing drug Actos (pioglitazone) could achieve similar benefits without the same risks. 

The article highlights that safety concerns had existed for several years, with red flags raised in 2007, but the FDA remained divided on regulatory action. GSK was ordered to conduct a prospective head-to-head trial against Actos, though some FDA staff argued this was unethical given the known risks. The article also details GSK's aggressive response to criticism, including attempts to silence Dr. John Buse, a University of North Carolina professor who raised safety concerns as early as 1999 through legal threats and pressure on his supervisor.

## 2. HISTORY

**Regulatory Actions:**
- **September 2010**: FDA significantly restricted Avandia use, limiting it to patients who couldn't control diabetes with other medications
- **November 2011**: European Medicines Agency withdrew Avandia completely from the European market
- **2013**: GSK pleaded guilty to federal charges and paid **$3 billion** in settlements for illegal drug marketing and failing to report safety data, including withholding Avandia cardiovascular risk data
- The drug remained available in the US under strict restrictions, but prescribing plummeted

**Legal and Financial Impact:**
- GSK paid approximately **$700 million** to settle individual lawsuits from patients claiming heart attacks and strokes
- The company faced thousands of lawsuits over cardiovascular events allegedly caused by Avandia
- Avandia sales, which peaked at $3.2 billion annually, collapsed to negligible levels
- The TIDE (Thiazolidinedione Intervention with Vitamin D Evaluation) trial mentioned in the article was ultimately halted due to safety concerns

**Scientific Outcomes:**
- Subsequent meta-analyses confirmed increased cardiovascular risk with rosiglitazone
- The RECORD trial, designed to address safety concerns, showed mixed results but contributed to ongoing restrictions
- Actos (pioglitazone) became the dominant TZD drug but later faced its own safety concerns regarding bladder cancer risk

**Policy Changes:**
- The Avandia controversy accelerated FDA reforms in drug safety monitoring
- Enhanced post-market surveillance requirements for diabetes drugs
- Increased scrutiny of cardiovascular safety in antidiabetic drug development

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article questioned whether Avandia would remain on the market, given conflicting FDA opinions
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate - Avandia wasn't completely removed from the US market but was severely restricted with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS); completely withdrawn in Europe

• **Prediction**: Implied GSK would face consequences for how they "could have handled" the Buse situation differently
  - **Outcome**: Validated - GSK paid $3 billion in settlements including for improper handling of Avandia safety data and intimidating researchers

• **Prediction**: The prospective trial would take years and Avandia would be generic by the time results came out
  - **Outcome**: Accurate - The drug faced generic competition, and the trial was ultimately stopped before completion due to safety concerns and lack of enrollment

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article captured a watershed moment in pharmaceutical regulation, combining scientific controversy, regulatory failure, corporate misconduct, and the eventual $3 billion settlement that became the largest healthcare fraud settlement in U.S. history at the time, fundamentally changing how drug companies report safety data.
