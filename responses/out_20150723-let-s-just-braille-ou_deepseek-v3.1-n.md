# Article Title (Month Year)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on a collaboration between IBM-Zürich and the University of Santiago de Compostela that used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly image a reactive intermediate—an aryne species generated by removing iodines from a precursor molecule. By applying high voltage to the AFM tip to cleave the bonds and then imaging the resulting isolated molecule, the team measured bond lengths and angles and concluded the intermediate most resembled a cumulene structure rather than alternative depictions as a diradical or traditional aryne.

The author reflects on how AFM enables direct observation of fleeting reactive intermediates that were previously only inferred from indirect evidence. The article wonders whether AFM could eventually become a standard analytical technique for structure determination, while acknowledging that most such work still comes from specialized labs like IBM's and that walk-up instruments remain distant.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 publication, atomic force microscopy continued advancing in molecular imaging capabilities. The IBM-Zürich group has remained a dominant force in high-resolution AFM of single molecules, suggesting the field has not yet democratized into routine analytical use. One significant development is the commercialization of CO-functionalized AFM tips, improving reliability in bond-order discrimination. Several research groups have replicated single-molecule bond-resolution imaging, expanding beyond IBM. However, AFM has not become a "walk-up" analytical technique and remains primarily a specialized research tool.

The specific cumulene-vs-aryne mechanistic question addressed in this article appears to have remained a niche research finding rather than catalyzing major shifts in synthetic methodology or drug discovery. No FDA-approved drugs or clinical candidates are known to have had their development directly impacted by this result. The broader impact has been methodological—demonstrating AFM's power for mechanistic organic chemistry—but adoption in pharmaceutical R&D pipelines has not materialized at scale.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions made:**
- AFM could become a standard analytical technique where researchers "just run the AFM tip over it" to determine structures
- The technique is "far too useful and powerful...to keep down for too long"
- Acknowledgment that walk-up instruments weren't expected "any time soon"

**How they compared to reality:**
• AFM has not become a standard analytical technique for routine molecular structure determination. Progress has been steady but slower than implied.
• The prediction underestimated the technical barriers to widespread adoption: requirement for ultra-high vacuum, cryogenic temperatures, specialized tip functionalization, and expert operation remain significant hurdles.
• While the technique has expanded beyond IBM labs, adoption has been limited to specialized research groups rather than routine analytical use.
• No walk-up AFM instruments for molecular structure determination have become commercially available.
• The gap between research demonstrations and practical analytical utility remains substantial nine years later.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an interesting technical milestone in molecular imaging, but its broader relevance to biotechnology and pharmaceutical development appears limited. While AFM imaging of single molecules remains scientifically valuable, it has not translated into practical impact on drug discovery or become the transformative analytical technique envisioned.
