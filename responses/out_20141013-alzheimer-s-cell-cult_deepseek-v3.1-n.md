# Alzheimer's in Cell Culture?
13 Oct 2014

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a breakthrough by the Tanzi lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, published in Nature, where researchers successfully grew 3D neuronal cultures that reproduce the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. This was significant because neurons are notoriously difficult to culture, and Alzheimer's had been extremely challenging to model in any in vitro system. The cultures responded to secretase inhibitors, which was expected but also puzzling since such inhibitors had shown poor efficacy in human clinical trials. The author notes this could open new avenues for phenotypic screening in Alzheimer's drug discovery, while cautioning that the challenge would be determining whether results from the model would translate to the actual human disease. The final update mentions that Tanzi's previous Alzheimer's insights had "run into some serious setbacks."

## 2. HISTORY

The 3D neuronal culture system developed by the Tanzi lab became known as "Alzheimer's-in-a-dish" and represented genuine progress in disease modeling. The technique allowed researchers to observe plaque and tangle formation in real-time, providing a more accessible platform for studying disease mechanisms and testing potential therapeutics.

Subsequent developments showed mixed outcomes. While the 3D culture model gained adoption in academic research and some pharmaceutical settings for early-stage drug screening, it did not lead to successful FDA-approved drugs. The secretase inhibitors mentioned in the article - and similar compounds targeting amyloid pathways - continued to fail in clinical trials through 2015-2022. Notably, drugs like solanezumab and other beta-secretase and gamma-secretase inhibitors showed no meaningful clinical benefit despite promising preclinical results from various models including cell culture systems.

The fundamental issue highlighted by the article proved prescient: compounds effective in models don't necessarily translate to human patients. Between 2015-2023, multiple anti-amyloid antibodies advanced through clinical trials with varying outcomes. Aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 but had limited clinical benefit and poor market uptake due to questionable efficacy and safety concerns. Lecanemab showed modest clinical benefit in 2023 but with significant side effects and small effect sizes that continued to fuel debate about the amyloid hypothesis.

On the commercial side, Tanzi co-founded a company called AZTherapies, which pursued treatments based on this research direction, but the company faced the same clinical trial challenges affecting the broader Alzheimer's field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The 3D culture system would "open up a whole new avenue for phenotypic screening" for Alzheimer's drug discovery.  
**Reality**: The model was adopted for research use but did not lead to successful drug approvals. Academic labs and some companies used it for mechanistic studies and early drug screening, but the compounds identified still failed in clinical trials, suggesting the model didn't fully capture human disease complexity.

• **Prediction**: The "tricky part will be whether compounds that come out of such a screen will be telling us something about Alzheimer's, or just telling us something about the model."  
**Reality**: This concern proved highly relevant. While the model could reproduce plaque and tangle formation, compounds effective in the model rarely translated to human patients, indicating the model captured some but not all aspects of human Alzheimer's pathology.

• **Prediction**: "Nothing in this area has come easy, and a break would be welcome."  
**Reality**: Even with improved models, Alzheimer's drug development remained extremely difficult. From 2014-2024, drug failure rates remained around 99% for Alzheimer's treatments, and the few approved drugs showed marginal benefits at best.

• **Implicit prediction**: Secretase inhibitors might work if the model was accurate.  
**Reality**: Secretase inhibitors continued to fail in clinical trials, suggesting either the model was incomplete, the compounds behaved differently in vivo, or the amyloid hypothesis itself was insufficient to explain Alzheimer's progression in humans.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article identified a genuinely important technical advance in Alzheimer's modeling and correctly anticipated the translation challenges that would persist for another decade. The 3D culture work was scientifically significant and widely adopted, though it did not solve the broader drug development crisis in Alzheimer's therapeutics.
