# And on the Carl Icahn Front. . . (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from February 2010 reports that activist investor Carl Icahn was continuing his campaign to influence Biogen Idec's board of directors. Icahn had nominated three additional directors to join the company's board, where he already had two representatives. The article frames the upcoming proxy vote as a crucial test of shareholder sentiment about whether steering Biogen down a path similar to Imclone—a company where Icahn had previously been successful in pushing for changes—would be beneficial for the company.

## 2. HISTORY

The Carl Icahn proxy fight against Biogen Idec in 2010 was part of his broader activist campaign in the biotechnology sector. Here's what happened subsequently:

**2010 Proxy Battle Outcome**: In June 2010, Icahn lost the proxy fight when shareholders rejected all three of his board nominees. Biogen's management successfully defended their position, with shareholders apparently unconvinced that Icahn's approach would benefit the company.

**Icahn's Continued Involvement**: Despite the loss, Icahn maintained significant influence. He still held two board seats from earlier fights and continued to pressure the company on strategic decisions.

**Company Performance and Evolution**: Biogen Idec went on to achieve substantial success in the following years, particularly with its multiple sclerosis drugs and later with Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy. The company maintained its independent course rather than being sold or radically restructured as Icahn had advocated.

**Imclone Comparison**: The comparison to Imclone proved imperfect—while Icahn had successfully pushed for Imclone's sale to Eli Lilly in 2008, Biogen shareholders preferred the company's existing strategy and management team.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in this article. The piece was observational rather than predictive, simply noting the ongoing proxy battle and inviting readers to "stay tuned" for the outcome.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This was a routine business news item about an activist investor campaign that ultimately had limited long-term impact on the company or the broader biotechnology industry. While proxy fights can be significant, this particular episode didn't fundamentally alter Biogen's trajectory or create lasting changes worth noting in the broader context of biotechnology development.
