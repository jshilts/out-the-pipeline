# Sarepta's Approval Woes (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Sarepta Therapeutics' setback when the FDA denied accelerated approval for eteplirsen, their proposed therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The drug was studied in only twelve boys with DMD, with results that looked promising but were based on small numbers and questionable statistical handling—specifically excluding two patients who were too sick to benefit. The FDA's rejection surprised many investors and infuriated the DMD patient community, sending Sarepta's stock plummeting. The regulatory concerns centered on inadequate trial design, questions about dystrophin as a biomarker, insufficient trial duration (less than two years), small sample size, and the need for better-powered endpoints beyond the six-minute walk test. The author notes this rejection came after the recent failure of a similar DMD drug from Prosensa and GlaxoSmithKline, making the regulatory environment more challenging.

## 2. HISTORY
Eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51) was ultimately approved by the FDA in September 2016 under the accelerated approval pathway, despite continued controversy about its efficacy. The approval came after Sarepta conducted additional studies and presented more extensive data, though the evidence remained contentious within the medical community.

Following approval, Exondys 51 achieved significant commercial uptake, with Sarepta reporting approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenues from the drug by 2023, treating thousands of DMD patients with the specific exon 51 mutation (roughly 13% of DMD cases). However, clinical benefits remained debated—while the drug showed dystrophin production increase, functional improvements in patients were modest and inconsistent across studies.

This approval set a precedent that influenced FDA's approach to rare disease drugs, emphasizing patient community advocacy and accepting surrogate endpoints (dystrophin production) when traditional clinical endpoints are difficult to achieve. The saga continued with additional Sarepta DMD drugs (golodirsen, casimersen) approved using similar pathways, and ongoing debates about whether the FDA's flexibility went too far in compromising evidence standards.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Bearish investor prediction of "early 2018 approval at best"**: The prediction proved too pessimistic; actual approval came in September 2016, approximately two years earlier than forecasted.

- **Concern that "Sarepta will have a difficult time coming to a study design that the company thinks they can do and that the FDA will be satisfied with"**: While this reflected genuine regulatory concerns, Sarepta and the FDA ultimately reached agreement on a pathway forward, though the process remained contentious.

- **Implication that accelerated approval would put FDA in "untenable position" with insufficient data**: This concern proved prescient—the FDA did grant accelerated approval but faced significant criticism from parts of the medical community over limited evidence of clinical benefit, continuing debates that persist today.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

The article captured a pivotal moment in regulatory history that presaged broader FDA policy shifts on rare disease treatments and the powerful role of patient advocacy in drug approval decisions. The case established important precedents about surrogate endpoints and accelerated approval pathways that continue influencing drug development and regulatory standards.
