# Dr. Gilman's Turn Toward the Inside (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the insider trading case involving Dr. Sidney Gilman, a Michigan-based academic researcher and Alzheimer's expert who was accused of passing confidential information about Wyeth's bapineuzumab Alzheimer's drug trial results to hedge funds. The piece describes how Gilman underwent a "sharp shift" in his late 60s, transitioning from a career dedicated to academic research to becoming a highly paid consultant for financial firms, earning $1,000 per hour for his medical expertise while simultaneously overseeing drug trials for pharmaceutical companies.

The article highlights the tension between experts legitimately sharing their knowledge and the ethical boundaries that become problematic when large sums of money are involved. The author suggests Gilman's case illustrates a gradual moral decline, referencing C.S. Lewis's "The Screwtape Letters" about the "gentle slope" toward corruption.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article's publication, the case against Dr. Gilman progressed through the legal system. In **August 2014**, Gilman **settled with the SEC**, agreeing to pay over $234,000 in disgorgement and penalties while neither admitting nor denying the allegations. The SEC alleged he had provided material nonpublic information about the negative bapineuzumab trial results to SAC Capital portfolio manager Mathew Martoma.

The broader insider trading case had significant consequences:

- **SAC Capital Advisors** (later renamed Point72 Asset Management) pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in **2014** and paid a record $1.8 billion penalty
- **Mathew Martoma**, the portfolio manager who received Gilman's tips, was **convicted in February 2014** on insider trading charges and sentenced to **nine years in prison**
- The case became one of the most prominent examples of expert network insider trading, contributing to increased scrutiny of how hedge funds obtain information from medical consultants

Regarding the actual drug development:
- **Bapineuzumab ultimately failed** in Phase III clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease
- Neither Wyeth nor Elan successfully brought an Alzheimer's drug to market based on this approach
- The case highlighted the enormous financial stakes involved in clinical trial results, where billions in market capitalization could be gained or lost based on data releases

The scandal led to **increased SEC enforcement** focused on expert networks and tighter compliance regulations within both pharmaceutical companies and financial firms regarding how clinical trial data is shared and when consultants can trade on such information.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments, focusing instead on commentary about the ethical implications of the case as it was unfolding. The author's cautionary tone about the "minefield" of expert consulting when large sums are involved proved prescient given the legal outcomes that followed.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in financial regulation history when an academic researcher's shift to high-paid consulting intersected with one of the largest insider trading cases ever prosecuted. The case had lasting implications for how pharmaceutical companies manage clinical trial data and how financial firms access expert medical opinions.
