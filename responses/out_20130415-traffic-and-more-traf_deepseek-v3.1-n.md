# Traffic and More Traffic (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief post from April 15, 2013 describes a blogger's experience with viral web traffic. The author notes that their site had already broken its monthly traffic record just halfway through the month, driven by a cascade of online mentions. The traffic surge originated from a link on xkcd's "What If" page, which then spawned discussions on Reddit, leading to a front-page placement on Hacker News (ycombinator's community). The author also mentions a subsequent Twitter mention by Adam Savage of Mythbusters fame, and expresses gratitude to readers and those sharing the content.

## 2. HISTORY

The specific blog post and website referenced in this article cannot be identified from the provided text alone, as it lacks the blog's name, URL, or author identity, and contains no technical or biotech content that would enable confident research of subsequent developments. The post describes a temporary traffic spike phenomenon common to web publishing, but no information is provided about the site's content, readership patterns after the viral event, publication frequency, business model, or long-term trajectory. Without the ability to identify the specific website or author, tracking concrete post-2013 outcomes (such as sustained readership, monetization success, industry influence, acquisition, or shutdown) is not feasible while avoiding speculation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains no explicit predictions about future developments, technological trends, business outcomes, regulatory changes, or clinical results. The author's observations are entirely retrospective, describing a traffic surge that had already occurred by the posting date. There are no stated expectations about future traffic levels, content direction, reader engagement patterns, or broader industry evolution that could be evaluated against later events.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This appears to be a personal blog post about website traffic metrics with no scientific, biotechnological, or health-related content, which makes it completely off-topic for the analysis format requested.
