# The Other Shoe Drops at Ariad (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 blog post reports on Ariad Pharmaceuticals' crisis after the FDA told the company to take its leukemia drug Iclusig (ponatinib) completely off the market due to serious blood-clotting side effects. The article describes how this regulatory action forced Ariad to lay off a large portion of its workforce and cast doubt on both the drug's future and the company's survival. The author also mentions an incomplete building construction project in Cambridge that was intended to be Ariad's new headquarters, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding who would ultimately occupy the space. In contrast to the FDA's complete market withdrawal, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) allowed Iclusig to remain on the market with increased cautionary measures. The article paints a picture of the harsh realities of the biopharmaceutical industry, where a single regulatory setback can threaten an entire company.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2013 crisis, Iclusig did indeed return to the US market. The FDA lifted the suspension in January 2014 with a revised label that included a black box warning and strict risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) requirements. The drug was approved for a narrower indication: treatment-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), specifically for patients with the T315I mutation or those who had failed other tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

Iclusig gained full FDA approval in November 2016 for adult patients with CP-CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapies, and in December 2012 it had already been approved for resistant Ph+ ALL. By 2023, the drug had generated annual revenues exceeding $300 million, demonstrating significant market uptake among eligible patient populations.

Ariad Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda in February 2017 for approximately $5.2 billion, representing a substantial recovery from the 2013 crisis. The company continued operations as Ariad, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda, maintaining its oncology focus.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: "It's very much in doubt whether Iclusig will ever come back."
  - **Outcome**: Iclusig did return to market within months (January 2014) with modified indications and enhanced safety warnings.

• **Prediction**: "It's very much in doubt whether Ariad will [survive], or how long that might take."
  - **Outcome**: Ariad not only survived but was acquired by Takeda for $5.2 billion in 2017, representing a successful turnaround.

• **Prediction**: Implicit concern about the fate of Ariad's incomplete headquarters building.
  - **Outcome**: While the article mixes up Ariad's building with Aveo's, the broader concern about biotech real estate proved prescient, as the industry has seen continued volatility in construction and occupancy in the Cambridge biotech corridor.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

This article captures a critical regulatory moment that exemplifies both the fragility and resilience of biotechnology companies facing late-stage clinical setbacks, while also illustrating how drugs with serious side effects can still find appropriate therapeutic niches with proper risk mitigation strategies.
