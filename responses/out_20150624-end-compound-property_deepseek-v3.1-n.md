# The End of Compound Property Optimization Is At Hand (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes a joint retrospective review of drug pipeline data (2000-2010) from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Lilly, and GSK, covering 812 compounds. The key finding is that when compounds already fall within accepted physicochemical ranges (molecular weight, cLogP, cLogD, polar surface area), further optimization of these parameters provides no meaningful improvement in clinical success rates.

The data showed that 40% of terminated compounds failed due to preclinical toxicity, with 20% failing due to "portfolio rationalization." However, the striking result was that compounds failing due to toxicity showed no statistical differences in physicochemical properties compared to successful compounds. Even compounds failing in Phase I for pharmacokinetic reasons showed no property differences. The authors conclude that the "sliding scale" approach to drug optimization—where moving closer to ideal property ranges was thought to improve outcomes—appears to be invalid. The gains from property-based filtering had already been realized by eliminating extreme outliers, leaving little room for further improvement through these simple parameters alone.

## 2. HISTORY

The paper's findings reflected a broader shift in drug discovery philosophy that continued after 2015. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly recognized that **simple rule-based physicochemical optimization had reached diminishing returns**. However, rather than abandoning property considerations entirely, the field moved toward more sophisticated approaches that integrated additional dimensions:

**Mechanistic Toxicology and ADME**: The inability of simple properties to predict toxicity led to greater emphasis on understanding specific toxicological mechanisms, reactive metabolite screening, and advanced ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) modeling that went beyond simple lipophilicity measures.

**Computational Advances**: Machine learning and AI approaches began supplementing (rather than replacing) physicochemical property filters, incorporating structural alerts, off-target predictions, and multi-parameter optimization that considered properties in combination rather than isolation.

**Clinical Validation**: The fundamental issue identified—that compounds within acceptable ranges still fail at high rates—remained true. Industry-wide success rates for drugs moving from Phase I to approval remained around 10-15% post-2015, validating that simple property optimization alone couldn't solve pipeline attrition.

**Business Impact**: The recognition that portfolio rationalization (20% of failures) and toxicity (40%) drove attrition more than properties influenced R&D strategy, leading some companies to improve decision-making processes and commit to projects earlier rather than continually optimizing lead properties.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Prediction**: That tweaking physicochemical parameters within accepted ranges would prove to be a "waste of time"
  - **Outcome**: **Mostly correct**. The industry largely moved away from believing that incremental property improvements within normal ranges would dramatically improve success. However, this didn't eliminate property monitoring—instead, it became one input among many rather than the primary driver of decision-making.

• **Prediction**: That toxicology and pharmacokinetics are "complex fields" requiring "something new" beyond simple parameters
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. This prediction was validated by the subsequent growth in mechanistic toxicology, safety pharmacology, and complex ADME modeling. The failure to find simple property-toxicity correlations drove investment in more sophisticated toxicogenomics, organ-on-a-chip systems, and predictive toxicology platforms.

• **Prediction**: That the gains from physicochemical filtering had been "realized early on" by trimming extreme outliers
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. This view became widely accepted in drug discovery. The value of property filters (like Lipinski's Rule of Five) was in preventing time-wasting pursuit of extreme compounds, not in fine-tuning already acceptable candidates.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified a crucial inflection point in drug discovery strategy—the recognition that simplistic property optimization had reached its limits. The piece had lasting impact because it provided empirical evidence against widely held assumptions and correctly anticipated the need for more sophisticated approaches to drug development challenges.
