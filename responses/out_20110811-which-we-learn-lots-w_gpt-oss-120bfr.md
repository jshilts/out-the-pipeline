# In Which We Learn Lots About Wine Swirling (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article is a tongue‑in‑cheek commentary that claims the direction in which you swirl a glass of wine changes what you smell. According to the piece, a **counter‑clockwise** swirl supposedly emphasizes “spice‑shelf” aromas that come from the barrel, while a **clockwise** swirl supposedly brings out fruit notes.  The author backs this up with a string of pseudo‑scientific explanations: wine is said to contain “cells” with magnetic polarity, the Earth’s rotation supposedly imprints a directional pattern on molecules, and swirling either “tightens” or “unwinds” these patterns, altering which volatile compounds are released.  The article also drifts into a critique of biodynamic viticulture, mocking its use of “ground quartz in cow horns” (preparation 501) as “half‑understood second‑hand gibberish.”

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Scientific consensus on wine swirling** – Over the past decade, sensory‑science research has repeatedly shown that swirling a wine can increase the release of volatile aroma compounds by exposing more surface area to air, but the **direction of swirl has no measurable effect**.  Controlled experiments (e.g., blind tastings with randomized swirl direction) have found no statistically significant difference in perceived aroma intensity or character.  The underlying physics cited in the article (magnetic polarity of “wine cells,” Earth‑rotation‑induced molecular shingling) is not supported by any peer‑reviewed literature.  

- **Industry practice** – Professional sommeliers and wine‑service guidelines continue to recommend a gentle swirl to aerate the wine, but they do not specify a direction.  No major wine‑producer, trade association, or regulatory body has adopted the clockwise/counter‑clockwise distinction.  

- **Biodynamic wine** – The biodynamic movement has persisted and even grown modestly in niche markets, but its practices (including preparation 501) remain controversial.  Scientific assessments have not validated any unique sensory benefit attributable to those preparations, and the market growth has been driven more by branding than by demonstrable performance.  

- **Public perception** – The article itself circulated mainly within chemistry‑related social media circles (e.g., Chemjobber, Twitter) as a humorous piece.  It did not spark broader debate or policy change, and it has not been cited in serious wine‑science publications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not lay out explicit, formal predictions, but it implicitly suggests:

- **Prediction:** Swirl direction will become a recognized factor in wine tasting, with winemakers and sommeliers adopting clockwise vs. counter‑clockwise techniques to highlight different aroma families.  
  **Outcome:** Not realized.  Professional tasting curricula and wine‑service manuals make no mention of swirl direction, and no commercial products or training programs have been built around this idea.

- **Prediction (implied):** The “magnetic polarity” explanation will gain scientific traction and perhaps influence wine‑production methods.  
  **Outcome:** No scientific uptake; the concept remains classified as pseudoscience.

- **Prediction (implied):** Biodynamic practices such as preparation 501 will be validated by physics‑based arguments similar to those offered for swirl direction.  
  **Outcome:** Biodynamic methods continue to be debated on philosophical and agronomic grounds, not on the magnetic‑field rationale presented.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10**  
The piece is amusing and illustrates how scientific‑sounding language can be misapplied, but it has had virtually no lasting impact on wine science, industry practice, or public policy.  Its relevance is limited to a niche of internet humor rather than to substantive biotechnology or sensory research.
