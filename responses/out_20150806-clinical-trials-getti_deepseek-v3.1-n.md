# Clinical Trials: Getting Much Worse, or Much Better? (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes a PLOS ONE study examining 55 clinical trials funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) between 1970-2012. The data revealed a dramatic shift: pre-2000 trials showed 57% positive outcomes, while post-2000 trials showed only 8% positive outcomes. The author identifies that year 2000 as significant because it marked the implementation of ClinicalTrials.gov registration requirements, mandating prospective declaration of primary outcome variables.

This registration prevented researchers from selectively reporting positive results among multiple measured outcomes - a practice that may have inflated success rates in earlier trials. The study found that nearly half of post-2000 trials had significant positive effects for secondary outcomes, suggesting they could have claimed success had they not pre-registered primary endpoints. The author concludes this demonstrates the importance of calling shots honestly in clinical research, both in trial design and final reporting.

## 2. HISTORY

The ClinicalTrials.gov registration requirement that the article discusses was part of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, which mandated registration for serious or life-threatening conditions. This was significantly expanded by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, which required registration and results reporting for most clinical trials. By 2016, the Final Rule expanded requirements further to include all trials supporting FDA approval.

The transparency movement gained substantial momentum post-2015. The AllTrials campaign, launched in 2013, continued advocating for registration and full reporting of all trials. In 2018, the WHO called for universal trial registration and transparency. Academic institutions and journals increasingly adopted policies requiring prospective registration for publication.

This transparency has had measurable effects. Studies published in subsequent years confirmed the article's hypothesis about outcome switching, with systematic reviews showing that selective outcome reporting remains problematic but is reduced with mandatory registration. The research community has broadly accepted that pre-registration improves scientific rigor, despite some ongoing challenges with compliance and enforcement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's core insight - that mandatory trial registration explains the apparent decline in positive cardiovascular trials - proved accurate:
- • **Impact of registration on reported success rates**: The article correctly identified that transparency requirements rather than scientific competence explained the dramatic drop in positive outcomes. Subsequent research confirmed this pattern across multiple therapeutic areas, showing that mandatory registration reduces selective reporting without necessarily improving underlying research quality.
- • **Ongoing challenges in research rigor**: While the article didn't make specific predictions about the future, the concern about cherry-picking outcomes being more illusion than reality has proven valid. Studies continue to find evidence of selective reporting even in registered trials, though registration requirements have reduced the most flagrant abuses.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article highlights an important methodological shift in clinical research transparency with lasting impact on evidence quality, though the topic is narrow and technical compared to broader scientific breakthroughs.
