# Tone It Down! (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article criticizes American Gene Technologies (AGT) for using the word "cure" in press releases about their HIV gene therapy candidate AGT-103T before any human trials had begun. The therapy aims to modify patients' CD4 T cells via lentiviral vectors to make them resistant to HIV infection (through CCR5 and CXCR4 modifications) while enhancing immune recognition of the virus. The author notes that while the scientific approach appears valid, AGT was generating "Single-dose cure!" headlines based solely on filing an IND application to begin Phase I trials, having treated zero human patients. The article argues this pre-clinical hype is irresponsible and potentially cruel to vulnerable patients, advocating for humility until clinical evidence emerges.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validate the article's caution. American Gene Technologies did advance AGT-103T into clinical trials. In 2023, the company published Phase I trial results (NCT04561258) showing the therapy was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events in 7 HIV-positive participants, and demonstrated persistent modified T cells expressing HIV-specific T cell receptors and CCR5 knockdown. However, the trial was small, lacked a control group, and measured immunological markers rather than clinical endpoints like viral load reduction or functional cure rates.

As of 2025, AGT-103T has not progressed to larger efficacy trials, and HIV gene therapy remains experimental rather than an approved treatment. The broader field has seen continued research into gene therapies for HIV, but no gene therapy has achieved FDA approval for HIV cure. First-line treatment remains antiretroviral therapy (ART), which effectively suppresses viral replication but requires lifelong adherence. The "cure" narrative AGT promoted has not materialized into clinical reality, though research continues.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made one implicit prediction and several recommendations rather than explicit forecasts:

• **Implicit prediction: Preclinical hype without clinical data would lead to disappointment**
  - **Outcome**: Validated. AGT-103T generated significant press coverage in 2019-2020 with claims of "cure" potential, but subsequent clinical data showed only safety and immunological markers without demonstrating actual therapeutic efficacy or cure outcomes. No breakthrough cure materialized.

• **The article's caution against premature "cure" claims**
  - **Reality check**: HIV research has historically been marked by periodic premature cure announcements (notably the "Berlin Patient" and "London Patient" cases, which represented rare exceptions rather than generalizable therapies). The fundamental challenges of eradicating latent HIV reservoirs remain, and no scalable cure has emerged despite decades of research. Gene therapy faces additional hurdles including delivery challenges, immune responses to vectors, insertional mutagenesis risks, and variable engraftment efficiency.

• **Broader context**: The biotech industry's clinical failure rates remain high across all therapeutic areas, and the article's call for evidence-based communication rather than hype-driven promotion reflects enduring ethical and scientific principles that remain relevant in 2025.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article holds substantial interest as a case study in responsible scientific communication and the tension between seeking investment/public attention and maintaining ethical standards when dealing with vulnerable patient populations. The specific example of AGT's HIV gene therapy provides concrete lessons about the gap between preclinical promise and clinical reality.
