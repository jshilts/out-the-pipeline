# Remember Apo-A1 Milano? Pfizer Does. (January 2010)

**Source:** Derek Lowe, *Science* "In the Pipeline" blog, January 4, 2010

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Pfizer's $1.25 billion acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics in 2003, which centered on the promising cardiovascular drug candidate Apo-A1 Milano—a variant lipoprotein believed to effectively drive reverse cholesterol transport and potentially reverse atherosclerosis through periodic infusions. By 2010, the ambitious vision had unraveled: Pfizer had exited the program, spun Esperion back out in 2008 without the Apo-A1 Milano asset, and then sold the Apo-A1 Milano rights to The Medicines Company for just $10 million upfront. The author frames this as an example of large pharma's tendency to pursue "Big Moves" that acquire self-sustaining momentum and lead to spectacular write-downs, alongside Pfizer's earlier Exubera inhaled insulin failure. A concluding wish calls for fewer mega-mergers and a focus on doing drug development better rather than just doing more of it.

## 2. HISTORY

**What happened to Apo-A1 Milano after January 2010:**
- The asset remained with **The Medicines Company**, which advanced it into a Phase II trial using recombinant ApoA-I Milano (ETC-216) in patients with acute coronary syndrome. This trial failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoints, and The Medicines Company ultimately discontinued the program.
- No ApoA-I Milano therapy has ever been **FDA-approved**, nor has any similar HDL-infusion product reached approval and broad clinical uptake for atherosclerosis or acute coronary syndromes. The reverse-cholesterol-transport/HDL-hypothesis as a drug mechanism largely failed to translate into approvable therapies across the industry (see CETP inhibitors below).
- Separately, **Esperion** (spun out by Pfizer in 2008) pivoted to small-molecule oral LDL-cholesterol-lowering agents, leading to **bempedoic acid**. Bempedoic acid was **FDA-approved in 2020** (Nexletol) as an adjunct for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It achieved moderate uptake but did not become a blockbuster.
- Pfizer's broader cardiovascular ambitions referenced in the article did not recover. Its CETP inhibitor **torcetrapib** had already failed spectacularly in 2006. Subsequent industry-wide CETP programs (dalcetrapib, evacetrapib, anacetrapib) either failed or showed marginal benefit, cementing the HDL/cholesterol-ester-transfer pathway as a major clinical disappointment.
- The author's wish for "no big mergers in 2010" went unheeded: Pfizer executed the **$68 billion acquisition of Wyeth** in 2009 (closing in late 2009, with major integration in 2010), and other large mergers continued industry-wide.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Pfizer has de-emphasized the whole area" [of cardiovascular]:** Broadly accurate; Pfizer's dominant position in cardiovascular declined post-Lipitor loss of exclusivity and the torcetrapib/ApoA1-Milano setbacks, with greater focus shifting to oncology, immunology, and vaccines.
- **Hopeful speculation about outcomes contingent on ApoA1-Milano working out:** The program did not succeed. The Medicines Company’s subsequent Phase II trial did not support efficacy, and no ApoA1-Milano or analogous HDL-infusion product reached approval or widespread use.
- **Industry prediction by the author: "Any other drug company of that size would probably have done things equally catastrophic, and as they get larger, the others surely will find their own open manholes":** Prescient. Large acquisitions and pipeline bets continued to produce major write-downs across big pharma (e.g., Roche/Seragon, GSK’s oncology pivot struggles, AstraZeneca/ZS Pharma, Merck’s anacetrapib failure). The proposed "no big mergers in 2010" was directly contradicted by Pfizer-Wyeth integration and continued M&A trend across the industry.
- **Implicit prediction that Exubera-style "huge things" would continue to fail absent customer adoption:** Consistent with later outcomes—Exubera was not resurrected, and subsequent inhaled insulins (e.g., Afrezza) struggled commercially due to device usability and physician/patient acceptance challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This is a sharp, well-observed case study of a high-profile, billion-dollar asset collapse that later culminated in definitive clinical failure. It also captures a persistent strategic pathology in big pharma: the momentum-driven mega-deal that ends in write-downs. The broader HDL-revival hypothesis would fail across the industry, making this a durable lesson in therapeutic hype versus clinical reality.
