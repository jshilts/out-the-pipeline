# C-Nucleosides Never Went Away (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 commentary reflects on the cyclical nature of medicinal chemistry research trends, using C-nucleosides as a case study. The author notes that C-nucleosides were heavily researched from the mid-1970s through the 1980s, then saw reduced interest, but biology doesn't care about research fashions—active compounds remain active regardless of trends. The article cites a Journal of Medicinal Chemistry paper calling for renewed interest in C-nucleosides.

The author draws parallels to other boom-and-bust cycles in drug discovery: the kinase inhibitor boom of the 1990s-2000s, extensive peptidomimetic research in the 1980s targeting enzymes like elastase and renin, and earlier waves like antifolates and tricyclic CNS agents. The central argument is that research areas become "mined out"—not because the biology stops being relevant—but because easier compounds get made, good targets get worked over, and patent space becomes cluttered, leading researchers to chase new trends.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2015, the prediction of renewed C-nucleoside interest proved prescient, particularly driven by antiviral applications:

**Remdesivir (Veklury)**: In 2020, this C-nucleoside prodrug became the first FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19. Developed by Gilead Sciences, remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral originally investigated for Ebola and emerging viruses. While controversial in its COVID-19 efficacy, it achieved significant clinical uptake during the pandemic, demonstrating that C-nucleosides could indeed re-emerge as important therapeutics. The drug generated billions in revenue, though its usage declined as COVID-19 treatments evolved and vaccines became widespread.

**Molnupiravir**: Approved by the FDA in December 2021 for COVID-19 treatment, this is another nucleoside analog (though not strictly a C-nucleoside) that demonstrated continued pharmaceutical interest in modified nucleosides for antiviral applications. While its efficacy was modest, it represented continued investment in this chemical space.

**Continued Research**: Post-2015 publications on C-nucleosides increased, particularly in antiviral drug discovery journals, validating the article's prediction of renewed interest. The field benefited from improved synthetic methods and better understanding of nucleoside metabolism.

**Broader Context**: The article's broader theme about cyclical research trends remained relevant, with continued examples of "rediscovery" in drug development, though the specific C-nucleoside revival materialized more quickly and prominently than perhaps expected in 2015.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's implicit predictions fared well:

• **C-nucleoside revival**: The prediction that C-nucleosides would see renewed interest proved accurate—from 2015 to present, significant research investment occurred, culminating in FDA-approved drugs
• **Cyclical nature of med-chem**: The broader claim about research trends cycling continued to hold true across drug discovery
• **Biology over fashion**: The statement that "biology doesn't care about research fashions" was validated by C-nucleosides' successful return as approved therapeutics

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6/9**

The article demonstrates moderate-to-high interest value due to its prescient timing—written just before the COVID-19 pandemic would drive renewed mainstream attention to nucleoside antivirals and C-nucleoside therapeutics specifically. The broader theme about cyclical research patterns remains relevant to drug discovery strategy discussions, though the specific C-nucleoside content became more historically significant than readers in 2015 likely anticipated.
