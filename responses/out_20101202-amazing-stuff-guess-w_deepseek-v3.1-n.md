# Amazing Stuff! Guess Where It's From. . . (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's blog post presents pseudoscientific claims found on a supplement seller's website, framed as a "guess the author" game. The quotes assert that animal cells become cancerous by evolving into plant-like cells in acidic environments, and that cancer can be prevented or treated by maintaining body alkalinity. Further claims describe "alkaline water" with smaller water molecule "microclusters" (6 vs. 12 molecules) that allegedly enhance permeability, solubility, and detoxification. The post initially withholds the source, inviting readers to recognize the absurdity of these claims—particularly the notion of enhancing "the solubility of water" itself. Lowe planned to reveal the author in a follow-up post.

## 2. HISTORY

The article targets Dr. Robert O. Young, who promoted the "pH Miracle" alkaline diet and sold water alkalinization devices. Young claimed acidity causes disease and that "alkalizing" the body can prevent or treat cancer.

In 2016, Young was convicted by a California state court on two counts of practicing medicine without a license. The case centered on his treatment of terminally ill cancer patients with intravenous baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), with prosecutors presenting evidence linking his treatments to patient deaths. He was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison. Notably, Young had previously served prison time for a similar practicing-without-a-license charge in Utah in 1996.

About a decade after the Science post (July 2021), Young was ordered by a San Diego jury to pay $105 million in damages to a breast cancer patient he had treated with his alkaline protocol. The plaintiff had forgone standard oncology care for Young's regimen and subsequently saw her cancer metastasize. In settlements with additional plaintiffs, the total civil damages exceeded $136 million.

These legal consequences highlight the real-world harm of pseudoscientific claims and reflect broader regulatory and public health pressures against unsubstantiated cancer treatments. There remains no credible evidence that dietary or water "alkalinity" changes blood pH enough to affect cancer. Young's prosecution and civil penalties stand as factual endpoints to the claims being lampooned in the original post.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No concrete predictions were made in the original article. The tone was critical and cautionary rather than predictive, except perhaps an implicit anticipation that the source would eventually face serious consequences for fraudulent health claims. Given that the target—Robert O. Young—eventually faced criminal conviction and over $136 million in civil damages for harming patients, the implicit prediction seems to have been validated.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

Reasoning: While focused on debunking a single purveyor of pseudoscience, the post serves as an early, publicly accessible documentation of claims that later became central to criminal and major civil proceedings. It highlights the broader pattern of leveraging scientific-sounding language to mislead patients and the tangible harm such promotion can cause.
