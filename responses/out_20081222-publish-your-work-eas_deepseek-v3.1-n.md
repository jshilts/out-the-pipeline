# Publish Your Work The Easy Way (December 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2008 commentary discusses the case of M. S. El Naschie, editor-in-chief of the Elsevier journal *Chaos, Solitons, and Fractals*, who had published 322 papers in his own journal since assuming the editorship, including five in the December 2008 issue alone. The article characterizes the journal as El Naschie's "private kingdom" and cites criticism that his papers constitute "undisciplined numerology larded with impressive buzzwords." Despite the $4,520 annual subscription cost, the journal appeared to function as a vanity press publishing questionable content. The piece reports that Elsevier had finally acknowledged the problem and announced that El Naschie would retire as editor-in-chief in 2009, with the publisher planning to review the journal's editorial policies and appointment arrangements.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, El Naschie did indeed step down as editor-in-chief in early 2009 as Elsevier announced. However, the controversy continued to unfold:

**Legal Action**: In subsequent years, El Naschie filed libel lawsuits against critics and bloggers who had commented on his editorial practices and the quality of his work, including legal action related to online discussions of his publication record.

**Academic Investigation**: The case became a prominent example in discussions about editorial ethics, peer review quality, and publisher accountability in academic publishing. It highlighted concerns about the bundling practices of major publishers where problematic journals could be included in subscription packages.

**Journal Reform**: *Chaos, Solitons, and Fractals* underwent substantial editorial restructuring after 2009, with new editorial boards and improved peer review processes. The journal continues to operate under Elsevier with normal publication standards.

**Elsevier's Response**: The incident prompted Elsevier to review its editorial oversight procedures and implement stronger monitoring of journals to prevent similar situations. This case was cited in broader academic publishing reform discussions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in this article. The author expressed skepticism about why the situation had continued for so long and questioned Elsevier's oversight, but did not make specific forward-looking statements about outcomes.
