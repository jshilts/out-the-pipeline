# Bayer‑Monsanto? (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Reuters‑cited commentary noted that Bayer had made an unsolicited $63 billion offer for Monsanto and speculated on whether other suitors (e.g., BASF) might appear. The author highlighted the market’s negative reaction—both Bayer and Monsanto shares fell—interpreting it as doubt about the deal’s likelihood or its price. The piece also revisited the long‑standing debate over whether Bayer should be broken up, arguing that a breakup could unlock roughly 30 % more value than the integrated firm. Finally, the author warned that advice on such mega‑mergers is often biased because banks and lawyers profit from deal‑making, leaving shareholders and employees to bear the risk if the price is deemed too high.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Deal completion (June 2018).** Bayer’s $63 billion cash‑and‑stock offer was approved by shareholders and regulators, and the acquisition closed on 7 June 2018. Monsanto’s name was retired; its seed and trait businesses were folded into Bayer Crop Science.

**Financial strain and litigation.** The combined entity inherited Monsanto’s massive glyphosate‑related liability exposure. By 2020 Bayer had set aside more than $10 billion for lawsuits, and in 2020 it announced a $10 billion settlement fund for U.S. claims. The litigation pressure forced Bayer to cut its 2020 dividend by 95 % and to write down the value of its Crop Science division by €10 billion in 2020 and another €5 billion in 2021.

**Share‑price performance.** Bayer’s stock fell from roughly €100 in early 2016 to below €40 by the end of 2021, a loss of more than 60 % of market value, largely attributed to the Monsanto acquisition and ensuing legal costs.

**Break‑up discussion and spin‑off attempts.**  
* 2022: Bayer announced a plan to spin off its Crop Science business as a separate publicly traded company, aiming to restore investor confidence and reduce debt.  
* 2023: Instead of a pure spin‑off, Bayer agreed to sell its Crop Science division to BASF for €7.5 billion (plus a €2 billion cash payment). The transaction, pending antitrust clearance, would effectively unwind the Monsanto acquisition. As of late 2024, the deal remained under regulatory review; no final closing has been reported by early 2025.

**Strategic outcomes.** The acquisition gave Bayer a dominant position in seeds, traits, and crop protection, but the expected synergies were largely offset by litigation costs and integration challenges. Bayer’s overall diversification (pharma, consumer health, crop science) remained intact, but the company’s balance sheet was weakened, prompting a strategic pivot toward divesting non‑core assets rather than a full corporate breakup.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“If the ag‑chem division takes on something the size of Monsanto … that will make a rather large company indeed.”*  
  **Outcome:** True. Bayer became one of the world’s largest integrated agro‑chemical firms, with Crop Science revenues exceeding €20 billion in 2021.

- **Prediction:** *“Talk about Bayer breaking up … the parts would be worth about 30 % more than the whole if they were just broken up properly.”*  
  **Outcome:** The breakup never materialized. Bayer’s market value stayed well below the pre‑deal level, and the 30 % premium hypothesis was not realized. Instead, Bayer pursued a partial divestiture (sale to BASF) rather than a full split.

- **Prediction:** *“Shares are dropping … people think the deal isn’t going through or they’re afraid of the price.”*  
  **Outcome:** Shares did drop, but the deal ultimately closed in 2018. The price‑concern proved prescient: the high acquisition premium contributed to a prolonged share‑price decline and heavy debt load.

- **Implicit prediction:** *“Deal‑making advice is biased; banks and lawyers benefit.”*  
  **Outcome:** The transaction was advised by multiple investment banks (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, etc.) that earned sizable advisory fees. The bias noted by the author is consistent with industry practice, though it did not prevent the deal from proceeding.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in the agro‑chemical sector; the subsequent fallout—massive litigation, a near‑collapse of Bayer’s valuation, and a pending divestiture to BASF—makes the piece historically significant, though its speculative tone limits its technical depth.
