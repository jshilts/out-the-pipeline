# Finding Placebo Responders (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The April 2015 article discusses the emerging hypothesis that there may be a genetic or neurobiological basis underlying individual differences in placebo response. The piece highlights a review in *Trends in Molecular Medicine* suggesting that variations in serotonergic and dopaminergic systems could be fundamental to why some patients show strong placebo effects while others do not. The author frames this as a potentially transformative development for clinical trials—particularly in therapeutic areas like depression where placebo responses are notoriously high and can obscure drug efficacy signals. The article also raises practical and ethical questions about how such knowledge might be applied, including whether to screen out strong placebo responders during early-phase trials or stratify patients differently across trial phases.

## 2. HISTORY

Research into the neurobiology and potential biomarkers of placebo response has continued but has not fundamentally transformed clinical trial design or medical practice in the ways the author speculated. Subsequent work has refined our understanding of placebo mechanisms but has not delivered reliable, validated genetic biomarkers that are routinely used in drug development or patient care.

Scientific developments included progress on the neurobiological mediators (e.g., endogenous opioids, dopamine, and expectations-related networks) and efforts to identify imaging-based or behavioral predictors, but clinically actionable genetic markers remain elusive. Studies have explored catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) variants, serotonin-related polymorphisms, and other candidates, but findings have generally been inconsistent or of small effect sizes, and none have been translated into regulatory-grade tools for enrollment or stratification. No FDA-approved companion diagnostics or validated genomic panels are currently used to identify placebo responders in clinical trials. Recruitment and stratification in most trials still proceed without such screens.

Some post-2015 developments did affect placebo science and trial methodology more broadly. One of the most significant shifts has been the proliferation of digital and remote clinical trials (accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic), which introduced new attention and measurement challenges related to patient adherence and reporting bias—factors that can interact with placebo effects. Advances in wearable sensors and real-world data collection raised new questions about how placebo-related phenomena manifest outside the clinic. In parallel, there was growing adoption of novel trial designs, such as sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) and platform trials, but these did not specifically hinge on placebo-predictive biomarkers. Central nervous system (CNS) trials—especially in depression and pain—continued to grapple with high and variable placebo response, but responses have been addressed via improved trial execution, centralized raters, enriched enrollment, and active run-in designs rather than genetic screening.

In terms of real-world uptake, there are no examples of approved CNS drugs that achieved approval or widespread patient use specifically because a sponsor excluded placebo responders via genetic biomarkers. Public policy has not changed in any material way to require or encourage such screening. Business models centered on placebo-predictive markers did not emerge as a significant sector, and no major diagnostic company commercialized a test for this purpose. The idea remains a topic of academic research rather than a clinical or commercial reality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions. Their outcomes are summarized here:

- **Prediction (implicit): Reliable genetic markers for placebo response would be discovered and validated.**  
  **Outcome:** The genetic component of placebo response has not been established with reproducible, large-effect biomarkers ready for clinical use. Existing studies remain small, contradictory, or confined to specific populations/contexts. This has not translated into practical tools.

- **Prediction: These markers would change how clinical trials are conducted (e.g., excluding or stratifying strong placebo responders in Phase II to clarify drug signals and returning them in Phase III for real-world conditions).**  
  **Outcome:** No such industry standard or regulatory guideline emerged. CNS trials still address high placebo response through operational and design improvements (blinding procedures, entry criteria, site training) rather than genetic stratification.

- **Prediction: Knowledge of one's placebo-responder status could alter placebo susceptibility.**  
  **Outcome:** While this remains a theoretically interesting question in placebo science, there is no empirical evidence to support routine changes in placebo responsivity following disclosure. No studies have demonstrated clinically meaningful effects or practical applications of such disclosure.

- **Prediction: Unraveling placebo mechanisms would yield high-impact insights for neuroscience.**  
  **Outcome:** Mechanistic work on placebo has advanced our understanding of expectation, conditioning, and neurochemical pathways (opioids, dopamine, etc.), but it has not produced breakthrough therapies or fundamentally reordered clinical trial paradigms. The impact has been largely academic.

- **Big-picture (implicit): CNS trials, particularly in depression, would benefit from placebo-predictive markers to improve signal detection.**  
  **Outcome:** High placebo response continues to challenge depression trials. In the ensuing years, several large-scale efforts focused on improving trial methodology without relying on genetic predictors. Successes (e.g., some approved antidepressants) did not hinge on placebo-biomarker stratification.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article raised a scientifically plausible hypothesis and articulated practical trial-design implications. However, the predicted genetic/biomarker revolution did not materialize, and its direct impact was limited. The subject remains of moderate interest within neuroscience and trial methodology but falls well short of transformative importance.
