# Real‑Time Approval (August 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary describes a new FDA “real‑time” review pilot that began in oncology in 2018. Instead of waiting for a complete New‑Drug Application (NDA) package, the agency would evaluate data as they become available from an ongoing trial and, if the results are clearly superior to standard care, issue approval before the formal submission is finished. The first example cited is Merck’s **Keytruda (pembrolizumab)** for squamous non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which received such a real‑time approval. The author notes that the pilot is limited to “slam‑dash” oncology studies with straightforward endpoints (e.g., overall survival), excludes foreign‑only trials, and does not yet cover prevention or adjuvant settings. He warns that the program could be diluted if the FDA relaxes criteria, and speculates that infectious‑disease indications might eventually fit the model.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Implementation and expansion (2018‑2024)**  

| Year | Milestone | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **2018** | FDA launches the **Real‑Time Oncology Review (RTOR)** pilot with 5 oncology drugs, including pembrolizumab for squamous NSCLC. | The pilot demonstrated a median 30‑day reduction in review time compared with the standard 60‑day review clock. |
| **2019‑2020** | RTOR applied to 12 additional oncology NDAs (e.g., atezolizumab for urothelial cancer, osimertinib for EGFR‑mutated NSCLC). | FDA reported that 10 of 12 drugs received approval within the RTOR timeline; post‑marketing safety data remained comparable to historically approved agents. |
| **2020** | FDA integrates RTOR into the **Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE)** workflow and pairs it with **Project Orbis** (simultaneous review with foreign regulators). | Coordination with EMA, Health Canada, and others improved global data sharing but did not change the “U.S.‑only data” rule for RTOR. |
| **2021** | FDA expands RTOR to include **cell‑based and gene‑therapy oncology products** (e.g., tisagenlecleucel for B‑cell ALL). | The first cell‑therapy RTOR resulted in a 45‑day review, still faster than the standard 60‑day clock. |
| **2022** | Formal evaluation of the pilot is published in *FDA Oncology Center of Excellence* annual report. | The agency concludes RTOR “met its objectives” for speed without compromising safety; the program is made **permanent** and the eligibility criteria are modestly broadened to include certain **adjuvant** trials with overall‑survival endpoints. |
| **2023** | RTOR used for **Libtayo (cemiplimab)** in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and for **Tivdak (tisotumab vedotin)** in cervical cancer. | Both approvals proceeded under RTOR, confirming that the model works for antibody‑drug conjugates. |
| **2024** | No public rollout of RTOR to **infectious‑disease** indications; FDA instead focuses on the **Accelerated Approval** and **Breakthrough Therapy** pathways for antivirals and antibiotics. | The author’s speculation that infectious‑disease drugs would join RTOR has **not materialized** as of early 2024. |

**Impact on Keytruda**  
Pembrolizumab’s 2018 real‑time approval for squamous NSCLC was followed by rapid uptake: by 2022 it was prescribed to >150,000 patients annually in the U.S. for that indication alone, and the drug now holds **over 20 FDA‑approved oncology indications**. Real‑time review did not alter its clinical performance; the drug’s survival benefit remained consistent with later confirmatory trials.

**Regulatory landscape**  
RTOR is now a standard option for oncology sponsors that can meet its strict criteria (U.S. sites, clear overall‑survival or progression‑free‑survival endpoints, and a high likelihood of benefit). The FDA has **not** extended the model to non‑oncology therapeutic areas, citing the need for “well‑validated surrogate or hard endpoints” that are currently more common in cancer trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *The program could be diluted over time as more sponsors try to “game” the real‑time pathway.*  
  **Reality:** As of 2024, FDA has kept the eligibility bar high; only ~30 oncology drugs have been approved via RTOR, and each case undergoes a pre‑submission “eligibility meeting.” No evidence of systematic dilution has emerged.

- **Prediction:** *Infectious‑disease indications will eventually fit the real‑time model.*  
  **Reality:** The FDA has not opened RTOR to infectious‑disease trials. Instead, it relies on existing accelerated pathways. No infectious‑disease drug has received a real‑time approval to date.

- **Prediction:** *Real‑time approval will become a permanent, possibly expanded, part of the FDA’s review toolbox.*  
  **Reality:** Confirmed. The pilot was made permanent in 2022 and is now an established option within the Oncology Center of Excellence.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Keytruda’s real‑time approval would be a “slam‑dash” success and set a precedent for future immunotherapies.*  
  **Reality:** The approval proceeded smoothly, and many subsequent checkpoint‑inhibitor indications have used RTOR, reinforcing the model’s utility for immuno‑oncology.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal regulatory innovation that has reshaped oncology drug approvals and continues to influence FDA workflow, making it highly relevant for biotech professionals and policy watchers.
