# Bad Interviews (29 Nov 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses problematic interviewing techniques encountered in the pharmaceutical industry. Written during a period when the author and colleagues were job searching, the piece identifies several "warning sign" interview approaches. These include: (1) excessive blackboard mechanism problems that don't reflect actual medicinal chemistry work, (2) irrelevant HR questions like "If you were a tree, what kind would you be?", and (3) over-reliance on "Behavioral Event Interviewing" that encourages exaggerated storytelling. The article also warns against accepting positions at companies that demonstrate disrespectful behavior during interviews, sharing an anecdote about a Saturday morning interview where lab heads ate breakfast in front of a candidate.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical industry landscape has evolved significantly since 2006, with major implications for hiring practices. The period following this article saw substantial industry consolidation (e.g., Pfizer's acquisition of Wyeth in 2009, Merck's acquisition of Schering-Plough in 2009, Roche's acquisition of Genentech in 2009). This consolidation trend, combined with R&D productivity challenges and patent cliffs, led to significant job cuts across the industry. Thousands of pharmaceutical scientists faced layoffs, increasing competition for positions and potentially intensifying pressure during interviews.

The Great Recession (2007-2009) further tightened job markets, possibly shifting power dynamics toward employers. In the biotech sector, the rise of smaller, specialized companies created different interview cultures, often more informal than large pharma. However, concerns about interviewing best practices persisted, with Derek Lowe continuing to discuss workplace and hiring issues on his blog, which moved to Science Translational Medicine in 2010.

The specific interviewing techniques critiqued in this article became part of broader discussions about hiring reform. The blackboard mechanism problems reflect concerns about academic-style testing versus practical job requirements, while the "tree question" became emblematic of ineffective HR practices. Companies increasingly adopted structured interviewing and competency-based approaches, though debate continues about optimal methods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions and concerns in this article:**

• **Medicinal chemistry jobs would increasingly require practical skills over theoretical mechanism knowledge**: The field has evolved with more emphasis on drug design, computational approaches, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Mechanism knowledge remains important but practical drug discovery skills are prioritized.

• **Interview quality would impact company success**: Companies with poor hiring practices (disrespectful behavior, irrelevant questions) would struggle to attract talent. The intense competition for qualified pharmaceutical scientists in subsequent years made employer branding increasingly important.

• **Behavioral interviewing might incentivize dishonesty**: This concern resonated with broader discussions about interview coaching and preparation industries that grew significantly post-2006. The tension between authentic assessment and performative interview behavior remains unresolved.

• **Industry job insecurity would continue**: Written during layoff periods, the article's premise about scrambling for positions foreshadowed ongoing volatility. Pharmaceutical industry employment saw waves of layoffs through the 2010s, particularly in traditional R&D.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses perennial workplace concerns with some wit, but focuses on situation-specific interviewing gripes rather than substantive biotech industry developments, making it more of an industry commentary than a analysis of scientific or business evolution.
