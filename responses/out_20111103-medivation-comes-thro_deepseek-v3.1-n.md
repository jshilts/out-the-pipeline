# Medivation Comes Through With MDV3100 (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Medivation's successful Phase III trial results for MDV3100 (later named enzalutamide), a novel androgen receptor ligand for treating prostate cancer. The piece provides background on Medivation's previous failure with an Alzheimer's drug (Dimebon) and describes how MDV3100 emerged from academic collaboration between Michael Jung's group at UCLA and Charles Sawyers' team at Sloan-Kettering. The compound was notable for its unusual thiohydantoin structure and unique mechanism of binding to the androgen receptor, preventing DNA binding in the nucleus, a different mode of action compared to other AR ligands. The Phase III trial showed such compelling efficacy that it was stopped early, with placebo patients switched to the active drug. The article highlights this as a rare success story in drug discovery, especially coming from academic origins.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2011 Phase III success, MDV3100 (enzalutamide, brand name Xtandi) received FDA approval in August 2012 for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that had previously failed chemotherapy. The drug demonstrated significant survival benefits, extending median overall survival by approximately 4.8 months compared to placebo. The approval marked a major turnaround for Medivation, which had faced skepticism after its high-profile Alzheimer's drug failure.

Xtandi became a commercial blockbuster, generating over \$1 billion in annual sales by 2015. The drug's success led to expanded approvals, including for chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in 2014, and eventual label expansions to earlier disease stages. The mechanism proved impactful - enzalutamide's ability to overcome resistance mechanisms in androgen receptor signaling represented a real clinical advance, and it became a standard treatment option in prostate cancer management protocols.

Medivation's stock indeed recovered dramatically from its post-Dimebon lows, validating the article's speculation about investor prospects. The company's success attracted acquisition interest, leading to Pfizer pursuing Medivation in 2016. However, Medivation was ultimately acquired by Pfizer in September 2016 for approximately \$14 billion, making it one of the larger biotech acquisitions that year. The Jung-Sawyers collaboration stands as a successful example of academic drug discovery translating to clinical and commercial success.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Stock recovery prediction**: The article suggested Medivation's stock might recover past previous levels when the company was hyped for its (ultimately failed) Alzheimer's drug. ✓ **This proved accurate** - Xtandi's success drove substantial stock appreciation, and the company's ultimate \$14 billion acquisition value far exceeded earlier market capitalizations.

• **Enhanced standard of care**: The article predicted MDV3100 would "considerably advance the standard of care in prostate cancer." ✓ **This prediction was correct** - enzalutamide became a standard treatment option incorporated into major clinical guidelines for castration-resistant prostate cancer.

• **Trial success translation to real-world impact**: The article's optimism about the compound's Phase III performance translating to clinical benefit was ✓ **substantiated** by later FDA approval, commercial success, and continued label expansions demonstrating real-world patient benefit.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

The article covers a genuinely important clinical development that proved transformative for prostate cancer treatment and became a multi-billion dollar therapy, but the writing primarily focuses on immediate trial results rather than broader scientific or policy implications.
