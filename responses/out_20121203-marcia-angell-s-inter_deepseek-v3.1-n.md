# Marcia Angell's Interview: I Just Can't (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a blog post by Derek Lowe responding to a podcast interview with Marcia Angell on drug company research and innovation. Lowe expresses extreme frustration with Angell's claims, particularly her assertion that pharmaceutical companies don't do much innovation because most R&D budgets are spent on clinical trials, which she characterizes as something "everyone knows how to do." 

The post argues that Angell fundamentally misunderstands drug development by overemphasizing the importance of identifying drug targets while underestimating the difficulty and cost of everything that follows. Lowe contends that Angell's worldview—that innovation decline in the industry is a choice rather than a reflection of genuine scientific challenges—ignores the "disastrously expensive failures" companies face when expanding into new diseases and targets. The author references Alex Tabarrok's critique of Angell's views on marketing costs and drug development economics, positioning himself as aligned with Tabarrok's more industry-sympathetic perspective.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2012 exchange, the pharmaceutical industry landscape evolved in ways that both support and challenge elements of both perspectives:

**Research Productivity & Costs**: Between 2012-2022, drug development costs continued rising, with estimates of bringing a new drug to market reaching $2-3 billion when accounting for failures. The industry maintained high R&D spending despite Angell's skepticism about its innovative value—global pharmaceutical R&D expenditure grew from ~$137 billion in 2012 to over $200 billion by 2022.

**Clinical Trial Complexity**: Contrary to Angell's claim that "everyone knows how to do a clinical trial," trial complexity increased dramatically post-2012. Adaptive trial designs, biomarker-driven patient selection, and real-world evidence integration became standard, requiring specialized expertise. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022) particularly demonstrated that rapid, high-quality clinical trials require substantial innovation and resources.

**R&D Productivity**: FDA drug approvals showed mixed trends. While new drug approvals peaked in 2018 (59 approvals) and remained relatively high through the early 2020s, breakthrough therapies remained concentrated in oncology and rare diseases. Alzheimer's disease research—specifically mentioned by Lowe as an area of "disastrously expensive failures"—continued seeing major trial failures (including multiple Phase 3 disappointments through 2019-2022), supporting Lowe's argument about genuine scientific difficulty.

**Innovation Patterns**: The decade saw genuine therapeutic innovations, including CAR-T cell therapies (first approved 2017), gene therapies (Luxturna 2017, Zolgensma 2019), and mRNA vaccines (COVID-19, 2020-2021). However, many high-profile "innovative" drugs were incremental modifications or "me-too" drugs, partially validating Angell's skepticism about breakthrough innovation.

**Policy and Pricing Debates**: Drug pricing controversies intensified after 2012, culminating in the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) giving Medicare drug price negotiation authority—a policy direction consistent with Angell's broader critiques of pharmaceutical industry practices, though not specifically addressing her R&D innovation claims.

**Industry Response**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly emphasized external innovation (licensing, acquisitions) over internal R&D, with biotech partnerships becoming central to pipelines—perhaps validating some of Angell's concerns about internal innovation capacity while contradicting her dismissal of clinical development complexity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no explicit forward-looking predictions. It primarily critiques existing viewpoints rather than forecasting future developments. Lowe's position implies that:

- **Implicit assumption**: Drug development would remain difficult and expensive due to genuine scientific challenges (partially validated by continued high costs and clinical failures through 2022)
- **Implicit assumption**: Industry critics underestimating clinical development complexity would continue being wrong (mixed validation—clinical trials indeed became more complex, but criticisms of industry innovation patterns gained policy traction)

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4/9**

This scores in the 40-49th percentile of interest. The debate captures an important ongoing policy discussion about pharmaceutical innovation and costs, but the specific exchange represents one iteration of a recurring argument that both sides largely repeated without resolution in subsequent years.
