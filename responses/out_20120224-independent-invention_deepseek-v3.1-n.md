# Independent Inventions (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Alex Tabarrok's proposal to allow "independent invention" as a legal defense against patent infringement claims. The core issue is that under current patent law, if two inventors independently develop the same invention, the first to patent can prevent the second from using or selling their own creation, even without any copying or theft involved.

The article highlights that independent invention is actually quite common historically, citing examples like Newton and Leibniz with calculus, multiple inventors of the telephone (Bell, Gray, Reis), and jet engine pioneers (Ohain, Campini, Whittle). The author expresses agreement with Tabarrok's proposal in principle but worries about potential legal abuse and system-gaming. For biotechnology specifically, the author notes that drug discovery already involves careful legal differentiation of molecules from competitors, but recalls a personal experience where their research group and a competitor independently developed the same compound series, filing patent applications within weeks of each other with significant overlap.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2012 article, the independent invention defense proposal did not gain significant legislative traction in the United States. The America Invents Act of 2011, which went into effect in March 2013, maintained the U.S. shift to a "first-inventor-to-file" system but did not establish independent invention as a formal defense against patent infringement.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries continued operating under the existing patent framework, where simultaneous independent invention remains unprotected. The FTC and DOJ conducted hearings on patent assertion entities and patent litigation abuse between 2013-2016, but reforms focused more on litigation procedures rather than substantive patent rights like independent invention defenses.

Some legal scholars continued advocating for independent invention reforms through academic publications, but no major jurisdiction adopted such changes. The biotechnology sector, as the author predicted, continued its practice of carefully differentiating compounds and building patent portfolios as primary competitive strategies.

The fundamental tension identified in the article—that parallel research is common but legally unprotected—remained unresolved through subsequent policy changes up to present day.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself did not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes, focusing instead on discussing a proposed policy change and its potential implications for the biotechnology industry. The main implied expectation was that some reform movement might emerge around independent invention rights, but this did not materialize as hoped by reform advocates.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article addresses important issues of patent law that directly affect scientific innovation and biotech research. While the policy proposal discussed did not ultimately lead to reforms, the underlying problem of parallel invention remains relevant, particularly in fields with high R&D investment and competitive research timelines.
