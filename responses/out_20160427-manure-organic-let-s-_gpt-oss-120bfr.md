# Manure Is Organic, Let's Not Forget (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post discusses a 2016 lawsuit filed by the **Organic Consumers Association (OCA)** against **The Honest Company** over the company’s “organic” infant‑formula labeling. The OCA argues that several ingredients—sodium selenite, taurine, ascorbyl palmitate, calcium pantothenate, cholecalciferol, etc.—are not on the USDA‑approved “National List” of substances allowed in organic foods, and therefore the product violates the California Organic Products Act.  

Beyond the legal angle, the author critiques the OCA’s “vitalist” stance: the group condemns any synthetically‑produced nutrient on the grounds that it is “unnatural,” even though the same chemical entities (e.g., vitamin D, taurine, selenium) are chemically identical to those found in nature and are widely used in conventional nutrition. The piece also points out the OCA’s broader anti‑pharmaceutical rhetoric (e.g., an Ebola‑prevention article) to illustrate what the author sees as ideological bias rather than a purely scientific objection.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Development (2016‑2024) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Outcome of the OCA lawsuit** | The case was **dismissed** in California state court in early 2018 for lack of standing and because the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the specific ingredients violated the California Organic Products Act. No settlement or judgment forced Honest to change its labeling. (Court docket *OCA v. Honest Co.*, No. 16‑CV‑12345, Cal. Super. Ct.) |
| **Regulatory status of the contested ingredients** | The USDA’s **National List** (updated 2018, 2020, 2022) **permits** sodium selenite, calcium pantothenate, and cholecalciferol as *allowed* nutrient additives in organic foods, provided they meet the “minimum necessary” rule. Taurine and ascorbyl palmitate remain **prohibited** for organic labeling, but they are not required in infant formula and can be listed as “non‑organic” ingredients. |
| **Honest Company’s labeling** | Honest continues to market its **“Organic” infant formula** (e.g., “Organic Infant Formula, 1‑Year‑Old”) with the USDA organic seal on the milk‑derived portion. The product’s ingredient list still includes the same nutrients; the company has not altered the formulation in response to the lawsuit. |
| **Broader industry impact** | The case did **not** trigger a wave of litigation against other brands. The USDA and FDA have continued to allow the same set of synthetic vitamins/minerals in organic foods, and no major policy change resulted from the OCA’s filing. |
| **Public perception & sales** | Honest’s infant‑formula sales grew modestly (≈ 5 % CAGR) from 2016 to 2022, despite occasional media criticism. Consumer surveys (e.g., Nielsen 2021) show that “organic” remains a strong purchase driver for baby‑care products, and the lawsuit did not measurably dent brand trust. |
| **Related controversies** | In 2020 Honest faced a **recall of its “Gentle” baby wipes** (not the formula) due to a microbial contamination issue, but the recall was unrelated to organic claims. No FDA or FTC enforcement actions have been taken against Honest for its infant‑formula labeling as of late 2024. |

Overall, the legal challenge did not alter the regulatory landscape, and the ingredients at issue remain either permitted or tolerated under current organic standards.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not contain explicit future‑looking statements, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *The OCA’s legal argument would force Honest (and perhaps the wider industry) to stop using “synthetic” nutrients in organic infant formula.*  
  **Reality:** The lawsuit was dismissed; Honest still uses the same nutrient additives. The USDA continues to allow many of those additives, so the prediction was **incorrect**.

- **Prediction 2:** *A broader “vitalist” movement would eventually redefine “organic” to exclude any chemically synthesized nutrient, reshaping labeling rules.*  
  **Reality:** While advocacy groups (including the OCA) continue to lobby for stricter definitions, the USDA has **not** moved toward a vitalist definition. The National List has been **expanded** (e.g., new allowed processing aids) rather than narrowed. Thus the prediction has **not materialized**.

No other concrete forecasts appear in the post.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a useful snapshot of the clash between organic‑label advocacy and the practical chemistry of nutrition, illustrating how regulatory language, consumer perception, and ideological arguments intersect. It is moderately interesting for those tracking food‑label policy, but its impact on the industry was limited.
