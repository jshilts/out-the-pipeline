# The X-Ray Future, And Others (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article reflects on the evolution of X-ray crystallography over time, noting that as the technology improved (better X-ray sources, detectors, and computational methods), what was once Nobel Prize-worthy work became routine. The author points out that this pattern—heroic effort becoming automated and commoditized—applies across many scientific fields, including DNA sequencing and organic synthesis. The harder experimental challenges—bigger molecules, smaller samples, and faster collection times—remain the new frontier, and the author raises the concern that practitioners must adapt as their specialized skills become automated.

## 2. HISTORY
Several concrete developments have occurred since 2016 that align with these trends:

- **Structural biology automation**: X-ray crystallography workflows are widely automated; small-molecule single-crystal diffraction is now a standard service at core facilities, routinely delivering structures in days or hours, and many industrial and academic labs treat it as a walk-up technique. 
- **Cryo-EM displacement**: While X-rays remain essential for routine small molecules and many proteins, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become the dominant method for very large complexes and membrane proteins in many labs, often providing near-atomic resolution without crystallization. This partly fulfills the essay's prediction of moving to "bigger molecules," just via a different diffraction modality.
- **XFELs and time-resolved work**: X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities have enabled serial femtosecond crystallography on smaller samples with shorter collection times, yielding molecular movies on femtosecond-to-picosecond scales. However, this remains elite, facility-driven science rather than routine lab practice.
- **Automated synthesis progress**: Fully automated synthesis devices for peptides and oligonucleotides are commercially mature, and systems for small-molecule synthesis have advanced (e.g., closed-loop robotic platforms and integrated flow-chemistry workstations), though general, end-to-end automation for arbitrary organic molecules is not yet widespread.
- **Consolidation and service models**: Structural determination has moved toward core facilities and CROs; fewer academic labs maintain dedicated crystallography operations for routine problems, freeing specialists to focus on difficult samples and methods development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Crystallography becoming "turn a couple of knobs" routine**: Confirmed. High-throughput X-ray facilities, robotic sample handling, and automated processing pipelines are standard, and small-molecule structures are often obtained with minimal manual intervention.
- **Harder problems: bigger molecules, smaller samples, shorter times**: Partially confirmed. Cryo-EM now dominates the "bigger molecules" space for many applications. Smaller samples and faster times (fs–ps) are demonstrated at XFELs but remain specialized.
- **X-ray wonder machine doing atomic-resolution, in situ, femtosecond studies**: Overly optimistic timeline and modality. In situ structural biology (inside cells or tissues) at high resolution is nascent and not routine; femtosecond studies are performed at XFELs but mostly on purified systems. "Atomic-level resolution of huge protein complexes, in situ, on a femtosecond time scale" as a single, integrated capability has not materialized.
- **Automated synthesis "freeing the rest of us up"**: Partially confirmed. Automation is mature for specific domains (peptides, oligos, some flow chemistry), while general small-molecule automation is progressing but not yet displacing synthesis chemists at scale. The prediction overestimated the pace of general automation.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: 7/10
This article captures a durable pattern of technological commoditization in science, and its core thesis remains relevant. Some of its specific extrapolations were too optimistic, and it did not anticipate cryo-EM's rise as the primary rival for large-complex structural biology.
