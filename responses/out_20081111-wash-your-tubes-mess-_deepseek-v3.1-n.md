# Wash Your Tubes; Mess Up Your Data (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article describes a contamination problem in laboratory plasticware that was disrupting biochemical assays. Researchers discovered that disposable lab plastics (pipette tips, assay plates, Eppendorf vials) were leaching two problematic compounds: oleamide (used as a slip agent to prevent plastic components from sticking) and DiHEMDA (an ammonium salt biocide). Both compounds turned out to be monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors. The contamination was particularly problematic when organic solvents like DMSO or methanol were used, which extracted more contaminants from the plastic. The effect wasn't limited to MAO-B assays - the authors also observed interference with GABA-A receptor binding assays. The article recommends running blank controls but notes this remains a persistent challenge for assay development and validation.

## 2. HISTORY
This 2008 article highlighted a genuine and ongoing problem in drug discovery. In the years following publication, the issue of laboratory contamination from plasticware became more widely recognized and systematically addressed:

**Industry Response:** Major laboratory plasticware manufacturers began developing "low-binding" or "ultra-clean" plastic products specifically marketed for sensitive biochemical assays. Companies like Eppendorf, Corning, and Greiner Bio-One introduced product lines with reduced levels of extractable compounds.

**Scientific Impact:** Research continued to document contamination issues across various assay formats. Studies in the 2010s expanded the list of problematic leachables to include antioxidants like BHT, UV stabilizers, and other polymer additives. The problem became particularly acute as assays moved to lower volumes (nanoliter scale) and higher sensitivity detection methods.

**Best Practices Evolution:** The recommendation to run blank controls became standard practice in assay development and validation. Quality control guidelines from organizations like the FDA for bioanalytical method validation now typically include requirements for investigating matrix effects and potential interferences from labware.

**Clinical Translation Impact:** While not directly affecting FDA drug approvals, this recognition led to improved assay reliability in preclinical drug discovery, potentially reducing false leads and assay artifacts that could have sent drug discovery programs down unproductive paths.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions about how this problem would evolve:

• **Prediction:** That the problem would worsen as assays moved to smaller volumes and more complex protocols.  
**Outcome:** This proved accurate. The trend toward miniaturization and high-throughput screening in the 2010s indeed amplified the impact of leachable compounds, leading to greater industry awareness and specialized product development.

• **Prediction:** That oleamide and biocides would be a bigger problem for lab assays than for human health due to metabolism and the body's natural detoxification systems.  
**Outcome:** This appears correct. There's no evidence that these particular plastic leachables became major human health concerns in the way that bisphenol A did. The laboratory assay interference remained the primary documented problem.

• **Prediction:** That the contamination issue would affect error bars and assay precision across the board.  
**Outcome:** Confirmed. The problem became recognized as contributing to inter-laboratory variability and assay reproducibility challenges, contributing to what was later termed the "reproducibility crisis" in biomedical research.

• **Prediction:** That people should run blank controls but that this wouldn't entirely solve the problem for many experiments.  
**Outcome:** Also accurate. Blank controls became standard practice, but contamination from labware remains an ongoing challenge that requires multiple mitigation strategies (specialized plastics, glass inserts, extensive washing protocols).

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article addresses a practical, underappreciated problem that affects assay reliability across drug discovery. While not groundbreaking science, it highlights a persistent technical challenge that has grown in importance with assay miniaturization and continues to impact research reproducibility in meaningful ways.
