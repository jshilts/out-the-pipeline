# Breaking the Contract of Aging (January 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe reviews a 2007 Nature paper from the Hutchinson Center screening 88,000 compounds in C. elegans for lifespan extension. The screen identified 115 compounds that increased worm lifespan by 30-60%, with 5-HT2 antagonists (including mianserin) emerging as the most promising. The proposed mechanism ties these compounds to caloric restriction pathways, as they activate metabolic signals suggesting food shortage without actual restriction. The article contextualizes this within broader aging research, noting metabolic-aging connections and the evolutionary trade-offs between reproductive fitness and longevity. Lowe references Sirtris and Elixir as smaller companies pursuing lifespan extension, contrasts with large pharma's absence, and discusses Aubrey de Grey's controversial prominence. The article concludes by suggesting aging interventions could represent a major inflection point in human history while acknowledging cancer risks and other potential trade-offs.

## 2. HISTORY

*   **High-throughput screens for longevity compounds continued and expanded**: The 2007 Hutchinson Center paper was indeed a landmark in magnitude for its time, and set the stage for an era of increasingly large-scale screens. Subsequent work in C. elegans, Drosophila, and yeast extensively mapped genetic and chemical influences on aging, firming up the connections between nutrient sensing pathways (e.g., insulin/IGF-1, mTOR, AMPK) and lifespan. The approach became a mainstay of academic aging research, though translating hits to mammals remained a persistent bottleneck.
*   **Sirtris Pharmaceuticals was acquired, and its pipeline ultimately failed**: In 2008, GlaxoSmithKline acquired Sirtris for $720 million, a major event that appeared to validate the commercial potential of sirtuin activators for aging-related diseases. However, over the subsequent decade, Sirtris's lead molecule resveratrol and synthetic analogs (like SRT501) failed in clinical trials for Type 2 diabetes and other conditions, showing lack of efficacy or poor bioavailability and toxicity. This acquisition and public enthusiasm substantially outpaced scientific validation. By the mid-2010s, skepticism about the specific Sirtris approach grew as replication issues and alternative explanations emerged for initial results. GSK eventually curtailed most of the original Sirtris programs.
*   **Metformin's enduring relevance and ongoing trials**: Metformin, an AMPK activator, remained a workhorse in diabetes and a plausible anti-aging candidate due to epidemiological associations with health in aging populations and its established safety. The TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial was proposed and pursued as a pragmatic test of an anti-aging drug, designed to ask whether metformin can delay age-related diseases. While facing funding and design challenges, it became a focal point of discussion and helped legitimize "aging" as a targetable condition. However, definitive broad anti-aging benefit in healthy populations remains unproven, and newer drugs like rapamycin analogs have gained comparative traction.
*   **Rapamycin and mTOR inhibition became a dominant paradigm**: Beyond sirtuins, mTOR inhibition (with rapamycin/sirolimus and rapalogs) emerged as a potent and reproducible method to extend lifespan in mammals. Studies demonstrated robust lifespan extension in mice, engendering considerable research interest in rapamycin for healthspan. Clinical trials proceeded cautiously due to rapamycin's established use as an immunosuppressant. mTOR remains a core target within aging biology research, with the balance of efficacy-to-side-effects as a central challenge.
*   **Caloric restriction mimetics gained ground as a field**: The "caloric restriction story" mentioned in the article became a durable and central concept. Research on sirtuins, mTOR, AMPK, and other pathways (such as ketogenesis) advanced the idea of pharmacologically mimicking the benefits of caloric restriction. Several academic and industry efforts focused on identifying orally available, safer CR mimetics. While successes were modest compared to the profound effects of actual caloric restriction, this class of interventions remained a major focus of anti-aging research.
*   **Senolytics and cellular senescence shifted focus**: In the 2010s, research on senolytics—drugs that clear senescent cells—provided a distinct and promising alternative mechanism for extending healthspan. Early work in mice demonstrated that removing senescent cells could delay age-related conditions. Companies like Unity Biotechnology were founded to translate senolytics into therapies, although initial human trials showed mixed results. The conceptual focus on senolytics reflected maturation of the field toward addressing specific mechanisms of aging rather than solely metabolic manipulations.
*   **Limited approved anti-aging drugs in patients**: To date, no drug is FDA-approved specifically for anti-aging or lifespan extension in healthy people. While metformin and rapamycin have FDA approval for other indications, their use for broad anti-aging remains off-label and investigational. Public uptake for preventive anti-aging pharmacology is therefore negligible compared to standard-of-care for age-related diseases.
*   **Elixir Pharmaceuticals faded from prominence**: Elixir, mentioned positively in the article, did not become a major success; it appears to have been merged or rebranded over time without delivering breakthrough anti-aging therapies to market.
*   **Aubrey de Grey and SENS remained marginal to mainstream science**: While de Grey maintained a public profile, his SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) framework remained at the periphery of mainstream biogerontology. Most grant funding and drug development continued to focus on specific diseases of aging and established pathways, rather than comprehensive repair-based strategies.
*   **Industry engagement evolved slowly**: After the Sirtris acquisition, large pharma generally remained cautious about direct anti-aging programs, preferring to pursue specific age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis). Venture funding and smaller biotechs continued to drive most anti-aging innovation, while Big Pharma often engaged through partnerships or acquisitions.
*   **Policy and funding shifted incrementally**: The NIH and other funders did not broadly redefine aging as a disease, but certain initiatives (e.g., cognitive aging, frailty) and targeted funding calls acknowledged aging biology as central to public health. Regulatory pathways remained challenging, though the TAME trial design illustrated efforts to create frameworks for anti-aging clinical endpoints.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

*   **Prediction: "This stuff could work, eventually, and if it does, it'll be one of the biggest inflection points in the history of the species."**
    *   **Outcome**: As of now, lifespan or healthspan extension pharmacology has not delivered a practical, broadly adopted inflection. While the underlying metabolic pathways remain scientifically compelling, progression from screens in worms to robust, clinically effective human anti-aging drugs has proven extremely difficult. Some pathways (notably mTOR) appear effective in mammals, but clinical near-term impact is still modest. The "inflection point" remains speculative, not a present reality.
*   **Prediction: Large drug companies "seem to be staying away... content to let the smaller ones... take on the (considerable) risks."**
    *   **Outcome**: This pattern largely held. GSK's acquisition of Sirtris was a notable entry, but it ended in failure that probably reinforced caution. Most large pharma continued to focus on specific diseases rather than holistic anti-aging programs, with smaller biotechs and venture-funded startups driving innovation. The risks of longevity trials (long durations, unclear endpoints, safety concerns) remained substantial deterrents for large-scale corporate commitment.
*   **Prediction: 5-HT2 antagonists might extend lifespan, possibly tied to caloric restriction ("fake caloric restriction").**
    *   **Outcome**: The exact class of 5-HT2 antagonists highlighted in the 2007 paper (like mianserin) did not become a major anti-aging pillar. However, the broader concept of caloric restriction mimetics became foundational in aging research (e.g., mTOR inhibitors, AMPK activators, sirtuin-focused work). Several drug classes have aimed for CR-like effects, often through different molecular targets.
*   **Prediction: Potential catches to extending lifespan, such as "susceptibility to cancer and other diseases."**
    *   **Outcome**: Biological trade-offs and risks remain central concerns, but have not clearly materialized to block all progress. Cancer risk is a known side effect of some proposed anti-aging pathways (e.g., IGF-1 and insulin signaling), but in other cases (mTOR inhibition) may provide benefit or offer a manageable trade-off. Long-term safety is a major driver of trial design and the slow pace of progress.
*   **Prediction: The high-profile nature of advocates like Aubrey de Grey might do "as much harm as good for the field."**
    *   **Outcome**: The field of aging biology remained professionally separate from de Grey's SENS framework. While de Grey attracted media and some private funding, most academic and industrial research proceeded with mechanistic, hypothesis-driven programs (CR mimetics, senolytics, mTOR, etc.) rather than comprehensive repair strategies. De Grey's prominence may have introduced non-specialists to anti-aging concepts, but it did not reshape mainstream biogerontology research priorities.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

It accurately pointed to metabolism and pathway modulation as central to aging research, the ongoing challenge of translating invertebrate screens to mammals, and the persistent difficulty of commercial drug development. While the specific lead (5-HT2 antagonists) did not become the breakthrough, the article identified structural dynamics that proved enduring and contributed frame the scientific and commercial maturation of the field.
