# A Christmas Break (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post from science blogger Derek Lowe announces a temporary hiatus from regular blogging during the Christmas and New Year holiday period. The author explains that posting will be "light and irregular" until after January 1st, with only occasional recipe posts expected unless major breaking news occurs in the science/chemistry/pharma world. The tone is personal and informal, describing typical holiday activities like baking cookies, roasting lamb, wrapping presents, and some disappointment about weather conditions preventing telescope use. The article serves purely as a scheduling announcement rather than containing substantive scientific or industry analysis.

## 2. HISTORY
As this was a personal holiday announcement rather than substantive commentary, there are no consequential developments to track. Derek Lowe's blog "In the Pipeline" continued successfully after this break, and he remains a prominent science blogger in the pharmaceutical and chemistry space as of 2024. The blog format and his approach to science communication have remained consistent over the subsequent decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The post contained no predictions about scientific developments, biotechnology trends, pharmaceutical outcomes, or business performance. It was purely a personal announcement about blogging schedules during the holiday season.

## 4. INTEREST
Score: 0/10

This post is in the bottom 10% of interest as it contains no analysis, data, predictions, or substantive commentary about biotechnology or pharmaceutical developments. It serves only as a personal scheduling announcement with no technical or industry content.
