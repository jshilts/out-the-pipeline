# What Exactly Does Resveratrol Do? (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the scientific controversy surrounding resveratrol, a compound that appeared to extend lifespan in yeast and lower organisms and showed various effects in mice. The central issue raised is whether resveratrol actually activates the SIRT1 pathway as believed, or if this is an experimental artifact. The author notes that GlaxoSmithKline had purchased Sirtris Pharmaceuticals for $720 million based largely on sirtuin research originating from resveratrol studies.

The piece highlights a critical challenge to this paradigm: an Amgen research group published findings suggesting resveratrol doesn't directly affect SIRT1 when tested without fluorescent peptide substrates. This concern had been raised previously by University of Washington researchers. Both teams concluded that the apparent SIRT1 activation was an artifact of the assay methodology using fluorescent tags. While the metabolic benefits of resveratrol in diabetic animal models were acknowledged as real, the mechanism appeared unclear - possibly involving AMPK activation rather than direct SIRT1 modulation. The article raises questions about what assay methods Sirtris had been using and what implications this had for GSK's expensive acquisition.

## 2. HISTORY

**Sirtris and GSK Integration:** Following GSK's $720 million acquisition in 2008, Sirtris continued operating semi-independently until around 2013 when GSK fully integrated the unit. Several key clinical programs progressed but ultimately faced challenges:

**SIRT1 Activator Programs:**
- **SRT2104 (selisistat):** Advanced to Phase II trials for Huntington's disease and other conditions. Despite some early encouraging signals, it failed to demonstrate clear clinical efficacy in larger studies and was eventually discontinued.

- **SRT2379 and SRT3025:** Other sirtuin-targeting compounds that progressed to various clinical stages but ultimately did not lead to approved drugs.

**Replication Crisis and Mechanism Clarification:**
The fundamental concerns raised in the article proved prescient. Subsequent research confirmed that resveratrol's apparent SIRT1 activation was indeed an artifact of the fluorescent assay system. When using native substrates without artificial tags, resveratrol showed no direct SIRT1 activation.

However, research evolved to show that resveratrol might exert effects through:
- Indirect SIRT1 activation via other pathways
- AMPK pathway activation (as suggested in the article)
- Multiple other targets and mechanisms

**Clinical Translation Outcomes:**
Despite extensive research investment and multiple clinical trials, no SIRT1-activating drugs based on the original resveratrol paradigm have achieved FDA approval. The metabolic benefits observed in animal models did not consistently translate to human clinical endpoints.

**Broader Sirtuin Field Impact:**
The controversy prompted more rigorous assay development and validation throughout the sirtuin field. Research continued on sirtuins' roles in aging and metabolism, but drug development proved more challenging than initially hoped.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction (implied):** That the Amgen findings would force a reevaluation of Sirtris's research approach and GSK's investment strategy.
  - **Outcome:** Partially accurate. The field did undergo significant reevaluation, but GSK maintained Sirtris programs for several years. The fundamental assay issues did prompt methodological improvements industry-wide.

• **Prediction (implied):** That the question of how resveratrol works would be resolved through further research.
  - **Outcome:** Ongoing. While the direct SIRT1 activation hypothesis was largely disproven, the mechanisms remain complex and not fully understood. Resveratrol appears to work through multiple pathways rather than a single target.

• **Prediction (implied):** That "plenty of important things we don't know yet about sirtuins" would emerge.
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. The sirtuin field continued expanding with discoveries of additional sirtuin family members (SIRT1-7), their diverse cellular roles, and complex regulatory networks. However, therapeutic applications remained elusive.

• **Prediction (implied):** That Sirtris's compound evaluation methods would face scrutiny.
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. The entire field shifted toward more physiologically relevant assay systems and validation approaches following these revelations about assay artifacts.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article demonstrates excellent scientific judgment in identifying a critical methodological flaw that had major commercial implications. It represents a microcosm of broader challenges in drug development: the difficulty of translating basic research findings into clinical applications, and the importance of rigorous validation of experimental systems before making substantial investment decisions.
