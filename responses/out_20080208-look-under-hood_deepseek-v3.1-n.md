# A Look Under the Hood (February 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* review that examines the state of HDL-raising drugs, focusing on the aftermath of Pfizer's torcetrapib failure. Torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, had failed catastrophically in Phase III trials, raising questions about whether other HDL-raising therapies faced similar risks. The author explains that public understanding of cholesterol is oversimplified (good vs. bad), while the scientific reality is significantly more complex. HDL exists in multiple subforms with different functions, and its mechanism involves reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) across eight steps involving multiple organ systems and enzymes. Additionally, HDL has anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-oxidant effects whose mechanisms are poorly understood. The article underscores the gap between apparent scientific knowledge and actual clinical understanding, noting that cardiovascular disease is relatively well-studied compared to other therapeutic areas like CNS diseases.

## 2. HISTORY

The torcetrapib failure in 2006-2007 marked a turning point for CETP inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Subsequent developments include:

- **Dalcetrapib** (Roche): Showed no cardiovascular benefit in the dal-OUTCOMES trial (2012), terminated early due to futility
- **Evacetrapib** (Eli Lilly): Failed in the ACCELERATE trial (2015-2016), showing no reduction in major cardiovascular events despite raising HDL by 130%
- **Anacetrapib** (Merck): The REVEAL trial (2017) showed modest 9% relative risk reduction in major coronary events, but the drug was never marketed, likely due to accumulation in adipose tissue and long half-life concerns
- **TA-8995 (obicetrapib)** (NewAmsterdam Pharma): Currently in Phase III trials with mixed early results suggesting some promise but not breakthrough efficacy

The consistent pattern across CETP inhibitors has been that dramatic increases in HDL cholesterol do not translate into proportional cardiovascular risk reduction. This suggests that the relationship between HDL and cardiovascular disease is not causal in the way originally hypothesized, or that CETP inhibition affects the "wrong" HDL subfractions. The field shifted focus toward understanding HDL functionality rather than simply quantity, including cholesterol efflux capacity and HDL particle composition. No CETP inhibitors are currently FDA-approved for clinical use as of 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction 1**: "Torcetrapib and the other CETP inhibitors represent a very large (and very risky) bet on what is approximately step four" of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway
  - **Outcome**: Correct about the risk. The subsequent failures of dalcetrapib and evacetrapib, and minimal benefit from anacetrapib, validated concerns that CETP inhibition might not deliver meaningful clinical benefits despite raising HDL levels.

- **Prediction 2**: "We're going to learn a lot about human lipidology from its failure"
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. The CETP inhibitor failures drove research into HDL functionality over quantity, leading to understanding that HDL-C levels may not be causally protective and that HDL particle quality/function matters more than simple concentration.

- **Prediction 3**: Implicit prediction that CETP inhibition might be compound-specific or require better mechanistic understanding
  - **Outcome**: Partially correct about compound specificity (torcetrapib had off-target toxicity), but fundamentally, the mechanism itself appears flawed as a therapeutic strategy. Three different compounds from major companies all failed to show substantial benefit.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article was prescient in highlighting the complexity of HDL biology and correctly anticipated that CETP inhibition was a risky bet that would teach important lessons about lipid metabolism. The subsequent validation of these concerns through multiple clinical trial failures makes this a valuable case study in pharmaceutical development.
