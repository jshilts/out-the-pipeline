# Overselling p53 Drugs (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary responds to a New York Times article that had characterized drugs targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction as potential "wonder drugs" capable of treating multiple cancers regardless of origin. The author acknowledges that while p53 is indeed central to cancer, the Times piece conflated two distinct issues: mutated p53 (very common across cancers but difficult to drug) versus the less common situation of intact p53 bound by overexpressed MDM2. The drugs discussed (including Roche's Nutlins and RG7112) specifically aim to disrupt the p53-MDM2 interaction in cancers where p53 is wild-type but suppressed by excess MDM2. Early clinical trial data for RG7112 in liposarcoma showed modest results: 14 of 20 patients achieved stable disease, but only one had tumor shrinkage; there were also 12 serious adverse events in 8 patients. The commentary argues that while targeting MDM2 represents genuine progress for select tumor types, it does not merit the "beginning of a new genetic age" framing given that the approach would not work for the larger population of patients with mutant p53.

## 2. HISTORY

The commentary's measured assessment proved accurate. **RG7112 did not advance to approval.** Roche ultimately discontinued development after subsequent clinical studies showed limited efficacy and concerns about toxicity. The company's successor compound, **idasanutlin (RG7388)**, entered Phase III trials for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as monotherapy and in combination but ultimately failed to meet primary endpoints, and development was halted in the late 2010s. Across the industry, other MDM2 inhibitors met similar fates. **Sanofi's SAR405838**, tested in liposarcoma and other solid tumors, did not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit. **Merck's MK-8242** was discontinued after Phase II results showed inadequate efficacy. **Amgen's AMG-232** (kartozinertib) also failed to show meaningful response rates as a single agent in solid tumors, though some small signals appeared in specific contexts.

By the **mid-2020s, no MDM2 inhibitor had achieved FDA approval for cancer**, despite two decades of research and hundreds of millions in investment. Clinical trials repeatedly revealed a narrow therapeutic window: at doses required for efficacy, on-target toxicity emerged due to p53 activation in healthy tissues. While the biological mechanism was sound, translating it into safe and effective drugs proved far more difficult than anticipated. Liposarcoma remains an area of unmet need, but MDM2 inhibitors did not become a standard of care.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit or implicit predictions and evaluations:

• **"These results are absolutely enough to go on to a larger trial"**: ✅ **Partially correct in the near term; incorrect long-term.** RG7112 did advance into larger trials, but those trials ultimately led to discontinuation rather than approval.

• **"If they replicate (safety profile permitting), I'd certainly expect the drug to be approved"**: ❌ **Incorrect.** The safety and efficacy profiles did not replicate favorably, and RG7112 was discontinued.

• **"This is absolutely good news" for liposarcoma patients**: ⚠️ **Short-lived.** Early signals did not translate into an approved therapy that benefited patients.

• **Implicit prediction: p53-MDM2 targeting would remain niche and not broadly applicable**: ✅ **Correct.** The approach never expanded beyond narrow populations, and the vast majority of cancer patients with p53 mutations remained unaffected.

• **Implicit assessment of press hype versus reality**: ✅ **Correct.** The "Dawn Of A Glorious New Era" framing was unjustified, as subsequent clinical failures demonstrated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable scientific and clinical foresight, accurately predicting that the "wonder drug" narrative was premature. Its measured assessment of the p53-MDM2 landscape and critique of how science journalism inflates research results remain highly relevant given continuing cycles of media hype around early-stage cancer therapies. The article scores highly not just for its predictive accuracy but for its constructive critique of science communication practices.
