# Holiday Break (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a brief holiday announcement post from the Science magazine blog "Pipeline" dated December 22, 2010. The author (likely Derek Lowe, who writes the "In the Pipeline" blog about drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry) announces taking a holiday break from blogging. The post describes personal plans for the period including cookie-baking, tree-decorating, shopping, sleeping in late, and possibly using a telescope for stargazing during the vacation. The author notes that blog updates will be minimal until after the holidays and wishes readers celebrating the season a good break.

## 2. HISTORY
This was simply a routine holiday announcement post for a blog that has continued operating since 2010. The "In the Pipeline" blog continues to be published on Science magazine's website as of 2024, maintaining its focus on drug discovery and pharmaceutical industry commentary. The blog has maintained its regular publication schedule through subsequent years and continues to be a respected source of commentary on pharmaceutical research and biotechnology. No significant historical developments are tied specifically to this particular post, as it was merely a seasonal administrative announcement rather than substantive scientific content.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This holiday announcement post contained no substantive predictions about the future of biotechnology, pharmaceutical industry, or any scientific developments. It focused entirely on short-term holiday plans and temporary blogging schedule changes.

## 4. INTEREST
