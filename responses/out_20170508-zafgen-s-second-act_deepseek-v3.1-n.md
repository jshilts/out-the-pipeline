# Zafgen's Second Act (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Zafgen's comeback attempt after the failure of their first drug candidate, beloranib, for Prader-Willi syndrome. Beloranib was an epoxide-based methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAp2) inhibitor that showed efficacy but caused fatal blood clots, leading to clinical trial termination and the compound's discontinuation. Zafgen had persevered and developed a second MetAp2 inhibitor, ZGN-1061, described as being in the fumagillin class and similarly epoxide-based. The company was returning to the clinic with ZGN-1061, this time targeting diabetic patients rather than Prader-Willi syndrome. The article notes that the original strategy was likely to gain rare disease approval with Prader-Willi and then expand to the much larger diabetes market, but after beloranib's safety failure, Zafgen had to pursue the diabetes indication directly, which the author characterizes as a harder, more expensive path in a crowded field with stringent FDA safety requirements.

## 2. HISTORY

The article was published in May 2017. Subsequently, Zafgen advanced ZGN-1061 through clinical trials for type 2 diabetes. A Phase 2 trial for ZGN-1061 was completed, with results released in late 2017 showing statistically significant reductions in HbA1c and body weight, but the drug's development was ultimately discontinued after Zafgen's strategic shift toward rare diseases. In 2019, Zafgen announced it would halt development of ZGN-1061 and instead focus entirely on rare metabolic diseases, pivoting toward its newer lead candidate, ZGN-1258, for hypothalamic obesity. This pivot also included a corporate rebranding, with the company announcing in 2019 that it would change its name to Larimar Therapeutics. After the rebranding, Larimar Therapeutics went on to advance CTI-1601, a fusion protein intended to treat Friedreich's ataxia, while Zafgen's MetAp2 inhibitor programs were shelved. By 2021, Larimar had fully transitioned away from obesity and diabetes R&D, with MetAp2 as a drug target largely abandoned in the clinic. Neither beloranib nor ZGN-1061 reached FDA approval, and MetAp2 inhibition did not become a widely adopted mechanism for diabetes or obesity in clinical practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **ZGN-1061 would proceed into diabetes trials** – Confirmed. ZGN-1061 completed a Phase 2 trial in type 2 diabetes after the article, achieving endpoints but not progressing to Phase 3.
- **It would be harder and more costly to succeed in the crowded diabetes field** – Confirmed. The diabetes indication proved challenging, and despite positive Phase 2 data, Zafgen discontinued ZGN-1061 and exited the metabolic disease space.
- **Beloranib's failure would have sunk many small companies** – Partially true regarding Zafgen. The company avoided liquidation but pivoted completely, abandoning MetAp2, rebranding, and shifting to rare diseases rather than achieving commercial viability with their second MetAp2 candidate.
- **MetAp2 inhibition had therapeutic potential** – Disconfirmed for clinical use. While the mechanism showed biological activity for weight and glucose control, neither beloranib nor ZGN-1061 led to approved drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article captures a notable mid-stage pivot in biopharma and the challenges of repurposing a failed mechanism, but the story did not produce lasting breakthroughs or regulatory approvals, making it moderately interesting rather than highly impactful.
