# Sounding Like Deepak Chopra (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This Science blog post discusses a social science study titled "On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-Profound Bullshit," which examined people's susceptibility to impressive-sounding but meaningless language. The study compared randomly generated buzzword strings using Markov chains with tweets from Deepak Chopra's Twitter feed, finding that participants could barely distinguish between the two.

The paper determined that people more receptive to such "pseudo-profound bullshit" tended to score lower on verbal intelligence tests and were more likely to believe in conspiracy theories and paranormal phenomena. The post explores the broader challenge of distinguishing legitimate technical language (like that used in scientific papers) from meaningless jargon. The author contrasts technical vocabulary in fields like chemistry—where terms like "aromatic protons" have specific, verifiable meanings—with philosophical or spiritual language that may appear meaningful but lacks substance. The piece references the Sokal affair, where physicist Alan Sokal successfully hoaxed a literary theory journal by submitting nonsense dressed up in academic language, highlighting how easily people can be deceived by impenetrable prose that sounds profound.

## 2. HISTORY

The "On the Reception and Detection of Pseudo-Profound Bullshit" paper, published in 2015 by researchers Gordon Pennycook, James Allan Cheyne, Nathaniel Barr, Derek J. Koehler, and Jonathan A. Fugelsang, became highly influential in psychology and communication studies. The paper has been cited over 600 times according to Google Scholar, spawning significant follow-up research on bullshit receptivity and cognitive biases.

A notable follow-up study by Pennycook and colleagues in 2018 examined the prevalence of "fake news" sharing and found similar cognitive patterns—people who were more receptive to pseudo-profound bullshit were also more likely to share misinformation online. This research contributed to a growing body of literature on misinformation susceptibility, particularly relevant during the 2016 US presidential election and subsequent years when "fake news" became a prominent societal concern.

The paper's framework for measuring "bullshit receptivity" using both randomly generated phrases and Deepak Chopra quotes has been adapted by subsequent researchers studying vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy theory belief, and climate change denial. The fundamental finding that poor bullshit detection correlates with lower cognitive ability and higher susceptibility to pseudoscience has held up in multiple replication studies across different populations.

Alan Sokal, mentioned prominently in the article, continued his critique of postmodern misuse of scientific concepts. In 2022, Sokal (along with co-authors) published "The Pseudoscience Wars" examining the persistent problem of scientific language being co-opted for ideological purposes. The principles behind the Sokal affair remain relevant as debates continue about academic rigor, particularly in fields intersecting science and social theory.

Deepak Chopra, whose tweets served as the study's "genuine" pseudo-profound material, remains active with over 3 million Twitter followers. However, his reputation in scientific circles has not improved—in fact, the scientific community has become increasingly vocal about calling out what they view as harmful pseudoscience. Chopra's continued promotion of quantum healing and similar concepts has been criticized by organizations like the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and individual scientists who argue it undermines public understanding of actual quantum physics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions identified in the article:**
• None explicitly stated

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article ranks in the 70-80th percentile of interest due to its early discussion of a study that would become highly influential in understanding misinformation susceptibility. While focused on a specific 2015 paper, it touched upon themes—bullshit detection, scientific communication, and cognitive biases—that became increasingly relevant in subsequent years, particularly with the rise of "fake news" and online misinformation. The connection drawn between pseudo-profound language and broader patterns of credulity proved prescient given later developments in misinformation research.
