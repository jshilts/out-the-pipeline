# Big Sirtuin News (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short note announced that the seminal 2001 *Nature* paper showing that over‑expression of the yeast deacetylase Sir2 extended lifespan in *Caenorhabditis elegans* was “largely incorrect.”  The author suggested that this flaw could explain the mixed results that had since emerged for sirtuin‑activating compounds such as resveratrol and the synthetic molecule SRT1720.  The post promised a longer follow‑up that would discuss (i) the broader biology of sirtuins, (ii) reproducibility of the original longevity claim, (iii) the outlook for pharmaceutical programs targeting sirtuins, and (iv) how the acquisition of Sirtris by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) might be affected.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Re‑evaluation of the 2001 longevity claim**  
* 2013–2014 a series of papers (most notably by Tissenbaum, Guarente and colleagues) showed that the original lifespan extension was due to a background mutation in the *daf‑2* insulin‑signalling pathway, not to Sir2 activity.  The 2001 *Nature* paper was never formally retracted, but the community now treats the claim as disproved.  

**Resveratrol and synthetic sirtuin activators**  
* Early‑2000s enthusiasm for resveratrol as a “sirtuin‑activating compound” (STAC) gave way to a consensus that its in‑vivo effects are pleiotropic and not driven by direct SIRT1 activation at physiologic concentrations.  
* Sirtris’s lead STACs (SRT1720, SRT2104, SRT2379) entered Phase I/II trials for metabolic disease, inflammation, and neuro‑degeneration.  None progressed to registration; the most advanced, SRT2104, completed Phase IIb trials for ulcerative colitis (2016) and for type‑2 diabetes (2018) with modest efficacy signals and safety concerns that halted further development.  

**GSK’s Sirtris acquisition**  
* GSK bought Sirtris in 2008 for ≈ $720 M, betting on a pipeline of sirtuin‑activating drugs.  After the reproducibility crisis and the disappointing trial data, GSK wound down the Sirtris program around 2014, laying off most of the original team.  The acquisition is now cited as a cautionary example of hype‑driven biotech deals.  

**Shift in the field**  
* Research on sirtuins continued, but emphasis moved from “activators” to understanding their role in NAD⁺ metabolism, DNA repair, and epigenetic regulation.  
* NAD⁺ precursors (nicotinamide riboside, NMN) entered the clinic; NR (Niagen) received GRAS status and is sold as a dietary supplement, while NMN has progressed to Phase II trials for metabolic and age‑related indications (2023‑2025).  
* SIRT1‑targeted gene‑therapy approaches (e.g., AAV‑mediated SIRT1 over‑expression) are in early pre‑clinical stages but have not yet reached human trials.  

**Clinical and commercial outcomes**  
* No sirtuin‑activating drug has received FDA or EMA approval as of early 2026.  
* Resveratrol remains a widely marketed supplement, but large‑scale trials have not demonstrated disease‑modifying benefits.  
* The broader “longevity” market has shifted toward senolytics, mTOR inhibitors, and NAD⁺ boosters rather than direct sirtuin activation.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 note | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **If the 2001 Sir2 longevity result is wrong, the field will lose credibility.** | The reproducibility issue was confirmed (2013‑14) and did dent enthusiasm, but the field survived by pivoting to other sirtuin functions. |
| **Pharma research on sirtuins will be jeopardized.** | GSK’s Sirtris program was discontinued (≈ 2014). Other companies (e.g., Merck, Novartis) also halted STAC pipelines after Phase II failures. |
| **Resveratrol’s mixed results will be explained by the Sir2 controversy.** | Subsequent mechanistic work showed resveratrol’s effects are largely off‑target; the controversy contributed to a more skeptical view, but the explanation is broader than just the Sir2 paper. |
| **GSK will reassess its investment in Sirtris.** | GSK wrote off most of the Sirtris assets and redirected resources to other epigenetic targets; the acquisition is now viewed as a loss. |
| **New sirtuin‑based drugs will soon reach the market.** | No sirtuin‑activating drug has been approved to date; the prediction proved overly optimistic. |
| **The sirtuin field will remain scientifically interesting despite commercial setbacks.** | True – basic research on SIRT1‑7 continues robustly, especially in NAD⁺ metabolism and DNA repair, and has informed the development of NAD⁺ precursors. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when a high‑profile longevity claim was overturned, prompting a major re‑evaluation of a whole therapeutic area; its relevance persists because it illustrates how reproducibility issues can reshape biotech investment strategies.
