# Why Not Share More Bioactivity Data? (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the challenge of sharing bioactivity data in the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on the ChEMBL database as a repository for such information. At the time, vast amounts of biological activity data on small molecules existed within drug companies—the "driveshaft" of discovery—but remained locked away due to concerns about competitive advantage and lack of clear immediate benefit. The author notes that even completed or abandoned projects generated far more data points than were typically published, creating missed opportunities for scientific advancement. The piece highlights that GSK appeared to be the only organization experimenting with sharing unpublished bioactivity data through ChEMBL's supplementary data program, which accepted data from assays described in open scientific publications. The author argues for a cultural shift toward greater transparency, contending that data with potential value has zero chance of helping anyone if it remains inaccessible in "digital desk drawers."

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the landscape of bioactivity data sharing evolved significantly, though perhaps more gradually than hoped:

**ChEMBL Database Growth**: ChEMBL continued expanding substantially, with the database growing from ~1 million bioactivity measurements in 2013 to over 20 million by subsequent years, incorporating data from additional pharmaceutical companies beyond GSK.

**Industry Participation**: More pharmaceutical companies gradually joined data sharing initiatives. Major players including Pfizer, Novartis, and others eventually contributed data through various channels, though the process remained cautious and selective.

**Mechanism of Action**: The FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) gained traction in the mid-to-late 2010s, providing a framework that helped justify data sharing investments. This scientific rather than purely altruistic framing helped organizations build business cases for participation.

**European Bioinformatics Institute Leadership**: EBI (now part of EMBL-EBI) strengthened its role as a neutral, trusted repository, which likely helped overcome some corporate concerns about data sharing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The author expected that GSK's pioneering data sharing would encourage other organizations to participate.
  - **Reality**: While adoption grew, it remained measured rather than explosive. Most companies engaged cautiously through partnerships rather than open publication of historical data.
  
- **Prediction**: That shared data would have limited immediate breakthrough potential but nonzero value compared to zero value when locked away.
  - **Reality**: This proved accurate. No single transformative discovery was directly attributed to shared bioactivity data, but it contributed to systematic drug discovery efforts, target validation studies, and machine learning model training.

- **Prediction**: The implied expectation that a cultural shift toward openness would accelerate.
  - **Reality**: The shift occurred but was gradual, driven more by practical considerations (broader availability of public data made selective secrecy less valuable) than pure cultural transformation.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

Reasoning: This article addresses an important and persistent challenge in pharmaceutical research infrastructure, but the topic is somewhat specialized to the drug discovery community.
