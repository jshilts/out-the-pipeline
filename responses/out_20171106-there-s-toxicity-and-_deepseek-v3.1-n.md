# There's Toxicity, And There's Toxicity (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the remarkable toxicity and potency of botulinum toxin (BTX), using a Bloomberg feature about Botox production as its starting point. The author emphasizes the extreme safety measures required for BTX handling—a baby-aspirin-size amount of powdered toxin suffices for the global Botox supply for a year, with secret transportation, guarded facilities, and government oversight. The article provides a comparative toxicity ranking across different substances: BTX is positioned as the most toxic known substance with a human LD50 of about 2 nanograms/kg intravenously and 10 nanograms/kg by inhalation—orders of magnitude more toxic than Sarin nerve gas. Other substances discussed include cone snail venom (≈30 micrograms/kg), ricin (single-digit micrograms/kg), tetrodotoxin (≈300 micrograms/kg in mice), with LSD mentioned as exceptionally potent though not highly toxic (0.2 micrograms/kg produces noticeable effects). The author notes that despite billions in sales, no company has successfully developed a Botox biosimilar due to the complex production and purification trade secrets held by Allergan.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2017, botulinum toxin has continued to dominate both therapeutic and cosmetic markets. Allergan's Botox maintained strong market position, but faced increasing competition. The FDA approved additional therapeutic indications for botulinum toxin products, including chronic migraine prevention and various spasticity conditions. Several biosimilar attempts encountered significant challenges, though some competitors like Dysport (abobotulinumtoxinA) and Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA) gained market share.

The market expanded beyond Allergan, with companies like Revance Therapeutics developing alternative botulinum toxin products. Revance's Daxxify (daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm) received FDA approval in 2022 for glabellar lines, representing the first new neuromodulator approved in decades, though it still faced challenges competing with established products.

Research continued into new therapeutic applications across neurology, urology, and pain management. However, the predicted biosimilar challenges proved accurate—despite expiration of some patents, the complexity of manufacturing and regulatory hurdles prevented true generic equivalents from entering the market in substantial numbers. The market for botulinum toxin products grew to exceed $4 billion annually by the early 2020s, with both medical and cosmetic applications expanding.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"No company has made a successful run at a Botox biosimilar yet, despite its sales of billions of dollars per year"**:
  - **Outcome: Mixed**. While no true identical biosimilar emerged, competitors like Dysport, Xeomin, and later Daxxify gained FDA approval and market presence. However, these were alternative formulations rather than true biosimilars, maintaining the high barrier to entry predicted. The fundamental manufacturing complexity and regulatory requirements proved as challenging as anticipated, preventing the flood of generics seen with small-molecule drugs.

- **Implicit prediction about continued market dominance**:
  - **Outcome: Correct**. Botox and similar botulinum toxin products continued to dominate both cosmetic and therapeutic markets, with expanding indications and growing revenue. The unique position of BTX as a therapeutic agent remained unchallenged by alternative mechanisms.

- **Implicit prediction about biosimilar difficulty**:
  - **Outcome: Accurate**. The article's suggestion that manufacturing secrets and purification complexity would prevent biosimilar competition proved largely correct. Competitors emerged but through alternative formulations rather than true interchangeable biosimilars, validating the prediction about technical barriers.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides valuable comparative toxicology insights and accurately predicted the continued challenges in biosimilar development for botulinum toxin, though it focuses heavily on technical toxicity rankings rather than broader clinical or commercial implications.
