# Backstage Problems (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief post from May 2015 describes technical difficulties with the Corante website, specifically redirects to unrelated domains and general instability. The author notes they are in the process of migrating archives to a new location and testing a new version of the site. The post mentions that pipeline.corante.com will redirect to the new site, which promises to be more stable. The author identifies Sitemeter as the source of redirect problems and removes it to maintain stability during the transition period.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published on what appears to be Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which focused on pharmaceutical science and drug discovery. Around this time, the blog was indeed transitioning from its long-time hosting on the Corante network. The "In the Pipeline" blog subsequently moved to new hosting arrangements, first appearing on Science Magazine's network and later operating independently.

The "In the Pipeline" blog itself continued to be published regularly after this technical transition, maintaining its reputation as one of the most respected sources of commentary on pharmaceutical research, drug discovery, and biotechnology. The blog has consistently provided expert analysis of clinical trial results, FDA approvals, scientific conferences, and industry developments through the present day.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Things should hold together long enough now!" and site stability**: The immediate goal of the temporary fix (removing Sitemeter) was successful - the site remained accessible during the migration period.

• **New site being "far more stable"**: The subsequent hosting arrangements did provide more stable platform for the blog's continued publication.

• **Pipeline.corante.com redirect to new site**: This domain transition was successfully completed, allowing readers to continue accessing the content without disruption.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While this post documents an important behind-the-scenes transition for a significant scientific blog, it contains no scientific content or substantive analysis relevant to biotechnology developments.

---

This appears to be a routine technical update post rather than a substantive article about biotechnology. While "In the Pipeline" is an important blog in the pharmaceutical industry, this particular post offers no commentary or analysis that could be evaluated for accuracy or insight regarding biotech developments after May 2015. The technical transition it describes was successfully completed, but the post itself contains no predictions about biotechnology or scientific developments that could be assessed.
