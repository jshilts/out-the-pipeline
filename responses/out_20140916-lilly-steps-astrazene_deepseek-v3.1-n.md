# Lilly Steps In for AstraZeneca's Secretase Inhibitor (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on Eli Lilly's $500 million deal to partner with AstraZeneca on AZD3293, a beta-secretase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease that originated from Astex's fragment-based drug discovery platform. AstraZeneca had been scaling back its central nervous system (CNS) research infrastructure, making a partner necessary, while Lilly had previously halted its own beta-secretase program in 2013. The author notes that both companies were taking significant risks given the historical failure rate for Alzheimer's trials (zero to 1% success). The compound had been cited in AstraZeneca's defense against a Pfizer takeover bid, though some skeptics questioned the claimed 9% probability of success. The author characterizes Lilly's approach as a "bet-the-ranch" commitment to Alzheimer's research despite the long and uncertain development timeline typical of the field.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2014 partnership announcement, the joint development of AZD3293 (later named lanabecestat) continued through Phase 1 and into Phase 2/3 trials. By 2016, Lilly and AstraZeneca moved the compound into two pivotal Phase 3 trials: AMARANTH (mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's and mild Alzheimer's dementia) and DAYBREAK-ALZ (early Alzheimer's disease). Both trials were large-scale, global studies designed to assess efficacy and safety over extended periods.

The development program ultimately failed. In June 2018, Lilly and AstraZeneca announced they were discontinuing the global Phase 3 trials of lanabecestat due to unfavorable results from an interim analysis by an independent data monitoring committee. The trials showed that the compound was unlikely to meet their primary endpoints, and concerns emerged about potential worsening of cognitive function and increased risk of adverse events including weight loss and psychiatric symptoms in treated patients.

This failure was part of a broader pattern of setbacks for beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors as a class. Multiple pharmaceutical companies, including Merck (verubecestat), Janssen/AstraZeneca (atabecestat), Novartis (CNP520/umibecestat), and Roche (gantenerumab in some studies), also discontinued BACE inhibitor programs between 2017-2020 due to lack of efficacy or safety concerns. The failures revealed underlying challenges with the BACE inhibition approach, including questions about target engagement timing and whether amyloid reduction alone, particularly at later stages, was sufficient to alter disease progression.

AstraZeneca continued its shift away from CNS research, eventually eliminating most internal neuroscience discovery efforts by 2020 and pivoting toward rare neurological disorders through external partnerships. Lilly, despite the lanabecestat setback, maintained its commitment to Alzheimer's research, continuing development of solanezumab (also failed in 2016) and later advancing donanemab, an anti-amyloid antibody targeting pyroglutamate Aβ plaques, which showed more promising results in early studies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Beta-secretase inhibitors warranting another serious attempt**: The author expressed cautious optimism that "beta-secretase deserves to have another good shot taken at it." This prediction proved incorrect. Not only did lanabecestat fail, but multiple other BACE inhibitors failed within four years of this article, leading to widespread abandonment of this mechanism class by major pharmaceutical companies.

• **The long development timeline ("it'll take years before we find out")**: This prediction was accurate. The compound did indeed require years of development before the ultimate failure was determined in 2018, four years after the partnership announcement. As anticipated, the trials were "painfully slow."

• **Implicit risk assessment**: While the author didn't make explicit success predictions, the framing of Lilly's "bet-the-ranch" approach and the 9% success claim skepticism proved prescient, as the compound ultimately had 0% success. The underlying caution about Alzheimer's trial success rates was validated.

• **The mechanistic approach**: The implicit assumption was that BACE inhibition was scientifically sound but faced clinical execution challenges. The subsequent failures of multiple BACE inhibitors suggested more fundamental biological problems, potentially including the timing of intervention, the role of amyloid reduction alone, and safety concerns that only emerged in large-scale trials.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 6/10**
This article offers a prescient look at a major clinical failure in Alzheimer's research and captures a pivotal moment when companies were still investing heavily in BACE inhibitors despite accumulating skepticism, providing valuable context for understanding the broader industry shift away from this mechanism class.
