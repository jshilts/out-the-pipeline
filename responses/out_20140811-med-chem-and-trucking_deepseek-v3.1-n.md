# Med-Chem and Trucking, Together At Last (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article uses the trucking industry's driver shortage as an analogy to critique claims of STEM worker shortages in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The author references a New York Times article showing that the trucking industry claimed a shortage of 30,000 qualified drivers (projected to reach 200,000 within a decade), while simultaneously turning down business due to lack of workers despite a 6% unemployment rate. The core argument is that Economics 101 principles suggest there's no true shortage when wages haven't risen to equilibrate supply and demand—instead, companies are simply unwilling to pay market-clearing wages. The article explicitly connects this to John Lechleiter's statements at Lilly about job shortages and broader "STEM shortage" discussions, suggesting these reflect wage-sensitivity rather than genuine workforce scarcity. The underlying argument is that claims of "shortage of skilled workers" often mask an unwillingness to increase compensation to attract sufficient talent.

## 2. HISTORY

**Trucking Industry Developments (2014-2024):**
- By 2015-2016, truck driver wages did begin rising significantly as predicted by basic economic theory, with some carriers increasing pay 10-20%
- The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration implemented Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandates in December 2017, which effectively reduced driver productivity and capacity while not addressing underlying compensation issues
- The industry experienced consolidation with smaller carriers struggling more with compensation than larger ones
- COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) exposed the essential nature of trucking but also highlighted high turnover rates (often 90%+ annually at some carriers)
- Actual driver turnover remains extremely high (often 80-100% annually) rather than true shortage being the primary issue

**STEM Workforce Developments (2014-2024):**
- The biopharmaceutical industry expanded significantly during the 2014-2024 period, with biosimilar development, cell and gene therapy emergence, and massive COVID-19 vaccine/drug development
- Wages in biotech/pharma did increase, particularly for specialized roles and during the 2021-2022 biotech boom
- H-1B visa programs continued to be used extensively, with arguments continuing about whether they suppress wages or fill genuine shortages
- The "shortage" narrative persisted but evolved - some companies outsourced more heavily, others increased compensation, while concerns grew about concentration in specific geographic hubs

**Policy and Business Impact:**
- No major federal policy changes occurred specifically addressing "STEM shortage" claims in ways that dramatically altered wage dynamics
- Companies continued strategies of outsourcing, contract work, and selective wage increases rather than broad market-clearing compensation adjustments
- The trucking analogy proved prescient regarding the relationship between compensation claims and actual worker availability

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Trucking Industry Predictions:**
- • **Prediction:** The 30,000 driver shortage would rise to 200,000 within a decade unless wages increased
- **Reality:** While recruitment challenges persisted, wage increases beginning around 2015, along with regulation (ELDs) reducing effective capacity, meant the "shortage" narrative was debatable—turnover remained the core issue rather than absolute shortage
- • **Prediction:** Companies turning down business would eventually be forced to raise wages
- **Reality:** Mixed evidence—some companies did increase wages, others continued high-cost recruitment and retention struggles with minimal wage improvements

**STEM/Med-Chem Predictions:**
- • **Prediction:** STEM claims of worker shortages would be revealed as wage-sensitivity issues rather than genuine shortages
- **Reality:** Partially validated—biotech expansion occurred with wage growth in many sectors, but concentration in geographic hubs and continued outsourcing suggested a complex dynamic beyond simple shortage arguments. The debate persisted through 2024 with no clear resolution, suggesting wage sensitivity played a role but wasn't the full explanation

- • **Prediction:** The "parsimonious" corporate approach to wages outside executive suites would be unsustainable
- **Reality:** In both industries, the relationship between compensation and workforce availability remained contentious through 2024. Highly profitable periods (especially post-2020) saw some wage growth but also increased outsourcing and contract work

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article links two seemingly unrelated industries to make a single, testable economic claim and anticipates the wage debate that remained unresolved through 2024.
