# Merck Cuts Back. Way Back. (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Merck implementing significant workforce reductions, cutting approximately 20% of positions worldwide across all parts of the company. The information came as a rumor that was later confirmed, with the piece noting that additional details would follow as they became available. The context suggests this was part of broader restructuring within Merck's drug research operations, though specific reasons for the cuts or which divisions were most affected are not detailed in this brief announcement.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 Merck restructuring was part of a larger strategic transformation under CEO Kenneth Frazier and research head Roger Perlmutter, who had recently joined from Amgen. The cuts were indeed substantial, eventually totaling around 8,500 jobs by 2015 across research, manufacturing, and commercial operations.

In the years following 2013, Merck made several major moves:
- **Divestitures**: Sold their consumer care business to Bayer in 2014 for $14.2 billion
- **Acquisitions**: Purchased Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014, Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 2015, and notably acquired Schering-Plough in 2009 (before this article), which had already set the stage for consolidation
- **Research restructuring**: Focused resources on priority areas including oncology, vaccines, diabetes, and hospital acute care
- **Key drug developments**: Continued investment in what would become their blockbuster immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda), which received FDA approval in 2014 and grew into one of the world's best-selling drugs, generating over $20 billion annually by the early 2020s
- **Pipeline outcomes**: While some programs were cut, the strategic focus on oncology and vaccines proved successful

Merck's stock performance was generally positive over the subsequent decade, and the company maintained its position as one of the major global pharmaceutical companies. The restructuring appears to have been successful in improving operational efficiency while maintaining research productivity in key therapeutic areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**No explicit predictions were included in this brief announcement-style article.** The piece notes that "more details as they become available" would follow, suggesting it was an early report of breaking news rather than a predictive analysis. The article serves as a contemporaneous news item rather than making forward-looking statements about the pharmaceutical industry or biotechnology sector.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This brief announcement-style post lacks substantive analysis or broader industry insights, simply reporting confirmed news of workforce reductions. While Merck's restructuring was significant, the article itself provides minimal context or commentary that would make it interesting for long-term analysis.
