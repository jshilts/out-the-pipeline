# From Industry Into Teaching? (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is actually a blog post soliciting community input rather than a traditional commentary article. The author, an industrial scientist, poses an open question to readers about the experiences of scientists who transition from industry positions into teaching roles, particularly focusing on organic chemistry instruction. The post acknowledges that this career move is common but asks for practical insights on textbooks, web resources, and personal experiences across different institutional contexts. It touches on the challenges of organic chemistry's reputation as a difficult course and the pedagogical pitfalls of treating it as pure memorization. The author offers preliminary advice about organized presentation styles and self-recording practice sessions, while explicitly inviting readers to contribute their experiences and recommendations in the comments section.

## 2. HISTORY

This is a blog post requesting reader contributions rather than making claims about biotechnology or scientific developments. As such, there are no subsequent developments to research regarding:

- **Approved drugs**: Not applicable - the post doesn't discuss drug development
- **Clinical trials**: Not applicable - the post doesn't discuss clinical research
- **Scientific method adoption**: Not applicable - the post discusses teaching careers, not research methods
- **FDA approvals**: Not applicable - no drugs or therapies are discussed
- **Business growth/failures**: Not applicable - no companies or commercial ventures are mentioned

The post was essentially a call for community discussion about career transitions from industry to academia, focusing on pedagogical approaches rather than scientific or commercial outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make predictions about future developments in biotechnology, scientific discoveries, or commercial trends. Rather, it solicited practical experiences and advice from readers about teaching careers. Any "predictions" about how teaching transitions might work would have been speculative opinions from commenters rather than forecasts about empirical developments in the field.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This blog post is a community discussion prompt about academic career transitions rather than a substantive article about biotechnology industry developments.
