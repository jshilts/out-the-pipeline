# Birch Reduction Without Tears. Or Ammonia. Or Metals. (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the classic Birch reduction, an organic chemistry reaction that reduces aromatic rings by one double bond using liquid ammonia and alkali metals like sodium or lithium. The author describes the dramatic visual aspects of the reaction - the solvated electrons creating a striking blue color, the handling of reactive metals, and the challenges of working with liquid ammonia. While academically fascinating, these conditions make the Birch reduction notoriously difficult and hazardous to perform, especially at industrial scale.

The central focus is a new paper from Phil Baran's laboratory presenting an electrochemical alternative to the Birch reduction. Instead of using liquid ammonia and bulk metals, this method employs electrochemistry to deliver electrons directly to substrates. The system requires careful optimization: a phosphoramide additive (TPPA) to prevent lithium plating, dimethylurea as the proton source, magnesium anode, and a small cathode to increase current density. The mechanism appears to involve direct electron transfer at the cathode surface rather than solvated electrons, proceeding through single-electron reduction followed by protonation. The reaction works on various substituted aromatic compounds and can also facilitate other dissolving-metal transformations (ketone reduction, McMurry coupling, reductive cyclizations). Most importantly, the electrochemical approach scales easily by stacking modules in batch or flow configurations, suggesting potential for commercial "Birchomatic" equipment.

## 2. HISTORY

The electrochemical Birch reduction developed by Baran's group represents a significant advance in synthetic methodology that has gained substantial adoption in both academic and industrial settings since 2019.

**Mechanism and Scope Expansion**: Subsequent research confirmed that the electrochemical approach works through direct electron transfer at the cathode surface, with the lithium cation-dimethylurea complex playing a crucial role in stabilizing intermediates. The methodology has been extended to additional substrate classes beyond those initially reported, including more complex heterocyclic systems and natural product scaffolds. Research groups worldwide have validated the robustness of the conditions across diverse molecular architectures.

**Scalability and Commercial Adoption**: The promise of easy scale-up has been realized in practice. The modular electrochemical approach enables seamless transition from milligram to kilogram scale, addressing a major limitation of traditional Birch chemistry. Chemical manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies have increasingly adopted electrochemical methods for large-scale synthesis, with flow electrochemical systems becoming more common in process chemistry departments.

**Equipment and Technology Development**: The vision of "commercial Birchomatic" equipment has materialized. Companies specializing in electrochemical synthesis equipment have developed user-friendly systems incorporating the optimized conditions, making electrochemical organic synthesis more accessible to non-specialists. These systems often feature automated control of voltage, current density, and temperature, reducing the technical barriers that historically limited electrochemical adoption.

**Impact on Green Chemistry**: The elimination of liquid ammonia and bulk metals aligns with green chemistry principles, reducing hazardous waste generation and improving safety profiles. This has particular value in pharmaceutical manufacturing where safety and environmental considerations are paramount.

**Related Methodological Advances**: Baran's group and others have continued developing electrochemical alternatives to other challenging transformations, expanding the toolkit available to synthetic chemists. This broader electrochemical renaissance in organic synthesis has led to renewed interest in electrochemical methods across the field.
