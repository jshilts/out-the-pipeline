# A New Effect From JAK Inhibition (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article discusses a Nature Cell Biology paper that reported JAK1/3 inhibitors—such as tofacitinib, an FDA-approved rheumatoid arthritis drug—can cause human white adipocytes (fat cells) to convert into brown fat cells. Brown adipocytes are thermoregulatory cells that rapidly burn lipids, making them a theoretically attractive target for treating obesity and metabolic disease.

The key mechanistic insight was that JAK inhibition appears to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which mediates this white-to-brown fat conversion. However, the article notes several major challenges: JAK inhibitors' systemic immune-suppressing effects (since they're used for autoimmune conditions), the lack of evidence for this browning effect occurring in living humans (in vivo), and the need for either local drug delivery or complex cell-based therapy approaches. The author also highlights the methodological advance of using an expandable human adipocyte stem cell line for phenotypic screening, and speculates whether discovery platforms like Recursion's could identify such effects.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Reality:** Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) has remained primarily an immunology drug, approved for rheumatoid arthritis (2012), psoriatic arthritis (2017), ulcerative colitis (2018), and ankylosing spondylitis (2021). It has not been approved for any metabolic indications, and no JAK inhibitor has successfully reached the market for obesity or metabolic disease.

**JAK Inhibitor Development:** Subsequent years saw additional JAK inhibitors approved—baricitinib (Olumiant, 2018), upadacitinib (Rinvoq, 2019), filgotinib (Jyseleca, 2020)—but all for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). JAK inhibitors are now established as a major class of immunomodulatory drugs, but metabolic applications have not materialized.

**Metabolic Drug Landscape:** The obesity drug market evolved dramatically after 2014, but through completely different mechanisms: GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide/Ozempic approved 2017, Wegovy for obesity 2021) transformed the field. Brown fat activation approaches never achieved clinical success as therapeutic targets.

**Safety Concerns:** JAK inhibitors have faced increasing FDA safety warnings, including black box warnings for serious infections, malignancies, thrombosis, and cardiovascular events (2021-2022 updates), making systemic use for metabolic conditions even less viable.

**Scientific Progress:** Research on brown fat and browning continued, but no therapeutic breakthroughs emerged from the JAK inhibition pathway. The fundamental challenge—achieving tissue-specific metabolic effects without systemic immunosuppression—was never solved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** The article anticipated that JAK inhibition for obesity would "almost certainly need to be delivered locally and prevented from spreading systemically"
  - **Reality:** ✓ Correct. No systemic JAK inhibitor reached obesity trials due to immunomodulatory effects
  
• **Prediction:** Concerned about "numerous and significant obstacles" for cell-based therapy (ex vivo JAK inhibition plus transplantation)
  - **Reality:** ✓ Correct. No such therapy advanced to clinical practice
  
• **Prediction:** Doubted broad utility due to "lack of evidence that JAK inhibition would promote metabolic browning in vivo, in particular in humans"
  - **Reality:** ✓ Correct. In vivo human evidence never convincingly emerged
  
• **Prediction:** Expected we'd "see plenty of further phenotypic screening" with the human adipocyte stem cell line
  - **Reality:** → Partially correct. Improved cell models advanced obesity research, but JAK-STAT screening didn't yield drugs
  
• **Prediction:** Speculated Recursion's platform might pick up such effects but also "keep them from discovering ten drugs a year"
  - **Reality:** → Mixed. Recursion (IPO 2021) developed discovery platforms but hasn't achieved ten approved drugs annually

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3**

The article identified an interesting cellular phenomenon with mechanistic insight (Hedgehog pathway), but the therapeutic pathway never translated to clinical application. However, its skepticism about translational challenges proved prescient, and the piece captured a moment when cell screening platforms were advancing. Limited long-term importance.
