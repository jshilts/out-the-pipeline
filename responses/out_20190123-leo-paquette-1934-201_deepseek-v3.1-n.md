# Leo Paquette, 1934-2019 (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This obituary article commemorates Leo Paquette, a prominent synthetic organic chemist from Ohio State University who died at age 84 after years of illness from Parkinson's disease. Paquette authored over a thousand publications and made significant contributions across natural product synthesis, synthetic methods development, and mechanistic studies.

The article particularly highlights Paquette's most famous achievement: the first total synthesis of dodecahedrane, a molecule representing the dodecahedron—the last of the Platonic solids. This multi-year effort combined photochemistry and brute-force dehydrogenation to produce just 1.5 milligrams of a compound that had never existed before. The molecule exhibits extraordinary symmetry (single NMR peaks for protons and carbons) and remarkable thermal stability (melting point ~430°C) despite having no functional groups.

The synthesis was celebrated as demonstrating the "arts of organic synthesis" applied to a molecule with no practical application, driven purely by aesthetic and intellectual challenge. A second synthesis by Horst Prinzbach followed years later using a completely different route. The article also addresses uncomfortable truths: Paquette's reputation for being a demanding supervisor and, more seriously, two instances of plagiarism in the 1990s involving NIH and NSF grant proposals, including falsified evidence during investigations. These misconduct cases cost him federal funding and damaged his reputation, casting a shadow over his later career at Ohio State.

## 2. HISTORY

Following Paquette's death in January 2019, the synthetic chemistry community continued to grapple with his complex legacy. The dual nature of his career—exceptional scientific achievements coupled with serious ethical breaches—served as a case study in how the field remembers and teaches about scientists with flawed personal records.

No major new synthetic routes to dodecahedrane emerged after 2019 that fundamentally changed the landscape. The molecule remains a specialty target rather than a stepping-stone toward practical applications. Material science applications of such Platonic carbon frameworks, while theoretically interesting due to their extreme symmetry and stability, have not translated into commercial or pharmaceutical developments.

The broader field of natural product synthesis has continued evolving since 2019, with advances in catalysis, flow chemistry, and computational prediction methods. However, the philosophical question raised by Paquette's dodecahedrane work—whether purely aesthetic molecular targets justify multi-year synthetic campaigns—remains relevant. Modern funding environments increasingly prioritize molecules with therapeutic potential or materials applications, making purely curiosity-driven synthesis more challenging to support.

The misconduct aspects of Paquette's career became part of ongoing discussions about research ethics in chemistry, particularly as the field confronts replication crises and加强了 oversight mechanisms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"No one is going to make it [dodecahedrane] again unless they come up with some sort of three-step route that looks like a magician's trick"**: **CORRECT IN PRACTICE** - No revolutionary new synthetic routes to dodecahedrane have emerged that fundamentally changed the synthesis landscape. The molecule remains a challenging target requiring complex, multi-step approaches. To my knowledge, no dramatically simplified synthesis has been reported, and the molecule remains a niche curiosity rather than a practical synthetic target.

• **Funding Difficulty Prediction**: **CORRECT** - The article correctly anticipated that securing funding for purely aesthetic synthetic targets would become increasingly difficult. Modern research funding has indeed moved toward therapeutic targets, materials with applications, and commercially viable molecules, making curiosity-driven synthesis harder to justify economically.

• **Implicit Prediction - Dodecahedrane's Practical Applications**: **CORRECT (NEGATIVE)** - The article implicitly suggested the molecule would remain without practical use, and this has proven accurate. No significant pharmaceutical, materials science, or industrial applications have emerged for dodecahedrane to my knowledge.

• **Prediction about Paquette's Legacy**: **ACCURATE** - The article's closing prediction about how Paquette would be remembered—with dodecahedrane as his most visible monument while ethical issues might fade from general awareness—appears consistent with how his career is discussed in synthetic chemistry circles today.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article sits in the middle range of interest—it chronicles a significant scientific achievement and addresses important questions about research ethics and legacy, but focuses on a niche area of chemistry without broader practical implications. The synthesis of dodecahedrane represents a pinnacle of purely curiosity-driven research, and the ethical questions raised by Paquette's misconduct cases resonate beyond chemistry. However, the molecule's lack of subsequent practical development and the specialized nature of the discussion limit broader impact.
