## 1. SUMMARY
This is a barbecue recipe article published on the Fourth of July featuring two main components: a brined grilled pork tenderloin and a sour onion salsa. The pork tenderloin recipe uses a brine composed of salt, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, water, star anise, black peppercorns, and bay leaves, with the meat marinated for several hours or overnight before grilling. The sour onion salsa consists of grilled red onion wedges marinated in lime juice, orange juice, and salt. The article emphasizes practical cooking tips, including warnings about salt density variations between different brands (noting the significant difference between Morton's and Diamond Crystal kosher salts), and acknowledges that grilling involves subjective judgment rather than precise scientific measurements.
