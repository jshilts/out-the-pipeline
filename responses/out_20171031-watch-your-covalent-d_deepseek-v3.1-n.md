# Watch Your Covalent Drugs Carefully (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a chemical proteomics study from the Cravatt lab at Scripps (in collaboration with Pfizer) that examined the off-target profiles of third-generation covalent EGFR inhibitors. The research focused on three compounds: osimertinib (Tagrisso, approved by FDA in 2015), rociletinib (recently discontinued by Clovis), and PF-06747775 (in clinical trials).

The key finding was that despite all three inhibitors sharing the same unsubstituted acrylamide reactive group and being engineered for similar EGFR mutant selectivity, they exhibited dramatically different proteome-wide reactivity profiles when tested in living human cancer cells. Most notably, osimertinib showed high reactivity with multiple cathepsins due to lysosomal accumulation—off-target interactions that were completely missed in standard in vitro assays. This highlighted the critical importance of studying covalent drug action directly in living systems rather than relying solely on traditional biochemical assays, as cellular compartmentalization and context-dependent factors significantly influence where and how covalent warheads react with protein targets.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's findings proved prescient and aligned with the subsequent trajectory of covalent drug development and the specific drugs discussed:

**Osimertinib (Tagrisso):** Became one of the most successful oncology drugs, receiving multiple FDA approvals beyond the initial T790M indication, including first-line treatment for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. It achieved blockbuster status with peak sales exceeding $5 billion annually. The off-target effects noted in this study did not prevent its clinical success, though they contributed to understanding its safety profile.

**Rociletinib:** Development was indeed terminated as mentioned, with Clovis announcing discontinuation in 2016. The drug failed to gain FDA approval after complete response data showed insufficient efficacy and concerning side effects including hyperglycemia.

**PF-06747775:** Continued in development but ultimately did not reach market approval.

**Scientific Impact:** This research catalyzed increased attention to chemical proteomics in drug development. Covalent drug discovery evolved to more routinely incorporate cell-based proteomic profiling. The methodology described (using alkyne reporter tags for target identification) became more widely adopted in pharmaceutical R&D.

The clinical significance was that while osimertinib succeeded commercially, the broader lesson about context-dependent covalent reactivity resonated throughout drug discovery, leading to increased screening in physiologically relevant conditions rather than solely in vitro biochemical assays.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about drug development and scientific practices:

• **Prediction: Covalent drugs would require more sophisticated cell-based proteomic profiling to fully understand their effects**
  - **Outcome:** This prediction was validated. Chemical proteomics and activity-based protein profiling became more integrated into drug discovery workflows, particularly for covalent compounds.

• **Prediction: Osimertinib's off-target effects might have clinical implications**
  - **Outcome:** Osimertinib achieved clinical success despite these off-targets, suggesting they weren't critically limiting, but the broader principle that cellular context matters proved foundational.

• **Prediction: The different proteome-wide fingerprints of similar covalent warheads highlighted the need for individualized profiling**
  - **Outcome:** This became standard practice. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly recognize that even closely related covalent inhibitors need independent biological characterization.

• **Prediction: Lysosomal accumulation effects would be important for kinase inhibitor development**
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed. Lysosomal trapping and subcellular distribution became recognized as critical parameters in kinase inhibitor design, affecting both pharmacology and toxicity.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlighted an important gap between in vitro and in vivo drug behavior that has had lasting impact on pharmaceutical research practices, though the specific drugs under study had mixed clinical fates.
