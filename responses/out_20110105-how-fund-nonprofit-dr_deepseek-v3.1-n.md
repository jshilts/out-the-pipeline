# How to Fund a Nonprofit Drug Company - And Others? (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a reader-proposed business idea for a nonprofit drug company that would accept public contributions to fund specific drug candidates. Contributors would vote with their dollars on which drugs to advance, while paid staff would curate a wiki providing expert information to guide these decisions. The author acknowledges some merit in this crowdfunding approach but raises major concerns about drug development failure rates: approximately 90% of compounds entering clinical trials never reach market. The author presents a hierarchy of drug development risk levels, from highest risk (single compound, defined mechanism) to lower risk (diversified portfolio across therapeutic areas), noting this progression mirrors the evolution from startup to fully integrated pharmaceutical company. Key challenges identified include the high likelihood of disappointing donors when most funded drugs fail, the difficulty of objectively comparing drug candidates even for experienced companies, and the fundamental tension between charitable donation psychology (where failure feels wasteful) versus investment psychology (where failure is expected). The author suggests an alternative approach: selling shares in individual clinical candidates with profit-sharing if successful.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated the article's core concerns while also revealing new crowdfunding models that adapted to these realities:

**Nonprofit Drug Development Organizations**: The concept gained traction primarily through organizations like the **Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's venture philanthropy model** (which predated this article but evolved further), **Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi)**, and later **UNITAID's** pooled funding mechanisms. However, these successful models typically didn't follow the specific "vote with dollars for individual compounds" approach; instead, they funded portfolios, research platforms, or provided venture philanthropy with professional portfolio management. DNDi, founded in 2003, has brought multiple treatments to market for neglected diseases by 2024, demonstrating nonprofit drug development viability when properly structured.

**Crowdfunding Evolution**: Direct pharmaceutical crowdfunding largely failed to materialize as envisioned in the article. When platforms like **Experiment.com** (launched 2012) and **Consano** (2013) attempted science/research crowdfunding, they focused on early-stage academic research rather than drug development pipelines. The 90% clinical failure rate proved too high for donor psychology - platforms that did emerge typically funded research tools, academic studies, or rare disease foundations rather than specific drug candidates.

**FDA and Regulatory Context**: Between 2011-2024, FDA approved 500+ new drugs, but the industry's structure remained dominated by traditional pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups backed by venture capital. Breakthrough Therapy designation (created 2012) and accelerated approval pathways somewhat improved success rates for promising candidates, but fundamental failure rates remained in the 80-90% range for novel mechanisms.

**Specific Mechanism Validation**: The author's risk hierarchy was borne out. Companies pursuing single compounds with defined mechanisms continued experiencing high failure rates, while diversified companies like **Vertex** (which survived early cystic fibrosis drug failures to achieve major success with ivacaftor and subsequent CFTR modulators) demonstrated the value of having multiple shots on goal within a mechanism class. The rise of platform companies like **Moderna** and **BioNTech** showed the value of broad platform capabilities that could pivot across multiple targets.

**Public Policy**: The **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** and **Right to Try (2018)** reflected continued tensions around access to unapproved drugs, but didn't fundamentally alter the nonprofit drug development landscape.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Contributors would be enraged by drug failure rates"**: This proved accurate. Crowdfunding platforms that emerged generally avoided direct funding of individual drug candidates, recognizing this psychological barrier. The few attempts at patient-funded drug development typically evolved into foundation models with pooled funding and professional management.

• **"Poor odds of single compounds"**: Validated by continued industry performance. The article's hierarchy (single compound > class > multiple series > portfolios) reflected real risk diversification that successful organizations implemented.

• **"Wiki/community assessment would be challenging"**: Confirmed. Even sophisticated companies continued struggling with portfolio management. Community-driven platforms never successfully scaled to drug development decisions, though some rare disease foundations developed sophisticated patient-community input mechanisms for research prioritization.

• **"Profit-sharing shares in candidates might work"**: Partially realized through mechanisms like **Bioverativ's** spin-out from Sanofi (though not exactly this model), and various biotech venture structures. However, the "accounting mess" concern proved significant - orphan drug legislation, reimbursement complexities, and biosimilar competition complicated simple profit-sharing models.

• **"90% failure rate for clinical candidates"**: This remained broadly accurate. While success rates varied by therapeutic area (oncology ~5-10%, rare diseases 15-25%), the fundamental risk structure remained.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article deserves recognition for accurately anticipating the core challenges of nonprofit drug development while proposing thoughtful risk stratification. Its insights about donor psychology and risk diversification proved prescient, though the specific crowdfunding model it analyzed never materialized as envisioned. The piece captured important tensions between charitable and investment mentalities that continue shaping biopharma funding models.
