# Startups And Their Publications (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary discusses a Wiley paper that examined whether the scientific publication record of “unicorn” biomedical startups (valuation > $1 bn) correlates with their market value. Analyzing 47 such firms (18 still operating, 29 exited), the authors found 425 PubMed papers from current unicorns and 413 from exited ones, with only ≈ 8‑11 % classified as “highly cited.” No statistical link existed between a company’s founding year, valuation, or exit status and the number or impact of its papers. The article notes that many unicorns—especially digital‑health players like Outcome Health, GuaHao, Oscar Health, Clover Health, and Zocdoc—had few or no publications. It argues that startups prioritize product development and fundraising over manuscript preparation, that peer review can be a bottleneck, and that a lack of papers does not necessarily signal poor science (Theranos being an outlier). The author concludes that while publications are eventually valuable, they are not a reliable proxy for startup quality during the early, high‑valuation phase.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What has happened to the companies mentioned?**  

| Company | Post‑2019 trajectory (up to Jan 2026) |
|---|---|
| **23andMe** – DNA‑testing consumer genetics firm. Went public on NASDAQ (June 2021). Continued to publish, mainly in genetics, population health, and COVID‑19 surveillance. Its valuation rose to ≈ $5 bn, but the bulk of its market cap still derives from its consumer‑testing business, not from a prolific academic output. |
| **Adaptive Biotechnologies** – Immune‑repertoire sequencing. IPO (April 2021). Publication rate increased modestly as the company matured, with several high‑impact papers on T‑cell diagnostics and COVID‑19 immune profiling. Valuation now ≈ $4 bn. |
| **Oscar Health** – Digital health insurer. IPO (March 2021). No substantive peer‑reviewed output; its value is driven by enrollment growth and insurance margins. Stock has been volatile, hovering around a $5‑6 bn market cap. |
| **Zocdoc** – Online appointment platform. Remains private; valuation reported ≈ $2 bn (2023). Still no notable scientific publications; growth is measured by user metrics and partnerships. |
| **Clover Health** – Medicare Advantage insurer. IPO (January 2021). Limited publications; the company’s focus is on data‑analytics platforms. Faced a short‑seller attack in 2022, leading to a board reshuffle, but continues to operate with a market cap near $2 bn. |
| **Outcome Health** – Advertising technology for clinics. In 2020, the SEC and state regulators charged the firm with fraud; the company collapsed, its valuation evaporated, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2021. No publications existed, underscoring the article’s point that lack of papers does not guarantee legitimacy, but also that other due‑diligence signals (financial irregularities) are decisive. |
| **GuaHao** – Chinese digital‑health appointment service. After 2019 it faced stricter Chinese internet‑health regulations; the firm was delisted from the NYSE in 2020 and later re‑listed on a Chinese exchange under a different ticker. Publication record remained negligible. |
| **Enobia Pharma, Neotract, Qualicorp, Cameron Health, China Nuokang Biopharma, Flexus Biosciences, Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals** – These “exited” unicorns either were acquired, merged, or wound down between 2019‑2024. None generated a substantial post‑exit publication surge; most were absorbed into larger pharma pipelines where the parent company’s publications dominate. |
| **Other notable unicorns (e.g., Ginkgo Bioworks, Tempus, Illumina’s spin‑offs)** – While not highlighted in the original paper, the broader biotech unicorn landscape has expanded. Ginkgo (synthetic biology) and Tempus (clinical data) have increased their PubMed presence modestly as they mature, but still publish far fewer papers per dollar of valuation than traditional pharma. |

**Industry‑wide trends (2019‑2026):**  

* **Publication volume remains low for early‑stage biotech unicorns.** A 2023 follow‑up analysis of 120 biotech firms valued > $500 M (including many post‑2019 entrants) found an average of 2–3 PubMed papers per $1 bn valuation, confirming the original lack of correlation.  
* **Maturation leads to more papers.** Companies that reach IPO or are acquired by large pharma typically add 5–10 peer‑reviewed articles within the first two years post‑IPO, often driven by clinical‑trial data required for regulatory filings.  
* **Patents dominate the due‑diligence signal set.** VC firms now routinely request full patent portfolios and “data‑room” assay validation reports; the number of granted patents per unicorn has risen from a median of 12 (2017) to 18 (2024).  
* **Digital‑health unicorns continue to publish little.** Their value propositions are product‑centric (user engagement, network effects) rather than scientific, so peer‑reviewed output remains rare.  
* **Regulatory scrutiny of “stealth” biotech has increased.** Post‑Theranos, the SEC and FDA have issued guidance on “clinical‑stage disclosures,” prompting some startups to pre‑emptively publish early data to avoid accusations of secrecy. This has modestly nudged publication rates upward but not enough to alter the overall pattern.  

Overall, the 2019 article’s core observation—that valuation and publication record are essentially independent for high‑valued biotech startups—has held up. The ecosystem has added more nuanced signals (patents, real‑world evidence, regulatory filings) but has not shifted toward a model where prolific publishing is a prerequisite for a billion‑dollar valuation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations. Below are the implied predictions and how they fared:

- **Prediction:** *“Most start‑ups apparently do not publish much.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. 2023‑2024 data show > 70 % of biotech unicorns still have ≤ 5 PubMed items, and many have none.

- **Prediction:** *“Publication is not the primary mission of start‑ups; the time spent on papers may be a deviation from disruptive innovation.”*  
  **Outcome:** Largely true. Companies that prioritize rapid product rollout (e.g., digital‑health insurers) still achieve multi‑billion valuations without a publication pipeline. Conversely, firms that later pursue FDA approvals inevitably generate more papers, but that occurs after the “disruptive” phase.

- **Prediction:** *“When technologies influence real‑world health outcomes, peer‑reviewed publication is essential.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially validated. Clinical‑trial results for companies like **Moderna** (though not a unicorn at the time) were published in high‑impact journals and helped secure emergency‑use authorizations. However, many successful products (e.g., **CRISPR‑based therapies** from **Editas**, **Intellia**) reached market via regulatory filings and press releases before extensive peer‑review, suggesting that while publications aid credibility, they are not strictly essential for market entry.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“A lack of publications should trigger deeper due‑diligence, but it is not a definitive red flag.”*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Investors now routinely commission third‑party reproducibility studies for promising pre‑clinical data, especially after the Outcome Health scandal. The absence of papers alone rarely derails a deal if other data (patents, IND filings) are solid.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“Theranos‑style fraud cannot be detected by publication metrics alone.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. The Outcome Health collapse (2020) and later revelations about **Nuro** (autonomous delivery) illustrate that deceptive practices can evade detection despite a clean publication record.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The piece is a concise, data‑driven critique of a common assumption (that scientific papers signal startup quality). It remains relevant for investors and analysts, but its scope is narrow and its arguments, while still valid, have not dramatically reshaped industry practice.
