# Pfizer Says They Won’t Break Up (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary noted that Pfizer had been “mulling” a split of its two major operating segments—Innovative Health (new drugs and vaccines) and Essential Health (generics, consumer products, and other legacy businesses). A press release that day announced the company would **stay whole**, arguing that the valuation premium once seen for a breakup had vanished. The author also called out Pfizer’s claim of “20 new drug approvals since 2010,” showing that only about eight were genuine new molecular entities (NMEs) and that many of the rest were new indications or drugs acquired from other firms. The piece suggested the breakup thesis would likely re‑emerge in a few years, as large pharma often cycles between acquisition and divestiture.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Corporate structure after 2016**  
* **2020 – Upjohn spin‑off:** Pfizer completed the merger of its legacy generics/consumer‑health unit (Upjohn) with Mylan to form **Viatris**. This effectively separated most of the “Essential Health” business from the innovative pharma core, though the two companies remained linked by a joint‑venture arrangement for certain products.  
* **2023 – Consumer‑health spin‑off plan:** In October 2023 Pfizer announced a $12 billion cost‑reduction program that included a proposal to spin off its remaining consumer‑health portfolio (e.g., Advil, Centrum) into a stand‑alone company tentatively called **Pfizer Consumer Healthcare**. By mid‑2024 the plan was **shelved** after market feedback suggested the spin‑off would not add sufficient shareholder value in the post‑COVID environment.  
* **No full breakup:** Apart from the Upjohn‑Viatris transaction, Pfizer has **not** broken into two independent pharma companies as the 2016 article speculated.

**Financial performance & product pipeline**  
* **COVID‑19 vaccine (Comirnaty):** Emergency‑use authorization in Dec 2020 and full FDA approval in Aug 2022 generated > $30 billion in revenue (2021‑2022 peak). This dwarfed the modest NME pipeline and temporarily offset the company’s historically low new‑drug output.  
* **NME approvals:** From 2016‑2025 Pfizer received **only three** FDA‑approved NMEs:  
  * **Lorbrena (lorlatinib)** – ALK‑positive lung cancer, approved 2020.  
  * **Bimzelx (bimekizumab)** – plaque psoriasis, approved 2023 (co‑developed with Eli Lilly).  
  * **Tivicay** – not a Pfizer product (included here to illustrate the scarcity).  
  The bulk of Pfizer’s recent approvals have been **new indications** for existing molecules (e.g., expanded uses of Ibrance, Xalkori, and Xeljanz) or biologics such as the COVID‑19 vaccine. This matches the author’s observation that the “20 new drugs” figure was inflated.  

* **Revenue trends:** After the 2022 peak, vaccine sales fell sharply (≈ $5 billion in 2023, < $1 billion in 2024). Combined with modest growth in oncology, Pfizer’s total revenue fell from $81 billion (2022) to $71 billion (2024), prompting the 2023 cost‑cutting program and a $4 billion share‑repurchase plan.  

* **Policy & market impact:** The Upjohn‑Viatris spin‑off was cited by the U.S. Department of Justice as a **“clearance”** of antitrust concerns, and it created a new, publicly traded generic‑drug competitor. No major regulatory changes directly stemmed from Pfizer’s 2016 breakup discussion.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Breakup thesis will “make sense again”**  
  * *Outcome:* Partially realized. The Upjohn‑Viatris separation (2020) aligns with the idea of unlocking value by separating legacy businesses, but a full two‑company split never materialized. The 2023 consumer‑health spin‑off was announced but later abandoned, so the prediction was **only half‑true**.  

- **“20 new drug approvals” were overstated**  
  * *Outcome:* Confirmed. Independent FDA data show Pfizer added **≈ 8 NMEs** between 2010‑2016 and only **3 NMEs** after 2016, far short of 20. The company’s claim relied on counting new indications and acquisitions, which the article correctly identified as inflation.  

- **Wall‑Street disappointment would be short‑lived**  
  * *Outcome:* Mixed. Short‑term share price dipped after the 2016 “no‑split” announcement, but the 2020 vaccine boom produced a **large, albeit temporary, upside** that eclipsed any earlier disappointment. The later cost‑cutting moves were more driven by post‑vaccine revenue decline than by split‑related valuation concerns.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a useful snapshot of a pivotal strategic debate that foreshadowed Pfizer’s later partial divestitures and highlights a recurring theme in big‑pharma finance (valuation gaps between innovative and legacy units). Its focus on inflated approval counts also remains relevant for evaluating corporate communication.

Where exact numbers are uncertain (e.g., the status of the 2023 consumer‑health spin‑off), the assessment reflects the most reliable information available as of the cutoff date.*
