# ABT-199 Clinical Trial Suspended (Updated)

## 1. SUMMARY

This February 2013 blog post reported that AbbVie had suspended enrollment in Phase 1 trials for ABT-199, a selective Bcl-2-targeted oncology drug being developed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The suspension followed a patient death from tumor lysis syndrome—a potentially fatal condition caused by cancer cells breaking down too rapidly, releasing dangerous levels of potassium, calcium, and uric acid into the bloodstream.

The article noted that ABT-199 represented an advance over earlier Bcl-2 inhibitors like navitoclax (ABT-263) because it appeared to spare platelet function while maintaining anticancer activity. The author speculated that the trial suspension would cause delays while AbbVie developed better dosing protocols with enhanced patient monitoring. An update included a company statement clarifying that while new patient enrollment was suspended, dosing of existing trial participants was continuing, and AbbVie expected to resume full trials and initiate Phase 3 studies in 2013 as planned.

## 2. HISTORY

The ABT-199 suspension in 2013 proved to be a temporary setback. AbbVie quickly developed improved dosing protocols featuring gradual dose escalation (starting with very low doses) and enhanced tumor lysis syndrome monitoring and prevention measures, including hydration protocols and prophylactic medications. The company resumed enrollment shortly after the suspension.

By 2015-2016, ABT-199 (generic name venetoclax) demonstrated strong clinical efficacy. The pivotal Phase 1b trial in relapsed/refractory CLL showed an overall response rate around 79%, including complete responses in 20% of patients. This led to accelerated FDA approval in April 2016 for CLL patients with 17p deletion who had received at least one prior therapy. The approval was based on durable response rates, as overall survival data was not yet mature.

Subsequent developments significantly expanded venetoclax's clinical impact. In 2018, the FDA approved venetoclax in combination with rituximab for relapsed/refractory CLL based on the MURANO trial, which demonstrated improved progression-free survival compared to bendamustine plus rituximab. The drug also received approvals for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine, showing efficacy in older patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy.

The therapeutic landscape for CLL underwent substantial transformation. Venetoclax-based regimens became standard options across multiple lines of therapy for CLL and AML, with clinical guidelines incorporating these combinations into treatment algorithms. The drug generated substantial commercial success, with peak annual sales exceeding $2 billion, validating the Bcl-2 inhibition strategy despite the early safety concerns.

The incident highlighted the biopharmaceutical industry's ability to navigate serious adverse events through careful protocol modifications while advancing promising agents to market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions that largely aligned with subsequent developments:

• **Prediction: "they'll be able to restart testing, but that they'll be creeping up on the dosages, with a lot of blood monitoring along the way"**
  - **Reality: Correct.** AbbVie implemented stepwise dose ramp-up protocols starting with very low doses (e.g., 20 mg) and gradually escalating to target doses over several weeks, combined with intensive laboratory monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome markers. This approach became standard in venetoclax clinical trials and clinical practice.

• **Prediction: "ABT-199 looks too promising to abandon, and after all, we're talking about a fatal disease"**
  - **Reality: Correct.** The drug proceeded through clinical development, received FDA approval in 2016, and became an important treatment option for CLL and AML patients.

• **Prediction: "this is going to slow things down, for sure"**
  - **Reality: Partially correct.** While there was a brief suspension and need for protocol revisions, the overall timeline appears to have been maintained reasonably well, with AbbVie initiating Phase 3 trials in 2013 as planned and achieving FDA approval within three years of the incident.

• **Company prediction: "we will be able to initiate Phase 3 trials in 2013, as planned"**
  - **Reality: Correct.** Phase 3 development proceeded as indicated, leading to successful regulatory approval and market launch.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a critical moment in the development of what would become a breakthrough cancer therapy, illustrating how careful toxicity management can salvage promising drugs from serious safety setbacks. The incident and its resolution became an instructive case study in oncology drug development and risk mitigation strategies.
