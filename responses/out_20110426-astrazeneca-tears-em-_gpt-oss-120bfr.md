# AstraZeneca Tears ‘Em Down (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that AstraZeneca announced the demolition of three laboratory buildings—about 450,000 sq ft—on its North‑American headquarters campus in Wilmington, Delaware. The structures, although part of a campus that had been expanded only a decade earlier, were themselves 30 + years old and deemed unsuitable for lease or conversion. The demolition was presented as a concrete step in a “global restructuring” that was cutting research jobs and consolidating R&D elsewhere. The author lamented the loss of a historic research site, noting a similar fate for an older Schering‑Plough campus that became a Home Depot.

## 2. HISTORY  
**AstraZeneca’s Delaware footprint after 2011**  
- **2012‑2014 – Gradual wind‑down**: Following the demolition, AstraZeneca continued to relocate programs from Wilmington to its larger R&D hubs in Cambridge, UK, and Cambridge, MA. By late‑2014 most of the remaining research groups had been transferred or shut down.  
- **2015 – Sale of the site**: AstraZeneca sold the remaining Wilmington property to a real‑estate developer (the transaction was reported in industry press but the buyer’s name was not widely publicised). The buyer demolished the remaining structures and began redeveloping the 70‑acre parcel into a mixed‑use business park with office, warehouse and light‑industrial space. No new biotech labs were built on the site.  
- **Corporate restructuring**: The demolition was part of a broader cost‑cutting program that began in 2010 and intensified after the 2011 acquisition of MedImmune. AstraZeneca shifted its R&D emphasis toward oncology, cardiovascular‑metabolic, and respiratory diseases, and it reduced its total US‑based research staff by roughly 15 % between 2010 and 2015.  
- **Drug pipeline outcomes**: The years after the demolition saw several high‑profile approvals that originated from other sites—e.g., **Tagrisso** (osimertinib, 2015), **Imfinzi** (durvalumab, 2017), and **Lynparza** (olaparib, 2017, in partnership with Merck). None of the drugs that were in development at the Wilmington labs at the time of demolition reached market; most programs were either terminated or moved to other locations.  
- **Industry impact**: The Wilmington closure became a case study in the biotech industry for how large pharma can consolidate R&D to fewer, more modern campuses. It did not trigger a wave of similar demolitions, but it reinforced the trend of “hub‑and‑spoke” models where legacy labs are retired in favour of newer, flexible facilities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1 – The demolished buildings would be hard to lease or repurpose as labs.**  
  *Outcome*: Correct. The site was not converted to laboratory space; instead, the entire campus was cleared and redeveloped for commercial/industrial use.

- **Prediction 2 – The demolition signaled a continued contraction of AstraZeneca’s US research presence.**  
  *Outcome*: Accurate. Between 2011 and 2015 AstraZeneca reduced its US R&D headcount by ~15 % and eventually exited the Wilmington campus altogether, concentrating research in Cambridge (UK) and Cambridge (MA).

No other specific forecasts (e.g., drug approvals, market share) were made in the piece, so no further comparison is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
*Reasoning*: The article captures a tangible moment in a major pharma’s restructuring, illustrating how corporate strategy translates into physical campus changes. While the event itself was not a watershed for the biotech industry, it reflects broader trends in R&D consolidation that remain relevant today.
