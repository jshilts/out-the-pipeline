# Epigenetics For the Spirit (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
Siddhartha Mukherjee’s New Yorker piece on epigenetics sparked a backlash from practicing molecular biologists.  The article used the story of Mukherjee’s mother and her identical twin to illustrate how “environmental” factors might leave lasting marks on the genome, suggesting that epigenetic marks such as histone methylation could act as a heritable “alternate code.”  Critics (e.g., Mark Ptashne, Michael Eisen) argued that Mukherjee omitted the central role of transcription factors, overstated the evidence for true trans‑generational inheritance, and presented a simplified, almost Lamarckian view of evolution.  From a drug‑discovery angle, Mukherjee (and his biotech venture) highlighted epigenetic enzymes as attractive targets because they are druggable enzymes, even though the downstream consequences of modulating them remain incompletely understood.  The article also reflected a broader cultural fascination with epigenetics as a counter‑narrative to genetic determinism.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Scientific progress (2016‑2025)**  
* **Therapeutic approvals** – The FDA approved several new epigenetic drugs after 2016, most notably tazemetostat (EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitor) for epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma (2020) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat for peripheral T‑cell lymphoma (2014, but its use expanded).  These approvals confirmed that targeting chromatin‑modifying enzymes can be clinically effective, especially in cancers with defined epigenetic driver mutations.  

* **Clinical pipelines** – Companies such as Epizyme, Constellation Pharma, and GSK have advanced dozens of epigenetic‑focused programs (BET bromodomain inhibitors, lysine‑specific demethylase inhibitors, DNA‑methyltransferase inhibitors).  While many early‑phase trials have shown modest activity, only a handful have progressed to registration‑level studies.  The overall success rate remains lower than for conventional kinase inhibitors.  

* **Trans‑generational inheritance** – Rigorous mammalian studies have continued to show that most epigenetic marks are erased during germ‑cell reprogramming.  A few rodent experiments (e.g., paternal diet affecting offspring metabolism via sperm‑bound small RNAs) have been replicated, but no convincing, reproducible human examples of true epigenetic inheritance have emerged.  The consensus in 2024 is that epigenetic transmission across generations in humans, if it occurs, is rare and highly context‑dependent.  

* **Histone‑code concept** – The idea that specific combinations of histone modifications constitute a “code” that is read by dedicated effector proteins remains useful as a heuristic, but large‑scale proteomic and genomic data have revealed extensive cross‑talk and redundancy.  The field has shifted toward viewing chromatin as a dynamic, integrated regulatory landscape rather than a strict combinatorial code.  

* **Epigenome‑editing tools** – CRISPR‑based epigenetic editors (dCas9‑fused acetyltransferases, demethylases, etc.) have become standard research tools, enabling locus‑specific modulation of gene expression in cell culture and animal models.  Therapeutic delivery, however, is still in pre‑clinical stages; no epigenome‑editing therapy has entered human trials as of late 2025.  

* **Policy and public perception** – The initial media hype around “epigenetic inheritance” has largely subsided in mainstream coverage.  Scientific societies (e.g., ASHG, AACR) have issued position statements emphasizing the distinction between epigenetic regulation within a lifetime and speculative trans‑generational effects.  No major regulatory changes specific to epigenetics have been enacted; existing drug‑approval pathways apply.  

**Business outcomes**  
* Epizyme’s tazemetostat generated > $300 M in global sales by 2024, validating the commercial potential of epigenetic oncology drugs.  
* Several biotech startups focused on epigenetic readers (BET inhibitors) have either been acquired (e.g., Celgene’s purchase of Constellation’s BET program) or have shuttered after disappointing Phase II results, reflecting a mixed commercial track record.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in or implied by the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Epigenetic marks could act as a heritable “alternate code” passed across generations, overturning classic Darwinian views.** | Human studies have not confirmed robust trans‑generational epigenetic inheritance; the prevailing view is that germ‑line reprogramming erases most marks. The idea remains speculative and is not considered a paradigm shift in evolutionary biology. |
| **Targeting epigenetic enzymes will provide a “handle” for drug discovery because enzymes are easier to inhibit than transcription factors.** | True for a subset of diseases, especially certain cancers. FDA approvals of EZH2 and HDAC inhibitors demonstrate clinical viability, but many epigenetic targets have failed to show efficacy or have unacceptable toxicity, indicating the promise is limited and context‑dependent. |
| **The “histone code” will be widely adopted as a concrete explanatory framework for gene regulation.** | The concept is still taught, but the field now emphasizes a more nuanced, network‑centric view of chromatin regulation. The “code” metaphor is used cautiously, acknowledging extensive cross‑talk and redundancy. |
| **Epigenetics will become a dominant narrative in public discourse, replacing genetic determinism.** | Epigenetics remains a popular topic in popular science and media, but the hype has moderated. Public understanding now distinguishes between epigenetic regulation of gene expression and the more sensational claim of inherited “memory.” |
| **Epigenome‑editing will soon yield therapeutic applications.** | As of 2025, epigenome‑editing is a powerful research tool, but no therapeutic products have entered clinical trials; delivery and safety challenges remain unresolved. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when epigenetics entered mainstream conversation and provoked a sharp scientific‑publicity clash; its relevance persists because the ensuing debates shaped both research directions and how the field is communicated.
