# Dr. Das Sues U Conn. Good Luck With That (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a lawsuit filed by Dr. Dipak Das against the University of Connecticut for $35 million, claiming wrongful termination, violation of university by-laws, and lack of due process under the 14th Amendment. This legal action followed earlier allegations of research fraud involving manipulated western blot images in Das's resveratrol research (a compound found in red wine studied for heart attack protection). The article is skeptical of Das's prospects, noting that the university's board of trustees had already unanimously affirmed his dismissal, and that Das had accumulated 19 retractions. The author argues that even if others had access to the office where images were altered, Das bore responsibility as lead author and should have caught the manipulation.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the research misconduct case and its aftermath continued to unfold. Dr. Das ultimately accumulated **28 retractions** according to Retraction Watch, making this one of the larger research fraud cases in biomedical research. The lawsuit against UConn was unsuccessful, and Das remained dismissed from the university. 

In terms of resveratrol research itself, the scientific field moved forward with numerous clinical trials over the following decade, but with largely disappointing results. Major pharmaceutical interest in resveratrol diminished significantly after 2013. Resveratrol has not led to any FDA-approved drugs for heart disease or other indications, despite extensive research investment. GlaxoSmithKline had acquired a resveratrol-related company (Sirtris) in 2008 for $720 million, but the drug development programs largely failed in clinical trials and were eventually discontinued. Today, resveratrol remains available as a dietary supplement, but lacks robust clinical evidence for any specific therapeutic benefit. The research fraud revelations contributed to growing skepticism about the compound's therapeutic potential and highlighted broader concerns about research integrity in the field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The article predicted Das's lawsuit would be "an uphill fight" and likely unsuccessful.
  - **Outcome**: Accurately predicted - Das lost the lawsuit and remained terminated.
  
- **Prediction**: Suggested that image alterations alone would constitute sufficient grounds for dismissal.
  - **Outcome**: Validated - the extensive retractions (eventually 28 papers) confirmed the severity of the misconduct.
  
- **Implied prediction**: The article suggested Das's defense that others had office access was weak because as lead author he bore ultimate responsibility.
  - **Outcome**: The academic and legal outcomes supported this view - shared lab access did not absolve the principal investigator of responsibility.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While this is a significant research misconduct case with ongoing relevance to research integrity issues, the resveratrol field has proven to have limited clinical impact, making the scientific content less transformative than initially hoped. The case serves as an important cautionary tale but does not represent a major scientific breakthrough or fundamental shift in understanding.
