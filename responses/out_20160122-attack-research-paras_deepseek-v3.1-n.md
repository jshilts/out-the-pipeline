# Attack of the Research Parasites (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a controversial editorial published by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that raised concerns about sharing clinical trial data. The NEJM editorial warned about a "new class of research person" who would use others' data without being involved in the original study design—people they characterized as "research parasites." The editorial expressed concerns that such researchers might misuse or misinterpret the data, or even try to disprove the original investigators' findings.

The Science blog post author disagrees fundamentally with this characterization, arguing that this type of data re-analysis and building upon previous work is actually how science advances. While acknowledging that clinical data are genuinely complex and difficult to interpret properly, the author believes the real danger isn't from legitimate scientists reviewing data but from bad actors who might cherry-pick data for commercial purposes or from people who would misinterpret clinical data to support unscientific claims. The author emphasizes that scientific progress depends on researchers building on each other's work.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this controversy, data sharing in clinical research evolved significantly in the direction the author advocated:

**Clinical Trial Data Transparency Movement:** Major funders and journals moved toward mandatory data sharing requirements. NIH began requiring data management and sharing plans for grants, and many journals adopted stricter data availability policies. The AllTrials campaign, launched in 2013, gained significant momentum and by 2023 had been endorsed by over 1,400 organizations worldwide calling for all clinical trials to be registered and results reported.

**NEJM's Own Evolution:** NEJM itself changed its stance considerably. By 2016, they had launched the NEJM Data Sharing Initiative, making clinical trial data available to researchers who submitted proposals. By 2019, they established more systematic data sharing policies, and today they actively collaborate with organizations like the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) Project to facilitate responsible data sharing. The "research parasites" editorial now stands as an historical reference point for how dramatically the culture shifted.

**Regulatory and Policy Changes:** The FDA expanded access to clinical trial data through various initiatives, though debates continued about privacy protections and data format standardization.

**Scientific Impact:** Secondary analyses of clinical trial data did indeed accelerate. Researchers reanalyzing published data uncovered important findings, validated original conclusions, and occasionally identified concerns that weren't apparent in original publications. However, legitimate concerns about data quality interpretation persisted, as the original NEJM editorial had noted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions:

• **That data sharing would increase and fears of "research parasites" would prove unfounded** → This proved correct. Major institutions embraced data sharing policies, and concerns about legitimate researchers misusing data proved less problematic than anticipated.

• **That the real danger was from commercial entities and anti-science groups misinterpreting data** → This prediction was partially accurate. While data misinterpretation by commercial or ideological groups remained a concern, the larger challenge became proper data governance and managing access requests.

• **That clinical data interpretation is genuinely complex and requires expertise** → This remained true and became a central challenge in implementing data sharing. Organizations like YODA developed sophisticated review processes for data access requests to ensure requesters had appropriate expertise.

• **That the scientific community would reject the "research parasites" framing** → This proved overwhelmingly correct. The editorial was widely criticized and became a catalyst for discussion that ultimately advanced data sharing norms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when established medical publishing norms around data hoarding came into conflict with emerging open science principles. The "research parasites" controversy became a watershed moment that clarified values and accelerated momentum toward data sharing in clinical research.
