# An Old Problem at Verily (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The STAT piece described a wave of departures from Verily (then “Google Life Sciences”) and blamed the turmoil largely on CEO Andrew Conrad.  Former staff said Conrad repeatedly over‑promised what Verily could deliver, launched large‑scale projects on a whim, and re‑allocated resources to newer “hot” ideas, creating unrealistic deadlines and a high‑pressure work environment.  The article noted that Verily was a secretive operation working on a broad portfolio—including real‑time diagnostics, robotic surgery, and a nanoparticle‑based blood test—but gave few concrete details about any of those programs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Leadership changes** – Conrad remained CEO until early 2022, when Alphabet announced he would step down.  He was succeeded by Stephen Gillett (former Starbucks and Microsoft executive).  In 2023 Verily appointed a new head of life‑sciences operations, Dr. Sanjay Sood, reflecting a shift toward more conventional corporate governance.

**Major programs**  

| Program | What happened (2016‑2025) |
|---|---|
| **Verb Surgical (joint venture with Johnson & Johnson)** | Launched 2019 with the goal of a next‑generation surgical robot.  By late 2022 J&J announced it would discontinue the venture; Verily withdrew and the project was effectively shelved. |
| **Smart contact lens (Google/Verily‑Alcon collaboration)** | Early‑stage prototypes were demonstrated in 2016‑2017 for continuous glucose monitoring.  In 2018 the partnership was ended and the lens never reached FDA clearance or commercial launch. |
| **Nanoparticle‑based blood test for early cancer detection** | Verily continued research under the “Project Baseline” umbrella, but no FDA‑cleared test emerged by 2025.  The work contributed data to academic publications but did not become a marketed diagnostic. |
| **Study Watch & health‑monitoring wearables** | The Study Watch received FDA clearance (2020) for ECG and heart‑rate monitoring and has been used in dozens of clinical trials, but it has not become a consumer‑grade product. |
| **Onduo (digital diabetes platform, partnership with Sanofi)** | Launched 2018 as a joint venture to provide remote monitoring and coaching for type‑2 diabetes.  In 2022 Verily sold its stake to Optum (UnitedHealth Group); the platform continues under Optum’s ownership. |
| **Baseline Study (large longitudinal health cohort)** | Ongoing as of 2025, with >100 000 participants.  The dataset is being used by academic and industry researchers, but no direct therapeutic product has yet been derived. |
| **Regulatory approvals** | Verily has not produced any FDA‑approved drugs.  Its FDA‑cleared devices are limited to the Study Watch and a few sensor modules used in partner‑led trials. |

**Business performance** – Verily’s revenue remains a small fraction of Alphabet’s overall earnings; the unit is still classified as “Other Bets.”  Alphabet’s quarterly reports (2020‑2024) list Verily’s contribution as “negative to marginal,” indicating that most projects are still in R&D or partnership‑revenue phases rather than profit‑generating products.

**Culture** – The exodus described in 2016 slowed after the leadership transition in 2022.  Employee‑review sites (Glassdoor, Blind) from 2022‑2024 show a mixed picture: many cite “big‑picture ambition” as a draw, while still noting “rapid pivots” and “resource re‑allocation” as sources of frustration.  No further high‑profile resignations of senior scientists have been publicly reported.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The 2016 article implied several informal forecasts.  Below are the most explicit ones and how they panned out:

- **Prediction:** *Verily would rapidly deliver breakthrough products (e.g., a nanoparticle diagnostic, a commercial smart lens, and a market‑ready surgical robot).*
  - **Outcome:** None of those three products reached the market.  The smart lens and Verb Surgical robot were discontinued; the nanoparticle diagnostic remains in pre‑clinical research.

- **Prediction:** *Andrew Conrad’s management style would cause continued talent loss and hamper progress.*
  - **Outcome:** Talent turnover was high through 2018‑2020, but after Conrad’s departure in 2022 the rate of senior‑level exits declined.  The culture issue appears to have been mitigated, though the “big‑pivot” approach persists.

- **Prediction:** *Verily’s secretive, “moon‑shot” approach would eventually translate into FDA‑approved medical devices.*
  **Outcome:** The only FDA‑cleared Verily device is the Study Watch (2020).  No drug or high‑impact diagnostic has been approved.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Partnerships with big pharma would accelerate product pipelines.*
  **Outcome:** Partnerships (e.g., with Sanofi on Onduo, with J&J on Verb Surgical) produced mixed results—Onduo survived but was sold; Verb Surgical was terminated.  Overall, partnerships have not yet yielded a blockbuster product.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  

*Reasoning:* The article is a useful snapshot of early cultural challenges at a high‑profile Alphabet biotech unit, and the subsequent history shows how those challenges influenced product outcomes.  However, the piece contains little technical detail and the predictions largely proved overly optimistic, limiting its long‑term scientific significance.
