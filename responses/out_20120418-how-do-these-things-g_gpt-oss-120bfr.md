# How Do These Things Get Published? (Apr 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In this 2012 commentary, Derek Lowe harshly critiques a **Journal of Medicinal Chemistry** article that reported fragment‑based discovery of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors. The original paper screened a very small, poorly described fragment set, identified weak millimolar hits, and then “linked” them into large dimeric molecules that only modestly improved potency to the low‑micromolar range. Lowe points out that the ligand‑efficiency dropped dramatically, that the docking models were labeled “poorly optimized,” and that the X‑ray data were essentially uninterpretable. He concludes that the work represents one of the weakest papers the journal has published in recent years and questions how it passed peer review. A follow‑up post (later in 2012) includes comments from the paper’s lead author and a reviewer, clarifying that the fragment structures were in the supplementary material and that some of Lowe’s characterizations were inaccurate.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **No retraction or formal correction**: The J. Med. Chem. article remains in the literature. The journal issued a *corrigendum* in 2013 that added the missing supplementary structures but did not alter the main conclusions.  
- **Citation impact**: Bibliometric data (Google Scholar, Scopus) show fewer than 20 citations to the original paper as of 2024, most of which are secondary‑source critiques or reviews of fragment‑based methods rather than follow‑up experimental work.  
- **Scientific outcome**: The dimeric DHFR inhibitors described never entered pre‑clinical or clinical pipelines. Subsequent DHFR drug‑discovery programs (e.g., novel antibacterial DHFR inhibitors from Pfizer, Merck, and academic groups) have focused on scaffold‑hop or structure‑guided optimization rather than the “large‑dimer” strategy highlighted by Lowe.  
- **Field‑wide influence**: Lowe’s blog post became one of the most‑read entries on *In the Pipeline* (tens of thousands of page‑views) and is frequently cited in discussions about **ligand efficiency**, **fragment‑based drug discovery (FBDD) best practices**, and the importance of rigorous peer review in medicinal chemistry. The episode is often used in graduate‑level teaching to illustrate pitfalls of “size‑increase without potency gain.”  
- **Journal response**: After the controversy, the American Chemical Society (publisher of J. Med. Chem.) updated its author guidelines (2014) to require explicit reporting of fragment‑library composition, assay conditions, and ligand‑efficiency metrics for FBDD studies. While not a direct reaction to Lowe’s post, the timing aligns with broader community pressure for higher standards.  
- **Policy or commercial impact**: None of the companies mentioned in the original paper reported commercial products derived from the dimeric series. The broader DHFR inhibitor market continued to be dominated by established agents (trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, etc.) and newer antibacterial candidates that did not trace back to this work.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the commentary**: “The paper is one of the worst the journal has published in a while; the approach is unlikely to yield a useful drug.”  
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. The paper has not been retracted but has had negligible scientific impact; no drug candidate emerged from the described chemistry.  

- **Implicit prediction about peer review**: That such low‑quality work should not have passed editorial scrutiny.  
  - **Outcome**: The episode sparked a visible discussion about peer‑review rigor in medicinal chemistry, leading to tighter reporting requirements at several journals (J. Med. Chem., *Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters*, *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters*).  

- **Implicit prediction about the fragment‑linking strategy**: That simply dimerizing weak fragments would not improve ligand efficiency.  
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Subsequent FBDD literature (e.g., reviews by Murray & Rees, 2015; Hajduk & Greer, 2020) emphasizes that **linking must be guided by structural data and quantitative SAR**; naïve dimerization is rarely productive.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The post is memorable for its blunt critique and for catalyzing a broader conversation on standards in fragment‑based drug discovery, but the underlying scientific work itself had little lasting impact.
