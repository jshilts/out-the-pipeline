# New Cures! Faster! Faster! (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary responds to the NIH's plans to establish a translational medicine institute (NCATS), addressing the "FasterCures movement" backed by Michael Milken that advocated accelerating medical research timelines. The author critiques the growing sentiment that there exists a "treasure chest of great discoveries" sitting unused in academia, arguing instead that most seemingly promising basic research fails to translate due to biological complexity—not neglect. The piece highlights concerns about funding shifts away from basic research, unrealistic expectations from patient advocacy groups, and leaders' tendency to "over-promise" quick cures (e.g., promises to cure Parkinson's within five years, end cancer suffering by 2015, and deliver rapid genomic medicine breakthroughs). Key voices quoted include Joseph Zaia (warning against business-driven timetables), Keith Yamamoto (cautioning about overpromising), and Amy Rick (representing patient urgency about the "valley of death"). The author argues most apparent "slow progress" reflects genuine scientific difficulty, not organizational inertia.

## 2. HISTORY
After this article's publication, the **National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) officially launched in 2011-2012** with an initial budget of ~$575 million, focusing on de-risking preclinical projects and developing enabling technologies (assays, biomarkers, drug repurposing). Here is what followed empirically:

**Reality Check on Translation:**
- **Clinical success rates did not improve** as hoped. Overall drug development success rates remained consistently low: Phases I→II (~63%), II→III (~31%), III→regulatory (~58%), with oncology (3.4% overall), neurology (~8%), and infectious diseases (~19%) showing stark variation by therapeutic area.
- **NCATS' flagship programs showed mixed, often disappointing results.** The **Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND)** program, intended to shepherd academic discoveries toward IND, advanced some candidates, but few reached FDA approval. Only a handful of TRND-origin drugs progressed meaningfully, often with lengthy timelines.
- The much-hyped **National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)** during 2020–2022 demonstrated NCATS' pivoting capability but produced mainly observational findings without breakthrough treatments. 
- **Budget dynamics confirmed critics' fears**: NCATS funding grew from ~$575M (2012) to ~$680M (2016–2023 range), partially shielded from flat NIH budgets—reinforcing concerns about resource diversion from basic science.

**Industry behavior contradicted the "unused discoveries" narrative:**
- The biopharma "pipeline problem" persisted due to biological complexity, not academic neglect. Late-stage failures for high-profile targets (beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's, many oncology candidates) reinforced the author's skepticism.
- **No evidence emerged of a "treasure chest" of missed cures.** Instead, the 2010s saw repeated high-profile clinical disappointments: Alzheimer's drugs (e.g., bapineuzumab, solanezumab), gene therapies facing manufacturing challenges (e.g., Glybera's withdrawal), and cardiovascular outcomes trials struggling to show benefit.

**Policy outcomes validated skepticism:**
- The **"Moonshot" initiatives (Cancer Moonshot 2016; All of Us 2015–ongoing)** similarly generated enthusiasm but practical progress remained incremental (e.g., Cancer Moonshot funded infrastructure but breakthrough cures were limited).
- FDA created breakthrough therapy designations, with **mixed impact**: accelerated approval pathways were real, but did not fundamentally resolve the underlying success rate problem.

**Business outcomes:**
- Mainstream pharma increasingly exited early-stage research, outsourcing risk to smaller biotechs—reflecting rational response to scientific uncertainty rather than acceleration.
- **NIH budget shares shifted toward translational programs**, but without proportionate gains in approved drugs relative to increased spending on translational infrastructure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself does not offer explicit predictions but channels several forecasts advanced by advocates and critics. Here is how those predictions measured up to what actually happened:

• **FasterCures/NIH promise: Redirecting resources to translation will provide "significant stimulus to moving ideas out of the lab and into the clinic."**  
  → **Outcome: Disappointing.** Clinical success rates and novel approvals did not improve substantially despite NCATS' funding. NCATS' portfolio produced few FDA-approved drugs, especially given its budget.

• **Amy Rick's concern: The "valley of death" is growing; government should bridge it.**  
  → **Outcome: Partially validated, but misdiagnosed.** The NIH created infrastructure to bridge this gap, but biological—not organizational—barriers remained the dominant cause of failure. The valley persisted.

• **Zaia's warning: Imposing "business time schedules" would deplete NIH resources and tear down the basic knowledge infrastructure.**  
  → **Outcome: Largely confirmed.** NCATS drew funding (though not as dramatically as feared) and basic research budgets stagnated relatively. Critically, no evidence emerged that speeding timelines via NCATS systematically uncovered hidden cures; the core challenge remained scientific complexity.

• **Yamamoto/Varmus concerns: Overpromising cures leads to public cynicism.**  
  → **Outcome: Validated.** The "end cancer by 2015" and "genome sequence → rapid cures" expectations largely unmet, likely eroding public trust. Subsequent years saw growing scrutiny of precision medicine's realistic timelines.

• **Implicit prediction in patient advocates' narrative: Private money isn't filling the translational gap.**  
  → **Outcome: Unsubstantiated.** The 2010s saw a surge in venture capital for biotech, growth of translational institutes at universities, and many startups pursuing "dusty" discoveries. The gap remained due to scientific risk, not funding neglect.

• **Collins' genome-sequencing linked promises of direct, quick medicines.**  
  → **Outcome: Not realized.** Despite vast genomic data, most common diseases still lack targeted therapies derived directly from genome-inspired discoveries, with timelines often exceeding a decade when successful.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 8/10**
This article provides a incisive, empirically grounded critique of persistent translational hype, and its concerns were largely validated by subsequent developments over the next decade. The piece remains relevant for understanding why biopharma productivity remains challenging despite increased translational investment.
