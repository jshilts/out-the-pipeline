# "Welcome to My Brain" – commentary on a questionable academic paper (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 blog-style commentary discusses a peculiar academic paper titled "Welcome to My Brain" published in the SAGE journal *Qualitative Inquiry*. The article focuses on exposing what the author considers a bizarre and nonsensical publication that somehow passed peer review.

The target paper uses recursive, self-referential language with phrases like "developing recursive, intrinsic, self-reflexive as de-and/or resubjective always evolving living research designs." It features extended passages about knitting, Möbius strips, and a character named "John," written in what the commentator describes as either "an elaborate word game or the product of a disturbed mind." The abstract and excerpts suggest the paper combines neurobiological terminology with what appears to be pseudo-profound academic jargon, including references to "antifragility," "postconceptual hyperbolic word creation," and "brain theorizing itself." The commentator draws parallels to the controversial Andrulis "gyre" paper published by MDPI in 2012, raising questions about peer review standards in certain open-access journals. The article ends by calling for better quality control in academic publishing.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2013 commentary was published, there were several important developments related to academic publishing quality and peer review integrity:

**Predatory Publishing Lists and Accountability:** The reference to Beall's List of predatory publishers reflects a growing awareness in the early 2010s. Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado Denver, had been maintaining this list since 2010. The list gained significant attention and influenced how researchers and institutions viewed open-access publishers. However, Beall's list faced criticism for being subjective and biased against certain publishers, leading to legal threats and the list's eventual removal in 2017.

**SAGE Publishing Response:** As a major academic publisher, SAGE has generally maintained a respected reputation among academic publishers. Their journal *Qualitative Inquiry* continued operations and maintained its academic standing despite this particular paper. Major publishers like SAGE, Springer, and Elsevier have generally implemented more rigorous peer review processes and editorial oversight compared to the more problematic open-access publishers discussed in the commentary.

**Continued Problems in Academic Publishing:** Unfortunately, concerns raised in this 2013 article proved prescient. The subsequent decade saw continued proliferation of predatory journals and questionable papers. High-profile cases included:
- The "SCIgen" papers (computer-generated nonsense) that continued to be accepted by some conferences and journals
- Scientific "sting" operations by journalists and researchers revealing how some journals would publish anything for a fee
- Persistence of pay-to-publish schemes with minimal or fake peer review

**Stricter Institutional Policies:** Many universities and funding agencies implemented stricter policies about where researchers could publish, often creating "approved" lists of journals and discouraging publication in predatory or low-quality venues.

**Impact on Open-Access Movement:** This type of controversy created challenges for the open-access movement, as legitimate concerns about quality were sometimes conflated with attacks on the OA model itself. However, reputable OA journals (PLOS ONE, eLife, Nature Communications) maintained rigorous standards and established themselves as respected publishing venues with different business models.

The specific paper discussed in "Welcome to My Brain" appears to have faded into obscurity rather than sparking major institutional changes at SAGE specifically, but it contributed to broader conversations about maintaining quality standards as academic publishing evolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made one clear prediction, though more as a recommendation:

• **Prediction:** "Maybe it's time for not only a list of predatory publishers, but a list of nonpredatory ones that freely admit garbage."

**Outcome:** The prediction for better tools to evaluate publisher quality partially came true, but not exactly as envisioned.

**What happened:**

- Beall's List of predatory publishers continued until 2017 and gained widespread use, but was controversial and ultimately discontinued due to legal concerns and criticism of its methodology.

- Various alternatives emerged: Cabell's Journal Blacklist (more systematic, paid service), the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) maintained quality standards, and initiatives like the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) developed best practice guidelines.

- However, no simple "nonpredatory ones that freely admit garbage" list materialized as suggested. Instead, the academic community developed more sophisticated approaches including institutional-level journal evaluation, citation metrics analysis (impact factors, h-index, etc.), and professional organizations' assessments.

- The problem proved more complex than a simple binary classification. Many journals exist on a spectrum of quality, and subjective research domains (like qualitative inquiry itself) presented particular challenges for evaluation standards.

**Broader Impact:** The underlying concern about publishing quality standards remained highly relevant, but solutions evolved to be more nuanced than simple black-and-white lists, incorporating quantitative metrics, peer community evaluations, and institutional certification systems.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an important ongoing issue in academic publishing (quality control and peer review standards) through a specific bizarre example. However, it's primarily a blog-style commentary rather than deep investigative journalism, focuses more on spectacle than systematic analysis, and has limited lasting significance compared to more comprehensive examinations of predatory publishing.
