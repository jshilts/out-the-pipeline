# Sure About That? (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 blog post questioned the structural assignment of a natural product compound published in a 2009 Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters paper. The author, Derek Lowe, expressed strong skepticism about whether the reported anti-Bredt cyclobutene structure was correct, noting that such structures were virtually unknown in modern chemistry literature and had only been discussed theoretically. The post highlighted the broader issue of structural misassignment in natural products chemistry, referencing another chemistry blog ("One in Ten Thousand") that had also raised concerns about the same paper.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in this blog post proved prescient. Natural products chemistry has continued to face challenges with structural misassignment, particularly as compounds become more complex. In the years following 2010, several high-profile cases emerged where compounds initially reported with certain structures were later corrected through advanced spectroscopic techniques, total synthesis, or X-ray crystallography.

The issue highlighted in this post reflects a broader trend in chemical literature where the pressure to publish novel structures sometimes outpaces thorough validation. Subsequent developments include:
- Increased use of computational NMR prediction and X-ray crystallography to verify structures
- Growing emphasis on total synthesis as the gold standard for structure confirmation
- Several case studies where initial claims were retracted or significantly revised

No specific drugs or policy changes resulted directly from this particular paper, but it contributed to ongoing discussions about quality control and verification standards in natural products research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about structural correctness**: The author strongly implied that the structure was likely incorrect. This type of informed skepticism from experienced chemists often proves accurate when subsequent research is conducted.

• **No explicit forward-looking predictions** were made about the broader field or future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an important but niche quality control issue in natural products chemistry, and while the skepticism was well-founded and representative of broader field concerns, the impact was limited to highlighting verification challenges rather than driving major scientific or policy changes.
