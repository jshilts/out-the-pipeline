# The Predatory Publishers List Goes Dark (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the sudden disappearance of Jeffrey Beall's "List of Predatory Publishers," a widely-used resource in the scientific community. Beall's list compiled publishers and journals that operated as "predatory"—charging authors publication fees while providing little to no peer review or editorial oversight, effectively publishing anything for money.

The author characterizes these predatory publishers as producing "piles of useless stuff" including recycled, low-quality research and papers that couldn't meet legitimate journal standards. While acknowledging that some reputable open-access publishers exist, the article distinguishes them from these predatory operations that exploit authors (particularly those from institutions emphasizing publication quantity over quality) and damage scientific credibility. The piece highlights the controversy surrounding Beall's list, while defending its overall utility in exposing fraudulent publishing practices, and expresses hope that someone would continue this watchdog function after Beall's list went dark without explanation.

## 2. HISTORY
Following Beall's list disappearance in January 2017, several important developments occurred:

**Continuation and Institutionalization:** Beall's work evolved into more formal, institution-backed efforts. Cabell's Scholarly Analytics launched its own predatory journal blacklist in 2017, providing a commercial successor. Major academic institutions and funding bodies began developing their own criteria and lists.

**Regulatory and Policy Response:** The problem gained recognition at policy levels. In 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission successfully sued OMICS Group for deceptive practices, resulting in a $50 million judgment (though collection proved challenging). This marked significant government intervention against predatory publishers. The DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) strengthened its inclusion criteria, while institutions like the NIH and universities worldwide developed policies to help researchers avoid predatory venues.

**Standards and Infrastructure:** Multiple organizations developed standards for identifying predatory practices. COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) and ThinkCheckSubmit campaigns emerged. The CRediT taxonomy helped clarify legitimate authorship, and tools like Scopus, Web of Science, and Journal Citation Reports improved transparency around journal quality metrics.

**Growth Despite Crackdowns:** Predatory publishing continued expanding. Studies estimated 8,000-11,000 active predatory journals by 2019, generating millions in revenue. Some publishers simply rebranded or moved operations to avoid scrutiny, demonstrating the persistent economic incentive structure.

**Impact on Research:** Analysis showed predatory publications increasingly contaminated legitimate bibliographic databases, complicating systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Research evaluation systems in various countries (including parts of India, China, and the Middle East) that emphasized publication quantity inadvertently incentivized using predatory venues.

**COVID-19 Amplification:** During the pandemic, predatory publishers exploited heightened research urgency, publishing dubious COVID-19 research while legitimate publishers maintained review standards despite accelerated timelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article explicitly made one prediction and implied a need:

• **"Something like Beall's list is needed; I have no doubt of that"** - This was confirmed as correct. Multiple successors emerged, including Cabell's blacklist, institutional guidelines from universities and funding agencies, and international standards like the COPE guidelines. The persistence of predatory publishing and continued development of countermeasures validated the need for such resources.

• **"I'll be watching with interest to see if a successor list appears"** - A successor did appear through Cabell's in 2017, though it operated as a paid subscription service rather than the free resource Beall had maintained. Additionally, numerous open-source databases and community-maintained lists developed.

• **Implied prediction that predatory publishing would continue without intervention** - This proved accurate. Analysis showed the sector grew rather than diminished, with sophisticated operations evading detection through rebranding, jurisdictional arbitrage, and exploiting gaps in international enforcement.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
The article addresses an important but specialized aspect of scientific publishing integrity. While it correctly identified a significant problem that persisted and actually worsened, the scope primarily affects researchers and institutions rather than broader biotechnology drug development or patient care directly. The FTC intervention and ongoing challenges with research quality give it moderate long-term relevance.
