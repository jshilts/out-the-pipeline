# More on Woodward (November 30, 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on why there will likely never be another chemist quite like R. B. Woodward, explaining that Woodward was "the perfect man for the moment"—with tools and challenges that fitted his era. In the 1950s–1960s, the synthesis of complex natural products (e.g., Vitamin B-12) was not widely assumed to be feasible, but Woodward "lived for" such grand problems. By the early 2000s, however, organic synthesis had advanced so much that the aspirational complexity gap had narrowed, and a figure like Woodward—a colossus who proved the merely unthinkable was achievable—no longer fitted the times. The author concludes that post-Woodward synthetic greats (Corey, Kishi, Nicolaou) later handled molecules that might have given Woodward pause, but the field's tools had improved faster than target complexity had grown.

## 2. HISTORY

The 20 years since 2004 largely validated the article's framing of organic synthesis as a mature discipline focused more on efficiency, selectivity, and enabling applications than on audacious "impossibility" campaigns.
- **Complex target synthesis continued but shifted toward function**: Multi-step total syntheses of highly complex natural products (e.g., by Baran, Sarpong, MacMillan, Carreira) persisted, but the discourse increasingly weighed atom-economy, step-count, redox-economy, and scalability, in line with Corey's retrosynthetic ideals.  
- **C–H activation and late-stage functionalization matured**: Methods for direct C–H functionalization, photocatalysis, and electrochemistry broadened the synthetic toolkit, making previously "impossible" disconnections routine.
- **Automation and machine-assistance grew**: Platforms for retrosynthetic planning and automated synthesis (e.g., Chematica/ASKCOS) entered broader use in pharma and fine chemicals.
- **Successes and failures in industry**: Merck’s synthesis of hepatitis C therapy vaniprevir demonstrated kilogram-scale synthesis of complex architectures; at the same time, highly complex natural-product drugs (e.g., halichondrin-based eribulin, first synthesized by Kishi) reached patients but often required engineered routes for supply. Conversely, some ornate natural-product classes proved too costly to manufacture at scale, reinforcing that complexity alone does not equal utility.
- **Biologics eclipsed small-molecule novelty in the spotlight**: A growing share of approvals became biologics, bispecifics, and cell/gene therapies, shaping where pharma invested in synthesis.

Public policy did not change in direct response to this essay, and the businesses mentioned (and their research directions) evolved toward targeted applications rather than pure conquest-of-complexity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Core prediction**: The author argued that "Woodwardosaurus rex will remain extinct" and that a "leap into some new level of difficulty" would be required before a comparable icon could emerge.
  - **Outcome**: Broadly accurate. No single synthetic chemist since 2004 has captured the public and professional imagination in the way Woodward did for turning "impossible" natural-product syntheses into reality. The frontier shifted from cannot-make to should-we-make, with emphasis on efficiency, sustainability (green chemistry), and enabling function (e.g., PROTACs, molecular glues, covalent inhibitors).  
- **Implicit forecast**: Post-Woodward gods (Corey, Kishi, Nicolaou) had already shown that synthesis could outpace target complexity; this trend largely held, with advances in catalysis, flow chemistry, and computational tools further closing the gap but not creating an equivalently heroic "conquest" narrative.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This is a thoughtful, historically grounded reflection on the sociology and arc of a discipline. It captures why the "heroic era" of natural-product synthesis can't be repeated and why the frontier has moved. The argument is subtle and largely correct, and it avoids hype.
