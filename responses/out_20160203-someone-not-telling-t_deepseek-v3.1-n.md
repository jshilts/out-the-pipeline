# Someone Is Not Telling the Truth About Valeant (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the growing controversy around Valeant Pharmaceuticals in early 2016, focusing on discrepancies between the company's public statements and internal communications. Valeant had been claiming that business growth was primarily driven by volume increases (~90%), while critics suspected the company relied heavily on aggressive price hikes for existing drugs. The piece highlights internal documents obtained through Congressional subpoenas showing Valeant's former CFO reporting to CEO Mike Pearson that "price represented about 60% of our growth" (or 80% including acquisitions), directly contradicting the company's official narrative. The article also notes uncertainties surrounding CEO Mike Pearson's medical leave and questions how major investor Bill Ackman of Pershing Square could maintain confidence in the company despite mounting evidence of misleading statements.

## 2. HISTORY

The Valeant controversy escalated dramatically after this article's publication. In March 2016, Valeant announced it would restate earnings due to accounting irregularities related to its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services, which regulators were investigating for questionable dispensing practices. CEO Mike Pearson eventually returned from medical leave but was replaced in May 2016 by Joseph Papa as the company's stock collapsed from over $200 per share in mid-2015 to around $20-30 per share in 2016.

The company faced multiple federal investigations, including by the SEC and Department of Justice, over pricing strategies, accounting practices, and its relationship with Philidor. Valeant ultimately restated over $58 million in revenue for 2014 and 2015 due to improper recognition tied to Philidor. Major investors including Bill Ackman's Pershing Square and ValueAct suffered billions in losses. Valeant's business model of acquiring drugs and raising prices became emblematic of pharmaceutical industry pricing concerns that later influenced policy discussions.

The company never recovered its former valuation. In 2018, Valeant changed its name to Bausch Health Companies and has since operated with reduced scope and under federal settlement agreements. The episode contributed to increased scrutiny of drug pricing practices industry-wide and became a case study in corporate governance failures, aggressive accounting, and misleading investor communications in the pharmaceutical sector.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction about CEO Mike Pearson's return**: The article questioned when or if Pearson would return from medical leave. **Outcome**: Pearson did return briefly from his December 2015-January 2016 medical leave in February 2016, but was ultimately replaced as CEO in May 2016.
  
• **Prediction about Warren vs. Ackman perspectives**: The article suggested someone was "wrong - or worse than just wrong" regarding conflicting claims about volume-driven vs. price-driven growth. **Outcome**: The evidence definitively showed Valeant's internal communications contradicted their public statements—price increases were the primary driver, not volume, validating critics' concerns and proving Ackman's due diligence claims incorrect.

• **Implicit expectation of ongoing scrutiny**: The article anticipated continued investigations into Valeant's business practices. **Outcome**: Multiple federal investigations, SEC actions, and congressional inquiries followed, leading to corporate restructuring, management changes, and eventual rebranding.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated prescient analysis of one of the most significant pharmaceutical industry scandals, accurately identifying the discrepancy between public claims and documented reality. The Valeant case became emblematic of broader concerns about drug pricing and corporate accountability in healthcare.
