# Don't Make Mine Mink (November 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes a concerning coronavirus outbreak among mink populations in Denmark, which at the time accounted for 40% of global mink production with 17 million animals. The coronavirus had jumped from human farm workers to mink populations, where it spread rapidly and mutated. Most alarmingly, some of these mutated strains had jumped back into humans, with reports suggesting these variants might be less susceptible to antibody responses.

The situation prompted the Danish government to order an immediate cull of all 17 million mink in the country, with military and police involvement. The Serum Institute in Denmark classified the situation as "very serious," noting that 5% of human COVID-19 infections in North Jutland might already involve the new mink-related mutations. The article mentions specific mutations of concern: H69del/V70del, Y453F, I692V, and M1229I.

## 2. HISTORY

The Danish mink cull was indeed carried out in November 2020, with the government destroying approximately 15-17 million mink. However, the feared "Cluster 5" variant (the specific mink variant containing Y453F and other mutations) did not become a major global concern.

Several developments followed:

**Variant Outcomes:** The specific Danish mink variant faded from significance and did not restart the pandemic as initially feared. The mutation was not detected again in the months following the cull, and subsequent studies suggested it did not significantly evade neutralizing antibodies from vaccines or prior infection.

**Economic Impact:** The mass cull devastated Denmark's mink industry, which has not recovered to previous production levels. The Danish government later faced criticism and legal challenges regarding the legality of the culling order.

**Scientific Research:** Genetic sequencing confirmed the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in mink populations and documented transmission back to humans, validating concerns about animal reservoirs. However, the specific immunological escape properties of the Danish variant proved less severe than initially feared.

**International Response:** Other countries with mink farming, including the Netherlands, also implemented culling programs and accelerated plans to phase out mink farming.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: The mink variant would restart the pandemic spreading from Denmark** - This did not happen. The "Cluster 5" variant disappeared and did not become a variant of concern or lead to widespread transmission.

• **Prediction: The variant's reduced susceptibility to antibody responses would be a major problem** - The antibody escape properties were real but proved less significant than feared. The variant did not substantially evade immunity from vaccines or prior infection.

• **Prediction: Mink farming would face major restrictions globally** - Partially accurate. Multiple European countries accelerated mink farming phase-outs, but production continued in some regions including China and Poland.

• **Prediction: Sequence information would clarify the situation** - Accurate. Genetic sequencing did reveal the mutations and allowed proper assessment, ultimately showing the variant was not as dangerous as initially feared.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important moment in pandemic response where legitimate scientific concern about a potential variant drove dramatic policy action. While the specific threat turned out to be overestimated, the underlying issues about animal reservoirs and reverse zoonosis remain scientifically significant. The episode demonstrated both the value and limits of early dramatic response to emerging biological threats.
