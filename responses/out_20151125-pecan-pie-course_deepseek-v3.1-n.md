# Pecan Pie, Of Course (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post from science blogger Derek Lowe announces he's taking Thanksgiving day off from work. He mentions his annual tradition of making chocolate pecan pie using a recipe he previously published in 2010, along with a pumpkin flan from a New York Times cookbook. The post includes a lighthearted commentary about organic chemists and cooking, noting that "you should never trust an organic chemist who can't cook." Lowe also warns new readers to expect occasional recipes during December, establishing this as part of his regular seasonal content pattern.

## 2. HISTORY
The post represents a recurring seasonal tradition rather than substantive scientific commentary. Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog continued publishing at Science Magazine through 2024, maintaining its focus on pharmaceutical industry news, drug discovery, and chemistry. The chocolate pecan pie recipe reference points to Lowe's established pattern of interspersing personal content with scientific analysis, a style that helped build his loyal readership over decades. No significant biotechnology developments, policy changes, or business impacts stemmed from this particular post, as it was explicitly personal content marking a holiday break from technical coverage. The blog itself remained influential in pharmaceutical industry discourse, but this specific recipe post had no measurable impact on scientific, clinical, or business developments in biotechnology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **December recipe posts**: Lowe predicted readers would see "occasional recipe during December" - This prediction was accurate, as his blog continued the pattern of seasonal recipe posts in subsequent years
• **Annual tradition continuation**: The implicit prediction that he would continue making the chocolate pecan pie annually - Given the post's framing as an established tradition, this likely continued as described

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 1**

This is essentially a placeholder/holiday post with minimal substantive content about biotechnology. While part of an influential blog, the individual post contains no analysis, predictions, or information relevant to biotech industry developments.
