# Why Don't Chemists Communicate? (Or Do We?)
**17 Dec 2009**

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2009 commentary reflects on why chemistry as a discipline appeared slower to adopt web-based scholarly communication tools compared to fields like physics and biology. The author references a Nature Chemistry article examining why chemistry preprint servers and data-sharing initiatives consistently failed to gain traction, while counterparts like arXiv and GenBank flourished in other fields.

The piece explores several explanatory factors: the culture of chemistry emphasizes making and characterizing physical substances rather than generating reusable datasets; chemists historically didn't share preprints as physicists did, so infrastructure alone couldn't change behavior; chemistry research is more fragmented across smaller research groups rather than large collaborative efforts requiring coordination; and various sub-disciplines have different communication needs and constraints, especially in industry where information sharing has commercial sensitivity.

The article notes failed initiatives like Elsevier's preprint server and the uncertain adoption of Nature Precedings, suggesting that successful tools need to align with existing practices rather than attempting to create entirely new behaviors. The author questions what specific web-based tools would actually improve research productivity, expressing skepticism toward social media-style platforms while acknowledging the value of electronic literature searching and electronic notebooks.

A notable observation highlights that science blogging at the time was primarily done by students, journalists, and early-career researchers, with "hardly any established scientists" maintaining blogs due to time constraints, leaving open whether this would become mainstream.

## 2. HISTORY

**Preprints and Open Science Evolution (2010-2020s)**
The chemistry community did gradually adopt preprint culture, though more slowly than physics. ChemRxiv was launched in 2016 by the American Chemical Society, Royal Society of Chemistry, and other societies, becoming the dominant chemistry preprint server. By 2018-2022, it gained substantial traction, with thousands of submissions annually, though adoption remained lower than physics (arXiv submissions dwarf chemistry preprints by orders of magnitude).

ChemRxiv's success addressed earlier failures by being society-backed rather than commercial, eliminating the earlier trust issues that plagued Elsevier's attempt. Major chemistry journals increasingly accepted preprints, removing the critical barrier that killed previous initiatives.

**Blogging and Social Media**
Science blogging evolved significantly. Established scientists did increasingly adopt blogging and social media platforms, particularly Twitter (now X). By the mid-2010s, respected senior chemists maintained active Twitter presences for professional communication. However, the concern about time investment proved accurate—sustained engagement remained challenging, and many remained selective about participation.

**Shared Data and Repositories**
Chemistry data sharing did advance, though with different characteristics than genomics. Crystallographic databases like the Cambridge Structural Database (existing since 1965) continued growing. NMR and computational chemistry data repositories emerged, with persistent challenges around standardization and researcher incentives. The "piles of reusable data" vision didn't materialize as dramatically as in genomics, though structure-activity databases did enable machine learning applications.

**Publisher-Led Initiatives**
Nature Precedings (mentioned in 2009) was discontinued in 2012, largely unsuccessful in chemistry. The field's adoption patterns confirmed that chemistry research sharing follows instrument-specific and characterization-specific pathways rather than general-purpose preprint servers.

**Industry Considerations**
The confidentiality concerns raised proved prescient. Pharmaceutical and industrial chemistry research largely remained outside public preprint culture, with sharing limited to post-publication materials. The competitive nature of synthetic routes and process chemistry constrained open communication more than in academic physics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "Hardly any established scientists maintain a blog - after all, blogging regularly is very time-consuming. The question remains open whether these will remain fringe phenomena or become part of the mainstream communication in science."**

- **Outcome**: Established scientists did adopt online communication, but primarily through Twitter/X rather than long-form blogging for most. Time constraints did limit sustained engagement as predicted. Blogs remained semi-fringe, while social media microblogging became widespread for conferences, discussion, and networking. "Communication" opened up but shifted toward brief engagement rather than intensive blogging.

**Prediction: That chemistry's different relationship to data and instrument-based results would shape sharing behavior**

- **Outcome**: Confirmed. Chemistry databases developed along characterization-specific lines (X-ray crystallography, NMR reference data, mass spectrometry libraries) rather than comprehensive preprint repositories. The enduring value of older literature data was validated by the continued citation of decades-old characterization data and synthetic procedures. Chemists still don't generate the machine-analyzable datasets common in genomics.

**Prediction: That chemists don't naturally share preprints and infrastructure alone wouldn't solve this**

- **Outcome**: Partially reversed. ChemRxiv succeeded where earlier servers failed, suggesting that trusted institutional backing and journal acceptance did enable culture change. However, adoption rates remained modest compared to physics, indicating persistent cultural factors. Chemistry still has lower preprint usage rates than fields with longer preprint traditions.

**Prediction: Tools need to align with existing practices rather than impose new behaviors**

- **Outcome**: Strongly confirmed. Successful chemistry tools (Reaxys, SciFinder, electronic lab notebooks) reinforced existing workflows. Generic "social media for science" platforms largely failed as the author suspected, while domain-specific databases and literature tools proliferated.

**Prediction: Sub-disciplines have different communication needs**

- **Outcome**: Validated. Medicinal chemistry and drug discovery remain more proprietary, computational chemistry more open, organic synthesis built extensive community databases for reactions, materials chemistry developed specialized repositories.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article perceptively identified cultural and practical barriers that shaped chemistry's digital transition, and many of its cautious predictions proved remarkably prescient over the following decade.
