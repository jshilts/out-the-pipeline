# Merck and Its Ransomware Problems in Court (December 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the aftermath of the 2017 NotPetya ransomware attack on Merck, which infected tens of thousands of the company's devices and caused approximately $1.3 billion in damages, shutting down operations for two weeks and disrupting U.S. vaccine supplies. The cyberattack originated from Russian malware targeting Ukraine but spread indiscriminately worldwide through Merck's Ukraine office server. The central conflict described involves Merck's insurance claims being denied by providers who classify the state-sponsored attack as an "act of war" excluded from coverage, leading to ongoing litigation that would set important precedents for cyber insurance policies that were not designed to address such scenarios. The article also highlights the unique nature of NotPetya as purely destructive malware with bogus ransom demands, unlike typical criminal ransomware where payment might recover data.

## 2. HISTORY
**Insurance Litigation Outcome**: In January 2022, the New Jersey Superior Court ruled in favor of Merck, finding that the "act of war" exclusion in their property insurance policies did not apply to the NotPetya cyberattack. The court determined that the exclusion language was ambiguous and that Merck was not engaged in warfare with Russia. However, this decision was **partially reversed** by an appellate court in May 2022, creating mixed precedent that sent the case toward further appeals. The final resolution came in **November 2022** when the New Jersey Supreme Court declined to hear the case, effectively ending Merck's appeal and allowing the appellate decision to stand, though the exact financial outcome of their insurance claims remains unclear.

**FDA and Supply Chain Impact**: The attack significantly disrupted Merck's manufacturing operations. The company had to request Gardasil vaccine supplies from the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, which was **completely depleted** by the request. Merck spent approximately eighteen months rebuilding vaccine inventory and replenishing the government stockpile. The incident prompted the FDA to issue updated cybersecurity guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers in 2018, establishing new requirements for IT infrastructure protection and business continuity planning. The attack also contributed to temporary Gardasil supply shortages in 2017-2018 before production resumed fully.

**Corporate Responses**: In the wake of the attack, Merck invested heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure upgrades, implementing more robust network segmentation, enhanced endpoint protection, and improved disaster recovery systems. The company also participated in government-industry cybersecurity partnerships and enhanced employee training programs to reduce phishing vulnerability—the initial NotPetya infection vector.

**Insurance Industry Changes**: The case catalyzed significant changes in the cyber insurance market. Insurers began explicitly addressing nation-state attacks in policy language, with many policies now including specific coverage exclusions or limitations for state-sponsored cyber incidents. Premiums for comprehensive cybersecurity insurance increased substantially after 2019, with some estimates showing 30-50% increases for pharmaceutical companies. The litigation highlighted gaps in legal frameworks for attributing cyberattacks and determining when they constitute "acts of war."

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions about specific outcomes or timeline. However, it touched on broader implications which can be evaluated:

• **"Merck will be arguing its case for some time"** - This proved accurate, as the litigation continued through multiple appeals until late 2022, spanning nearly three years from when the article was published.

• **"One can expect an appeal no matter what happens"** - This was prescient. After the initial Superior Court victory for Merck in 2022, insurance companies did appeal, and the appellate court partially reversed the decision.

• **Implicit expectation of clarified insurance policy language** - The article's discussion of ambiguous policy language proved accurate in driving industry changes, as insurers did revise cyber policy language following this case to address nation-state attack scenarios more explicitly.

• **Implicit concern about drug industry cybersecurity preparedness** - This concern was validated by subsequent developments, as the pharmaceutical sector increased cybersecurity investments and faced additional high-profile attacks (including the 2020 SolarWinds campaign affecting some pharma companies).

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article identified a critical intersection between cybersecurity, corporate insurance, supply chain resilience, and pharmaceutical operations. The Merck-NotPetya case established important precedents for cyber insurance claims and demonstrated how geopolitical cyber conflicts can create cascading impacts on public health infrastructure. The legal and regulatory implications for the pharmaceutical industry remain relevant today.
