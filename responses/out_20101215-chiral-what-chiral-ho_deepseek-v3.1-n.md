# Chiral What? Chiral How? (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post critiques a *Tetrahedron* paper claiming to have isolated naturally occurring nevirapine (an HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor) from the plant *C.viscosa*. The central oddity was the authors' assertion that their isolated nevirapine was optically active (chiral), whereas the synthetic drug is achiral. The blogger, noting nevirapine's structure lacks chiral centers, questioned how chirality could arise and criticized the paper's X-ray crystallography methods for determining absolute stereochemistry. The post suspected a potential "patent-busting exercise" and concluded that the paper should not have survived competent peer review.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent events validated the blog's deep skepticism. The *Tetrahedron* paper became a prominent case study in the broader reproducibility crisis and failure of peer review in chemistry publishing. The claim of chiral nevirapine was never substantiated, and no later research confirmed nevirapine as a natural product. Critically, no concrete impacts followed: no patents were overturned, no alternative chiral HIV drugs emerged, and no pharmaceutical development resulted from these findings. The primary outcome was reputational damage to the authors and scrutiny of journal quality control standards. Nevirapine remained an achiral, synthetic antiretroviral drug, with its clinical use and patent status unaffected. This incident served as a cautionary tale about extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence in medicinal chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in the article.

## 4. INTEREST
3

The article ranks in the 30-40th percentile for interest. While the specific paper discussed was a footnote in chemistry history without broader scientific or clinical impact, it became a minor case study illustrating failures in peer review and the importance of critical examination in academic publishing.
