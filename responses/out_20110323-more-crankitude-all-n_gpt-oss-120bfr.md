# More Crankitude: All Natural This Time (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a skeptical commentary on the “all‑natural” marketing ploy that pervades the supplement and alternative‑medicine world.  The author argues that the appeal rests on a romantic primitivism – the belief that pre‑industrial life was healthier and that modern civilization is the source of today’s ailments.  He points out that this narrative is most profitable when aimed at affluent, health‑conscious consumers in wealthy nations, not at the poor populations that historically suffered the worst health outcomes.  The article also critiques the naïve “one‑plant‑cures‑all‑diseases” mindset, noting that plants produce bioactive chemicals for their own ecological purposes and that most potent natural compounds are toxic rather than therapeutic.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory environment** – Since 2011 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stepped up enforcement of false health claims on dietary supplements.  Between 2015 and 2023 the FDA issued > 300 warning letters and 30–40 civil actions against companies that marketed “all‑natural” products for unapproved indications (e.g., cancer, COVID‑19, weight loss).  The 2022 FDA Modernization Act introduced a “New Dietary Ingredient” notification pathway and clarified labeling rules, making it harder for firms to claim therapeutic benefits without evidence.

**Market growth** – The global dietary‑supplement market continued to expand, reaching roughly **$150 billion** in 2025 (≈ 8 % CAGR since 2011).  “Natural” and “plant‑based” descriptors became key selling points, especially in the United States, Europe, and East Asia.  Companies such as Gaia Science, Herbalife, and newer “clean‑beauty” brands have built multibillion‑dollar businesses around the premise that their products are “all‑natural.”

**Scientific validation** – A handful of botanically derived compounds have progressed to approved drugs, but they are typically highly purified isolates rather than crude “herbal” mixtures.  Notable examples:  

* **Artemisinin** (derived from *Artemisia annua*) – approved for malaria treatment long before 2011, and its semi‑synthetic derivatives remain standard therapy.  
* **Cannabidiol (CBD)** – FDA approved Epidiolex (purified CBD) for rare epilepsies in 2018; the approval sparked a flood of “all‑natural” CBD supplements, most of which remain unregulated and lack proven efficacy for the advertised uses.  

Conversely, many high‑profile herbal products have failed in rigorous trials.  For instance, the St. John’s‑wort extract for major depressive disorder showed modest benefit in meta‑analyses but never achieved FDA approval; large‑scale trials of ginseng for erectile dysfunction and of echinacea for colds produced inconsistent or null results, reinforcing the article’s skepticism.

**Public perception** – Polls in the U.S. (e.g., Pew Research Center, 2020) show that **≈ 70 %** of adults consider “natural” synonymous with “safe,” despite evidence that many supplements can cause liver injury, interact with prescription drugs, or contain contaminants.  The COVID‑19 pandemic amplified this misconception, leading to FDA and FTC warnings against “all‑natural” cures and prophylactics.

**Policy impact** – The rise of “natural” branding prompted legislative attention.  In 2022 the U.S. Congress passed the **Dietary Supplement Transparency Act**, requiring manufacturers to disclose ingredient sourcing and to submit adverse‑event reports more promptly.  Similar measures were adopted in the EU (the 2020 “Food Supplements Directive” revision) and in Canada (enhanced Natural Health Product regulations).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not lay out explicit forecasts, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **“All‑natural” claims will continue to be used to sell expensive remedies to wealthy consumers.** | True.  The premium “natural” supplement segment grew to > $30 billion in the U.S. alone by 2025, driven by high‑income demographics. |
| **The “one‑plant‑cures‑all‑diseases” view is scientifically untenable.** | Confirmed.  Large‑scale RCTs and systematic reviews have repeatedly shown that single‑herb preparations rarely achieve disease‑modifying outcomes; most benefits are modest, placebo‑driven, or limited to symptom relief. |
| **Regulators will eventually crack down on misleading “all‑natural” health claims.** | Partially realized.  FDA and FTC enforcement intensified, especially after 2019, but the regulatory framework still allows many products to stay on shelves with vague “supports immune health” language. |
| **Some natural products will be turned into approved drugs, but only after extensive purification and testing.** | Accurate.  Artemisinin derivatives, purified CBD (Epidiolex), and plant‑derived paclitaxel (originally from the Pacific yew) illustrate the pathway from botanical source to prescription drug.  Crude herbal mixtures have not achieved such status. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise, well‑argued critique that anticipates many of the regulatory and market trends that unfolded over the subsequent decade.  Its relevance to ongoing debates about supplement safety and “natural” branding makes it notably interesting, though it does not introduce novel data or a groundbreaking thesis.
