I notice that you've provided commentary about a New York Times Magazine article on drug discovery, but the actual content of the article itself is missing. To conduct the thorough retrospective analysis you've requested - examining predictions, historical outcomes, and real-world impact - I would need to see the full text of the original article.

The material you've shared appears to be a brief commentary about the NYT piece rather than the article itself. Without the actual claims, arguments, and predictions made in the original article, I cannot:

- Summarize what the article actually said about drug discovery challenges
- Track how specific predictions played out over the past decade
- Evaluate which claims about genomics, target-based discovery, etc., proved accurate
- Assess the article's overall perspicacity and long-term importance

Could you please provide the full text of the New York Times Magazine article from November 2014, or at minimum the key arguments and predictions it made about drug discovery, genomics, and the biotechnology industry? With that content, I can deliver the detailed retrospective analysis you're looking for across all four requested sections (summary, history, predictions, and interest score).
