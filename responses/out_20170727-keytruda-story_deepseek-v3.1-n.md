# The Keytruda Story (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary by Derek Lowe discusses the convoluted development history of Merck's immuno-oncology drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The article highlights how Keytruda was discovered accidentally by Organon scientists in 2003 while researching drugs to suppress immune responses for autoimmune diseases - they were initially looking to *stimulate* PD-1, not block it. The program survived two mergers/acquisitions (from Organon to Schering-Plough to Merck), fought for funding, and was nearly out-licensed after Merck initially shut it down and placed it on the "for sale" list. Only competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb's promising results with Opdivo prompted Merck to reconsider.

Lowe emphasizes the role of serendipity and luck alongside persistence and strategic decision-making. While Merck executed well once committed (particularly under Roger Perlmutter's leadership), the article suggests timing and chance played crucial roles. The piece also notes Bristol-Myers Squibb's lost opportunity despite having a years-long head start with Opdivo.

## 2. HISTORY

**Commercial Success and Clinical Expansion:**
Since 2017, Keytruda has become Merck's flagship product and one of the most successful cancer drugs in history. By 2023, it generated over $25 billion in annual revenue and became the world's top-selling drug. The FDA has granted dozens of approvals across multiple cancer types including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, and various solid tumors with specific biomarkers.

**Clinical Trial Outcomes:**
Keytruda demonstrated particular success in lung cancer, where it gained first-line treatment status for certain patient populations, significantly expanding the eligible patient base. Its combination with chemotherapy showed improved survival rates in multiple trials. However, not all trials succeeded - notably, some combination trials in head and neck cancer failed to meet endpoints, confirming the author's caution about selective drug efficacy across cancer types.

**Broader Industry Impact:**
The PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor class, including Keytruda and Opdivo, fundamentally transformed cancer treatment paradigms. These drugs pioneered immunotherapy as a pillar of oncology alongside surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Many pharmaceutical companies developed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, creating a competitive landscape. The success validated checkpoint inhibition as a therapeutic strategy and spurred research into combination therapies and other checkpoint targets (CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3).

**Combination Strategies:**
The period after 2017 saw extensive investigation of Keytruda in combination with other agents. Lenvima (lenvatinib) plus Keytruda received approval for certain endometrial and renal carcinomas. However, combination trials also revealed increased toxicity, requiring careful benefit-risk assessment.

**Biomarker Development:**
PD-L1 expression testing became standard practice in many cancers to guide Keytruda use, though imperfect. Research expanded into tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) as predictive biomarkers, leading to tissue-agnostic approvals for Keytruda in patients with these genomic features.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Merck's strategic bet on Keytruda would prove correct despite early skepticism**
- **Outcome:** Correct. Merck's aggressive resourcing of Keytruda under Roger Perlmutter was validated. The program became extraordinarily successful, generating massive revenue and becoming standard-of-care for numerous cancers. This success justified the substantial investment and clinical development risks taken.

**Prediction: Luck and serendipity played significant roles in Keytruda's success**
- **Outcome:** Confirmed. The drug's pathway to success involved substantial serendipity - accidental discovery, competitor data prompting reconsideration, favorable trial sequence timing. However, clinical execution also proved crucial as not all companies with PD-1 inhibitors achieved similar success, and Merck's strategic trial design (including combination approaches and biomarker selection) contributed to market differentiation.

**Prediction: Bristol-Myers Squib's lost competitive advantage**
- **Outcome:** Partially validated. While Opdivo remained the second-leading PD-1 inhibitor with significant sales and approvals, Bristol-Myers Squibb did lose its initial market leadership position to Merck. Opdivo generated approximately $10 billion annually by 2023-2024 - substantial but approximately 40% of Keytruda's sales. BMS faced some clinical setbacks (including certain first-line lung cancer trials) and never regained the dominance suggested by its early lead.

**Prediction: Not all indications would succeed (exemplified by head and neck cancer concerns)**
- **Outcome:** Accurate. Clinical trials confirmed heterogeneous responses across cancer types. Some trials failed to show benefit, including head and neck cancer studies (KEYNOTE-040, KEYNOTE-122), bladder cancer studies, and certain combination approaches. This highlighted the importance of precision patient selection and the non-universal efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article appropriately identifies Keytruda's development as a landmark case study in drug discovery - illustrating the interplay of chance and strategic decision-making, with sufficient critical distance without picking winners too definitively. While scores could be higher given Keytruda's ultimate success, the commentary stays circumspect and avoids excessive speculation, making it a valuable perspective.
