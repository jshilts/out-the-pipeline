# Kevan Shokat At The Challenges in Chemical Biology Conference (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This July 2013 conference commentary describes Kevan Shokat's presentation on using *Drosophila* (fruit fly) models for kinase inhibitor discovery in oncology, with a specific focus on targeting the Ret kinase pathway relevant to thyroid cancer. The article highlights that although fruit fly models might seem problematic for human drug discovery, species conservation of the Ret kinase enabled functional screening. The team developed a clever screen using approximately 1,000 kinase inhibitor candidates that could rescue a lethal phenotype, creating a high signal-to-noise readout. The key finding—and main insight of the work—was that Ret kinase inhibition alone was insufficient: compounds with nearly identical Ret activity produced dramatically different phenotypes in flies. Follow-up analysis revealed that off-target polypharmacology against Raf and TOR kinase pathways was responsible for divergent outcomes, either canceling or enhancing the desired effects. This demonstrated that phenotypic screening could reveal the necessary "kinase fingerprint" for achieving a therapeutic effect, rather than relying solely on target-specific potency.

## 2. HISTORY

After the July 2013 commentary, the work Shokat described continued to influence both mechanistic understanding and clinical development around Ret kinase inhibition, particularly as it relates to clinical multi-kinase inhibitor effects and the broader effort to target rearranged during transfection (Ret) in thyroid cancers.

**Clinical development and FDA approvals:**
- Vandetanib (Caprelsa), an inhibitor of Ret, VEGF receptor, and EGFR, had already been FDA-approved in 2011 for symptomatic or progressive medullary thyroid cancer. In practice, uptake was modest and largely confined to specialized centers due to significant toxicities, slow disease progression in some subtypes, and later competition.
- Cabozantinib (Cometriq), another multi-kinase inhibitor with potent Ret activity also targeting VEGFR2 and MET, was approved for medullary thyroid cancer in 2012. It gained wider use than vandetanib for more aggressive disease, in part due to its broader kinase profile and perceived impact on metastatic burden and pain control.
- Both drugs demonstrated that targeting Ret could produce clinically meaningful responses, but also highlighted that selective Ret inhibition alone might be insufficient for durable control and could lead to resistance. In practice, broad multi-kinase effects drove much of the clinical benefit—consistent with Shokat's Drosophila findings about polypharmacology.

**Targeted therapies and trials:**
- Subsequent trials explored selective Ret inhibitors versus multitargeted agents, particularly as genomic profiling identified Ret fusions and activating mutations in thyroid, lung, and other cancers. Selpercatinib (Retevmo) and pralsetinib (Gavreto), highly selective Ret inhibitors, later achieved FDA approval (2020) based on strong efficacy and better tolerability than earlier multi-kinase drugs. Their development aligned with a broader shift toward biomarker-driven, tumor-agnostic approvals.
- Clinical practice evolved to reserve vandetanib and cabozantinib for cases without access to or progression on selective Ret inhibitors, or in specific contexts where broader pathway inhibition (e.g., concurrent VEGF or MET blockade) remained desirable.
- The experience underscored that even "targeted" therapies often rely on off-target polypharmacology for efficacy, and that narrow selectivity could sometimes yield weaker or less durable responses—echoing the Drosophila results Shokat presented in 2013.

**Scientific method and adoption:**
- Phenotypic screening in model organisms (including Drosophila) continued to be used in drug discovery, often revealing unexpected mechanisms and necessary polypharmacology that target-focused screens can miss.
- Shokat's emphasis on "kinase fingerprints" (the exact pattern of on-target and off-target activities needed for efficacy) influenced efforts to profile compounds broadly across the kinome, rather than optimizing solely for single-target potency.
- The field moved toward more nuanced views of kinase inhibitor mechanism, acknowledging that efficacy often depends on hitting not just the primary target but also adjacent nodes (e.g., Raf, TOR, Src) to modulate compensatory pathways or overcome resistance.

**Business and policy:**
- Companies pursuing highly selective Ret inhibitors generally aimed for narrower indications and smaller markets compared to multi-kinase drugs, though accelerated approvals and companion diagnostics helped drive uptake.
- Policy shifts encouraged tumor-agnostic development for targets like Ret fusions, enabling smaller trials focused on molecularly defined populations.

The Drosophila screen Shokat described ultimately reflected a scientific principle (polypharmacology shapes in vivo efficacy) that was borne out repeatedly in the clinic, even as newer, more selective inhibitors offered improved toxicity profiles for certain patients.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The commentary itself did not make explicit predictions, but the underlying work implied several points that could be evaluated against subsequent developments:
- **Implicit premise: "Tiny critters" like fruit flies can reveal kinase polypharmacology required for in vivo efficacy.**
  - **Outcome:** Model organisms (including Drosophila, zebrafish, and C. elegans) continued to be deployed for phenotypic screening and mechanism-of-action studies, often uncovering critical off-target effects or pathway dependencies that cell-based or biochemically pure screens miss. In parallel, systematic kinome-wide profiling became standard practice, enabling researchers to identify "activity fingerprints" empirically.
- **Implicit premise: Targeting Ret kinase in thyroid cancer is therapeutically relevant.**
  - **Outcome:** Validated by both multi-kinase drugs (vandetanib, cabozantinib) and later selective Ret inhibitors (selpercatinib, pralsetinib). The Ret pathway has proven to be a clinically actionable target in thyroid cancer and other solid tumors.
- **Implicit premise: Polypharmacology—hitting Raf and TOR in addition to Ret—is necessary for desired phenotype.**
  - **Outcome:** Paradigm largely upheld in the clinic. Multi-kinase inhibitors with Ret plus VEGFR/MET/Raf activity show broader and often more durable efficacy than early single-target ambitions suggested. Highly selective Ret inhibitors produced compelling response rates in biomarker-selected patients but resistance can emerge, and combinations or broader pathway coverage are being explored in certain contexts.
- **Implicit premise: Screening in living systems will be increasingly valuable.**
  - **Outcome:** Phenotypic screening, including in small model organisms, maintained a key role in drug discovery, complementing purely target-based approaches.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an insightful scientific approach whose lessons about polypharmacology were repeatedly validated in clinical practice, yet the topic remains somewhat niche and the direct impact is not transformative beyond oncology kinase inhibitor development. The commentary is solid but intermediate in long-term importance.
