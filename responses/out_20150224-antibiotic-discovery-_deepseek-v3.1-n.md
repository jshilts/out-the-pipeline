# An Antibiotic Discovery Prize (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Ezekiel Emanuel's 2015 proposal, published in the New York Times, for the U.S. government (potentially in cooperation with the EU and Japan) to offer a $2 billion prize to the first five companies or academic centers that develop and gain regulatory approval for a new class of antibiotics. The author endorses this as a good idea, suggesting it represents a reasonable minimum investment—far more realistic than a previous £1 million proposal from 2013. The author adds that to maximize impact, requirements could be tightened to require a new mechanism of action specifically against gram-negative organisms, since targeting gram-positive bacteria is both easier and less critical given clinical needs. The pitch rule leverages prize mechanisms, like those used by the XPrize foundation, to catalyze novel research teams and approaches in a field where traditional market incentives have faltered. Regulatory approval is set as the appropriate endpoint to ensure real-world applicability.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2015 proposal, a large, government-backed antibiotic discovery prize on the scale envisioned was not implemented. Instead, the policy and funding landscape evolved along different lines. In the U.S., the GAIN (Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now) Act provisions, enacted in 2012, continued to be the primary legislative lever, offering extended exclusivity (5 extra years) and fast-track pathways for qualifying antibiotics. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and FDA guidance changes aimed to streamline and modernize clinical trial designs for antibiotics, but did not create a massive prize purse. Internationally, the UK piloted a "subscription-style" pull incentive starting in 2019–2020 (paying suppliers a fixed annual fee based on a drug's value to the NHS, independent of volume), which has since expanded; other European nations and the U.S. began exploring similar models. CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator), launched in 2016 as a public-private partnership, became a major funder of early-stage antibiotic R&D, providing grants and support to biotech companies to advance candidates toward clinical proof-of-concept. The DRIVE-AB consortium, funded by IMI and active until 2018, focused on roadmaps for pull incentives. On the approval front, a small number of new antibiotic classes reached the market (e.g., the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime-avibactam and cefiderocol), but their commercial uptake was often limited due to stewardship pressures and pricing challenges, with several developers declaring bankruptcy or exiting the space post-approval (e.g., Achaogen and Melinta). Globally, AMR remained a major public health threat, but the policy response shifted toward hybrid incentive models rather than winner-take-all grand prizes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction: A large prize for a new class of antibiotics would catalyze hundreds of unexpected research teams and novel approaches.**
  - **Outcome:** This specific prize fund was not established, so there was no direct test. However, the rise of CARB-X funding and other smaller inducement prizes did help sustain early-stage research. No explosion of "hundreds of unexpected teams" materialized, but focused R&D support did advance some candidates.

- **Prediction: Setting regulatory approval as the endpoint would make the investment worthwhile and drive unusual, creative efforts.**
  - **Outcome:** Subsequent years showed that achieving regulatory approval alone was insufficient; post-approval market access and reimbursement challenges meant approved antibiotics often failed commercially, discouraging investment more than regulatory gate-keeping did.

- **Prediction: Tightening requirements to a new mechanism against gram-negative organisms would be valuable.**
  - **Outcome:** Several gram-negative antibiotics did eventually receive FDA approval, but none introduced a truly novel mechanism along the lines of the first new class in decades; most were iterations or combinations. Few genuine "new class" breakthroughs targeting gram-negatives reached approval.

- **Prediction: The prestige and mission-driven incentives of a prize would help focus R&D efforts.**
  - **Outcome:** Policy efforts shifted toward economic "pull" mechanisms (e.g., subscription models) rather than prestige-driven prizes, reflecting wider recognition that market failures and reimbursement, not just a lack of motivation, were blocking sustainable pipelines.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlights a concrete policy idea in a critical public health area that generated substantial debate. While the proposed prize was not implemented, it prefigured later pull-incentive proposals and helps illuminate the gap between innovation prizes and the structural market failures that continued to limit antibiotic R&D.
