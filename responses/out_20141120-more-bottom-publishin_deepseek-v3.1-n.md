# More From The Bottom of the Publishing Barrel (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes an Australian engineer who submitted a deliberately absurd paper titled "Get Me Off Your F*#&ing Mailing List" to a supposedly predatory journal, *The International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology*. The entire paper consisted only of that phrase repeated throughout. Despite its obviously bogus nature, the journal accepted the paper for publication with "minor revisions" and an "Excellent" rating from its reviewer, requesting only a $150 publication fee from someone named Tej Pal Singh.

The context indicates this was part of exposing predatory publishing practices, where fake journals solicit academic papers primarily to collect publication fees without providing legitimate peer review or editorial standards. The engineer's stunt aimed to demonstrate how easily these operations would accept and "praise" even nonsensical content.

## 2. HISTORY
This 2014 incident became one of the most famous cases exposing predatory publishing, and its aftermath significantly influenced the discourse around academic publishing integrity:

**Immediate Impact**: The paper itself became a viral phenomenon in academic circles, frequently cited in discussions about predatory journals. While never actually published (the author didn't pay the fee), the acceptance letter and correspondence became widely circulated evidence.

**Publication and Citations**: Ironically, a version of this paper was later published in 2015 in the legitimate *International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology* (different journal, legitimate), but as a satirical piece with proper context. The original story remains frequently referenced in academic integrity literature.

**Policy Changes**: This incident contributed to heightened awareness that prompted:
- Greater scrutiny by academic institutions of where their researchers publish
- Increased training for early-career researchers about identifying predatory publishers
- More systematic efforts to blacklist predatory journals, though formal regulatory action remained limited
- Discussion about the "publish or perish" culture that drives researchers toward questionable venues

**Business Impact**: Major predatory publishers like OMICS (which owned hundreds of suspicious journals) faced increased legal and regulatory pressure, culminating in a 2019 U.S. FTC ruling ordering OMICS to pay $50 million for deceptive practices. However, the predatory publishing industry continued growing, with estimates suggesting thousands of such journals still operating.

**Scientific Community Response**: The case accelerated the development of better predatory journal identification tools, institutional warnings, and educational campaigns. However, the fundamental problem persisted, with studies showing continued proliferation of predatory journals and conferences.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original article made no explicit predictions about future developments - it was primarily reporting on a current incident and using it to critique predatory publishing practices. No specific claims were made about how this would evolve or what broader consequences might follow.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This ranks in the 70-80th percentile of interest because while it captured an important academic integrity issue through a memorable stunt and had measurable impact on awareness and policies, its broader implications were more technical and field-specific than transformative for biotechnology research practices.
