# Strychnine! And Monty Python. Chemists, In Other Words (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This short blog-style article serves as a lighthearted Friday reading recommendation. The author highlights an entertaining blog post from ChemBark that curates chemistry papers beginning with dramatic or bizarre opening lines. The article positions this as "fun" content showcasing the chemistry community's ability to inject personality into scientific writing. The author expresses appreciation for the examples provided and playfully commits to attempting similarly creative openings in future manuscripts, acknowledging potential resistance from co-authors.

## 2. HISTORY
This article functions primarily as a content pointer with no direct subsequent developments to track. The ChemBark blog (chembark.com) continued operating as a chemistry community blog focused on scientific publishing, chemistry careers, and community discussions. The broader trend toward scientists and academics maintaining blogs gained momentum in subsequent years, with many chemists and researchers using platforms like WordPress, Medium, and Twitter to share insights, commentary, and informal scientific communication. However, this specific article had no commercial, regulatory, or policy implications that would generate measurable downstream impact. The referenced blog post about dramatic paper openings remained an amusing footnote in chemistry community discussions rather than catalyzing any significant movement or change.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No predictions were made in this article. The content is purely observational and recreational in nature.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
While charming in its celebration of scientific humor and community engagement, this article represents lightweight blog content without substantive scientific, technological, or policy implications. Its interest is largely limited to chemistry community insiders and has minimal broader significance.
