# Open Pharma? (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2009 commentary responds to remarks by Paul Stoffels, then head of R&D at Johnson & Johnson, advocating for "open innovation" in pharmaceutical research. The article critically examines two key claims: first, Stoffels' assertion that "all simple diseases have been solved" and that future drug development requires addressing much more complex medical needs; second, his promotion of network-based collaborative models for drug discovery, drawing analogies to open-source software development.

The author expresses skepticism on both points. Regarding "simple diseases," the commentary argues that few diseases have truly been "solved" (beyond smallpox and polio), with most treatments representing improvements rather than cures. Regarding open innovation networks, the author questions whether the crucial information needed for drug development—particularly toxicology data and safety signals—can actually be found through external collaborations, highlighting the significant infrastructure barriers (NMR machines, animal labs, compound repositories) that make pharmaceutical research fundamentally different from software development.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent developments largely validated both the promise and limitations highlighted in this article:

**Open Innovation Models Evolved**: The 2010s saw pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopt various forms of collaboration, but the most successful models were more targeted and structured than the vague "open innovation" concept described in 2009. Notable examples include:
- Pfizer's Centers for Therapeutic Innovation (launched 2010)
- GlaxoSmithKline's open lab in Tres Cantos, Spain for tropical diseases
- Sanofi's partnership with academic institutions through its "open innovation" portal
- The rise of public-private partnerships like the Structural Genomics Consortium and various pre-competitive consortia

**Drug Discovery Complexity Increased**: The prediction about complex diseases proved accurate. The 2010-2020 period saw:
- Significant growth in biologics, gene therapies, and cell therapies addressing complex mechanisms
- Increasing focus on rare diseases and personalized medicine
- Continued high failure rates in Phase II and Phase III trials, validating the article's concerns about predictability

**Infrastructure Barriers Persisted**: The commentary's skepticism about distributed drug discovery proved largely correct. While computational approaches and AI have grown (particularly post-2015), the physical infrastructure of drug development—manufacturing facilities, specialized equipment, regulatory expertise—remained concentrated in traditional pharmaceutical companies and CROs.

**Exubera's Lesson Resonated**: The inhaled insulin failure mentioned in the article became a cautionary case study in underestimating complexity, with subsequent attempts at alternative insulin delivery (Afrezza in 2014) also struggling with commercial adoption despite FDA approval.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"All simple diseases have been solved"**: ✓ **Mixed accuracy**.
  - Correct that pharmaceutical focus shifted toward more complex diseases (rare diseases, personalized oncology, complex chronic conditions)
  - However, "simple diseases" continue to present challenges: antibiotic resistance, metabolic diseases requiring better therapies, and new infectious disease threats (COVID-19 demonstrated this dramatically in 2020)

- **Network-based drug discovery as the future**: ✓ **Partially realized, but with caveats**.
  - Pharmaceutical companies did increase external collaborations through the 2010s
  - However, these were typically structured partnerships rather than truly "open" models
  - The most effective collaborations were pre-competitive (early research) rather than late-stage development
  - The infrastructure barriers proved real: drug discovery remained capital-intensive and concentrated

- **Traditional drug discovery limitations would persist**: ✓ **Accurate**.
  - High failure rates in Phase II/III trials continued through the 2010s
  - Toxicology prediction remained challenging despite advances in computational methods
  - Group thinking and confirmation bias continued to affect pharmaceutical R&D decision-making

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article demonstrates good scientific skepticism and raises important questions about collaboration models in pharmaceutical R&D, though it primarily engages with industry rhetoric rather than deep scientific developments.
