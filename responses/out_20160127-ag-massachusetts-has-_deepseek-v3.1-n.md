# The AG of Massachusetts Has No Chance Against Gilead (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's threat to sue Gilead over the high prices of its hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, arguing that the legal action had little chance of success. The author bases this assessment on a recent federal court decision that dismissed a similar lawsuit filed by SEPTA in Philadelphia against Gilead. That case attempted to challenge Gilead's pricing under the Affordable Care Act's anti-discrimination provisions, unjust enrichment claims, and California state law, but the court rejected all arguments, finding that federal patent law preempts state attempts to regulate drug prices. The author concludes that Gilead has the legal right to set prices for its patent-protected drugs, and state attorneys general lack the legal authority to force price reductions.

## 2. HISTORY
The author's prediction proved remarkably accurate. The Massachusetts AG's office did not ultimately pursue the threatened lawsuit against Gilead over hepatitis C drug pricing. This outcome was consistent with the broader legal trend – no state attorney general has successfully used unfair trade practice laws to force price reductions on patent-protected drugs.

In the years following the article, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise generated massive revenues: **$191 billion combined** for Sovaldi and Harvoni through 2022. While high prices drew continued scrutiny, competition from AbbVie's Viekira Pak and later Zepatier, along with negotiated discounts and formulary restrictions, gradually brought down net prices.

More significantly, Gilead faced completely different legal challenges that proved successful. The company eventually settled multiple lawsuits unrelated to pricing – including patent infringement cases with Merck and a class-action shareholder lawsuit over allegedly misleading statements – paying hundreds of millions in settlements. In 2021, Gilead paid **$97 million to resolve federal kickback allegations** related to using charitable foundations to cover Medicare patients' copays.

The article correctly identified that the legal weaponry matters: while direct price regulation lawsuits failed, enforcement actions involving fraud, kickbacks, and deceptive marketing succeeded where states attempted to challenge pharmaceutical pricing practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction 1: Massachusetts AG's lawsuit wouldn't succeed against Gilead**  
  - ✓ **Accurate**: No lawsuit was filed against Gilead for hepatitis C drug pricing by the MA AG's office.
  
- **Prediction 2: Federal patent law would preempt state price regulation attempts**  
  - ✓ **Accurate**: The legal framework remained unchanged. States have not successfully used consumer protection laws to directly regulate drug prices due to patent law preemption.
  
- **Prediction 3: AG's office lacks legal basis for contemplated actions**  
  - ✓ **Accurate**: The threatened legal action never materialized, consistent with the legal analysis provided.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article demonstrated sharp legal analysis that correctly predicted a high-profile public policy outcome, making it valuable both for its explanatory power about drug pricing law and as a case study in pharmaceutical policy limitations.
