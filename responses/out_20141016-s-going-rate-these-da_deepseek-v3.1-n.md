# What's The Going Rate These Days? (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article serves as a community data-gathering post asking for anonymous salary information for medicinal chemists in the Boston/Cambridge biotech hub. Written during a period of increased hiring activity, the author acknowledges it had "been a while" since salary discussions were relevant, indicating a potential recovery in the job market. The piece invites both job applicants and companies to share salary data to help establish fair compensation benchmarks, recognizing the mutual interest both sides have in understanding market rates. The call for information extends beyond the Boston/Cambridge area to include other regions and different experience levels.

## 2. HISTORY

This October 2014 article appeared during a significant biotech industry expansion. The period from 2014-2015 marked a biotech boom driven by increased venture capital funding, successful IPOs, and growing pharmaceutical R&D investment. The Boston/Cambridge area specifically experienced substantial growth in biotech employment during this period, with many companies expanding their medicinal chemistry and drug discovery operations. However, the biotech sector faced market corrections in 2015-2016, and experienced further volatility in subsequent years due to various factors including regulatory changes, pricing pressures, and shifts in investment patterns. The demand for medicinal chemists has continued to evolve with the changing biopharmaceutical landscape, including the rise of new therapeutic modalities and the impact of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains minimal specific predictions about future salary trends or market conditions. It primarily serves as a snapshot of the market at that moment rather than forward-looking analysis. The implicit suggestion that hiring activity was increasing in late 2014 did reflect accurate assessment of the biotech hiring climate at that time, which did see continued growth into 2015 before experiencing some correction in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article ranks in the lower tier of interest because it primarily serves as a community discussion starter about salary data rather than providing substantive analysis of biotechnology developments, scientific breakthroughs, or industry trends with lasting importance.
