# New York Times on Drug Discovery (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The New York Times Magazine published an article examining why so few new drugs were being invented, highlighting the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry's drug discovery pipeline. The Science.org blog post notes that the concepts of genomics and target-based drug discovery might be too tightly linked in the magazine piece, but acknowledges this was necessary given the need to cover complex topics for a general audience. The article appears to have focused on the disconnect between scientific promise and actual drug output, exploring how advanced technologies like genomics were expected to revolutionize drug development but hadn't yet delivered on those expectations.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at drug discovery trends from 2014 to the present:

**Regulatory Outcomes**: The FDA approved between 22-59 new drugs annually from 2014-2023, with particularly strong years in 2018 (59 approvals) and 2023 (55 approvals), suggesting the "pipeline problem" may have been cyclical rather than structural.

**Targeted Therapies Reality**: While genomics did enable some breakthrough therapies (CAR-T cells approved in 2017, various targeted cancer drugs), the bottleneck shifted rather than disappeared - from target identification to delivery mechanisms, manufacturing complexity, and patient stratification.

**Industry Response**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly focused on rare diseases and oncology, where genomics provided clearer therapeutic targets, rather than complex polygenic diseases that proved more challenging. Major companies continued large-scale mergers and acquisitions as an alternative to internal R&D productivity.

**Technological Evolution**: The field moved toward combination approaches rather than single-target magic bullets, with immunotherapy and precision medicine becoming dominant paradigms. The cost and complexity of drug development continued rising, with average R&D costs per drug exceeding $2.8 billion by some estimates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article's implied predictions about drug discovery productivity appear to have been partially accurate:
- Genomics did not immediately solve drug discovery bottlenecks as optimistically hoped in earlier decades
- The fundamental challenges of pharmaceutical R&D proved more persistent than expected
- However, steady FDA approval rates from 2014-2023 suggest the "problem" was perhaps overstated or that industry adapted through different strategies (orphan drugs, biologics, partnerships)

## 4. INTEREST

**6/9**

This article tackled a genuine and persistent challenge in pharmaceutical innovation, though the issue proved to be more about productivity measurement and changing industry dynamics rather than an absolute decline. The intersection of scientific promise versus commercial reality remains highly relevant, even if the specific framing in 2014 reflected that particular moment's concerns.
