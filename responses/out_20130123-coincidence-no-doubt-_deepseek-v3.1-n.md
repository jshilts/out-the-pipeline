# Coincidence, No Doubt. Well, Some Doubt. (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from *Science* magazine's blog highlights a case of alleged plagiarism in the chemistry literature. Derek Lowe points to two papers—one from 2009 authored by Valerie Pierre of the University of Minnesota, and another from 2013—that appear to be substantially similar according to chemist Shawn Burdette. The later paper cited Pierre's work only peripherally (reference 14d), suggesting inadequate attribution for what appeared to be duplicated content.

## 2. HISTORY

Follow-up investigation of these specific papers shows that this case appears to have remained at the level of academic dispute rather than escalating to institutional investigations or formal retractions that entered the public record. The 2013 paper in question (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201202925) remains available in Wiley's *Chemistry—A European Journal* as published.

Looking at broader patterns, this article appeared during a period of increased attention to research integrity issues. In the years following 2013, numerous high-profile retractions occurred across chemistry and biomedical fields, including cases involving image manipulation, data fabrication, and plagiarism. Journals and institutions have since implemented more systematic screening tools (such as plagiarism-detection software and image-analysis tools), but systematic plagiarism and problematic citations remain persistent problems in academic publishing.

Valerie Pierre continued her career at the University of Minnesota, maintaining an active research program in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, suggesting no lasting professional damage from this incident.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself makes no explicit predictions about future developments. Its purpose is primarily to document and comment on a specific instance of alleged academic misconduct rather than to forecast trends in research integrity or publishing practices.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This post documents a real integrity concern and exemplifies ongoing issues in academic publishing, but similar cases appear regularly and this particular instance did not trigger major policy changes or broader reform movements. While such incidents remain important for the affected researchers, this case did not prove particularly consequential beyond the immediate parties involved.
