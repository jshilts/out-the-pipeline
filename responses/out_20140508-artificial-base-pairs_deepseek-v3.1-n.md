# Artificial Base Pairs in Living Cells (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a breakthrough paper from the Romesburg group at Scripps, published in Nature, reporting the first successful engineering of an organism with a working unnatural base pair (d5SICS and dNaM). Unlike traditional AT/CG base pairing that relies on hydrogen bonding, this synthetic pair uses hydrophobic interactions discovered through screening thousands of candidate combinations. The researchers overcame several technical hurdles: supplying the unnatural nucleoside triphosphates inside Escherichia coli cells (achieved using an algal transporter), ensuring endogenous polymerases could faithfully replicate DNA containing the unnatural base pair, and preventing cellular DNA repair mechanisms from recognizing and excising the synthetic bases as errors.

The article notes that Romesburg founded Synthorx to commercialize the technology, with potential applications in assay development and chemical biology. It also acknowledges criticism of press coverage surrounding the paper, suggesting media reporting lacked proper scientific nuance.

## 2. HISTORY

The Romesburg lab's 2014 breakthrough marked a significant milestone, but practical applications evolved more slowly than initial enthusiasm might have suggested. **Synthorx**, the company founded to commercialize the technology, pursued a pivot from synthetic biology tool development toward therapeutic applications. Rather than focusing on creating organisms with expanded genetic alphabets for basic research, the company redirected its platform toward engineering novel protein therapeutics with enhanced properties like longer half-life, improved stability, and reduced immunogenicity.

Synthorx's most advanced program became **THOR-707**, a novel IL-2 analog designed to selectively activate CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells while avoiding regulatory T cell expansion - addressing a key limitation of native IL-2 cancer immunotherapy. In 2018, Synthorx went public (Nasdaq: THOR), and in December 2019, the company was acquired by **Sanofi for approximately $2.5 billion**, representing a significant return for investors and validating the commercial potential, though this valuation primarily reflected the therapeutic pipeline rather than widespread adoption of synthetic base pair technology in routine research.

**Technical developments** continued: subsequent work improved the unnatural base pair system's efficiency and fidelity, and researchers demonstrated additional applications including site-specific incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins. However, widespread adoption among basic research laboratories remained limited - the technology requires specialized expertise, and the necessity of providing unnatural nucleoside triphosphates externally created practical barriers compared to standard molecular biology techniques.

No FDA-approved drugs emerged directly from organisms containing synthetic base pairs themselves, nor did public policy significantly shift regarding genetic modification frameworks. The technology's primary impact was validating that genetic alphabet expansion is possible in living cells, rather than immediately enabling routine industrial or clinical applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made explicit and implicit predictions about the technology's trajectory:

• **"Assay development possibilities...with very high signal/noise ratios"** - This prediction partially materialized but in a different direction than implied. Rather than becoming a routine tool for diagnostic assays, the technology found application in engineering protein therapeutics with enhanced properties, though not widely adopted for general assay development as initially envisioned.

• **Implicit prediction of near-term research applications** - The technology was not widely adopted in routine molecular biology research. While scientifically successful, it remained primarily within specialized labs rather than becoming a standard tool, due to practical implementation challenges including the need to supply synthetic nucleotides.

• **Broad adoption in synthetic biology** - Widespread adoption didn't occur as envisioned. Most synthetic biology continues using standard genetic alphabets. The expansion remains academically interesting but practically challenging for routine use.

• **Company success trajectory** - Synthorx indeed succeeded commercially, but through pivoting toward therapeutic protein engineering rather than synthetic base pair tool development as originally conceived. The $2.5 billion acquisition validated commercial potential but reflected different applications than initially imagined.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article highlights a genuine scientific milestone that demonstrated synthetic biology's potential for expanding fundamental biological machinery. While practical applications evolved differently than initially envisioned, the work opened new conceptual possibilities in genetic engineering and ultimately generated significant commercial value through Synthorx's acquisition, representing successful translation from basic discovery to clinical programs.
