# Two Diabetes Drug Mysteries (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses two surprising clinical findings about SGLT-2 inhibitors, a class of diabetes drugs that work by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, causing excess glucose to be excreted in urine. The first mystery involves Jardiance (empagliflozin), which demonstrated remarkable cardiovascular benefits—reducing cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations—but these benefits couldn't be explained by traditional risk factors like HbA1c reduction, LDL cholesterol, or blood pressure changes. The second mystery involves Invokana (canagliflozin), which showed similar cardiovascular benefits but also revealed an unexpected increased risk of amputation in patients, a side effect not seen with other SGLT-2 inhibitors. The author emphasizes that clinical trials often miss longer-term or subtle effects that only emerge when drugs are used in larger, real-world populations.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2017 article, significant developments occurred with SGLT-2 inhibitors:

**Jardiance (empagliflozin)** received expanded FDA approval for cardiovascular indications based on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data. The drug gained widespread clinical adoption not just for diabetes management but as a cardiovascular-protective agent. The unexplained cardiovascular benefits led to extensive research into potential mechanisms, including effects on cardiac metabolism, hemodynamics, and inflammation.

**The amputation risk with Invokana** triggered FDA warnings and label updates in 2017. Subsequent real-world studies confirmed this signal, leading to recommendations for careful patient selection and monitoring. This risk appeared specific to canagliflozin, as other SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) did not show similar signals in large outcomes trials.

**SGLT-2 inhibitors expanded into heart failure treatment**, receiving FDA approval for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) regardless of diabetes status—a major therapeutic breakthrough. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin both demonstrated significant reductions in heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death in landmark trials (DAPA-HF, EMPEROR-Reduced).

**The class also showed kidney protective effects**, leading to approvals for chronic kidney disease treatment. The 2020s saw SGLT-2 inhibitors become guideline-recommended therapy for multiple conditions beyond diabetes, with broad uptake in cardiology and nephrology practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction that these cardiovascular benefits might represent unknown biological mechanisms**: This proved accurate. The mechanistic mystery persisted; while several theories emerged (effects on cardiac energetics, myocardial sodium-hydrogen exchange, fibrosis reduction, hemodynamic effects), no single mechanism fully explained the breadth of cardiovascular benefits. The drugs' pleiotropic effects became an active area of ongoing research.

**• Implication that clinical trials would continue revealing surprises in real-world use**: Correct. Post-marketing surveillance identified additional considerations including rare cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (especially in specific populations), volume depletion effects, and the need for careful patient selection—confirming that real-world evidence complements trial data.

**• Prediction about Invokana's amputation risk requiring ongoing monitoring**: Confirmed. The distinctive amputation risk with canagliflozin held up in subsequent observational studies, leading to continued warnings and influencing prescribing patterns.

**• Broader prediction about undiscovered biological mechanisms**: The SGLT-2 saga validated this insight. The drugs' success across multiple organ systems (heart, kidneys) highlighted how incomplete our understanding of metabolism and organ crosstalk remains, spurring research into metabolic modulation beyond traditional pathways.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when SGLT-2 inhibitors evolved from diabetes drugs into multi-organ protective agents, fundamentally reshaping treatment paradigms across cardiology, nephrology, and endocrinology. The prescient focus on unexplained mechanisms and real-world surprises proved highly relevant as these drugs achieved blockbuster status with broad therapeutic impact.
