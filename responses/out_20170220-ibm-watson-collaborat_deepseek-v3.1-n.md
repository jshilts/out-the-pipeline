# An IBM-Watson Collaboration Goes Under (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on the collapse of a cancer research collaboration between IBM's Watson AI system and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which had been announced in 2013. The partnership, intended to apply Watson's machine learning capabilities to cancer diagnosis and treatment, had already cost M.D. Anderson $39.2 million paid to IBM plus $21.2 million to PricewaterhouseCoopers for business planning. The author notes this was unusual since research centers typically get paid by companies rather than paying them. Concerns are raised about funding irregularities, with reports that $50 million came from Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho (under DOJ investigation) and that MD Anderson's executive Lynda Chin bypassed normal approval procedures. In contrast, a similar Watson collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering appeared more successful, reportedly launching an actual product with Quest Diagnostics.

## 2. HISTORY
**IBM Watson Health's trajectory**: Following this 2017 report, IBM Watson Health continued operations but faced mounting criticism and commercial challenges. Multiple investigations revealed that Watson for Oncology often provided inaccurate or unsafe treatment recommendations, with internal documents showing the system was trained on "synthetic" or hypothetical cancer cases rather than real patient data. Hospitals including Jupiter Medical Center in Florida abandoned Watson implementations due to poor performance and workflow integration issues.

**Business outcome**: In January 2022, IBM sold Watson Health to private equity firm Francisco Partners for approximately $1 billion, significantly below the $4 billion IBM had invested since 2015. The sale marked IBM's retreat from ambitious healthcare AI applications, with the company refocusing on enterprise AI rather than clinical decision support.

**M.D. Anderson fallout**: The collaboration's failure was part of broader issues at the institution. Subsequent reporting confirmed funding irregularities, and the episode contributed to scrutiny of technology partnership governance in academic medical centers. No successful clinical product emerged from the $60+ million investment.

**Industry impact**: The Watson Health saga became a cautionary tale about AI hype in medicine, demonstrating that sophisticated technology alone cannot overcome data quality challenges, workflow integration issues, and the complexity of clinical decision-making. Healthcare AI development shifted toward more focused applications rather than broad diagnostic systems.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Article's implicit prediction about Sloan-Kettering collaboration**: The author noted that the Memorial Sloan-Kettering partnership "seem[ed] to be in the process of launching an actual product" and suggested this might be more successful than Anderson's. **Outcome**: This partnership also failed to deliver substantial clinical value; Watson for Oncology never achieved widespread adoption or demonstrated clear clinical benefits despite IBM's marketing claims.

• **Article's skepticism about Watson's healthcare applications**: The author expressed general skepticism about IBM's Watson healthcare claims, having written critically about them since 2013. **Outcome**: This skepticism proved prescient; Watson Health never successfully commercialized most promised applications, culminating in IBM's 2022 sale at a significant loss on invested capital.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article has proven highly relevant as an early indicator of AI hype's collision with healthcare reality, offering valuable lessons about technology implementation challenges and governance failures in academic-industry partnerships that remain pertinent as AI adoption in medicine continues.
