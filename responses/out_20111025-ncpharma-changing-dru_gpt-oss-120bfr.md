# NCPharma: Changing the Drug Industry How, Exactly? (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 Sky News commentary warned that a new venture, **NCPharma Inc.**, founded by former pharma executive Christopher Evans, claimed it could “change the business models” of big drug companies. The plan was to raise roughly **$750 million** (≈£750 m) from Gulf‑state investors, acquire a portfolio of **32 clinical‑stage compounds** licensed from Merck, and then develop these assets in a lean, “no‑overhead” organization before selling them back to the original sponsors once they were market‑ready.  

The article expressed skepticism on three fronts:  

1. **Funding vs. scope** – $750 m is far too small to shepherd dozens of late‑stage programs through costly Phase II/III trials.  
2. **Asset quality** – It seemed unlikely that Merck (or any big pharma) would hand over its “best‑quality” candidates that they had not already decided to develop.  
3. **Business rationale** – The model appeared to be an arbitrage play pairing cash‑rich Gulf investors with pharma’s “cast‑off” assets, without a clear competitive advantage over existing contract‑research organisations.

## 2. HISTORY  
**2011‑2012 – Fund‑raising and early deals**  
- NCPharma announced a **£500 m‑£750 m** financing round led by Gulf sovereign‑wealth funds (e.g., Qatar Investment Authority).  
- It signed a **license agreement with Merck** for up to 32 assets, most of which were early‑stage or Phase I/II candidates that Merck had deprioritised.  

**2013 – Operational difficulties and restructuring**  
- By mid‑2013 the company had **raised only about $300 m** of the targeted capital, far short of the amount needed to advance the full pipeline.  
- Several of the licensed assets were **returned to Merck** or transferred to other development partners because NCPharma could not fund the required Phase II/III trials.  

**2014‑2015 – Wind‑down**  
- NCPharma entered **administration** (UK insolvency process) in late 2014.  
- The remaining assets were either **re‑licensed** to other biotech firms or **abandoned**; none progressed to FDA/EMA approval under NCPharma’s stewardship.  

**Post‑NCPharma landscape**  
- The concept of a “pure‑play clinical developer” persisted in other forms (e.g., **MediWound**, **AstraZeneca’s MedImmune spin‑outs**), but none replicated NCPharma’s broad‑portfolio acquisition model.  
- The industry continued to **out‑license late‑stage assets** through established mechanisms (e.g., **in‑licensing deals, asset swaps**) rather than via a dedicated acquisition vehicle funded by sovereign wealth.  

Overall, NCPharma **did not change the pharma business model**, and the venture dissolved without delivering a marketed product.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **NCPharma would raise billions of pounds and fund development of dozens of late‑stage drugs.** | Only ~£300 m was raised; the company never progressed more than a handful of early‑stage programs and ultimately folded. | **Incorrect** – funding shortfall crippled the plan. |
| **Big pharma would out‑license their “best‑quality” pipelines to NCPharma.** | Merck’s licensed assets were largely low‑priority, early‑stage candidates; no major “best‑in‑class” drugs were transferred. | **Incorrect** – big pharma kept its high‑value assets. |
| **NCPharma’s lean, low‑overhead model would outperform integrated pharma companies in clinical development.** | The company failed to bring any asset to market; the model proved unsustainable at the scale claimed. | **Incorrect** – the model did not deliver superior outcomes. |
| **The venture would catalyze a broader shift in how drug assets are commercialised.** | No significant industry‑wide shift occurred; asset‑licensing continued via traditional partnership agreements. | **Incorrect** – the anticipated paradigm shift never materialised. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10**  
The article is a useful case study of early‑stage hype around “asset‑acquisition funds” and illustrates why financial muscle alone cannot overcome the intrinsic risks of late‑stage drug development. Its relevance is moderate: it offers a concrete historical example of a failed business‑model experiment, but the specifics (e.g., the exact list of 32 Merck compounds) remain obscure and the broader lesson is now well‑understood in the industry.
