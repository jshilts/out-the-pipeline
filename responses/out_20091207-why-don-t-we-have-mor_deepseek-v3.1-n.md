# Why Don't We Have More Protein-Protein Drug Molecules? (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2009 commentary discusses the pharmaceutical industry's limited success in developing drugs that target protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The author notes that nearly all marketed drugs at the time targeted small-molecule binding sites on proteins, while PPIs—which occur across broader protein surfaces rather than well-defined pockets—remained largely undruggable despite their biological importance.

The article highlights Bcl inhibitors, particularly Abbott's ABT-737, as rare success stories in PPI modulation. It explores technical barriers including inadequate compound libraries not optimized for PPI screens, with PPI inhibitors tending toward higher molecular weight and greater lipophilicity. Research analyzing 66 structurally diverse PPI inhibitors versus traditional drugs confirmed these trends: PPIs tended to be larger and "greasier," with shape descriptors and aromatic ring content providing some discriminatory power. The fundamental questions remain unresolved: whether PPI targets require large, complex molecules or can be addressed with reasonably-sized compounds, and whether specific structural features could improve success rates in identifying lead series.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2009, the PPI drug discovery field has evolved significantly, though many challenges persist:

**Clinical Successes**: Several PPI-targeting drugs achieved FDA approval. Venetoclax (a Bcl-2 inhibitor), the clinical successor to ABT-737 mentioned in the article, received FDA approval in 2016 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has become a blockbuster drug with broad clinical uptake. Other notable successes include selinexor (XPO1 inhibitor, approved 2019) and lenalidomide/pomalidomide (cereblon modulators affecting PPIs through protein degradation).

**Technology Advances**: Fragment-based drug discovery emerged as an effective strategy for PPI targets, with libraries of smaller fragments (molecular weight 120-300 Da) helping identify starting points that could be optimized. Structure-based drug design capabilities dramatically improved with cryo-electron microscopy enabling characterization of previously intractable protein complexes. Computational approaches like molecular dynamics simulations and AI-based binding prediction became valuable tools.

**Industry Adoption**: Major pharmaceutical companies established dedicated PPI drug discovery programs. The approach gained broader acceptance with increased understanding that PPIs represent approximately 650,000 potential drug targets in the human interactome, far exceeding traditional enzyme or receptor targets.

**Persistent Challenges**: Despite progress, PPI drug discovery remains difficult. Success rates remain lower than for traditional targets, and many programs fail due to insufficient binding affinity, poor pharmacokinetics, or inability to achieve selectivity. The molecular weight and lipophilicity concerns raised in 2009 persist as practical limitations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article implicitly raised several predictive questions:

• **Prediction about molecular size**: The article questioned whether PPI targets would require "big and ugly" molecules versus "reasonably-sized" compounds.
  - **Outcome**: Mixed results. While many successful PPI drugs are indeed larger than average (venetoclax MW ~868 Da), fragment-based approaches have enabled smaller starting points. The field has moved toward accepting that PPI inhibitors may need to be larger than traditional small molecules while seeking to minimize size where possible.

• **Prediction about compound library optimization**: The article suggested that existing compound libraries weren't optimized for PPI screens.
  - **Outcome**: Validated. The industry has developed specialized fragment libraries and PPI-focused screening collections. Research confirmed that traditional libraries indeed lacked the chemical diversity and appropriate physicochemical properties for effective PPI hit identification.

• **Prediction about structural features for success**: The article questioned whether specific structures or molecular shapes would prove more successful for PPI targets.
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated. Research has identified certain privileged scaffolds and structural motifs more common in PPI inhibitors (e.g., specific heterocyclic arrangements, three-dimensional architectures). However, no universal PPI-binding pharmacophore emerged, and success remains highly target-dependent.

• **Implicit prediction about Bcl inhibitors as pioneers**: The article highlighted ABT-737 as a "poster child" for the field.
  - **Outcome**: Strongly validated. The Bcl inhibitor approach proved clinically successful with venetoclax approval and widespread patient use, establishing PPI modulation as a viable therapeutic strategy and validating the investment in this difficult target class.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates strong foresight in identifying a critical bottleneck in drug discovery that would prove both persistent and increasingly important over the subsequent decade. Its framing of the fundamental challenges in PPI drug development captured issues that remained central to the field's evolution, making it highly relevant to understanding both the technical barriers and eventual breakthroughs in this important therapeutic area.
