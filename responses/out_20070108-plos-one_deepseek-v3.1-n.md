# PLoS One: A Radical Experiment in Open Science (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article introduces PLoS One, a new open-access journal launched by the Public Library of Science (PLoS). The publication represents a radical departure from traditional scientific publishing by implementing a "garbage filter" approach to peer review. Rather than evaluating papers based on subjective criteria like novelty, importance, or broad interest, PLoS One only assesses whether studies are methodologically sound and whether their conclusions reasonably follow from the presented evidence. If a paper meets these basic standards, it is published regardless of perceived impact.

The key innovation is the integration of post-publication, community-driven evaluation mechanisms. Readers can leave comments on papers, annotate specific parts of manuscripts, and eventually assign ratings in a system that resembles user-generated content platforms like Slashdot, Digg, or Reddit. This shifts the burden of "sorting wheat from chaff" from pre-publication peer reviewers to the scientific community after publication. The article notes that the journal includes reasonable guidelines for commenting—requiring evidence-based contributions rather than unsupported assertions or arguments from authority.

## 2. HISTORY

PLoS One proved to be far more successful and influential than most observers anticipated in 2007. By focusing on methodological soundness rather than perceived impact, the journal rapidly grew to become one of the world's largest scientific publications by volume. Its model addressed a critical pain point: many solid but unspectacular studies faced repeated rejections at "high-impact" journals despite being scientifically valid.

Within a few years, PLoS One was publishing thousands of papers annually across all scientific disciplines. The open-access model, combined with the rapid publication process and relatively modest article processing charges, made it attractive to researchers globally, particularly those from developing countries or with limited funding.

The post-publication commenting and rating features, however, never achieved the widespread adoption that the 2007 article envisioned. While the technical infrastructure existed, the scientific community did not embrace these features at scale. Most papers received few or no comments, and the envisioned "Slashdot for science" never fully materialized. Researchers continued to rely on traditional metrics like citation counts rather than community ratings.

The broader impact was profound: PLoS One's success demonstrated that radical publishing models could be viable and led other publishers to experiment with similar approaches. Many journals adopted modified versions of the "soundness-only" review criteria, particularly for interdisciplinary work or studies with negative results.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "I think that this will be a critical-mass phenomenon - if enough papers get annotated and ranked, it'll become the norm. And if not, these features might wither on the vine, which would be a shame."**

*   **Outcome:** **Largely incorrect.** While PLoS One achieved critical mass in terms of publication volume and became a well-established journal, the specific features of post-publication annotation and community ranking never became mainstream. These features did indeed "wither on the vine" despite the journal's overall success. The scientific community never broadly adopted the participatory evaluation model.

**Prediction: That PLoS One represents "part preprint server, part refereed journal, and part user-ranked content site"**

*   **Outcome:** **Partially correct.** The "refereed journal" aspect succeeded completely—PLoS One established itself as a legitimate scientific publication with rigorous methodological review. The "preprint server" characterization was less accurate, as PLoS One conducts peer review before publication. The "user-ranked content site" component largely failed to materialize as envisioned.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captures a genuinely innovative moment in scientific publishing and accurately identifies the key experimental elements of PLoS One. While the specific predictions about community-driven evaluation proved overly optimistic, the broader recognition that publishing models needed disruption was prescient. The article is historically interesting for documenting early reactions to what became a transformative force in academic publishing, though the long-term outcome differed from the most novel aspects described.

## 5. EVALUATION

This 2007 commentary demonstrates both the value and limitations of expert analysis in predicting innovation trajectories. The author correctly recognized that PLoS One represented a significant experiment in scientific publishing and understood the potential mechanisms for success. However, the prediction that post-publication community engagement would become the norm proved inaccurate.

This discrepancy highlights how technological innovation and cultural adoption don't always align. While the tools for community-driven evaluation existed and were well-designed, the incentives and social norms of academic culture did not support widespread participation in post-publication annotation and rating systems. Scientists continued to prioritize traditional metrics and viewed commenting on published papers as a lower-priority activity compared to conducting new research.

The lasting significance of PLoS One turned out to be in its volume-based, quality-filtered model rather than its participatory features. The journal succeeded by removing subjective impact criteria from peer review, not by creating a new ecosystem of community peer review. The prediction was directionally correct about the need for publishing reform but overly optimistic about scientists' willingness to engage in post-publication evaluation as a routine practice.

The broader lesson is that successful innovation often adapts to existing user behavior rather than transforming it completely. PLoS One found an unmet need—publication venues for methodologically sound but unspectacular research—and filled it effectively. The more ambitious goal of reshaping scientific communication through community participation proved unrealistic given the established incentive structures of academic careers.
