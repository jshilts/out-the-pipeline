# A Call For Merck to Cut R&D (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses an analyst report from Leerink Swann's Seamus Fernandez urging Merck to cut its R&D spending by approximately $1 billion—far deeper than the reductions contemplated by Merck's new R&D head Roger Perlmutter. The central argument was that Merck's R&D engine had poor "gas mileage": it was burning too much money while delivering insufficient returns, evidenced by disappointing Phase III pipeline results (odanacatib, suvorexant, Bridion) and lackluster 2013 performance. The analyst viewed this as necessary for Merck to improve operating margins, maintain shareholder returns, and bring its R&D spend closer to competitors like Pfizer (~$6.5B). The article notes that while R&D is Merck's core engine, the concern was efficiency rather than eliminating research entirely.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this article, Merck underwent significant R&D restructuring over subsequent years. In **January 2014**, Merck announced it would eliminate approximately 1,000 R&D positions and close its neuroscience research site in Scotland. Throughout **2014-2015**, the company continued streamlining operations, reflecting the industry-wide trend toward more focused R&D portfolios.

Key drug outcomes from the mentioned pipeline:
- **Odanacatib**: Merck discontinued development in **2016** after Phase III trials showed increased stroke risk
- **Suvorexant** (Belsomra): FDA approved in **2014** for insomnia treatment
- **Bridion** (sugammadex): FDA approved in **2015** for reversal of neuromuscular blockade

Merck's overall R&D strategy shifted toward immuno-oncology, resulting in significant success with **Keytruda (pembrolizumab)**—approved in **2014** and becoming Merck's blockbuster cancer immunotherapy. This validated the strategy of focusing resources on higher-probability, high-impact areas rather than maintaining broad R&D spending.

Industry-wide, pharmaceutical R&D productivity metrics showed gradual improvement, with companies adopting more targeted approaches to drug discovery and development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: Analyst predicted that $1B R&D reduction would add $0.25/share to earnings and improve operating efficiency
  - **Outcome**: Merck did implement R&D restructuring, though the exact financial impact is difficult to isolate from other business factors. The company maintained competitive R&D spend focused on fewer, higher-value targets.
  
- **Prediction**: Implicit: Merck's broad, expensive R&D approach would continue underperforming without substantial changes
  - **Outcome**: **Corroborated**—Merck shifted to more focused R&D strategy, discontinuing several programs (including odanacatib) while achieving major success with Keytruda, validating the efficiency-driven approach
  
- **Prediction**: Implicit: Other companies in the industry faced similar R&D productivity challenges
  - **Outcome**: **Corroborated**—Industry-wide trends showed continued focus on R&D efficiency, portfolio optimization, and external innovation partnerships throughout the 2010s

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article captured an important moment in pharmaceutical industry evolution where R&D efficiency became paramount, though the specific Merck-focused analysis has become somewhat dated as the company successfully pivoted its strategy.
