# Alnylam Breaks Through (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This September 2017 commentary celebrated Alnylam's announcement of positive Phase 3 results for patisiran, an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. The article contextualized this milestone within RNAi's turbulent history—from being biotech's "hottest area" fifteen years earlier, through multiple industry backlashes and major companies abandoning the field, to Alnylam's persistent $1.9+ billion investment despite setbacks. The piece noted Alnylam's recent clinical challenges, including a hemophilia RNAi trial halted after a patient death and the earlier disastrous rivusiran failure in ATTR amyloidosis with "mortality imbalance," making patisiran's success particularly significant.

The author explained that hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is caused by transthyretin protein mutations that form toxic amyloid fibrils in the heart and nervous system, for which only supportive care existed previously. The liver's accessibility made it an ideal RNAi target, as delivery and stability had been major obstacles limiting oligonucleotide therapeutics. This represented the first RNAi therapy to successfully complete Phase 3 trials, with Alnylam planning FDA filing for early 2018.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article's publication, patisiran (brand name Onpattro) received FDA approval in August 2018, becoming the first RNAi therapeutic approved in the United States. The drug demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit in hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, showing improved neuropathy symptoms and quality of life compared to placebo. Subsequent real-world evidence confirmed its efficacy, and patisiran gained regulatory approval in multiple regions including Europe.

Alnylam's broader RNAi platform continued advancing. In 2019, givosiran received FDA approval for acute hepatic porphyria, and in 2020, lumasiran gained approval for primary hyperoxaluria type 1. More recently, inclisiran was approved for hypercholesterolemia. These approvals established RNAi as a clinically validated therapeutic modality, overcoming the field's earlier skepticism.

The hereditary ATTR amyloidosis treatment landscape expanded significantly. In addition to patisiran, the small molecule tafamidis (Vindaqel/Pfizer) received FDA approval in 2019 for ATTR cardiomyopathy, providing an oral option. While patisiran demonstrated efficacy for polyneuropathy manifestations, tafamidis addressed cardiac involvement, offering patients different therapeutic approaches depending on their disease presentation.

Not all developments were positive for Alnylam. In October 2017, shortly after the article, Alnylam terminated fitusiran development following additional clotting issues and patient deaths, confirming the safety concerns mentioned in the original piece. This highlighted ongoing challenges in RNAi therapeutic development despite patisiran's success.

Alnylam's market position strengthened considerably post-approval, with Onpattro generating substantial revenue that validated the company's long-term investment strategy. The broader oligonucleotide therapeutics field gained renewed momentum, with antisense oligonucleotides and other RNA-targeting approaches advancing alongside RNAi platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Patisiran FDA approval**: The article anticipated FDA filing in early 2018 and approval following. This prediction proved accurate—patisiran received FDA approval in August 2018, making it the first approved RNAi therapeutic, a milestone the author correctly identified as landmark.

• **RNAi therapeutic potential**: The broader implication that patisiran's success would validate RNAi as a therapeutic modality proved prescient. Multiple additional RNAi drugs gained FDA approval in subsequent years across different diseases, establishing the platform's clinical legitimacy.

• **Field significance**: The author's characterization of this achievement as "really is a major achievement" that demonstrates "how hard it is to advance something really new in drug therapy" was validated by patisiran's market success and the subsequent expansion of approved RNAi therapeutics addressing multiple diseases.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article successfully identified a pivotal moment in therapeutic development at exactly the right time, providing context about RNAi's difficult history while accurately recognizing that patisiran's Phase 3 success represented a breakthrough that would finally validate the field. The piece demonstrated nuanced understanding of both scientific challenges and business dynamics, making it highly informative and prescient.
