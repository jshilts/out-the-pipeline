# Target Invalidation (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the crucial but often overlooked process of **target invalidation** in drug discovery—when a promising biological target proves ineffective as a therapeutic approach. The author draws from personal experience with dopamine D1 receptor antagonists failing as schizophrenia treatments despite initial optimism.

The piece focuses on a specific case: **SMARCA4**, an epigenetic target being pursued for lung cancer and other conditions. While SMARCA4 knockdown studies suggested therapeutic potential, Pfizer researchers published definitive evidence that their SMARCA4 ligand (PFI-3), despite effectively binding to the target, failed to produce the desired anti-tumor effects in cells. The ligand bound to one domain but couldn't modulate chromatin remodeling, suggesting the ATPase domain might be the real therapeutic target instead. The article notes that this Pfizer data, presented at conferences before publication, caused multiple academic and industry programs to halt abruptly.

## 2. HISTORY

**SMARCA4/Brg1 research after 2015:**

SMARCA4 (also called BRG1) remains an important but complex cancer target. The 2015 findings highlighted the challenge of drugging this SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex component.

**Clinical and research developments:**
- While PFI-3 and similar direct SMARCA4-binding approaches largely stalled, research pivoted toward different strategies
- SWI/SNF complexes gained recognition as important cancer dependencies, with components beyond SMARCA4 becoming drug targets
- **BRM/BRG1 ATPase inhibitors** entered development, aligning with the article's suggestion that the ATPase domain was the real target
- Companies like Foghorn Therapeutics advanced SWI/SNF-targeting approaches, though with mixed clinical outcomes

**Broader epigenetic drug development:**
The field learned from these validation challenges. While SMARCA4 direct targeting struggled, other epigenetic targets saw success (EZH2 inhibitors like tazemetostat gained FDA approval for specific cancers). The article's cautionary tale about target validation proved prescient as the field matured.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction evaluation:**
- **Implied prediction about SMARCA4 as cancer target**: The article suggested SMARCA4 remained problematic but that the ATPase domain might be the real target
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. Direct SMARCA4-binding ligands like PFI-3 largely failed, but ATPase-domain targeting approaches and SWI/SNF complex modulation continued development with varying success
  
- **General prediction about target invalidation frequency**: The author emphasized that "most of our ideas in this business turn out to be mistaken"
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. The high failure rate in drug discovery, especially for novel mechanisms like epigenetics, continued. Success rates for first-in-class drugs remained low (~10-15% from Phase I to approval)

- **Implication that epigenetic targets need better validation**: Suggested that "we really don't know all that much about how valid many of them are"
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. The field developed more sophisticated validation approaches, but epigenetic drug development proved harder than initially hoped, with many programs failing despite strong preclinical data

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article represents a solid but moderately interesting case study in target validation. While it captures an important moment in epigenetic drug discovery and demonstrates realistic caution about drug development, it focuses on a relatively narrow target that didn't reshape the broader field. SMARCA4 remained a niche research area rather than becoming a major clinical success or failure story, limiting its long-term impact compared to more transformative drug discovery case studies.
