# What A Fool Believes (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a rebuttal to a Slate blog post that warned of an imminent “collapse” of the pharmaceutical industry.  The Slate author argued that, because of the looming “patent cliff,” big drug makers had stopped investing in new, medically useful medicines, were merely milking existing products, and were laying off staff in anticipation of a revenue crash.  The rebuttal dismisses this view as “idiotic,” pointing out that companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, BMS and Astra‑Zeneca have continued to launch new drugs (albeit fewer than hoped) and that many costly R&D programs fail each year – a fact that the public rarely sees.  The author calls for more public awareness of clinical failures to counter the simplistic narrative that pharma has “stopped doing research.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 R&D output and approvals**  
- The FDA’s annual count of new molecular entities (NMEs) stayed roughly steady after 2011, averaging 30‑40 per year.  Notable approvals include **Keytruda (pembrolizumab, 2014)**, **Opdivo (nivolumab, 2014)**, **Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel, 2017)**, **Eliquis (apixaban, 2012)**, and **Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan, 2015)**.  
- Biologic and cell‑therapy pipelines expanded dramatically; by 2023 the FDA had approved more than 20 CAR‑T or gene‑therapy products, a category that did not exist in 2011.

**Financial impact of the patent cliff**  
- The first major “patent cliff” hit Pfizer in 2011‑2012 when **Lipitor** and **Celebrex** lost exclusivity, causing a ~15 % drop in revenue.  Pfizer responded with cost‑cutting, divestitures, and a series of acquisitions (e.g., **Wyeth** in 2009, **Seagen** in 2023) that restored growth.  
- Merck’s **Vioxx** loss (2004) and later **Keytruda** success illustrate the swing from a high‑profile failure to a blockbuster.  
- Overall, the industry’s global R&D spend rose from ~US$120 bn in 2011 to >US$180 bn by 2022, indicating continued investment despite patent expirations.

**Strategic shifts**  
- Companies pivoted toward **specialty biologics**, **immuno‑oncology**, and **precision medicine** rather than “just milking old drugs.”  
- The rise of **biosimilars** (e.g., Amgen’s Amjevita, 2016) created new competitive pressure but also new revenue streams for firms that developed follow‑on biologics.  
- Consolidation accelerated: **Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s acquisition of Celgene (2019)**, **Astra‑Zeneca’s purchase of Alexion (2020)**, and **Novartis’s acquisition of The Medicines Company (2020)**.

**Policy and regulatory environment**  
- The **FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” designation (2012)** and **Accelerated Approval pathways** were introduced to speed high‑need drugs to market, encouraging more late‑stage trials.  
- In the United States, the **“21st Century Cures Act” (2016)** and subsequent reforms increased funding for translational research and data‑sharing, indirectly supporting industry pipelines.

**Public perception and pricing debates**  
- High‑profile price controversies (e.g., **Sovaldi for hepatitis C, 2013**, and **EpiPen, 2016**) kept the narrative of “pharma greed” alive, but they did not halt R&D.  
- Despite occasional headline‑making failures (e.g., **Alzheimer’s drugs lecanemab and donanemab’s mixed trial results, 2022‑2023**), the pipeline remained robust, with several disease areas (oncology, rare diseases, gene therapy) seeing net growth.

**Bottom line**  
The dire prediction of an industry “near collapse” proved inaccurate.  While patent expirations forced restructuring, the sector continued to launch innovative therapies, increase R&D spending, and adapt business models.  The claim that companies “stopped producing drugs” is contradicted by the steady flow of approvals and the emergence of entirely new therapeutic modalities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the Slate blog / implied by the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Pharma would “stop making any sort of plans” for new patented drugs and would be “near collapse.”** | Companies kept (and expanded) R&D pipelines.  Major new drugs were approved each year; the industry’s market size grew from ~US$800 bn (2011) to >US$1.3 tn (2022). |
| **Layoffs of “tens of thousands” would be driven by a lack of future products.** | Workforce reductions did occur (e.g., Pfizer’s 2012‑2013 cuts), but they were largely a response to specific patent losses and cost‑optimization, not a universal industry‑wide shutdown.  Overall employment in pharma remained stable, with net hiring in biotech and specialty areas. |
| **The industry would be “incredibly bad at its business.”** | Business performance varied: some firms (e.g., Merck with Keytruda) saw double‑digit growth; others (e.g., Pfizer pre‑Seagen) struggled but later rebounded through acquisitions and diversification. |
| **Public belief in the “idiotic” view could have consequences.** | The narrative contributed to political pressure on drug pricing, but it did not translate into a systemic reduction of R&D.  In fact, post‑2011 legislation (e.g., 21st Century Cures) aimed to accelerate, not curtail, development. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of a common “doom‑saying” meme in 2011 and offers a concise counter‑argument, but its relevance is limited to that moment; the broader trends it touches on have been extensively documented elsewhere.
