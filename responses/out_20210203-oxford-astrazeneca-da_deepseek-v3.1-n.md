# Oxford AstraZeneca Data, Again (February 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes newly released Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine data from February 2021, focusing on three key uncertainties that had emerged during the vaccine's troubled clinical trial data rollout. First, the article examines the efficacy of extending the interval between the two-dose regimen from four weeks to twelve weeks, with a new preprint showing 82.4% efficacy for the twelve-week interval compared to 54.9% efficacy for the shorter interval. Second, the piece explores whether the apparently higher efficacy seen in the low-dose/standard-dose cohort (90%) might actually be driven by longer dose intervals rather than the lower initial dose itself, since that cohort also experienced longer delays between doses. Third, and most significantly, the article highlights breakthrough data on transmission reduction: weekly nasal swab testing in UK trial participants showed the vaccine reduced PCR positivity by 50-70%, suggesting it reduces viral load and transmission, not just severe disease. The author notes that while data collection and presentation had been problematic, these findings supported the UK's strategy of prioritizing first doses and delaying second doses to maximize population coverage.

## 2. HISTORY

**Vaccine Authorization and Global Rollout:** The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, later named Vaxzevria) received emergency authorization in the UK in December 2020 and EU authorization in January 2021. It became the most widely distributed COVID-19 vaccine globally, with over 3 billion doses administered worldwide by early 2023, particularly crucial for middle and lower-income countries through COVAX due to its lower cost and easier storage requirements.

**Real-World Performance:** Post-approval surveillance generally confirmed the extended dose interval strategy. UK data showed the twelve-week interval maintained strong real-world effectiveness against symptomatic disease, hospitalization, and death. However, the emergence of variants proved challenging: effectiveness against symptomatic disease from the Alpha variant remained high (around 70-75%), but dropped significantly against the Delta variant (around 60%) and even more against Omicron (around 40-50% after two doses). Importantly, effectiveness against severe disease and death remained substantially higher across variants.

**Transmission Findings Validated:** The viral load reduction data highlighted in the article proved prescient. Multiple real-world studies in 2021, including large UK household transmission studies, confirmed that vaccination with Vaxzevria did reduce transmission, though effectiveness waned over time and varied by variant. The Israeli data mentioned by the author did indeed demonstrate population-level benefits of vaccination on transmission in early 2021.

**Dosing Strategy Adoption:** The UK's extended dose interval strategy (initially controversial) became widely accepted and was adopted by other countries. Real-world evidence supported that longer intervals generally improved immune responses for adenoviral vector vaccines, though the exact optimal interval remained debated.

**Safety Issues:** In March 2021, reports emerged of rare but serious blood clotting events (Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia or VITT) associated with Vaxzevria, leading many countries to restrict its use to older populations or discontinue it entirely. This significantly impacted public confidence and limited the vaccine's utility despite its relatively strong performance against severe outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: The UK's strategy of extending dose intervals and prioritizing first doses would prove beneficial**
  - **Outcome: Largely validated.** Real-world evidence confirmed that longer intervals improved immune responses and that the single-dose protection was substantial enough to support the UK's strategy. The approach was adopted widely and credited with helping the UK achieve rapid population coverage in early 2021.

• **Prediction: The apparent superiority of the low-dose/standard-dose regimen was likely driven by dose interval rather than dose amount**
  - **Outcome: Mostly validated, though with incomplete certainty.** Subsequent analyses generally supported that dose interval was a key factor, though the complex trial design and subgroup sizes made definitive conclusions challenging. Most regulatory approvals were based on standard dosing regardless of interval optimization.

• **Prediction: Israeli data would demonstrate population-level transmission reduction**
  - **Outcome: Validated.** Israeli population studies published in 2021 showed clear reductions in transmission with the Pfizer vaccine, and similar patterns emerged across populations using AstraZeneca. The principle that mRNA vaccines reduced transmission was established by mid-2021.

• **Prediction: Transmission reduction would be confirmed through reduced viral load**
  - **Outcome: Validated with caveats.** The general principle held through 2021, but the emergence of variants (particularly Delta and Omicron) complicated the picture. Later variants showed some ability to replicate despite vaccination, reducing but not eliminating transmission benefits.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a critical moment in the pandemic response where real-world vaccine strategy was being actively debated, and correctly identifies both the transmission question and the dosing interval question as having longer-term significance. The analysis of the messy AstraZeneca trial data proves insightful, particularly the recognition that transmission data was groundbreaking even while acknowledging the trial's flaws.
