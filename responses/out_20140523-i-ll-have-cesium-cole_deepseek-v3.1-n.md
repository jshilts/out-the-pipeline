# "I'll have the Cesium Cole Slaw and the Francium Fries, Too" (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a humorous marketing blunder by Buffalo Wild Wings, a restaurant chain that named menu items using heavy metal chemical elements (Cesium Cole Slaw, Francium Fries, "heavy-metal chicken wings" with "mercury sauce"). The author, Derek Lowe, points out the absurdity of naming food items after toxic heavy metals, noting this as a prime example of chemistry-ignorant advertising. The piece mentions that Buffalo Wild Wings subsequently added a disclaimer on their website stating "Product does not contain Mercury," which the author suggests could have been avoided with basic chemistry knowledge. The article appears on Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which focuses on pharmaceutical and chemical industry commentary.

## 2. HISTORY

This incident represents a minor marketing misstep rather than a significant industry event. Buffalo Wild Wings, already a well-established restaurant chain by 2014, did not suffer meaningful business consequences from this naming gaffe. The company's subsequent addition of a mercury disclaimer demonstrates they addressed the concern promptly. The restaurant chain continued normal operations and growth, eventually being acquired by Arby's Restaurant Group in 2018 for approximately $2.9 billion, indicating the incident had no long-term negative impact. The "heavy metal" menu items appear to have been promotional or temporary offerings, as they are no longer prominent in the chain's marketing materials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Author's implicit prediction about chemistry literacy**: The author suggests that "five minutes of reading beforehand" could have prevented the need for disclaimers. While he doesn't explicitly predict future outcomes, there's an underlying assumption that better scientific literacy could improve marketing decisions. In reality, such chemistry-themed marketing gaffes have continued sporadically in advertising, suggesting the broader issue of scientific literacy in marketing persists rather than being resolved.
• **Implicit expectation of public reaction**: The Reddit chemistry community found this amusing rather than alarming, and there's no indication this generated significant consumer concern or backlash, suggesting the public recognized it as a harmless marketing mistake rather than a genuine safety issue.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article is essentially entertainment content about a minor marketing error with no lasting scientific, medical, or business significance. While amusing to chemistry enthusiasts, it lacks substantive impact or insights relevant to biotechnology or pharmaceutical development.
