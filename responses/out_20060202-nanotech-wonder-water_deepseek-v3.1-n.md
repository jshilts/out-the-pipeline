# Nanotech Wonder Water? (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" commentary critiques a small Israeli company called DoCoop that was marketing "Neowater"—a trademarked water-based nanotechnology product claimed to be "a stable system of highly hydrated, inert nanoparticles" with thousands of ordered hydration shells. The company made extensive claims about Neowater's capabilities: accelerating biochemical reactions, improving PCR, RNA interference, ELISA and other molecular biology techniques, enhancing bacterial growth while preventing biofilms, increasing antibiotic potency, and having applications in diagnostics, drug delivery, and protein purification.

The author expresses profound skepticism, noting the editorial staff at Genetic Engineering News seemed cautious by repeatedly using phrases like "The company claims..." The article highlights contradictions in DoCoop's claims (such as Neowater behaving like a detergent while also accelerating bacterial growth) and poses the fundamental question of whether this represents legitimate technology or pseudoscientific marketing. Despite finding one European paper mentioning their PCR kit, the commentary challenges readers to share any real-world experience with the product while questioning how such broad claims could be scientifically valid.

## 2. HISTORY

**DoCoop's trajectory:** Research into DoCoop reveals the company continued operating after 2006 but achieved minimal commercial or scientific impact. The company maintained a web presence and marketing efforts through the late 2000s and 2010s, but Neowater failed to gain meaningful adoption in the biotech or pharmaceutical industries.

**Scientific validation:** No peer-reviewed studies emerged that independently validated DoCoop's dramatic claims. The biotechnology community largely ignored or remained unaware of Neowater, with no significant publications demonstrating its purported effects on PCR, cell culture, or other techniques. Major reagent suppliers (Thermo Fisher, Qiagen, Sigma-Aldrich, etc.) never adopted or licensed the technology, and it never became a standard or even niche product in molecular biology labs.

**Business outcome:** DoCoop never achieved significant market penetration or formed the claimed partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies. The company remained a minor player without FDA-approved products or validated clinical applications. No drugs or diagnostic kits utilizing Neowater reached the market or late-stage clinical trials.

**Wider implications:** The episode stands as representative of periodic claims about "revolutionary" water-based technologies (structured water, activated water, etc.) that make broad biological claims without robust scientific evidence. Unlike legitimate nanomedicine advances (liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, etc.) that achieved clinical success, water-modification claims like DoCoop's typically fail to demonstrate reproducible, mechanistically sound effects.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Company's claims of broad biochemical improvements:** DoCoop predicted Neowater would enhance virtually all molecular biology techniques (PCR, ELISA, protein purification) and accelerate drug development. **Outcome:** COMPLETE FAILURE. No independent validation emerged, no technique improvements were documented in credible literature, and the biotechnology industry continued using standard buffers and reagents without Neowater.

**• Pharmaceutical partnerships and commercialization:** The company claimed engagement with several pharmaceutical companies and imminent commercial applications in diagnostics and drug delivery. **Outcome:** FAILURE. No pharmaceutical partnerships materialized into public collaborations or product development. No diagnostic kits or drug delivery systems based on Neowater reached the market.

**• Scientific mechanism claims:** DoCoop claimed thousands of ordered hydration shells around nanoparticles would modify bulk water properties. **Outcome:** QUESTIONABLE/UNVERIFIED. While nanoparticle-water interactions are legitimate areas of study, DoCoop's specific claims never gained scientific traction or mechanistic validation through peer-reviewed research.

**• Bacterial culture and antibiotic applications:** The article highlighted contradictory claims about Neowater behaving "like a strong detergent" while accelerating bacterial growth and enhancing antibiotic potency. **Outcome:** NO VALIDATION. No evidence emerged that Neowater achieved any of these effects in reproducible laboratory or clinical settings. If anything, the contradictory claims suggested lack of coherent scientific foundation.

**• Derek Lowe's implicit prediction (skepticism):** The author's tone suggests expectation that DoCoop's claims would prove unfounded. **Outcome:** CORRECT ASSESSMENT. The subsequent years validated Lowe's skepticism—no scientific validation, commercial success, or industry adoption occurred.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article captures a minor footnote in biotechnology history—an example of questionable claims that failed to deliver—but lacks broader scientific or commercial significance. It serves more as a case study in scientific skepticism than a commentary on important biotech developments.
