# Zafgen's Epoxide Pays Its Way (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Zafgen, a small biotech startup developing an obesity therapy based on an unusual covalent epoxide drug candidate targeting MetAP2 (methionine aminopeptidase 2). At the time of writing, Zafgen had successfully completed Phase II trials and was going public with an IPO. The author highlights the company's unusual scientific approach—using a covalent epoxide structure that many drug discovery scientists would typically reject immediately—and positions Zafgen as an example of how small companies must succeed at both scientific and financial/managerial aspects to survive. The article references Bruce Booth's venture capital perspective on the company's journey, noting that a "nice big IPO" would have seemed unlikely back in 2006, even assuming drug success. The author expresses particular interest in seeing how the compound performs in Phase III trials, as it potentially expands the boundaries of what's considered feasible in drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

What actually happened subsequent to this 2014 article reveals both promise and serious safety concerns for Zafgen's approach:

**Clinical Progress and Setbacks:**
- Zafgen's lead drug candidate was beloranib, a MetAP2 inhibitor being developed for severe obesity, particularly for rare disorders like Prader-Willi syndrome
- In 2015, the company progressed with studies but encountered serious safety issues
- In December 2015, Zafgen announced that two patients died in clinical trials of beloranib, both from blood clots (venous thromboembolisms)
- The FDA placed a clinical hold on beloranib development, effectively halting its progression
- This followed earlier concerns about the drug's safety profile

**Corporate Consequences:**
- Zafgen's stock price collapsed following the safety revelations and clinical hold
- In response to these failures, Zafgen pivoted its strategy and research focus
- The company eventually discontinued beloranib development
- Zafgen later shifted to developing a different compound, ZGN-1061, targeting the same MetAP2 pathway but with purportedly improved safety
- In subsequent years, the company continued to face significant challenges in regaining momentum

**Scientific and Clinical Impact:**
- The MetAP2 target has shown genuine biological relevance in metabolic regulation, angiogenesis, and cell growth
- However, the safety concerns surrounding this class of compounds, particularly thrombotic complications, have severely limited clinical development
- No MetAP2 inhibitor has achieved FDA approval for obesity or related indications as of the current time
- The pathway continues to be of research interest, but practical clinical translation has remained elusive

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions/expectations about Zafgen's future:

• **Prediction: Successful Phase III progression and potential drug approval**
  - **Reality: FAILED** - The drug encountered fatal safety issues before completing Phase III, leading to clinical hold and eventual discontinuation. The compound never reached market approval.

• **Prediction: "Nice big IPO" success leading to continued corporate growth**
  - **Reality: PARTIALLY TRUE then FAILED** - While the IPO was successful initially, subsequent clinical failures led to stock collapse and the company never achieved sustained success from this approach.

• **Prediction: Expanding the boundaries of what's feasible in drug discovery (epoxide covalent inhibitors)**
  - **Reality: PARTIALLY VALIDATED** - While the specific Zafgen compound failed, covalent drugs as a class have become more accepted in drug discovery, with successful covalent inhibitors like EGFR inhibitors in cancer therapy gaining approval. However, this particular epoxide approach to obesity did not open new therapeutic paths.

• **Prediction: MetAP2 as a viable therapeutic target for obesity**
  - **Reality: UNPROVEN/MIXED** - While biological rationale exists, no safe and effective MetAP2 inhibitor has reached clinical practice. The target remains scientifically interesting but clinically unvalidated.

• **Prediction: Zafgen as an exemplar of how small companies can succeed with both science and business**
  - **Reality: FAILED** - While the initial model appeared successful, the ultimate clinical failures undermined this example, highlighting how even well-funded, scientifically innovative approaches can fail due to fundamental safety issues.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article warrants a high interest score because it captures a crucial period in biotech development—the transition from promising Phase II results to the harsh realities of clinical translation—while highlighting broader themes about drug discovery boundaries and the risks facing innovative therapeutic approaches. The subsequent safety failures and corporate struggles of Zafgen provide important cautionary lessons about the drug development process.
