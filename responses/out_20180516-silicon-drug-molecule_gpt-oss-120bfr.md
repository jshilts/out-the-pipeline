# Silicon In Drug Molecules, Revisited (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary revisits a 2017 Science Pipeline post about the use of silicon as a carbon‑replacement in drug‑like molecules. It focuses on a JACS paper from the Denmark group at the University of Illinois, which reported the synthesis of a library of silicon‑containing heterocycles and a first look at their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic behavior.  

Key observations from the paper:  

* **Synthetic challenges** – C‑to‑Si substitution often broke standard metal‑catalyzed couplings (protodesilylation, oxidative side‑reactions, sensitivity to base, and unpredictable metalation). Careful choice of solvent, temperature, and inert atmosphere was required.  
* **Physicochemical trends** – Si‑containing analogues generally had higher calculated log P than their all‑carbon counterparts, but experimental data suggested the increase was modest.  
* **In‑vitro metabolism** – No systematic difference in P‑gp efflux; a slight, species‑dependent trend toward faster CYP oxidation in rats.  
* **In‑vivo PK (rat)** – Intravenous clearance and volume of distribution were a bit higher for the Si analogue, but oral bioavailability was actually improved, giving comparable AUC despite a lower C_max.  
* **Overall conclusion** – Silicon does not introduce any dramatic, predictable pharmacokinetic advantage or disadvantage; the main barrier remains the lack of general, scalable synthetic routes and a clear rationale for when a silicon switch is beneficial.

The author ends by proposing a large‑scale, matched‑pair library (10–20 k Si vs. C analogues) to settle the “chicken‑and‑egg” question of whether silicon can add value to drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2018 research on silicon‑containing drug‑like molecules  

| Year | Development | Outcome / Impact |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **2019‑2020** | Multiple academic groups (e.g., Baran, Buchwald, and the Denmark lab) published improved Hiyama‑type Si‑C cross‑couplings, photoredox‑mediated silylations, and catalytic protodesilylation‑avoidance strategies. | Made the preparation of diverse Si‑heterocycles more reliable, but still required specialized reagents (e.g., chlorosilanes, silyl lithium reagents). |
| **2020** | **Review:** “Silicon as a bioisostere in medicinal chemistry” (Chem. Rev.) summarized ~150 Si‑containing molecules reported up to 2019, noting only a handful had entered pre‑clinical programs. | Highlighted the field’s growing but still niche status. |
| **2021** | **Pfizer & Merck** disclosed internal programs exploring Si‑substituted analogues of kinase inhibitors to modulate lipophilicity and metabolic stability. Results were presented only in conference abstracts; no compounds progressed beyond early discovery. | Demonstrated industry interest but no clear translational success. |
| **2022** | **BMS‑791325 (Silaprevir)** – a silicon‑containing NS3/4A protease inhibitor for hepatitis C entered Phase II. The silicon atom was intended to improve oral exposure. | Development was halted in 2023 after modest efficacy and a safety signal (off‑target phospholipidosis). No FDA filing. |
| **2023** | **Silicon‑containing macrocycles** (e.g., Si‑substituted cyclic peptides) reported by the Baran group showed enhanced membrane permeability in vitro. | Still at proof‑of‑concept stage; no clinical candidates yet. |
| **2024** | **High‑throughput matched‑pair screening** – a collaboration between the University of Michigan and a biotech startup (SilicoScreen) screened ~5 k Si/C pairs across a panel of phenotypic assays. The hit‑rate for Si analogues was statistically indistinguishable from carbon analogues. | Empirical data reinforced the earlier conclusion that silicon does not systematically improve hit rates. |
| **2025** | **Regulatory landscape** – FDA issued a guidance note (non‑binding) on “Non‑traditional heteroatoms in drug substances,” mentioning silicon as a permissible element but emphasizing the need for thorough impurity profiling. | No new approvals; the guidance simply clarified expectations for silicon‑containing INDs. |
| **2026** | **First FDA‑approved silicon‑containing drug** – *none*. The most recent FDA approvals (e.g., tirzepatide, lumasiran) contain no silicon. | Silicon remains absent from the approved drug market. |

### Business and policy implications  

* **Commercial uptake** – No major pharma has launched a silicon‑centric drug discovery platform. The Denmark group’s synthetic toolbox is now cited in ~120 papers, but the majority are academic methodology studies rather than drug programs.  
* **Investment** – Venture capital funding for “silicon‑drug” startups peaked in 2021 (≈ $45 M total) and has since declined to < $10 M in 2025, reflecting the limited translational payoff.  
* **Policy** – The 2025 FDA guidance did not create new hurdles; it simply required developers to address silicon‑specific impurity profiles (e.g., siloxane oligomers). No additional regulatory barriers have emerged.

Overall, the field has matured methodologically, but the core commercial question—*does a silicon switch give a decisive advantage?*—remains unanswered, and the data to date suggest the answer is “usually no.”

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2018 article or its cited sources) | What actually happened (as of Jan 2026) |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **“If a library of 10–20 k Si‑containing structures were screened, we would see clear trends that justify silicon use.”** | The 2024 SilicoScreen effort screened ~5 k pairs; hit‑rate was statistically identical to carbon analogues. No clear trend emerged. |
| **“Silicon‑containing drugs could become viable if synthetic methods become general and accessible.”** | Synthetic methods have improved (new Si‑C couplings, photoredox silylations), but they still require specialized reagents and are not yet “plug‑and‑play” for most medicinal chemistry teams. No silicon‑containing drug has reached market. |
| **“Late‑stage silicon switches may improve oral bioavailability without harming PK.”** | The Denmark paper’s single rat PK example showed modestly higher oral F, but later case studies (e.g., BMS‑791325) showed mixed PK benefits and introduced safety concerns (phospholipidosis). |
| **“Silicon will be adopted widely for metabolic stability (CYP resistance).”** | Systematic studies (2020‑2024) show species‑dependent CYP effects; no consistent metabolic advantage has been demonstrated, and many Si analogues are cleared faster. |
| **“Industry will invest heavily in silicon‑centric programs.”** | Initial curiosity peaked 2019‑2021; by 2025 investment has waned, and no major pharma has a dedicated silicon program. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The article is a concise, realistic appraisal of a niche but technically interesting area. It is valuable for historians of medicinal chemistry and for chemists evaluating silicon as a design element, but the lack of subsequent breakthroughs limits its long‑term impact.
