# Of Deck Chairs, Six Sigma, And What Really Ails Us (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 commentary argues that pharmaceutical industry initiatives like "Lean Six Sigma" and "Lab of the Future" projects are distractions from fundamental problems plaguing drug discovery. The author contends that while the industry faces real challenges—uncertain future pricing power and insufficient drug pipelines—these cannot be solved by incremental process improvements, lab redesigns, or management fads. Instead, the piece identifies five core issues requiring substantial scientific advancement: (1) critical re-evaluation of target-based drug design, which the author suspects has been a "terrible detour"; (2) ability to work on harder target classes like protein-protein interactions; (3) better target selection given that efficacy failures suggest poor understanding of disease biology; (4) more meaningful clinical trials that cost less, especially in areas like cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease; and (5) earlier detection of human toxicity. The author argues these process improvement initiatives at best buy time and at worst create dangerous illusions that real problems are being addressed.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical industry challenges identified in 2010 have persisted and in many cases intensified. **R&D productivity** remained problematic through the 2010s, with analysis showing R&D spending doubling between 2010-2019 while new drug approvals stagnated. **Target-based drug discovery** continued to dominate but faced ongoing criticism; the approach's limitations became more apparent as failures accumulated in oncology (where many targeted therapies showed limited efficacy) and neuroscience (where amyloid hypothesis failures in Alzheimer's exemplified the target validation problem). Notably, **protein-protein interactions** proved even more challenging than anticipated—despite advances in molecular glues and PROTACs, drugging these targets at scale remained elusive through 2020.

**Clinical trial costs** escalated dramatically. By 2021, the average cost to develop a new drug exceeded $2.6 billion according to some estimates, with Phase III trials in areas like Alzheimer's consuming billions with repeated failures (e.g., multiple amyloid-targeting drugs failing despite massive investment). **Efficacy failures** remained the primary cause of late-stage clinical termination, confirming the author's concern about insufficient biological understanding. The **human tox prediction** problem proved intractable at scale; while organ-on-chip and computational methods advanced, most toxicity still emerged late in development.

**Lean Six Sigma initiatives** did spread through pharmaceutical R&D, including at companies like AstraZeneca, but evidence of transformational impact remains scant. Such programs continued alongside other management approaches without fundamentally altering industry productivity trends. Meanwhile, **external innovation** through acquisitions and partnerships became increasingly central as internal pipelines struggled—a trend that accelerated post-2010.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Lean Six Sigma would prove insufficient**: **Accurate**. Evidence shows these initiatives didn't substantially improve drug discovery productivity. Industry R&D returns continued declining through much of the 2010s.

• **Target-based drug design as a "terrible detour"**: **Partially accurate**. While target-based approaches have produced important drugs, their limitations became increasingly apparent, especially in complex diseases. Non-targeted phenotypic screening saw renewed interest as a corrective.

• **Need to tackle harder target classes (especially protein-protein interactions)**: **Accurate in identifying the challenge**. PPIs remained notoriously difficult to drug, though progress occurred with specific modalities like molecular glues and PROTACs.

• **Efficacy failures would continue due to poor target selection**: **Accurate**. Efficacy remained the primary cause of clinical failures throughout the 2010s and beyond, validating concerns about insufficient biological understanding.

• **Huge, expensive clinical trials would continue "killing" the industry**: **Accurate**. Trial costs and sizes escalated significantly, with mega-trials consuming billions while often failing in areas like cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's.

## 4. INTEREST

7/10 - This article correctly identified persistent structural problems that plagued drug discovery for the subsequent decade. While somewhat pessimistic, it offered clear-eyed analysis of fundamental scientific and operational challenges that management fads couldn't solve, making it prescient about industry trajectories.
