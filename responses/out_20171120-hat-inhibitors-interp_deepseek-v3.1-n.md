# HAT Inhibitors: Interpret With Care (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the 2017 Nature Communications paper that systematically evaluated 23 reported histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors—compounds designed to block enzymes that add acetyl groups to histone proteins. The authors found extensive problems: 15 compounds showed thiol reactivity (indicating non-specific protein binding), 6 degraded under standard assay conditions, 12 showed detergent sensitivity suggesting aggregation, and several had fluorescent interference issues. The review concludes that none of the 23 compounds met criteria for high-quality chemical probes, creating a literature filled with potentially misleading results. While HAT inhibitors held therapeutic promise for conditions like cancer and neurological disorders, the existing publicly available compounds were largely unreliable tools for research.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2017 paper, HAT inhibitor development continued to face significant challenges. The field did not see widespread adoption of the problematic compounds identified in the study—research largely moved away from the 23 compounds evaluated. However, meaningful clinical progress remained limited: **no HAT inhibitor has received FDA approval as of 2024**. Clinical trials have been sparse and mostly early-phase.

The research landscape evolved toward better characterization and new directions. Structure-based drug design efforts increased, focusing on more selective HAT inhibitors, particularly targeting p300/CBP. Some industrial efforts produced improved tool compounds, but these largely remained proprietary or in preclinical stages. Public databases and chemical probe standards tightened requirements partly in response to studies like this one.

The broader field of epigenetic drug discovery saw differentiated outcomes: HDAC inhibitors (which remove acetyl groups) achieved multiple FDA approvals for cancer, while BET bromodomain inhibitors also advanced in clinical development. In contrast, HAT inhibitors remained the "missing piece" of epigenetic pharmacology, demonstrating the lasting impact of the quality issues identified in 2017.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that industrial patents contained better compounds that might be validated**: This proved partially correct—some improved compounds emerged from pharmaceutical companies, but validation remained limited and no clear breakthrough compounds achieved widespread adoption across academia and industry.

• **Implicit expectation that HAT inhibitors would join HDAC inhibitors as approved epigenetic drugs**: This prediction largely failed. While HDAC inhibitors maintain several FDA approvals (vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, panobinostat), HAT inhibitors have not reached market approval by 2024.

• **Hope that better chemical matter would clarify HAT biology and therapeutic potential**: This showed mixed results—while research quality improved with better compound characterization, the fundamental therapeutic promise of HAT inhibition remains unproven in clinical settings despite nearly three decades of research effort.

• **Concern that problematic compounds would continue appearing in literature**: This concern was validated, as similar compound quality issues surfaced in other epigenetic target classes, leading to broader awareness of chemical probe quality in the field.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlighted a critical but often overlooked problem in drug discovery: the gap between published claims and actual compound quality, which had lasting implications for epigenetic research and therapeutic development.
