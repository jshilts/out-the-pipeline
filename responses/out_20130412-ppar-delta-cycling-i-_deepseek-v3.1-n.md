# PPAR Delta For Cycling? I Think Not. (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses GW501516 (also known as GW-501516), a PPAR-delta agonist that was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline as a clinical candidate but was subsequently discontinued. The author notes that the compound has gained popularity on the black market among cyclists and other athletes, particularly after a 2007 paper from the Evans lab at the Salk Institute suggested it could increase endurance in animal studies.

The author expresses strong concerns about the safety of using this compound, noting that GSK dropped it from clinical development, potentially for toxicity reasons. They emphasize that PPAR compounds have wide-ranging biological effects that are difficult to predict, and that the long-term safety profile is unknown.

## 2. HISTORY

GW501516 was originally developed by GSK and Ligand Pharmaceuticals as a potential treatment for metabolic diseases, particularly targeting dyslipidemia and obesity. The compound entered Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in the early-to-mid 2000s.

The drug was indeed discontinued from clinical development, and subsequent evidence has confirmed the author's safety concerns. Studies later revealed that GW501516 caused cancer in animal models, which led to its abandonment as a therapeutic candidate. Specifically, preclinical studies showed it caused various types of cancers in multiple organs at all tested doses in both rats and mice.

Despite these safety issues, the compound continued to circulate in the athletic community under various names including "Endurobol" and "Cardarine." It was placed on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) prohibited list, and there have been documented cases of athletes testing positive for the substance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions:

• **Safety concerns were well-founded**: The author's concern that GSK dropped the compound "for tox" proved accurate. Subsequent research confirmed carcinogenic effects in animal studies, validating the decision to abandon clinical development.

• **Black market use continued**: The prediction that athletes would continue using it despite unknown safety risks has unfortunately been borne out, with documented continued use in athletic communities.

• **Wide-ranging biological effects would be problematic**: The author's concern about PPAR-delta's complex effects proved prescient, as the compound's mechanism did indeed have unforeseen consequences that made it unsuitable for human use.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates insightful scientific skepticism that proved well-founded, addressing the intersection of abandoned pharmaceutical compounds, athletic doping, and public health concerns—issues that remain highly relevant today.
