# One Of Us Is Hallucinating (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article documents a heated debate between the author (a pharmaceutical industry professional) and blogger "Prometheus 6" about drug discovery and development. The central conflict revolves around P6's belief that most pharmaceuticals originate from government-funded academic research, and therefore drug companies merely handle testing and manufacturing while unfairly profiting from public-domain science.

The author strenuously argues against this position, contending that academic labs almost never discover actual drug compounds (estimating >95% are discovered by drug companies). Instead, academic research reveals biological pathways, protein behaviors, and mechanisms—valuable fundamental science that points directions but doesn't produce clinical candidates. The author emphasizes that even when drug targets emerge from NIH-funded research (using COX-2 enzyme discovery by University of Rochester as an example), pharmaceutical companies still face enormous costs averaging $800 million to develop actual drugs, with most attempts failing. The article culminates with P6 admitting to having no source for his claims, simply asserting he "knows what is done in academic research."

## 2. HISTORY

**Policy and Patent Law Evolution:**
The core debate preceded major policy developments. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 already allowed universities to patent federally-funded research, creating a framework where academic discoveries could be licensed to industry. This system expanded significantly through the 2000s and 2010s, with universities becoming major patent holders and drug companies paying substantial licensing fees for academic-originated discoveries.

**Academic-Industry Partnerships:**
Following this period, major academic institutions increasingly established technology transfer offices and specialized drug discovery centers (e.g., Harvard's ICCB-Longwood, Scripps' drug discovery programs). However, these typically focused on early-stage discovery rather than producing clinical-ready compounds. The translational gap remained significant.

**Drug Discovery Reality:**
Industry data from organizations like PhRMA and studies in journals like Nature Reviews Drug Discovery continued showing that the vast majority of drug candidates originate from pharmaceutical companies' internal discovery programs or specialized biotech companies. Academic contributions remained primarily in target identification and validation, not compound discovery.

**Response to High Drug Prices Debate:**
By 2010-2020, drug pricing controversies intensified significantly beyond the $800 million figure mentioned (which was controversial at the time and later criticized by some health economists). The debate expanded to include discussions of public funding's role, leading to proposals like march-in rights and greater transparency requirements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Well over 95% [of compounds] discovered by drug companies"**: This characterization of the discovery landscape has held up reasonably well. Major analyses (e.g., by Bhaven Sampat and Frank Lichtenberg) found that while NIH funding contributes to many drug discoveries indirectly through basic research, direct compound discovery remains overwhelmingly industrial. The exact percentage varies by therapeutic area, but the fundamental point—that academic labs rarely produce drug candidates ready for clinical development—has remained accurate.

• **"Even when targets come from NIH-funded research, drug companies face enormous costs"**: This prediction about the persistence of high drug development costs proved correct. Tufts Center studies continued showing average R&D costs in the hundreds of millions through the 2010s (though the $800M figure specifically has been debated). Clinical failure rates remained high, validating the risk argument.

• **Implicit prediction that the "academic labs produce drugs" misconception would persist**: This proved accurate. The misconception continued appearing in policy debates, with advocates frequently overstating academia's direct drug discovery role while understating industry's compound optimization and development contributions.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article addresses a persistent misconception about drug discovery with clear, industry-insider perspective, though the specific scope is narrow. It touches upon themes that grew in importance (drug pricing, public funding's role, academic-industry relationships) but the debate format constrains deeper analysis.
