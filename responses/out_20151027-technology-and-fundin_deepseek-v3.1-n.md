# Technology and Funding: Myths and Alternate Worlds (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Matt Ridley titled "The Myth of Basic Science," which argued that technological innovation has its own momentum independent of basic research. Ridley's piece suggested that industry naturally funds the research it needs, using the steam engine leading to thermodynamics as an example. The author acknowledges that pure basic research doesn't directly drive technology in the linear "ivory tower" model that politicians often imagine, but challenges Ridley's claim about the inevitability and self-directed nature of technological progress.

The article's most provocative section discusses the funding sources debate, citing controversial claims (attributed to Terence Kealey and a 2003 OECD study) that publicly-funded research has no measurable economic impact whatsoever, while privately-funded R&D does. The author notes this directly contradicts the post-WWII consensus established by Vannevar Bush's "Endless Frontier" that government must fund basic research. The commentary concludes that while the linear model of science-to-technology is flawed, the question of optimal funding sources remains unresolved and deserves more serious consideration than caricatured debates about government versus industry research.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2015, there has been no definitive resolution to this debate, but several developments have provided empirical data points across sectors:

**Pharmaceutical/biotech sector** has seen mixed results in the private-vs-public research balance. Large pharmaceutical companies have generally *reduced* their basic research spending since 2015, cutting internal blue-sky programs. Drug discovery has increasingly relied on acquiring innovative startups, which themselves often emerge from academic labs funded by NIH/NSF grants. The rapid development of mRNA vaccines during COVID-19 built upon decades of basic research funded by government grants to academic researchers like Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman—work that industry showed limited interest in until proven clinically viable. Conversely, CAR-T therapy and checkpoint inhibitor drugs show stronger private-sector leadership with substantial clinical/commercial pathway development guided by biotech and pharma R&D.

**Taxpayer-funded initiatives** have yielded complex outcomes. The Cancer Moonshot (announced 2016, relaunched 2022) exemplifies the difficulty: even with billions in federal funding, no dramatic cures have emerged, but the program did accelerate data-sharing infrastructure and precision oncology tools adopted in clinical practice. In contrast, the BRAIN Initiative (started 2013, ongoing) has led to specific technologies like high-resolution neural recording tools and genetic circuit mapping broadly adopted by both academic and industry neuroscience labs, demonstrating that targeted government research can create platforms for innovation.

**Semiconductor industry** presents a counter-example where Moore's Law scaling required coordinated public-private partnership. The post-2015 scaling challenges (7nm nodes and below) have required massive government investment through CHIPS Act funding (2022) precisely because private companies like Intel struggled to maintain R&D pace independently. Similarly, quantum computing advances post-2015 heavily depend on government laboratory programs (Los Alamos, NIST, etc.), though companies like Google and IBM invested significantly in parallel applications research.

**NIH funding trends** show that federal basic research support led to technologies with clear economic and clinical impact. For example, CRISPR gene editing's foundational discoveries came from NIH-funded academic labs, but commercial development and therapeutic applications have been driven almost entirely by private companies (e.g., CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas, Intellia). Similar patterns exist for immunotherapy where academic discoveries at universities and cancer centers (mostly government-funded) were translated into commercial drugs by biotech companies.

**Academic/business research mix** saw notable shifts. Companies like Google (Alphabet), Facebook (Meta), and Microsoft dramatically increased their AI basic research post-2015, establishing labs that publish in academic venues while building commercial platforms. However, their most impactful work often builds on earlier foundational research from academic labs (e.g., transformer architectures, reinforcement learning concepts). Bell Labs-style internal basic research hasn't revived broadly, though companies like DeepMind and OpenAI conduct fundamental AI safety research, partially as public-good activities.

The 2015-era assumption that publicly-funded research "has no economic impact" hasn't been conclusively validated or debunked. Studies analyzing the full innovation pipeline remain methodologically challenging, because they must account for long time-lags between basic discovery and commercial adoption, and they must differentiate between economic growth attributable to specific government-funded projects versus parallel industrial development. Post-2015 empirical work published in economics journals tends to show that public R&D spending's effects vary substantially by field, sector, and funding mechanism, rather than supporting universal claims about zero impact or guaranteed impact.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Ridley's implied predictions:**
- *Industry funding would continue displacing public funding for basic research*
  - **Reality:** Mixed. Industry R&D spending increased in sectors like AI and biotechnology, but pharmaceutical companies actually *reduced* fundamental research. Government research funding has remained stable or increased in absolute terms (though declined as % of GDP in some countries). Overall, no clear displacement trend emerged—both sectors coexisted with different focus areas.
  
- *Private research would be as innovative as public research*
  - **Reality:** Evidence varies by sector. AI demonstrates industry leadership in applied domains (chatbots, autonomous vehicles), while foundational breakthroughs still emerge from university/government labs. Biotech shows strong industry translation but relies heavily on academic discoveries. The most impactful innovations post-2015 generally required collaboration across sectors.

**Author's analysis that technology "progress has momentum" is over-simplified:**
- While not explicitly framed as a prediction, the article's skepticism suggests that historical contingency remains important.
  - **Reality:** Post-2015 technological advances show high path-dependence. Examples like cryptocurrency/blockchain emerged from specific developer communities rather than broad industrial needs; quantum computing progress depends heavily on niche research funding rather than market demand; AI breakthroughs in deep learning built upon sustained university/government research despite earlier commercial disinterest.

**Subtext that government-funded research arguments will remain politically convenient but economically questionable:**
- **Reality:** The political framing of research funding hasn't fundamentally changed since 2015. Policymakers continue citing economic growth justifications for science funding while actual innovation pathways remain contested. However, several major policy initiatives (CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act provisions for drug development) suggest that governments increasingly recognize industrial policy elements beyond basic research as necessary for strategic industries.

## 4. INTEREST 

Score: **7**

This article remains highly relevant because the core tension it identifies—between linear models of science-to-technology translation and empirically-ungrounded claims about research funding's economic impact—hasn't been resolved despite nearly a decade of additional evidence. While some sectors provide clearer examples for either side of the debate, no comprehensive framework has emerged to guide optimal resource allocation between public and private basic research. The ongoing AI revolution, quantum computing development, and biotech innovation pathways all reflect these same tensions in new forms.
