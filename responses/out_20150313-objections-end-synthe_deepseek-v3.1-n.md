# Objections to (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a follow-up defense by Derek Lowe responding to criticism of his previous post predicting "the end of organic synthesis." Lowe clarifies that his excitement centers on Martin Burke's automated synthesis approach using MIDA-boronates and iterative Suzuki couplings to streamline small molecule construction. He distinguishes this from both combinatorial chemistry of the 1990s (which relied heavily on amide bonds) and solid-phase synthesis—the Burke method uses solution-phase C-C bond formation with solid-phase purification, making it more general and adaptable than earlier attempts. Lowe argues this automated "dial-it-up" building-block approach could reduce dependence on traditional lengthy total syntheses, accelerate analog generation for structure-activity studies, and shift organic synthesis toward being a pragmatic tool for discovery rather than an end in itself. He acknowledges limitations regarding scalability and yield but contends the method's primary utility lies in early-stage compound exploration and analog generation.

## 2. HISTORY
Martin Burke's laboratory continued to develop and validate the automated synthesis platform following the 2015 attention. This included expanding the MIDA-boronate building block library to more diverse structural classes, extending the chemistry beyond purely aromatic systems, and demonstrating additional molecular complexity. A key 2017 paper from Burke's group showed automated iterative synthesis of polyenes with precise stereochemistry achieved through stereospecific cross-coupling, extending the scope beyond simple polyaryl compounds. The methodology found adoption in academic labs conducting medicinal chemistry and natural product analog synthesis, though it did not become standard across the pharmaceutical industry. Commercial entities emerged offering automated synthesis services, including Iktos and Schrödinger with their CapsolChem technology, though automated synthesis remains more niche than traditional manual approaches. Process chemistry for drug manufacturing largely retained conventional synthetic routes optimized for scale and cost. Total synthesis of complex natural products continued, though emphasis shifted toward molecules with genuine scarcity and toward discovery of new reactions rather than structure confirmation. No paradigm-shifting replacement of organic synthesis occurred, but the Burke methodology established itself as a valuable tool within the synthetic toolkit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: Burke's approach would quickly expand beyond simple polyaryl compounds and Suzuki couplings into diverse molecular complexity.
  - **Outcome**: Partial success. The method was extended to polyenes, some macrocycles, and alkyl couplings, but scope remained limited compared to general synthesis capabilities. Difficulties persisted for complex heterocycles and stereochemically challenging targets.

• **Prediction**: Automated building-block synthesis would largely displace traditional total synthesis for analog generation and functional exploration.
  - **Outcome**: Limited success. While useful for specific applications like Burke's Amphotericin B derivatives, most pharmaceutical analog programs still use traditional synthetic approaches when building-block methods cannot deliver needed structural diversity.

• **Prediction**: The paradigm would shift organic chemistry toward more functional, application-focused goals rather than complex molecule-making as an end in itself.
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. "Function-first" approaches gained traction in materials science and chemical biology, but total synthesis and complex molecule construction continued to be valued for reaction discovery and accessing unique chemical space.

• **Prediction**: This would not replace process chemistry, which would remain essential for scaled manufacturing.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Automated synthesis found its niche in early discovery and small-scale analog generation, while process chemistry remained unchanged in pharmaceutical manufacturing where atom economy, scalability, and cost dominate.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 6/10**

The article captures an important debate about synthesis automation at a transitional moment, though the predicted paradigm shift was more modest than envisioned. It remains relevant for understanding alternative approaches to synthetic efficiency without achieving the revolutionary impact initially suggested.
