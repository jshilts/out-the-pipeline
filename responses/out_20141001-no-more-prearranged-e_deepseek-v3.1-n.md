# No More Prearranged Editors at PNAS (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary discusses procedural changes at the journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). In July 2010, PNAS had eliminated the "member Communicated" submission route, but retained a "Prearranged Editor (PE)" process. This PE route was intended for exceptional papers that were interdisciplinary or ahead of their time, requiring special editorial attention. However, the PE process had been used extensively—with over 11,000 papers submitted through this designation—far beyond its intended purpose. The article announced that as of October 1, 2014, PNAS would discontinue the PE process, moving toward a standardized submission system similar to other journals. The author concludes by suggesting this change makes PNAS more conventional in its publication pathways.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 elimination of the Prearranged Editor process, PNAS continued operating primarily through its Direct Submission route, maintaining its position as a high-impact multidisciplinary journal. The procedural changes did not significantly alter the journal's prestige or publication standards. PNAS remains among the top-tier scientific publications, typically ranking in the upper tiers across multiple scientific disciplines.

The broader open-access movement and journal reform discussions continued gaining momentum after 2014. Several journals moved toward greater transparency in peer review, though the fundamental "high-impact journal" ecosystem persisted largely unchanged through the late 2010s and early 2020s. PNAS itself continued evolving its editorial processes, including enhancements to peer review transparency and diversity initiatives. The elimination of special submission routes represented one step in broader efforts to standardize editorial processes across scientific publishing, though many high-impact journals retained various forms of editorial discretion in manuscript handling. The trend toward more standardized submission processes continued, with most major journals implementing increasingly formalized review procedures rather than special "insider" submission routes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in scientific publishing or biotechnology outcomes. It was primarily descriptive, announcing and commenting on an editorial policy change at PNAS. The underlying assumption appeared to be that eliminating special submission routes would make PNAS operate more like conventional journals, which appears to have been consistent with subsequent developments as scientific publishing continued standardizing submission and review processes.

## 4. INTEREST 

**Rating: 3/10**

While this documents a notable procedural change at a major scientific journal, it represents an administrative policy update rather than a development with broad scientific or biotechnological implications. The content relates primarily to academic publishing mechanics rather than biotech industry developments or scientific discoveries.

*Note: This analysis is limited by the article's narrow focus on PNAS editorial procedures rather than biotechnology industry developments. The author's request for hindsight analysis of biotechnology industry commentary could not be fully addressed given the article's scope.*
