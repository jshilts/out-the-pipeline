# HER2 Confusion (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2010 commentary discusses the gap between the promised "personalized medicine" era and clinical reality, using HER2 testing for breast cancer as a case study. The article highlights a University of California, San Francisco study revealing that **one in five HER2 tests gives incorrect results**, and up to **two-thirds of breast cancer patients who should be tested are not tested at all**.

The piece references a Nature Biotechnology article showing deep problems with biomarker validation and implementation. While Genentech's Herceptin (trastuzumab) had been FDA-approved for over a decade at that point as a targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer, there was significant variability in testing practices: some doctors lacked confidence in interpreting test results, testing rates varied dramatically (Wellpoint claimed 98% testing while other data suggested much lower rates), and fundamental questions remained about test reliability and whether some HER2-negative patients might still benefit from the drug.

## 2. HISTORY

**Regulatory and Guideline Development (2010-2018):**
Following the article's publication, major efforts emerged to standardize HER2 testing. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) issued updated HER2 testing guidelines in 2013 and 2018, addressing many concerns raised in 2010. These guidelines established standardized criteria for HER2 positivity, recommended reflex testing protocols, and emphasized the need for quality assurance programs.

**Test Standardization and New Technologies:**
Automated HER2 testing platforms became more widespread, reducing inter-observer variability. The introduction of dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio analysis improved interpretation consistency. Companion diagnostics evolved significantly, with the FDA approving multiple HER2 testing platforms as companion diagnostics for various HER2-targeted therapies.

**Expansion of HER2-Targeted Therapies:**
The treatment landscape expanded considerably post-2010:
- **Perjeta (pertuzumab)**: FDA-approved in 2012 for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, later for neoadjuvant use (2013) and early breast cancer (2017)
- **Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine, T-DM1)**: FDA-approved in 2013 for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, later for early breast cancer (2019)
- **Herceptin Hylecta**: Subcutaneous formulation approved in 2019

**Improved Testing Rates:**
Studies from 2015-2020 showed significant improvement in HER2 testing rates, with some health systems reporting 95%+ testing rates for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, far exceeding the "one-third tested" concern from 2010.

**Clinical Impact:**
HER2-positive breast cancer prognosis dramatically improved. Whereas HER2-positive disease was once considered aggressive with poor outcomes, the combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy and subsequent HER2-targeted agents transformed it into a disease with survival rates approaching those of HER2-negative cancers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I don't see any reason why biomarkers (of various kinds, not just genetic) won't help us figure out which patients should be getting which drugs, but don't let anyone tell you that we're there yet."**
  
  - **Outcome**: This balanced prediction was largely accurate. Biomarkers did become increasingly important in drug development and patient selection, but the journey was indeed longer and more complex than early hype suggested. The development of comprehensive biomarker panels and next-generation sequencing for treatment selection validated this long-term view.

• **Implicit prediction that HER2 testing problems would persist without systematic intervention**
  
  - **Outcome**: Validated. It took coordinated efforts by professional societies, regulatory bodies, and improved testing technologies over several years to address the variability and under-testing issues highlighted in 2010.

• **Concern about test reliability and interpretation inconsistency**
  
  - **Outcome**: These concerns led to concrete solutions. Automated platforms, standardized scoring systems, and mandatory quality assurance programs were implemented, substantially improving reliability compared to the 2010 situation.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a crucial inflection point where the rhetoric of personalized medicine met the messy reality of clinical implementation, highlighting specific, solvable problems that actually were addressed in subsequent years. Its focus on a single biomarker (HER2) in one of the most successful targeted therapy stories made it both concrete and broadly relevant to understanding the challenges of biomarker-driven medicine.
