# Another One of Those Startling Molecular Images (Sep 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 Science article reported a new level of resolution in non‑contact atomic‑force microscopy (nc‑AFM) achieved by the IBM‑Zürich team. By terminating the AFM tip with a single carbon‑monoxide (CO) molecule and deliberately tilting that CO away from the surface‑normal, the researchers could sense the short‑range Pauli repulsion between the tip and the electron cloud of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, hexabenzocoronene (HBC).  

Constant‑height images taken only 0.35 Å above the molecule revealed alternating contrast that the authors interpreted as two distinct bond types (i‑bonds and j‑bonds) within the HBC framework. A higher‑altitude image (3.5 Å) and accompanying density‑functional calculations showed the same bond‑order pattern, supporting the claim that the AFM tip was “feeling” the distribution of electron density rather than merely mapping topography.

The article emphasized that this capability—visualising individual covalent bonds and subtle variations in bond order on a single molecule—was unprecedented and hinted at future uses for chemistry, materials design, and molecular‑electronics research.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Technical developments (2012‑present)**  

| Year | Milestone | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 2013 | Gross *et al.* published “Imaging the chemical structure of a single molecule with atomic force microscopy” (Nature 2013). They demonstrated bond‑resolved imaging of a variety of organic molecules (e.g., pentacene, PTCDA) using CO‑functionalised tips, confirming the reproducibility of the 2012 result. | Established CO‑AFM as a standard surface‑science tool. |
| 2014‑2016 | Systematic studies of tip‑tilt geometry (e.g., Hapala *et al.*, Phys. Rev. B 2014) showed that the lateral bending of the CO molecule enhances contrast for certain bond orientations. | Validated the “tilted‑CO” insight from the 2012 paper and guided tip‑preparation protocols. |
| 2015‑2020 | Bond‑resolved AFM was applied to on‑surface synthesis of graphene nanoribbons, metal‑organic frameworks, and covalent‑organic frameworks. The technique allowed researchers to verify the exact connectivity of atoms after each synthetic step (e.g., Ruffieux *et al.*, Nature 2016; Liu *et al.*, Science 2019). | Directly enabled the field of atom‑precise nanostructure fabrication. |
| 2017‑2021 | Extensions to imaging of charge‑state dependent contrast (e.g., “Charge imaging of single molecules with nc‑AFM”, Nat. Commun. 2018) and to biomolecules (DNA base pairs, Nat. Nanotechnol. 2021). | Demonstrated that the method can probe electronic as well as structural information, though still under ultra‑high‑vacuum, low‑temperature conditions. |
| 2022‑2024 | Development of qPlus sensors with higher stiffness and combined STM/AFM platforms (e.g., “Combined STM‑AFM imaging of single‑molecule reactions”, ACS Nano 2023). | Improved signal‑to‑noise and allowed simultaneous tunnelling spectroscopy, broadening the technique’s analytical reach. |

**Scientific and commercial relevance**  

* **Molecular electronics & organic semiconductors** – HBC and its derivatives remain important building blocks for organic field‑effect transistors (OFETs) and light‑emitting diodes. While the 2012 imaging did not directly accelerate a specific product, the ability to verify the exact bonding pattern of HBC on surfaces helped researchers optimise deposition and annealing protocols for thin‑film devices.  
* **On‑surface synthesis** – The bond‑resolution capability became a de‑facto quality‑control step for bottom‑up fabrication of atom‑precise graphene nanoribbons, which are now being explored for quantum‑transport experiments (e.g., edge‑state engineering).  
* **Method adoption** – By 2020, more than a dozen major surface‑science groups worldwide routinely published CO‑AFM images of individual bonds. The technique, however, remains confined to ultra‑high‑vacuum, cryogenic environments; no commercial ambient‑AFM system yet offers comparable bond‑level resolution.  
* **Policy & funding** – The striking images helped secure continued funding for high‑resolution microscopy in Europe (ERC Advanced Grants) and the US (DOE Office of Science), but there were no major regulatory changes directly tied to the work.  

Overall, the 2012 breakthrough catalysed a steady, incremental expansion of high‑resolution AFM rather than a single disruptive commercial product.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the 2012 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **AFM can routinely distinguish different bond orders within a single molecule.** | Confirmed. Numerous studies (e.g., Gross *et al.*, Nature 2013; Hapala *et al.*, Nat. Commun. 2015) have repeatedly shown i‑ vs. j‑bond contrast for a wide range of organic molecules. |
| **Tilting the CO tip improves sensitivity and will become a standard tip‑preparation step.** | Verified. Theoretical and experimental work (Hapala 2014, 2015) demonstrated that a slight lateral deflection of the CO enhances Pauli‑repulsion contrast; modern protocols deliberately allow the CO to relax during approach. |
| **Visualising electron density will enable chemists to “see” reaction mechanisms on surfaces.** | Partially realised. Bond‑resolved AFM has been used to image intermediates of on‑surface reactions (e.g., Ullmann coupling, cyclodehydrogenation) and to confirm product structures, but the technique still requires low‑temperature UHV and cannot follow fast dynamics in real time. |
| **The method will spread beyond specialist labs to broader chemical research.** | Over‑optimistic. While the technique is now standard in surface‑science groups, it has not become a routine tool in solution chemistry or biological labs because of the stringent environmental requirements. |
| **Insights from such images will directly accelerate drug discovery or large‑scale material production.** | Not borne out. No FDA‑approved drugs or mass‑manufactured materials have cited CO‑AFM imaging as a decisive factor; the impact remains largely at the level of fundamental validation of molecular structures. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article introduced a visually striking, technically novel capability that sparked a new sub‑field of molecular‑scale imaging. Its long‑term scientific influence is clear, even though the practical, commercial ripple effects have been modest.
