# AZ Spins Off Anti-Infectives (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

In February 2015, AstraZeneca announced it was spinning off its anti-infectives division into a separate subsidiary company rather than selling it outright. The company had previously shopped these assets around for cash but found no takers on their terms, making the spin-off appear to be a "last resort" option. The new entity would focus on early-stage antibiotic R&D and included AZD0914, a novel gyrase inhibitor in Phase II trials for gonorrhea treatment. Approximately 95 employees at the Waltham, Massachusetts facility were affected, with some transitioning to the new company or other AstraZeneca divisions. The article suggested that AZD0914's clinical success would largely determine the new company's fate.

## 2. HISTORY

The AstraZeneca anti-infectives spin-off became **Entasis Therapeutics**, which was officially formed as an independent company. AZD0914, the gyrase inhibitor mentioned in the article, was later renamed **zoliflodacin** and continued clinical development.

Zoliflodacin progressed through clinical trials as a potential treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea, including successful Phase II trials. In November 2023, zoliflodacin met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase III trial, demonstrating non-inferiority to the combination of ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea. This represented a significant breakthrough, as gonorrhea has shown increasing resistance to standard antibiotic treatments. However, the drug had not yet received FDA approval.

Entasis Therapeutics was acquired by **Innoviva** (formerly Theravance Biopharma) in 2022 for approximately $113 million, ending its period as an independent company. Other assets in Entasis's pipeline included SUL-DUR (sulbactam-durlobactam), which was eventually acquired by Innoviva and received FDA approval in May 2023 for treating carbapenem-resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii* infections.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**No explicit predictions** were made in the original article. The author noted that "the gyrase inhibitor's fortunes will determine a lot of the story," which was broadly accurate - zoliflodacin's success did become central to the spin-off's trajectory and eventual acquisition value. This observation was consistent with subsequent events, as zoliflodacin progressed successfully through trials and became a valuable asset.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a significant strategic pivot in pharmaceutical R&D that reflected broader industry challenges in anti-infective drug development and successfully identified the key asset that would drive subsequent developments.
