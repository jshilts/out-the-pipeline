# An Update on Vibrational Theories of Smell (August 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reviews the **vibrational theory of olfaction (VTO)** – the idea that odorant receptors detect the vibrational frequencies of molecular bonds (e.g., via inelastic electron tunneling) rather than solely their shape and electrostatics. It highlights the difficulty of obtaining decisive experimental evidence, especially the classic test of whether humans (or insects) can discriminate **deuterated** versus non‑deuterated odorants. Past studies have been plagued by impurity‑driven artefacts and noisy behavioral read‑outs. The author notes that, while many researchers still favor a lock‑and‑key (shape‑based) model, the VTO might find a niche in **engineered sensors** that exploit electron‑tunneling mechanisms, even if it never proves biologically relevant.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Experimental work (2018‑2024)**  
* **Human psychophysics** – A 2020 study by Keller, Vosshall and colleagues tested a panel of deuterated odorants and found that participants could not reliably distinguish them from their protiated counterparts, reinforcing the shape‑based view. Subsequent replications (2021‑2022) reached the same conclusion.  
* **Insect genetics** – In 2021 a Drosophila study reported that certain odorant receptors showed modest differences in response to deuterated ligands, but the effect size was small and could be explained by altered binding affinity rather than a true vibrational mechanism. No consensus emerged.  
* **Molecular modeling** – Computational work throughout the period has increasingly demonstrated that the energetic differences between isotopomers are far below the detection thresholds of known olfactory receptors, casting doubt on the plausibility of a vibrational sensor at physiological temperatures.  

**Artificial sensor development**  
* **Laboratory prototypes** – Several groups (e.g., at MIT, University of Cambridge) have built nanoscale devices that use **inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS)** to detect specific vibrational signatures of volatile compounds. These prototypes achieve high selectivity in controlled settings but have not yet been commercialized or integrated into real‑world odor‑monitoring systems.  
* **Commercial attempts** – A few startups announced “vibration‑based” electronic noses in 2022‑2023, but none have secured major customers; the technology remains at the proof‑of‑concept stage.  

**Overall impact**  
* The VTO has **not** been adopted as a mainstream explanation for mammalian olfaction.  
* No FDA‑approved drugs, diagnostics, or policy changes have stemmed from the theory.  
* Research interest has shifted toward **hybrid models** that incorporate both shape and subtle quantum effects, but these remain speculative.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article made two implicit predictions:

- **Prediction 1:** *“The VTO is dead, but long live the VTO”* – i.e., biological relevance will be disproved, yet the concept may survive in engineered sensors.  
  - **Outcome:** Largely accurate. Human and insect data have not provided convincing support for a biological vibrational mechanism, and the scientific community now treats VTO as a fringe hypothesis. Meanwhile, laboratory demonstrations of IETS‑based odor detection continue, though they have not yet become practical products.

- **Prediction 2:** *Artificial systems could exploit inelastic electron tunneling to create highly sensitive, specific odor sensors.*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially realized. Proof‑of‑concept devices exist and show impressive selectivity in the lab, but scalability, robustness, and cost remain barriers. No widespread commercial deployment has occurred as of early 2026.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is of moderate interest: it captures a long‑standing scientific controversy and points to a plausible engineering off‑shoot, but the theory has not reshaped biology or industry, and subsequent work has largely confirmed its marginal status.
