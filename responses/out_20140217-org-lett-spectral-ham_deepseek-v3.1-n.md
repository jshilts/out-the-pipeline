# The Org Lett Spectral Hammer Falls Again (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on five correction notices appearing at the top of the *Organic Letters* ASAP feed, all from the Nakada group, apparently involving NMR data editing—similar to earlier corrections from the Fukuyama group. The author notes that the corrections state the papers' conclusions and product yields remain unchanged, and interprets this as part of Editor-in-Chief Amos Smith's "data-cleaning crusade" to enforce integrity standards, with the motto "falsus in unum, falsus in omnibus" (false in one thing, false in all things).

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments included continued scrutiny of published organic chemistry literature for data manipulation and reporting irregularities. Amos Smith maintained his enforcement of data integrity standards at *Organic Letters*, resulting in additional corrections and retractions beyond the initial wave. Wider awareness grew about the prevalence of NMR data editing and image manipulation in chemistry publications, leading other journals to adopt more rigorous data inspection protocols. The Nakada and Fukuyama cases contributed to broader reform efforts emphasizing raw data deposition and improved peer review verification. These incidents were part of a larger pattern of research misconduct revelations across scientific fields that prompted publishers to implement stricter editorial oversight.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes or developments. It primarily reported on ongoing events and editorial actions rather than forecasting future trends or consequences.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the article addresses important issues of scientific integrity, its narrow focus on specific correction notices and limited broader implications restrict its lasting significance compared to more comprehensive analyses of research misconduct.
