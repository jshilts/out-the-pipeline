# A New Malaria Compound (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported on MMV390048, a small‑molecule antimalarial discovered through a Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV)‑sponsored screen of ~36 000 kinase‑focused compounds from BioFocus.  After phenotypic screening in a Plasmodium‑infected mouse model, medicinal‑chemistry optimisation (led by Prof. Kelly Chibale’s team) produced MMV390048, a pyridine‑sulfonamide that inhibits parasite kinases—later identified as the parasite phosphatidyl‑inositol‑4‑kinase (PfPI4K).  In the pre‑clinical data cited, a single oral dose of 30 mg kg⁻¹ cured mice infected with *Plasmodium berghei*, showed good oral exposure, acceptable in‑vitro safety, and activity against drug‑resistant strains.  The author highlighted the novelty of a kinase‑targeting antimalarial, the potential for a high barrier to resistance, and the imminent move of the compound into first‑in‑human trials.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development**  
- **Phase I (2015‑2017).**  MMV390048 entered a first‑in‑human, single‑ascending‑dose study in healthy volunteers (Lancet Infect Dis 2018).  The trial demonstrated dose‑proportional exposure, a half‑life of ~24 h, and no serious adverse events, confirming the safety profile anticipated from the pre‑clinical work.  
- **Phase IIa (2018‑2020).**  A proof‑of‑concept study in patients with uncomplicated *P. falciparum* malaria was conducted in Kenya and Thailand.  The drug cleared parasites rapidly (median parasite‑clearance time ≈ 12 h) and achieved cure rates > 90 % when given as a single 800 mg dose, but a small proportion of participants experienced recrudescence, prompting dose‑optimization studies.  
- **Program status (2023‑2024).**  MMV continued to support the candidate through a Phase IIb dose‑finding trial, but as of early 2024 the compound has not received regulatory approval and is not marketed.  Development has been slowed by the need to improve the “single‑dose cure” efficacy and to mitigate the emergence of PI4K‑resistance mutations observed in laboratory selection experiments.

**Impact on the field**  
- **Target validation.**  MMV390048, together with Merck’s KAF156 (ganaplacide), provided the first clinical proof that PfPI4K inhibition can clear malaria infections in humans, cementing PI4K as a validated antimalarial target.  
- **Chemical biology.**  The scaffold has been used as a probe in multiple academic studies to dissect PI4K biology across *Plasmodium* life‑cycle stages, including liver‑stage and gametocyte assays.  
- **Pipeline influence.**  The experience with MMV390048 informed MMV’s later “next‑generation PI4K” programs, which aim for higher potency and lower risk of resistance.  No other drug on the market today (e.g., artemisinin‑based combination therapies) uses a kinase‑inhibitor mechanism.

**Business and policy**  
- MMV’s partnership model (public‑private‑non‑profit) remained unchanged; the MMV390048 effort illustrated how a modest‑size nonprofit can shepherd a candidate from hit to early clinical testing.  
- No specific malaria‑policy changes were directly linked to this compound, but its progress reinforced global health funders’ willingness to invest in novel mechanism‑of‑action candidates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“The compound will be curative in humans with a single dose.”*  
  **Outcome:** Phase IIa data showed high cure rates with a single 800 mg dose, but a minority of patients required retreatment due to recrudescence.  The claim was partially realized; a truly universal single‑dose cure has not yet been demonstrated.  

- **Prediction:** *“Resistance will be slower because the inhibitor hits several malaria kinases.”*  
  **Outcome:** Laboratory selection identified point mutations in PfPI4K that confer resistance, indicating that the compound’s primary activity is on a single target rather than a broad kinase panel.  Clinically, resistance has not emerged at scale, but the mechanistic expectation proved optimistic.  

- **Prediction:** *“Combining this kinase inhibitor with existing antimalarials will give a powerful regimen.”*  
  **Outcome:** Pre‑clinical combination studies showed additive parasite killing, and MMV has pursued combination‑trial designs (e.g., MMV390048 + artesunate).  Formal clinical combination data are still pending, so the prediction remains untested but plausible.  

- **Prediction:** *“The drug will progress smoothly through the clinic because anti‑infectives have lower failure rates.”*  
  **Outcome:** While early safety was good, the need for dose optimisation and the recrudescence issue have introduced delays.  The overall attrition for antimalarials remains high; MMV390048’s path has been longer than the author anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article introduced a chemically novel, mechanism‑of‑action antimalarial that later validated a new drug target (PfPI4K) and progressed to human trials, making it historically significant even though it has not yet yielded an approved therapy.
