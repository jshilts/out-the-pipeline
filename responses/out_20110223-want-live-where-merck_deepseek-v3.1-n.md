# Want to Live Where Merck Used to Work? (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Merck's decision to convert its former Terlings Park research facility in the UK into a residential development, after failing for several years to sell it as a research site. The author notes that by 2011 the facilities were deteriorating, making a research facility sale even less likely. The piece contextualizes this within broader concerns about the state of pharmaceutical research in the UK, mentioning this as "another bad sign" following similar industry trends. The author draws a personal parallel to having worked at a research site that was later paved over for a Home Depot, while suggesting Terlings Park had better R&D location advantages than Pfizer's Sandwich site.

## 2. HISTORY

The closure and redevelopment of Merck's Terlings Park facility reflected a broader trend of major pharmaceutical companies exiting UK research operations during this period. In 2010, Merck had merged with Schering-Plough, leading to significant consolidation and site rationalization decisions. The Terlings Park site, which had been part of Merck's neuroscience research operations, ultimately became the Angle Grove residential development.

This closure was part of a larger wave: Pfizer's Sandwich research facility closed in 2011, eliminating roughly 1,500 jobs, and other major companies including AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis also downsized UK research presence during 2010-2013. The UK pharmaceutical R&D sector saw significant contraction, with industry spending on R&D in the UK declining during this period. However, the UK biotech sector eventually rebounded, with increased venture capital investment and startup formation in subsequent years.

The specific Terlings Park site was indeed redeveloped for residential use as reported, marking a definitive end to pharmaceutical research at that location.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about UK pharma research downturn**: The article's framing of Terlings Park's closure as "another bad sign" for UK pharmaceutical research was accurate. Major closures and consolidations continued through 2011-2013, including Pfizer's Sandwich site closure which the article references. Prediction: **Accurate**

• **Implicit prediction about difficulty repurposing research facilities**: The article's tone suggested research facilities facing closure would struggle to find new life as research sites. This proved generally true - many closed facilities were either demolished, converted to other commercial uses, or redeveloped for housing rather than being acquired by other research organizations. Prediction: **Accurate**

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article serves as a historically interesting snapshot of a specific moment in pharmaceutical industry consolidation, capturing the tangible impact of merger-driven site rationalizations. However, it's primarily focused on real estate and site-specific developments rather than broader biotechnology innovations or policy changes.
