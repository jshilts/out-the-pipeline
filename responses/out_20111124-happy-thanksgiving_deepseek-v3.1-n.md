# Happy Thanksgiving (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a personal blog post from Science magazine's blog written on Thanksgiving Day 2011. The author describes their traditional Thanksgiving meal in detail, including specific dishes like a kosher turkey prepared with brining, a family recipe stuffing with bread cubes and pepperoni, shirin pullo (a Persian rice dish), mashed potatoes, gravy, various vegetable sides, homemade cranberry sauce, and homemade pies. The post is written in a casual, conversational tone and focuses entirely on the author's personal Thanksgiving celebration and family culinary traditions, with only a brief mention of potentially using a telescope to look at Jupiter. The article contains no scientific content, biotechnology discussion, or industry analysis.

## 2. HISTORY
The article had no subsequent impact on biotechnology, drug development, regulatory policy, or scientific research. This was a personal lifestyle blog post about Thanksgiving dinner traditions. It did not lead to any FDA approvals, clinical trials, research methodologies, or business developments in the biotech sector. The content was purely anecdotal and personal in nature, with no professional or technical information that would warrant follow-up analysis in a scientific or biotechnology context.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

## 4. INTEREST
