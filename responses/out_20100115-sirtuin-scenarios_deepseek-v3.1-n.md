# Sirtuin Scenarios (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes the controversy surrounding Sirtris Pharmaceuticals after GSK's $720 million acquisition in 2008. The central issue was that Pfizer and Amgen researchers had reported problems with Sirtris's assays and compounds, particularly the resveratrol-based molecules being developed as sirtuin activators. The author outlines three possible scenarios: (A1) GSK knew about the assay problems but bought Sirtris for other valuable assets; (A2) GSK management was unaware of the technical problems (suggesting incompetence); or (A3) lower-level GSK scientists knew but their concerns didn't reach decision-makers in time. The author favors scenario A3, suggesting that technical concerns may have been buried under deal momentum. The piece speculates that if Sirtris had genuine alternative assets, GSK might still recoup value, but if not, the entire investment could be lost with no clinical compounds emerging.

## 2. HISTORY

The author's assessment proved prescient. Subsequent developments revealed that the fundamental issues with Sirtris's science were real and consequential:

**Scientific Validation of Concerns:** Between 2010-2012, multiple research groups confirmed that the original Sirtris compounds (including resveratrol and synthetic analogs like SRT1720) did not directly activate SIRT1 as claimed. Key publications showed that the fluorescence-based assays used by Sirtris generated artifacts. The compounds were later found to interact with the fluorophore substrate rather than the enzyme itself, invalidating the central mechanism.

**Clinical Failures:** GSK did advance some sirtuin compounds into clinical trials, but these largely failed:

- SRT2104 (for Type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, and other indications) progressed through Phase II trials but showed limited efficacy and was eventually discontinued.
- SRT2379 was studied for metabolic disorders but failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefits.
- The much-hyped resveratrol formulations showed no consistent disease-modifying effects in rigorous clinical studies.

**Corporate Impact:** By 2013, five years after the acquisition, GSK effectively dismantled Sirtris as an independent unit, integrating it into their broader R&D organization with significant layoffs. No sirtuin-activating drugs from Sirtris reached FDA approval or achieved commercial success.

**Research Evolution:** The sirtuin field itself remained scientifically important - sirtuins are indeed biologically significant proteins involved in metabolism and aging - but the therapeutic hypothesis that small-molecule activators could produce anti-aging or metabolic disease benefits via SIRT1 activation proved unfounded. The research community shifted focus toward understanding sirtuins' physiological roles rather than drug development based on the original activation mechanism.

The $720 million investment yielded negligible returns, consistent with the article's more pessimistic scenarios.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several scenario-based predictions:

• **"if A3 is what actually happened, then that sort of depends on whether we're looking at A3a or A3b. If the former, then Glaxo overpaid, but has a fighting chance to redeem itself"**
  - *Outcome:* Reality aligned with A3b rather than A3a. GSK did not redeem the investment through alternative assets, suggesting either there were no significant alternative assets worth the valuation or that the scientific problems were too fundamental.

• **"if no sirtuin compounds even go into the clinic at all, well, the question has answered itself"**  
  - *Outcome:* GSK did advance compounds to clinical trials, but they "hung there" and failed, which the author noted would be "an even worse sign than usual."

• **"If its sirtuin compounds go into the clinic and just sort of hang there, that will probably be an even worse sign than usual"**
  - *Outcome:* This proved accurate. Several compounds entered Phase II trials but lingered without clear efficacy signals before eventual termination.

• **"if, as I think, A3 is what actually happened"** (referring to technical concerns not reaching decision-makers)
  - *Outcome:* Post-acquisition events and eventual write-offs support this scenario. If GSK had solid contrary data, they would likely have continued pursuing the approach more aggressively rather than quietly winding down the programs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable scientific skepticism and predictive insight regarding one of biotechnology's most high-profile acquisitions and failures, offering a template for evaluating ambitious therapeutic claims against methodological rigor.
