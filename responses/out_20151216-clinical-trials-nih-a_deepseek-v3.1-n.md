# Clinical Trials: NIH and the Drug Industry (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines a JAMA study revealing that industry funding of clinical trials increased significantly from 2006-2014, while NIH-sponsored trials declined by about 24%. Pharmaceutical industry trials grew 43% during this period, accounting for all net growth in clinical research. The author notes this raises concerns because NIH trials are better positioned to address comparative effectiveness questions (e.g., "Drug X vs. lifestyle intervention Z") and public health priorities, while industry trials typically focus on proving efficacy of proprietary compounds. The decline in NIH trials is attributed to post-2003 budget reductions following the Bush-era funding peak, with the article arguing that the Bush increase was an historical outlier and NIH budgets had essentially returned to their pre-surge trajectory.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the trends identified largely continued and in some cases accelerated:

**NIH Funding and Trial Activity:**
- NIH funding remained relatively flat through 2016-2019, with modest increases that failed to keep pace with inflation
- The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) provided some additional funding but did not fundamentally reverse the trend
- COVID-19 brought significant but targeted emergency funding increases in 2020-2021, though this was largely earmarked for pandemic-related research rather than expanding the NIH's broader clinical trial portfolio
- Industry-sponsored trials continued dominating the landscape, particularly in oncology and rare diseases

**Regulatory and Policy Developments:**
- The FDA's use of accelerated approval pathways expanded significantly post-2015, particularly under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (2017-2019), favoring industry's faster development timelines
- Real-world evidence gained regulatory acceptance, enabling industry to supplement traditional RCTs with observational data
- Patient advocacy groups became increasingly important in trial design and recruitment, often partnering with industry

**Market Consolidation:**
- Pharmaceutical industry consolidation continued, with larger companies dominating clinical development
- CRO (Contract Research Organization) industry grew substantially, with many companies seeing 40-60% revenue growth 2015-2020, reflecting industry's expanding trial operations
- The number of active clinical trials globally exceeded 400,000 by 2021, up from approximately 200,000 in 2015

**Pandemic Impact:**
- COVID-19 trials were overwhelmingly industry-funded (vaccines, therapeutics), with Operation Warp Speed accelerating this trend
- NIH's role shifted toward coordination rather than direct sponsorship of many COVID trials
- The crisis highlighted both the strengths and limitations of industry-led rapid development

The fundamental shift toward industry-dominated clinical research that the article identified in 2015 became more entrenched, with lasting implications for research priorities, comparative effectiveness evidence, and public health decision-making.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1:** "The NIH budget does not look set to begin rising again at even its former rate"
- **Outcome:** Largely accurate. While there were modest increases, NIH budgets remained relatively flat in real terms through 2019, with pandemic-era boosts being temporary and targeted rather than restoring sustained growth trajectories.

**Prediction 2:** Industry would continue spending more on clinical trials
- **Outcome:** Accurate. Industry R&D spending increased from approximately $150 billion globally in 2015 to over $200 billion by 2021, with clinical trial costs representing a growing proportion.

**Prediction 3:** The decline in NIH trials would continue tracking budget constraints
- **Outcome:** Mixed. NIH did maintain some flagship trials (e.g., All of Us Research Program launched 2018), but its relative share of clinical research continued declining, particularly in expensive late-phase trials.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article identified a structural shift in clinical research funding that proved prescient. The trend toward industry-dominated trials has continued, with significant implications for research priorities and healthcare evidence generation. While the mechanics of this shift were already evident in 2015, the article's analysis of historical context and budget dynamics provided important explanatory depth.
