# Run, Do Not Walk, To The Nearest Exit (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article explains that the Nobel Prize nomination process differs significantly between categories. The Peace and Literature prizes have open nomination processes with poor signal/noise ratios, while the science prizes (Physiology/Medicine, Physics, and Chemistry) operate through tightly controlled committees of Scandinavian professors and prior laureates. 

The author emphasizes that the nomination process for science prizes is confidential - nominators never disclose their participation, and details remain sealed for fifty years. This means that no legitimate scientist can truthfully claim to be a "Nobel Prize nominee," as the information is never made public.

The article exposes this as a red flag used by various questionable figures, including William Hammesfahr (neurologist involved in the Terri Schiavo case), Nigerian physicist Gabriel Oyibo, various medical quacks, and Dr. Johanna Budwig - who was promoted from "six-time nominee" in 2002 to "seven-time nominee" by 2005 despite being deceased. The author warns readers to be highly skeptical of anyone claiming Nobel Prize nominee status.

## 2. HISTORY
The phenomenon of false Nobel Prize nominee claims has continued and even proliferated in the subsequent decades:

**Medical/Scientific Misinformation:** The practice remains widespread among alternative medicine practitioners, wellness influencers, and academic frauds. The internet has amplified these claims, making them easier to propagate but also easier to fact-check.

**Nobel Committee Response:** The Nobel Foundation has become more proactive in combating false claims, though the fundamental structure described in the article - confidential science nominations with 50-year secrecy - remains unchanged as of 2024.

**Dr. Johanna Budwig Legacy:** Despite her actual death in 2003, Budwig's "seven-time Nobel Prize nominee" claim continues to circulate in alternative health communities. The Budwig diet and cancer treatment claims persist online, with the Nobel nominee myth serving as false credibility.

**Academic Integrity Efforts:** Research institutions and journals have become more vigilant about credential verification, though "Nobel nominee" claims still appear periodically in suspicious contexts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article didn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, but the author's implied concerns about:
- **Continued misuse of "Nobel nominee" claims**: ✓ Accurate - The practice has continued and adapted to digital platforms
- **Credibility of nominees remaining confidential**: ✓ Accurate - This policy remains in effect
- **Public's ability to recognize false claims**: ⚠️ Mixed - While fact-checking resources have improved, misinformation also spreads more easily

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses an enduring problem in scientific and medical misinformation that remains highly relevant today. While focused on a specific credential-abuse pattern, it touches on broader issues of scientific literacy and source credibility that have only become more important with the growth of online information and health misinformation.
