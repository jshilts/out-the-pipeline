# More Fluorinated Fun (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2015 article highlights the publication of a synthetic method for generating difluorodiazomethane, a previously undescribed reagent, in situ without explosion risks. The key innovation was using t-butyl nitrite with catalytic acetic acid in chloroform to convert difluoroethylamine into the reactive intermediate. The author attributes the breakthrough to Pavel Mykhailiuk of Enamine, a Ukrainian chemical supplier, and suggests that organic chemists could leverage this new reagent for novel synthetic transformations typical of diazomethane derivatives, particularly in fluorination chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY

**Chemical Impact & Adoption:**
Following the 2015 publication, difluorodiazomethane chemistry has had limited adoption in pharmaceutical and agrochemical synthesis. The reagent remains primarily of academic interest rather than becoming a mainstream tool in industrial drug discovery. Fluorination chemistry continued to advance during this period, but the emphasis shifted more toward other reagents and methodologies that offered better selectivity or operational simplicity.

**Industrial & Commercial Outcomes:**
Enamine, the Ukrainian chemical company mentioned in the article, has continued operations but has faced significant challenges due to geopolitical events, particularly the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the company maintains its catalog and services, their overall contribution to pharmaceutical development has been constrained. Pavel Mykhailiuk continued publishing in fluorination chemistry, but the specific difluorodiazomethane technique did not translate into blockbuster pharmaceutical applications or widespread industrial adoption.

**Clinical & Drug Development Impact:**
The difluorodiazomethane reagent did not enable any FDA-approved drugs or lead to clinical candidates during the subsequent years. Fluorinated compounds remained important pharmaceutical building blocks, but this specific methodology did not achieve significant adoption in pipelines due to limitations in selectivity, scalability, and competition from alternative fluorination methods that emerged.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There were no explicit predictions in the article to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

This article covers a niche academic chemistry advance of limited practical impact on drug development.
