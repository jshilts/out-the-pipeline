# The Next Immuno-oncology Frontier? (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2018 commentary discusses a landmark Science Translational Medicine paper from the Levy group at Stanford demonstrating a novel cancer immunotherapy approach. The strategy involved two components: (1) local tumor injection of CpG oligonucleotides (a TLR9 ligand that activates innate immune sentinel cells like macrophages and dendritic cells), followed by (2) systemic administration of an OX40 agonist antibody. OX40 (CD134) is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells that provides a "second wind" survival and proliferation signal, functioning as a positive immune checkpoint.

The combination therapy showed dramatic results in mouse tumor models. While CpG alone produced strong local tumor regression, and OX40 agonist alone showed modest systemic effects, the combination led to complete regression of both injected and distant (non-injected) tumors across multiple cancer types including lymphoma, breast carcinoma, colon cancer, and melanoma. In a spontaneous metastatic breast cancer model (MMTV-PyMT), the treatment not only regressed existing tumors but prevented new tumor development, achieving 70% survival at 25 weeks versus 100% mortality at 15 weeks in controls. The therapy proved superior to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors in these models and demonstrated durable, systemic immune memory with minimal tumor recurrence.

## 2. HISTORY

The promising preclinical results described in this 2018 article did not translate into the clinical breakthrough that was hoped for. While both components entered clinical trials, the combination strategy failed to deliver transformative outcomes in human patients.

**OX40 Agonists in Clinical Development:**
Several OX40 agonist antibodies progressed to clinical trials between 2018-2024, including MEDI6469 (AstraZeneca), MOXR0916 (Roche), BMS-986178 (Bristol-Myers Squibb), and GSK3174998 (GSK). These were evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The results have been largely disappointing, with most trials showing modest response rates (typically 0-15% objective response rates) and several programs being discontinued. The mechanism failed to demonstrate the robust clinical efficacy seen in mouse models, and dose-limiting toxicities including liver enzyme elevations limited aggressive dosing strategies.

**TLR9 Agonists (CpG) Development:**
CpG oligonucleotides continued to be investigated, particularly in combination approaches. SD-101 (a CpG TLR9 agonist) was studied in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in several trials, including a Phase 2 study for lymphoma. While some signals of activity were observed, results were mixed and did not demonstrate consistent transformative benefit. The approach faced challenges including the need for intratumoral injection (limiting applicability to accessible tumors) and variable immune responses across patient populations.

**Combination Strategy:**
The specific combination advocated in the article—local CpG injection followed by systemic OX40 agonist—did not become a standard clinical approach. The translational gap between the impressive mouse results and human clinical outcomes proved substantial. This reflects a broader challenge in immuno-oncology where promising preclinical combinations often fail to replicate results in patients due to differences in tumor biology, immune microenvironment, and pharmacokinetics between species.

**FDA Approvals and Market Impact:**
No OX40 agonist or CpG/TLR9-based therapy received FDA approval for cancer treatment following this publication. The immuno-oncology field continued to be dominated by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and more recently, bispecific antibodies. The OX40 pathway, while biologically interesting, did not emerge as a clinically validated target on par with PD-1, CTLA-4, or emerging targets like LAG-3.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The CpG + OX40 combination would represent "the next wave of immuno-oncology" and "a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer."
  **Reality**: This combination did not become a standard or widely adopted approach. OX40 agonists showed limited efficacy as monotherapy and in combinations, with most clinical programs failing to advance beyond Phase 2 trials. The "next wave" of immuno-oncology instead focused on CAR-T cells, bispecific antibodies, and novel checkpoint targets beyond PD-1/CTLA-4.

• **Prediction**: The approach would be broadly effective across multiple tumor types (lymphoma, breast, colon, melanoma) and provide durable systemic immunity.
  **Reality**: Clinical trials of OX40 agonists showed very limited activity across tumor types. Response rates were typically single-digit percentages, with no clear signal of the broad efficacy seen in mouse models. The durability of responses was also modest, with most responses being transient rather than durable.

• **Prediction**: The therapy would be "curative" in contrast to PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies that "only delayed tumor growth" in the preclinical models.
  **Reality**: OX40 agonists failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in clinical trials. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have become established therapies with durable responses in multiple cancer types, while OX40 agonists have not shown comparable benefit.

• **Prediction**: The "exact CpG formulation used in this study is already in human trials" would facilitate rapid clinical translation.
  **Reality**: Despite CpG formulations being in clinical trials, they did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy to drive regulatory approval or widespread adoption. The entire class of TLR agonists has struggled to find clear clinical indications in oncology.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlights a scientifically elegant and highly promising preclinical combination that captured the immuno-oncology field's attention, but its clinical failure serves as an important case study in the challenges of translating mouse tumor immunology to human patients. The mechanistic insights remain valuable even as the therapeutic approach failed.
