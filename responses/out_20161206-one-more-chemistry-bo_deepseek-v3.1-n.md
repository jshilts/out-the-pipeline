# One More Chemistry Book (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal book promotion post by Derek Lowe from his "In the Pipeline" blog. Lowe announces the publication of his own book, "The Chemistry Book," which serves as a curated collection of milestones in chemistry. He explicitly acknowledges his bias as the author while recommending it as a worthwhile gift for readers broadly interested in chemistry. The post mentions that he's received positive feedback from non-chemist readers since its publication. The article is primarily a brief promotional piece, separate from his other book recommendations to avoid complications with Amazon's affiliate fee policies.

## 2. HISTORY

"The Chemistry Book" by Derek Lowe was published by Sterling in 2016 (ISBN 978-1454911808). The book presents 250 milestones in chemical history, arranged chronologically, spanning from ancient discoveries to modern developments. 

**Publication Impact and Reception:** The book achieved moderate commercial success, maintaining availability through major retailers like Amazon. It received generally positive reviews from both scientific and lay audiences, consistent with Lowe's mention of positive feedback from non-chemist readers. The book's accessible format made it suitable for general science education and gift-giving purposes.

**Professional Context:** This publication added to Lowe's established reputation as a science communicator through his long-running "In the Pipeline" blog, which continued to be a respected voice in drug discovery commentary. The book complemented his existing body of work without fundamentally changing his professional trajectory or influence within the pharmaceutical industry discourse.
