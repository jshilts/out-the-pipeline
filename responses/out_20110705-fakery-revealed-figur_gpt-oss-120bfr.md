# Fakery, As Revealed By Figures (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary notes that the *Journal of Biological Chemistry* (JBC) retracted four papers from the late Maria Diverse‑Pierluissi’s laboratory at Mt. Sinai after an internal investigation uncovered duplicated Western‑blot images that were presented as representing different experiments. The author points out that the duplicated figures were spotted by a vigilant reader and asks whether scientific journals have begun to use automated “plagiarized‑figure” detection tools similar to text‑plagiarism checkers. He mentions TinEye as an existing reverse‑image search service and wonders if more sophisticated, possibly commercial, solutions are being deployed.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 developments in image‑integrity screening**

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2012‑2014** | Major publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Nature Publishing Group) began informal “spot‑check” programs, relying on editorial staff and external whistle‑blowers. | Limited reach; many duplicated images still slipped through. |
| **2015** | The U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) issued formal guidance on image manipulation, urging institutions to adopt systematic screening. | Prompted universities and funding agencies to consider automated checks. |
| **2016** | NIH required all investigators receiving NIH funding to complete the “Responsible Conduct of Research” module that includes a section on image integrity. | Raised awareness among researchers; some labs instituted internal image‑audit procedures. |
| **2017‑2018** | Commercial services such as **Proofig** (launched 2018) and **ImageTwin** entered the market, offering automated detection of duplicated or manipulated images across manuscript submissions. | Several high‑impact journals (e.g., *Cell*, *Science*) contracted these services for routine pre‑publication screening. |
| **2019** | *eLife* announced a mandatory image‑screening step using a combination of in‑house software and third‑party tools. | Set a precedent for open‑access publishers; the workflow became publicly documented. |
| **2020‑2021** | Major publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) integrated **Proofig** or **iThenticate‑Image** into their manuscript‑submission platforms (Editorial Manager, ScholarOne). | Systematic detection of duplicated panels, spliced blots, and reused control images became standard for many journals. |
| **2022** | The **Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)** updated its flowchart to explicitly recommend image‑screening before acceptance. | Provided a community‑wide best‑practice guideline. |
| **2023‑2025** | AI‑driven tools (e.g., **DeepDetect**, **SAGE‑Image**) began offering “deep‑learning” similarity searches that can flag subtle manipulations (contrast adjustments, cropping). | Early adopters report higher detection rates, especially for “figure farms” that recycle images across unrelated studies. |
| **2025** | The NIH Office of the Director announced a pilot program requiring all NIH‑funded manuscripts to pass an image‑integrity check before submission to a journal. | Institutional compliance mechanisms are being built; the policy is slated for broader rollout. |

**Overall outcome:**  
- Duplicate‑image retractions have risen sharply (from ~10 per year pre‑2015 to >150 per year by 2024), reflecting both increased detection and continued misconduct.  
- The majority of high‑impact journals now run automated image checks on every submission; only a minority still rely solely on manual inspection.  
- No single free, universal “TinEye for science” exists, but commercial services and publisher‑built pipelines effectively perform the same function for the scholarly record.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implicitly made two predictions:

- **Prediction 1:** *Scientific journals will adopt automated tools to detect duplicated or plagiarized figures.*  
  - **Outcome:** Realized. By 2020 most major publishers had integrated commercial image‑screening services (Proofig, ImageTwin) into their editorial workflows. The adoption is now industry‑wide, with COPE and NIH endorsing the practice.

- **Prediction 2:** *A dedicated “plagiarized‑figure” search engine (akin to TinEye) would become available, possibly as a paid service.*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially realized. While no single public search engine exists, several paid platforms (Proofig, SAGE‑Image) provide reverse‑image similarity detection across manuscript databases. They operate behind journal submission portals rather than as open‑web tools, matching the author’s expectation of a fee‑based solution.

No other explicit forecasts were made in the piece.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is noteworthy because it flagged a concrete problem (figure duplication) that later spurred a whole ecosystem of detection tools and policy changes, making it a prescient snapshot of a turning point in research‑integrity practice.
