# More on Autism and Mercury (December 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2002 commentary addresses the hypothesized link between thimerosal (a mercury-containing preservative used in vaccines) and autism. The author argues against two specific mechanisms: first, a specific brain-lesion effect from thimerosal (similar to MPTP toxicity), and second, a general organomercury poisoning effect. The author contends that mercury poisoning typically produces a broad range of neurological symptoms that appear simultaneously, whereas autism is too specific a condition to be explained by general mercury toxicity. The commentary references both an Institute of Medicine report and what it calls "the Rochester data," suggesting these sources support the conclusion that a thimerosal-autism link is unlikely.

## 2. HISTORY

The thimerosal-autism hypothesis became a major public health controversy in the late 1990s and early 2000s, partly fueled by a 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield (later retracted) and increasing autism diagnoses coinciding with the childhood vaccine schedule. In 2001, thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines in the U.S. as a precautionary measure. Numerous large-scale epidemiological studies conducted since the early 2000s—including studies from Denmark, Canada, the U.K., and the U.S.—have not found an association between thimerosal exposure and autism. The Institute of Medicine issued multiple reports (2001, 2004) concluding that evidence did not support a causal link. In 2010, the Lancet fully retracted Wakefield's 1998 paper due to ethical violations and falsified data, and Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register. Vaccination rates declined in some communities due to "vaccine hesitancy," contributing to measles outbreaks in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The core prediction, or argument, within the article is:
*   **That the thimerosal-autism link "isn't the answer."**
    *   **Evaluation:** This prediction was largely born out. The scientific consensus, based on extensive evidence accumulated since 2002, is that there is no causal link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. While the article expresses this as a likelihood ("increasingly likely"), the direction of its argument was correct. The "Rochester data" it alludes to, from studies on mercury levels in infants, was part of a body of evidence that ultimately helped refute the hypothesis. The author's 2002 skepticism was well-founded and aligned with the subsequent scientific consensus.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**
This article provides a well-reasoned, early counterpoint to a widespread and impactful public health controversy, accurately questioning a hypothesis that subsequent research would largely debunk, even as the issue continued to have significant societal consequences.
