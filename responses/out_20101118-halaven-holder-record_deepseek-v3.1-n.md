# Halaven: Holder of the Record (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article announces the FDA approval of Eisai's Halaven (eribulin) for late-stage breast cancer in November 2010. The author highlights that eribulin represents the most synthetically complex non-peptide drug ever marketed at that time, originating from marine sponge compounds but requiring total synthesis for commercial production. The piece compares eribulin's complexity to historical examples like Merck's hydrocortisone synthesis and Roche's Fuzeon peptide drug, ultimately arguing that eribulin's synthetic pathway surpasses these precedents in complexity. The author invites readers to suggest other candidates that might exceed eribulin's synthetic sophistication.

## 2. HISTORY

Following FDA approval in November 2010 for metastatic breast cancer after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, Halaven (eribulin) gained additional approvals over the subsequent decade. In 2016, the FDA expanded its indication to include liposarcoma (soft tissue sarcoma) based on Phase 3 trial data showing improved overall survival. The drug was also approved in Japan, the EU, and other markets.

Clinical reality proved mixed. While eribulin demonstrated modest survival benefits in heavily pretreated patients (approximately 2-3 months improvement in overall survival), its adoption remained limited to late-line treatment settings due to significant toxicity including neutropenia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The drug never achieved blockbuster status, with global sales peaking around $400-500 million annually.

By the 2020s, eribulin had been largely displaced as first and second-line therapy by newer targeted agents, antibody-drug conjugates, and immunotherapy options. It remains primarily a third-line or later option for metastatic breast cancer patients. The compound's complex total synthesis (over 60 steps) remains a chemical achievement but has not been replicated for other approved drugs, as pharmaceutical industry emphasis shifted toward more modular synthetic approaches and biologics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made one implicit prediction:
- **That eribulin would remain the record-holder for synthetic complexity among marketed non-peptide drugs:** This largely held true through the 2010s, as no subsequent marketed small-molecule drug has surpassed eribulin's synthetic complexity. The prediction was narrow and technical—focused solely on synthetic complexity metrics rather than clinical or commercial success—and empirical evidence supports that the record remained unbroken in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3/9**

The article addresses a highly specific technical achievement (synthetic complexity) rather than broader therapeutic or scientific impact, limiting its lasting interest primarily to medicinal chemistry specialists rather than the broader biopharmaceutical community.
