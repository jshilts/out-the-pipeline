# A Technical Question (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from February 2005 is primarily a technical question directed at the Movable Type blogging community. The author, apparently a blogger in the biotech or pharmaceutical space, asks for help with a content management issue: how to publish older posts directly to category archives without having them appear on the main page. The author mentions wanting to republish two specific content series: one on chemical weapons that readers had requested, and another series called "Birth of an Idea" that chronicles the development of an idea to increase drug discovery success rates. The author notes having experienced "mood swings" during the idea's development and expresses interest in returning to work on this concept in their lab.

## 2. HISTORY

This post appears on what seems to be a biotech industry blog from the mid-2000s era when Movable Type was a popular blogging platform. The author appears to be a researcher or industry professional documenting their work and ideas. The post itself is a technical administrative query rather than substantive biotech content, asking about blog functionality rather than discussing scientific developments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No specific predictions about biotechnology, drug discovery, or industry trends are made in this article. This is purely a technical question about blog management and content organization, not a forward-looking analysis of the biotech field.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: 0/10

This post is not actually about biotechnology or the drug industry - it's a technical support question about blog software functionality. The brief mention of "drug discovery success rate" ideas and chemical weapons content is incidental to the main purpose of the post, which is seeking help with Movable Type category archives. This falls outside the scope of what would be considered a meaningful biotechnology industry commentary article.
