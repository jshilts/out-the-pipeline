# The NIH v Moderna
(November 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary examines the patent inventorship dispute between Moderna and the NIH regarding the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The article explains that while Moderna filed a patent application for the current vaccine excluding NIH scientists, NIH researchers filed their own relevant patent applications that likewise excluded Moderna personnel—creating a direct collision over who conceived the crucial inventive steps.

The author outlines the key legal framework: US patent law operates on first-to-file (not first-to-invent since 2013), with requirements for novelty, utility, and non-obviousness, plus strict inventorship rules where anyone who contributed to conception must be named. The central dispute revolves around which insights from prior MERS coronavirus mRNA work and which specific RNA modifications (pseudouridine substitutions, codon optimization, prefusion-stabilizing prolines, etc.) constituted the essential inventive contributions. A particularly contentious point noted is the prefusion stabilization technique patented by NIH researchers that BioNTech licensed but Moderna did not. The stakes involve licensing control and profit shares, with NIH co-inventorship potentially giving the agency a say in how the patents are ultimately licensed post-pandemic—even though Moderna pledged not to enforce patents during the health crisis.

## 2. HISTORY

The Moderna-NIH patent dispute continued for years after this article, culminating in a significant resolution. In **December 2022**, Moderna and the NIH announced they had settled the dispute. Under the agreement, Moderna acknowledged NIH scientists as co-inventors on key patents for the COVID-19 vaccine, specifically recognizing three NIH researchers (Dr. Barney Graham, Dr. John Mascola, and Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett) for their contributions to the prefusion-stabilized Spike protein design.

This settlement carried concrete financial implications: Moderna agreed to pay the U.S. government through a license agreement, though specific dollar amounts were not publicly disclosed. The resolution ensured that the NIH (and by extension U.S. taxpayers who funded the research) would share in the substantial revenues from the vaccine. Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine generated approximately $18.4 billion in revenue in 2022 alone, following $17.7 billion in 2021. The acknowledgment of NIH inventorship provided precedent-setting recognition of federal researchers' role in pandemic-response pharmaceutical development and established a framework for revenue-sharing from publicly funded innovations.

Regarding the broader patent landscape, the prefusion stabilization technology that the article highlighted (originally developed at NIH for MERS and applied to SARS-CoV-2) became recognized as a critical enabling innovation. This stabilization approach was indeed used not only by Moderna but also by Pfizer-BioNTech in their competing mRNA vaccine, for which they had licensed the NIH patent. The resolution thus validated the article's assessment that this specific technical contribution would be central to inventorship determinations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about the dispute's trajectory:

- **Prediction: The dispute would be "detailed, complicated, and ugly, and a great many legal hours are going to be billed along the way."**
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate—the dispute continued for over a year before resolution, and the eventual settlement involved substantial legal negotiations and recognition of NIH co-inventorship. The complexity was validated by the time required and the eventual licensing arrangement, though actual court litigation was avoided through settlement.

- **Prediction: The arguments would center on RNA modifications (pseudouridine, codon optimization, prefusion prolines) and who conceived these crucial steps.**
  - **Outcome**: This was confirmed—the eventual settlement specifically addressed the prefusion stabilization contribution by NIH researchers, demonstrating that these technical details were indeed pivotal to the inventorship determination.

- **Prediction: If NIH were found to be co-inventors, they would "have a say in how the patent does eventually get licensed and in the profits to be made."**
  - **Outcome**: This proved correct—the settlement established a licensing framework with financial compensation to NIH, giving the agency a direct stake in the commercialization outcomes.

- **Prediction (Implicit): The dispute would extend beyond the pandemic period and involve post-pandemic enforcement.**
  - **Outcome**: Moderna's pledge not to enforce patents during the pandemic held, and the settlement addressed long-term licensing, validating that the core issues extended beyond immediate crisis response.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article addresses a high-stakes inventorship dispute over one of the most impactful medical products of the century, correctly identifying the technical and legal issues that would prove decisive. While the resolution ultimately came through settlement rather than prolonged litigation, the piece accurately anticipated the central role of specific RNA engineering innovations and successfully highlighted how publicly funded research contributions translate into patent rights and commercial value in the mRNA vaccine space.
