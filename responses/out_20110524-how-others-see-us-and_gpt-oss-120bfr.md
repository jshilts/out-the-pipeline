# How Others See Us (And How We See Them) (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Forbes‑linked piece reports on a 2011 Quintiles survey that asked four stakeholder groups—biopharma executives, managed‑care payers, physicians, and patients—what they consider most valuable in a new drug.  

When respondents were given an open‑ended question, **cost** topped the list for payers and physicians, while **outcomes** (clinical efficacy) ranked higher for biopharma executives (only ~10 % of physicians mentioned outcomes). Patients mentioned cost but far less than the other groups, and many answered “not sure.”  

When the same question was presented as a multiple‑choice list, **patient outcomes** and **safety** became the top two factors for **all** groups, followed by **quality of life** and then **cost**.  

Agreement with the statement “the money patients spend on prescription medication is worth it” was high among biopharma staff (84 %) and patients (80 %), lower among physicians (70 %) and managed‑care respondents (56 %).  

Finally, when asked to rank who adds the most value to health care, **doctors and medical staff** were consistently placed first, **scientists/medical researchers** second, and **biopharma companies** near the bottom (11 % by their own peers, 5 % by patients, 1 % by physicians and payers). The author interprets this as a perception that “real science” lives outside the commercial drug‑development world.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Shift from Cost‑Centric to Outcomes‑Centric Evaluation  
* **Value‑Based Pricing & Contracts** – Starting around 2013, major U.S. payers (e.g., Cigna, UnitedHealth) began piloting outcomes‑based contracts for high‑cost therapies (e.g., oncology, rare‑disease drugs). By 2020, dozens of such agreements existed, reflecting the survey’s later‑year finding that outcomes are now a primary decision factor.  
* **FDA’s Real‑World Evidence (RWE) Framework** – The 2018 FDA guidance on RWE formalized the use of post‑approval data to assess effectiveness and safety, directly addressing the “outcomes” concern raised by the survey.  

### Patient‑Centric Measures Become Standard  
* **Patient‑Reported Outcome (PRO) Instruments** – The FDA’s 2019 PRO guidance and the widespread adoption of instruments such as EQ‑5D, PROMIS, and disease‑specific scales have made outcomes and quality‑of‑life data a regulatory and reimbursement requirement.  
* **ICER and QALY Adoption** – The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) began publishing cost‑effectiveness analyses for many new drugs in 2016, influencing payer negotiations and reinforcing the importance of outcomes over pure price.  

### Biopharma’s Reputation and Market Performance  
* **Revenue Growth vs. Public Perception** – From 2011 to 2024, global biopharma sales grew ~3‑fold (≈ $1.5 trillion in 2024). Despite the growth, public trust metrics (e.g., Gallup, Pew) have remained modest, with roughly 45‑50 % of U.S. adults expressing confidence that drug companies put patients first. This aligns with the low “value‑add” rating the survey gave to biopharma.  
* **Strategic Shifts** – Companies have increasingly emphasized “patient‑centric” R&D (e.g., Novartis’s “patient‑first” platform, Roche’s “real‑world evidence” units). The rise of “digital therapeutics” and companion diagnostics also reflects a move toward measurable outcomes.  

### Policy and Regulatory Changes  
* **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** – Mandated the inclusion of patient‑focused drug development (PFDD) data in FDA submissions, institutionalizing the outcomes focus highlighted in the survey.  
* **Medicare Part D Reforms (2020‑2023)** – Introduced “coverage with evidence development” for certain high‑cost drugs, requiring manufacturers to collect outcomes data to maintain reimbursement.  

### Overall Impact  
The survey’s snapshot of divergent stakeholder priorities foreshadowed a decade of convergence around **outcomes, safety, and quality‑of‑life** as the primary value drivers. Cost remains a negotiation lever, but it is now framed within value‑based frameworks rather than as a standalone ranking factor.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the article) | What actually happened (2021‑2026) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Stakeholders will eventually prioritize outcomes and safety over cost when evaluating new drugs.** | Outcomes and safety now dominate payer formularies, FDA labeling, and HTA (health‑technology assessment) decisions. Cost is still critical but is evaluated through cost‑effectiveness ratios. | **Accurate** – the shift is evident across the industry. |
| **Biopharma companies will be seen as low contributors to health‑care value.** | Public trust in pharma remains modest; however, many payers now view pharma as a partner in value‑based contracts. The “low value” perception persists in surveys but is mitigated by collaborative models. | **Partially accurate** – perception improved modestly but not to the level of physicians or researchers. |
| **Patients will increasingly view drug spending as worthwhile.** | 2022‑2024 patient surveys show ~70‑75 % agreement that prescription drugs are worth the cost, similar to the 80 % reported in 2011. The gap has narrowed slightly with rising drug prices. | **Accurate** – patient sentiment remains broadly positive, though price sensitivity has grown. |
| **Managed‑care organizations will continue to focus on cost over outcomes.** | Managed‑care plans now embed outcomes metrics in contracts; cost is still a factor but is balanced against performance guarantees. | **Inaccurate** – managed care has moved toward outcomes‑based evaluation. |
| **Scientists and researchers will retain the highest perceived value in health care.** | Academic and translational researchers continue to be highly respected, but the rise of “industry‑academic” collaborations has blurred the line. Surveys in 2023 still rank clinicians and researchers at the top. | **Accurate** – the perception remains largely unchanged. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article captures a pivotal moment in the early‑2010s when the industry began grappling with divergent value perceptions—a theme that has shaped the subsequent decade of value‑based health care. Its relevance endures, though the piece is more of a snapshot than a deep analysis, limiting its long‑term scholarly impact.
