# Article Title (Month Year)
**Yes, The Research Works Act Is Dead** (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief article from Science Magazine's blog announces that the sponsors of the Research Works Act—Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Darrell Issa (R-California)—have withdrawn the legislation and will not be bringing it forward. The author notes that Elsevier's earlier backtrack on supporting the bill was indeed the signal that the act was defeated.

The Research Works Act was controversial legislation that would have prohibited federal agencies from requiring public access to taxpayer-funded research, effectively blocking open access policies like NIH's Public Access Policy that mandated research funded by taxpayer dollars be made freely available to the public. The bill had strong backing from commercial publishers like Elsevier, who stood to benefit from maintaining paywall restrictions on publicly funded research.

## 2. HISTORY
The defeat of the Research Works Act in February 2012 proved to be a pivotal moment for the open access movement, with several concrete developments following:

**Expansion of Public Access Policies**: In February 2013, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy directed all major federal research agencies to develop plans requiring public access to federally funded research. This built on the NIH Public Access Policy that the Research Works Act had attempted to dismantle.

**National Institutes of Health (NIH)**: NIH's Public Access Policy, established in 2008, continued and strengthened. By 2023, NIH had over 4.7 million articles in PubMed Central, with approximately 140,000 new articles added annually, all freely available to the public.

**Clinical Impact**: The maintenance and expansion of open access policies enabled broader dissemination of biomedical research. Studies on FDA-approved drugs, clinical trial results, and treatment protocols became more readily accessible to clinicians, researchers, and patients worldwide.

**Business Outcomes**: While publishers like Elsevier continued their business models, open access publishing grew substantially. The defeat prevented legislative protection of paywalls for publicly funded research, leading to increased market competition and the rise of open access publishers and preprint servers.

**Policy Evolution**: The 2013 OSTP memo affected agencies across the federal research enterprise (NSF, DOE, NASA, etc.), establishing a new landscape where open access to publicly funded research became the norm rather than the exception.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions appear in this brief announcement article. The piece is purely descriptive reporting of the current events (bill withdrawal), rather than predictive in nature. It does not make claims about future developments, though the author's implicit assumption that this was a significant defeat for opponents of open access proved accurate.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **6/10**

This article marked an important moment in the ongoing evolution of scientific publishing and public access to research, with concrete policy consequences that affected millions of research publications and the broader research ecosystem.
