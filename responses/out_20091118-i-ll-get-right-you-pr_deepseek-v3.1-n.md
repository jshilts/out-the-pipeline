# I'll Get Right On That For You, Professor (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal anecdotal article in which the author reflects on his lazy approach to coursework during graduate school, particularly in physical chemistry. He recalls avoiding problem sets, not taking notes during lectures, and being unprepared when called upon in class. The piece describes specific incidents where he and a classmate were caught unprepared at the blackboard, and how a professor noticed his lack of engagement and tested him during a lecture on More O'Ferrall plots. The author expresses relief at moving from coursework to full-time lab work, where his learning style was better suited.

## 2. HISTORY

This article appeared on Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which was hosted on the Science magazine website (science.org). Lowe's blog was already well-established by 2009 as one of the most widely read chemistry and pharmaceutical industry blogs. The blog continued operating on Science.org for several more years before eventually moving to other platforms.

After 2009, Derek Lowe continued writing "In the Pipeline" regularly, maintaining it as a prominent voice in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery commentary. The blog became known for its insider perspective on pharmaceutical research, clinical trials, and industry trends. Lowe's writing style remained consistent - personal, anecdotal, and accessible while discussing technical topics.

The specific incidents and professors mentioned in this particular article did not become significant reference points in subsequent scientific literature or public discourse. The article was simply one of many blog posts in Lowe's extensive archive of pharmaceutical industry commentary.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contains no predictions about future developments in biotechnology, pharmaceutical research, or scientific methodology. It is purely retrospective, reflecting on past graduate school experiences without making forward-looking statements about scientific trends, drug development, regulatory changes, or industry evolution.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article ranks low in interest for biotechnology industry analysis as it is purely personal memoir content with no discussion of biotech developments, drug discovery, clinical trials, or industry trends relevant to the biotechnology sector.
