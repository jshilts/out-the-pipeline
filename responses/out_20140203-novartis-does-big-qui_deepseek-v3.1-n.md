# Novartis Does A Big, Quiet Reshuffle (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Novartis's announcement that it would maintain roughly the same global headcount while cutting or moving 4,000 jobs and opening a major center in Hyderabad, India, capable of employing up to 8,000 people. The commentary notes this contrasts with AstraZeneca's simultaneous decision to cut back operations in India and suggests Novartis is engaged in job reshuffling from higher-wage regions to Hyderabad. The author clarifies that these positions are primarily IT, clinical trial monitoring, HR, and other office roles rather than bench research positions. The analysis frames this as an economic arbitrage strategy that makes business sense, with the expectation that wage differentials will eventually close as India's economy improves, benefiting all stakeholders.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 announcement, Novartis proceeded with its Hyderabad expansion as planned, establishing what became one of their largest global service centers. The Hyderabad campus, officially opened in phases between 2014-2016, consolidated various global business services including finance, IT, procurement, and clinical trial support functions. By 2016-2017, the center employed several thousand people as projected, though reaching the full 8,000 capacity took longer than initially envisioned.

This strategy aligned with broader pharmaceutical industry trends of the mid-2010s, where multiple major companies (including Pfizer, GSK, and others) established similar shared services centers in India and other lower-cost locations. The model proved economically viable as companies sought to reduce operational costs while maintaining global reach. Novartis continued operating the Hyderabad center through subsequent years, though global headcount fluctuations occurred due to various portfolio rationalizations and restructuring programs.

Notably, this job relocation strategy did not significantly impact Novartis's drug development pipeline or FDA approval rates, which continued on their own trajectories determined by R&D decisions rather than support function locations. The company maintained its position among top pharmaceutical firms, with numerous drug approvals occurring in subsequent years, including treatments for cancer, heart failure, and other conditions, demonstrating that back-office relocation decisions operated independently from core scientific and clinical development outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The author anticipated that the economic arbitrage opportunity would continue "until the price differential closes" through India's economic improvement and rising wages.
- **Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate. India's economy did grow significantly throughout the 2010s, and wages for skilled professionals in Hyderabad and other major Indian cities increased substantially, reducing (though not eliminating) the cost arbitrage advantage by the late 2010s and early 2020s. Many companies continued maintaining Indian operations due to established infrastructure and talent availability, even as cost savings moderated compared to 2014 levels.

- **Prediction**: Implicit expectation that the reshuffling would proceed smoothly with manageable inefficiencies
- **Outcome**: Novartis successfully executed the transition, establishing a major operational hub in Hyderabad that continues operating today, suggesting the logistical challenges were indeed manageable within the scope of their large-scale operations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captured an important operational trend in pharmaceutical industry globalization during the mid-2010s, but primarily documented a corporate restructuring decision rather than fundamental scientific or medical developments.
