# Tone It Down (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Atomwise, a Y Combinator-backed biotech startup, for overly optimistic publicity. A TechCrunch piece quoted Atomwise co-founder Alex Levy claiming he could "predict a cure to measles" from his apartment, with the company having screened 8.2 million compounds for multiple sclerosis treatments in days using AI. The author (Derek Lowe, writing for Science Magazine's "In the Pipeline") calls this "hubris" and warns that such claims damage credibility within the drug discovery community. Atomwise responded in comments acknowledging the critique, agreeing that communicating computational drug discovery accurately is challenging, especially in differentiating "hits from cures" for general audiences, while noting their internal validation studies.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 critique, Atomwise has continued operating as a computational drug discovery company using AI for virtual screening. The company has developed its AtomNet platform, a deep learning system for structure-based drug design. Atomwise has not publicly announced FDA-approved drugs resulting from its platform in the subsequent years. The company has established partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions, including continued work on various therapeutic areas. However, the specific projects mentioned in 2015 (Ebola and measles treatments) have not resulted in widely deployed therapies. While computational approaches have become increasingly integrated into drug discovery pipelines, the field has not seen the revolutionary transformation in timelines or success rates that early hype suggested. The company's business model has evolved toward collaborative partnerships and internal programs, but concrete drug approvals from Atomwise's platform remain elusive.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Immediate Disease Cures from Home**: Levy's claim of "predicting a cure to measles" from his apartment significantly overstated capabilities. No such cure emerged, and computational hit identification remains far from clinical cures.

• **Revolutionary Speed**: The claim of screening 8.2 million compounds "in days instead of years" suggested near-term transformation of drug discovery. While computational screening is faster than traditional methods, actual drug development timelines have not compressed dramatically—drug discovery still takes many years, and clinical success rates remain challenging.

• **"Taking Out Guesswork"**: The suggestion that AI would eliminate uncertainty "before you get started" proved overly optimistic. Drug discovery remains probabilistic, with many candidates failing despite promising computational predictions.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

The article's significance lies in capturing a recurring pattern in biotech where early AI hype clashes with the field's hard realities, but it lacks specific drug outcomes or major policy impacts to warrant higher interest.
