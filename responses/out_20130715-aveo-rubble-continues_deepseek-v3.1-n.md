# Aveo: The Rubble Continues to Bounce Around (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes the crisis at Aveo Pharmaceuticals following the FDA's rejection of their kidney cancer drug tivozanib. The company faced multiple severe problems: their stock price had crashed after the regulatory failure, they had laid off 62% of their staff (140 employees), including their commercial team, and they had just received an SEC subpoena related to the drug's approval process. The author notes that FDA had apparently suggested a year earlier that Aveo's late-stage trial work needed supplementation with a new study, leading to surprised analysts and class-action lawsuits after the stock collapse. The piece characterizes remaining Aveo stockholders as either extremely risk-tolerant investors or those trapped with sunk-cost positions from more hopeful times, with little realistic expectation of recovery.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2013 crisis, Aveo's story took several significant turns over the subsequent decade:

**Tivozanib's eventual approval**: In March 2021, the FDA approved tivozanib (brand name Fotivda) for adults with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following two or more prior systemic therapies. This came nearly eight years after the initial rejection and represented persistence by the company through multiple clinical and regulatory challenges.

**Clinical pathway**: The drug went through additional clinical trials after the 2013 setback, including the TIVO-3 trial which supported the eventual approval. This demonstrated that tivozanib showed efficacy in the relapsed/refractory setting, which was a different treatment landscape than the first-line setting where the initial FDA rejection occurred.

**Company transformation**: In the years between 2013 and 2021, the treatment landscape for kidney cancer evolved significantly, with multiple other drugs approved for kidney cancer patients.

**Business survival and evolution**: Despite the massive layoffs and stock collapse in 2013, the company did not go bankrupt. They continued operations, reorganized, and pursued the longer-term development pathway for tivozanib. The eight-year gap between the initial regulatory failure and eventual approval demonstrates the extremely long timelines and persistence required in pharmaceutical development.

**Market conditions**: By 2021, the competitive landscape for kidney cancer treatments had become more crowded, with several immunotherapy and targeted therapy options available, though tivozanib carved out a specific niche in the relapsed/refractory setting.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions and characterizations that can be evaluated:

• **"Good luck with that" regarding stock recovery**: The implication was that Aveo stock was essentially worthless. However, with eventual FDA approval in 2021, the company did achieve some vindication, though whether early 2013 investors recovered significant value would depend on their entry and exit timing through the eight-year period of uncertainty.

• **Implicit suggestion that the company might not survive**: While the author didn't explicitly predict bankruptcy, the tone suggested extreme pessimism about the company's prospects. In reality, Aveo did survive, though at great cost (massive layoffs) and requiring nearly a decade to achieve their primary regulatory goal.

• **Skepticism about management's ability to "explain the OS data and win approval"**: The original management was criticized for overconfidence. While the initial approval attempt failed in 2013, the eventual 2021 approval did ultimately vindicate the drug's potential, though under different leadership and after substantial additional clinical work.

• **Characterization of the stock as only appealing to extremely risk-tolerant or trapped investors**: Given the eight-year timeline and eventual approval, early 2013 investors would indeed have needed extremely high risk tolerance and patience to see the eventual outcome.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article is moderately interesting as a case study in pharmaceutical development realities, showing how regulatory setbacks can create multi-year delays requiring extreme persistence and capital. It's valuable for illustrating that initial FDA rejections don't always mean complete dead ends, though the path to eventual approval can take nearly a decade. The story lacks extraordinary broader implications for the biotech industry beyond these standard development challenges.
