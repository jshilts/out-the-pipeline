# Critical Analysis of "Zafgen's Epoxide Pays Its Way" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Zafgen, a startup developing an obesity drug with an unusual covalent epoxide structure targeting MetAP2. At publication, the company had successfully cleared Phase II trials and was going public with an IPO. The author notes the compound's structure was one that many drug discovery scientists would have immediately rejected as unworkable, making its progress noteworthy for potentially expanding the boundaries of feasible drug design.

The piece frames this as a success story combining scientific innovation with proper financial and managerial execution—both crucial elements for small companies to survive. The author expresses particular interest in following the compound through Phase III trials to see if this seemingly improbable structure could ultimately succeed, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in drug development where even scientifically promising approaches face long odds.

## 2. HISTORY

Zafgen's story after 2014 took dramatic turns that were not anticipated in this optimistic article. The company's lead drug, beloranib, continued into Phase III trials for treating obesity in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by insatiable hunger and severe obesity.

However, in October 2015, the FDA placed clinical holds on both of Zafgen's ongoing trials following two patient deaths. By January 2016, a third patient death was reported. Ultimately, the company announced it would discontinue development of beloranib after the FDA indicated that additional safety requirements would be needed for approval, effectively killing the program.

The company pivoted, acquiring rights to other drug candidates and shifting focus. In 2019, Zafgen merged with Larimar Therapeutics and effectively ceased to be the same entity. The "improbable" epoxide drug that had generated excitement never reached the market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's predictions were largely incorrect, though understandably so given the inherent uncertainty of drug development:

**Wrong predictions:**
- That the compound would advance successfully through Phase III trials
- That Zafgen would maintain its trajectory toward becoming a successful obesity drug company
- That the IPO success would translate into long-term market success

**What the article got right:**
- The acknowledgment that "mistakes with any of [the scientific, financial, and managerial parts] can sink the whole effort" proved prescient, though the actual failure mode was safety concerns rather than management issues
- The recognition that even scientifically promising approaches face long odds in drug development
- The importance of financial and managerial execution alongside scientific innovation

The article's wariness about the difficulty of drug development was appropriate, even if the specific outcome couldn't have been predicted.

## 4. INTEREST SCORE: 6/9

This article earns a 6 out of 9 for interest. While it captures an important moment in biotechnology venture capital and drug development—the transition from promising Phase II results to IPO excitement—the ultimate failure of Zafgen's program makes it more of a cautionary tale than a breakthrough story. The piece is valuable as a case study in the volatility and uncertainty of drug development, showing how quickly a seemingly successful trajectory can reverse due to safety issues. The fact that this "improbable" structure actually failed rather than succeeded adds educational value about the importance of early safety signals and the brutal reality that expanding the boundaries of drug discovery doesn't guarantee clinical success. However, the company's ultimate fate makes this less historically significant than successful innovations that actually reached patients.
