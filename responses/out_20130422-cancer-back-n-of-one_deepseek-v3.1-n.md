# Cancer: Back to N-of-One (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses how researchers are revisiting failed oncology clinical trials by examining "exceptional responders" — patients who showed dramatic responses to drugs that proved ineffective overall. It highlights a pancreatic cancer patient treated by Gerald Batist at McGill University who responded remarkably to farnesyltransferase inhibitors, remaining cancer-free a decade later despite these drugs having failed in broader clinical trials and been abandoned by pharmaceutical companies.

The piece also describes work by David Solit at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, who found an exceptional responder in a failed everolimus bladder cancer trial. Tumor sequencing revealed mutations in the TSC1 gene, suggesting that patients with specific genetic profiles might respond to drugs that fail in unselected populations. The author acknowledges this approach will benefit few patients initially, as it targets rare molecular subtypes, but argues it represents necessary progress toward understanding cancer's molecular diversity. The article cautions that cancer heterogeneity and complex tumor cell mixtures will make this journey challenging and time-consuming.

## 2. HISTORY

**Exceptional Responder Programs:**
Following this trend, the NCI launched the Exceptional Responders Initiative in 2014, systematically investigating patients who responded unusually well to treatments. This program has since identified multiple genomic markers that predict drug sensitivity.

**Everolimus and TSC1 Mutations:**
The TSC1 mutation finding proved significant. Research continued, and mTOR inhibitors like everolimus have shown activity in TSC1-mutant cancers. However, everolimus did not become a standard bladder cancer treatment. Instead, the field moved toward immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab) and antibody-drug conjugates (enfortumab vedotin) for bladder cancer.

**Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors:**
These drugs remained largely abandoned. No farnesyltransferase inhibitor achieved FDA approval for solid tumors, though tipifarnib gained some interest for hematologic malignancies.

**Genomic Profiling in Oncology:**
Comprehensive genomic profiling became standard practice in oncology. FoundationOne CDx, MSK-IMPACT, and other platforms now routinely sequence tumors, guiding treatment selection. The exceptional responder concept evolved into broader precision oncology approaches.

**Impact on Drug Development:**
Drug development increasingly incorporates biomarker-driven patient selection from early clinical trials. Basket trials and umbrella trial designs became common, testing drugs in molecularly defined populations regardless of tumor histology. The FDA began approving drugs based on biomarkers rather than tumor type alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"These n-of-1 studies will be of direct benefit to very few people"**: This proved accurate initially. Exceptional responder programs helped small numbers, but their value was identifying patterns that informed broader precision oncology.

• **"...eventually we'll want to have all these things tracked down... that's going to take quite a while"**: This proved prescient. Over a decade later, we still don't have complete cataloguing of all cancer molecular subtypes. Progress has been significant but incremental.

• **The general concept that understanding cancer heterogeneity would be valuable**: This was correct. Precision oncology based on molecular profiling became standard of care, though the field moved toward broader biomarker-based approaches rather than purely individual n-of-1 studies.

• **"...it's going to be quite a slog through the sequencing jungle"**: Accurate. Despite technological advances, interpreting tumor sequencing remains complex and requires specialized expertise.

• **Recognition of multiple tumor cell types within single cancers**: This became well-established as tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution became central to cancer biology, complicating treatment but also revealing therapeutic vulnerabilities.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article correctly anticipated core directions in precision oncology and the value of exceptional responders while maintaining appropriately cautious expectations about speed and scope of impact—balancing insight with realism.
