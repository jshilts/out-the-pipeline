# Another Pain Drug Wipes Out (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article reports on Zalicus's announcement that its lead pain drug Z160—a calcium channel blocker—failed in a pair of Phase II clinical trials, showing no efficacy. The failure came just a year after another major clinical failure for the company's rheumatoid arthritis drug, driving the stock down significantly and putting the company in a precarious position (following a recent 1-for-6 reverse split to maintain listing). The author frames this as another example of the broader drug development challenges in the pain field, where finding new compounds without the side effects of older drugs (like opiates) or treatments for other types of pain has proven extremely difficult and led to numerous failures.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2013 failure, Zalicus's trajectory demonstrates the consequences of continued pipeline setbacks. In 2014, Zalicus merged with Epirus Biopharmaceuticals and adopted the Epirus name, essentially ending its independent existence after its lead programs failed. This followed a pattern of corporate transformation: the company had already rebranded from CombinatoRx to Zalicus after earlier disappointments. 

Calcium channel blockers for pain (particularly N-type calcium channels like Z160 targeted) continued to face challenges in clinical development after 2013. While calcium channel blockers have proven efficacy in cardiovascular applications, their translation to chronic pain indications has remained problematic in subsequent years. No major breakthrough pain medications targeting this mechanism gained FDA approval in the years immediately following this failure, underscoring the ongoing validation challenges in analgesic drug discovery.

The broader pain drug development landscape remained difficult post-2013. Opioids continued to dominate pain management despite their well-documented addiction and side effect problems, while alternative mechanisms struggled with efficacy, safety, or both. This historical context shows how Z160's failure fit within a persistent pattern of challenges in developing effective non-opioid analgesics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
While this article mainly reported on events, it carries an implicit assessment of Zalicus's future viability:

• **Company viability implications**: The author clearly suggests Zalicus's future was problematic ("company's stock is getting driven down into the ground"), which proved accurate as the company merged/rebranded within a year
• **Drug development field assessment**: The characterization of pain as a "nightmarish" therapeutic area with persistent challenges has been borne out by continued difficulties in developing effective pain medications in subsequent years

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This case illustrates the high failure rate and corporate consequences in pain drug development, with Zalicus serving as a specific example of how repeated Phase II failures can lead to corporate restructuring or acquisition within this challenging therapeutic area.
