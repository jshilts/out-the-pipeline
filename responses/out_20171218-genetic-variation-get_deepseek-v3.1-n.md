# Genetic Variation Gets More Real All the Time (December 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a landmark study published in Cell that analyzed genetic variation across 64,000 people from the Exome Aggregation Consortium, focusing specifically on 108 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are targeted by FDA-approved drugs. The research identified over 14,000 variants in these drug-target receptors, with a long-tailed distribution showing each receptor having an average of 3-4 common variations and 128 rare ones across the population. About 2,000 of these variants fell into functionally important regions such as drug-binding pockets and allosteric sites.

The study provided experimental validation using the mu-opioid receptor, demonstrating that different genetic variants could significantly alter drug response—some showing reduced signaling across all drug classes, while others exhibited selective changes to specific types of opioids. The authors highlighted implications for drugs including Belsomra (suvorexant), cannabinoids, and GLP-1 agonists like Byetta (exenatide), suggesting that a substantial fraction of the population carries variant receptors that could lead to unexpected drug responses.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2017 study reflected a critical inflection point in understanding pharmacogenomics at scale. Since its publication, several developments have occurred:

**Regulatory Progress**: While the article noted that no GPCR-targeting drugs had genetic variant information on their labels in 2017, this began changing. The FDA started incorporating pharmacogenomic information into drug labels more systematically, though GPCR-specific guidance remained relatively limited compared to cytochrome P450 variants.

**GPCR Drug Development**: The GLP-1 receptor agonist class mentioned in the article (exenatide/Byetta) expanded dramatically with the introduction and massive commercial success of semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound). These became multi-billion dollar drugs, though genetic variation testing did not become standard practice for prescribing. The orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant (Belsomra) saw modest uptake but faced competition from newer agents like lemborexant.

**Technical Infrastructure**: The Exome Aggregation Consortium data referenced in the paper evolved into larger initiatives including gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database), which now contains over 140,000 exome sequences and 15,708 whole-genome sequences as of 2024, dramatically expanding the catalog of human genetic variation.

**Clinical Implementation**: Despite the compelling data, routine genetic testing before GPCR-targeting drug prescriptions did not become widespread practice in most clinical settings. Cost, turnaround time, and uncertain clinical utility for many variants limited adoption.

**Opioid Crisis Context**: The mu-opioid receptor variants discussed took on additional significance as the opioid crisis intensified, though genetic testing for opioid response remained primarily investigational rather than standard care.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1**: "We're finally heading for that era of personalized medicine that everyone keeps talking about"
- **Outcome**: This happened selectively rather than broadly. While pharmacogenomic testing expanded for certain drug classes (especially warfarin, clopidogrel, and some cancer drugs), routine genome sequencing before drug prescriptions did not become standard practice for most medications, including most GPCR-targeting drugs.

**Prediction 2**: "There are no GPCR-targeting drugs with any human genetic variants flagged by regulatory agencies on the label, but that is surely going to change as sequencing gets relentlessly cheaper and more widespread"
- **Outcome**: Partially accurate. Regulatory agencies did incorporate more pharmacogenomic information into drug labels, but GPCR-specific guidance remained relatively limited. Sequencing costs continued to drop dramatically (whole genome sequencing fell from thousands to hundreds of dollars), yet clinical adoption lagged behind technical capabilities.

**Prediction 3**: The article's prediction that personalized medicine would more often involve "telling people that the drugs that work for the rest of the population won't work for them" rather than finding optimal treatments
- **Outcome**: This proved broadly accurate. Many implemented pharmacogenomic interventions focused on avoiding adverse events or therapeutic failures rather than identifying super-responders. Preemptive testing programs emerged but remained limited to specific populations and drug classes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important moment in genomic medicine, highlighting both the technical capabilities emerging from large-scale sequencing and the practical challenges in translating genetic data to clinical care. The central tension it identified—between genetic potential and clinical implementation—remains highly relevant today and represents a persistent gap in precision medicine.
