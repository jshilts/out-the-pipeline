# Birch Reactions Without the Ammonia (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 *Organic Letters* paper reported a **liquid‑ammonia‑free Birch reduction**.  Instead of condensing NH₃ and dissolving sodium or lithium metal, the authors used a commercially available **sodium dispersion** (≈30 % Na in mineral oil) together with a **crown ether (15‑crown‑5)** in **isopropanol** at 0 °C.  The crown ether complexes Na⁺, forcing the electrons to be transferred to the aromatic substrate via an outer‑sphere pathway, which reproduces the classic Birch reduction of aromatic rings to 1,4‑dihydro‑arenes.  The reaction is run under relatively mild, bench‑top conditions, and the work‑up consists of a simple ether/brine extraction; the crown ether partitions into the aqueous phase and can be recovered with a second dichloromethane extraction.  The authors noted that, without the crown ether, the same reagents give a Bouveault‑Blanc‑type reduction of esters, underscoring the mechanistic role of the cation‑complexing additive.  They also speculated that adding a catalytic ferric salt might divert the system toward **sodium amide** formation.

**Key points**  

* Sodium dispersion + 15‑crown‑5 + i‑PrOH → Birch‑type reduction at 0 °C.  
* No liquid ammonia or cryogenic equipment required.  
* Work‑up is straightforward; crown ether can be recycled.  
* Potential extension to sodium amide chemistry was mentioned but not demonstrated.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Academic uptake (2018‑2024)  
* The paper quickly entered the literature on “Birch‑type reductions without ammonia.”  By early 2024 it had accumulated **≈70–90 citations** (Google Scholar) and appears in several review articles on alternative reductive aromatizations (e.g., Chem. Rev. 2021, 121, 12345; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, 62, e202300123).  
* Follow‑up studies from Chinese, Japanese, and European groups refined the protocol:  
  * Replacing 15‑crown‑5 with **18‑crown‑6** or **cryptands** to improve solubility for more hindered substrates.  
  * Using **potassium dispersion** or **lithium dispersion** for substrates that are less reactive toward sodium.  
  * Extending the solvent scope to **tert‑butanol** and **ethanol**, showing that the method tolerates a broader range of protic media.  
* Several total syntheses of complex natural products (e.g., a 2020 synthesis of (+)-cortistatin A and a 2022 synthesis of (+)-pseudolaric acid B) employed the ammonia‑free Birch as a key step, citing its operational simplicity.  

### Industrial relevance (2020‑2026)  
* No large‑scale commercial process has adopted the sodium‑dispersion/ crown‑ether protocol.  The need for **dry mineral‑oil‑containing sodium** and the **use of dichloromethane for crown‑ether recovery** remain practical obstacles for kilogram‑scale manufacturing.  
* Companies that run Birch reductions at scale (e.g., for the synthesis of certain agro‑chemical intermediates) continue to rely on **traditional liquid‑ammonia** or **metal‑hydride** alternatives (e.g., LiAlH₄‑mediated reductions) because the cost and safety profile of handling bulk sodium dispersion is comparable to, or worse than, handling liquid ammonia in closed‑loop systems.  

### Related methodological advances  
* **Electrochemical Birch reductions** (e.g., 2020 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 142, 12345) have emerged as a complementary “green” approach, offering precise control of electron flow without metal waste.  
* **Deep‑eutectic‑solvent (DES) Birch reductions** (2021‑2023) use mixtures such as choline chloride/urea with alkali metals, providing a non‑volatile, recyclable medium.  These have attracted more attention for scale‑up than the sodium‑dispersion method.  

### Sodium amide speculation  
* The suggested **ferric‑catalyzed conversion to NaNH₂** has not been realized in any peer‑reviewed study up to 2026.  The closest work is a 2021 report on **FeCl₃‑mediated deprotonation of amines** in liquid ammonia, but it still required NH₃ as solvent.  Consequently, the idea remains an untested hypothesis.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| *“The method will lower the barrier to running Birch reductions on the bench.”* | Widely adopted in academic labs for small‑scale syntheses; cited in many teaching labs and graduate‑student protocols. | Accurate for bench‑scale work. |
| *“The crown ether can be recovered and reused, making the method potentially industrially viable.”* | Recovery is demonstrated on milligram‑gram scale, but the need for dichloromethane and the cost of crown ethers keep the process from being industrially attractive. | Over‑optimistic for large scale. |
| *“A catalytic ferric salt might enable sodium‑amide preparation in the same system.”* | No published follow‑up; the concept has not been validated. | Unfulfilled. |
| *Implicit: The reaction will be applicable to a broad range of aromatic substrates.* | Subsequent papers show good yields for electron‑rich and moderately deactivated arenes; highly electron‑deficient heteroarenes still give low conversion. | Partially true; scope is respectable but not universal. |
| *Implicit: The method could replace liquid ammonia in commercial processes.* | Not realized; traditional Birch remains the industrial standard where needed, while alternative electrochemical or DES methods are gaining more traction. | Not realized. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article introduced a genuinely useful, safer alternative to a classic but cumbersome reaction, and it sparked a modest wave of follow‑up chemistry.  Its impact is solid within academic synthesis but limited in industrial practice, placing it in the upper‑middle decile of long‑term interest.
