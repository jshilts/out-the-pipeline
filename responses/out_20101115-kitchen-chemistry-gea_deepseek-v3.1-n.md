# Kitchen Chemistry Gear (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the blurring lines between organic chemistry laboratory equipment and high-end kitchen tools, specifically noting how vacuum apparatus and rotary evaporators (rota-vaps) traditionally used in chemistry labs were becoming available for home culinary use. The author, writing from a chemist's perspective, observes that the crossover between cooking and chemistry was intensifying as sous vide techniques and lab-grade equipment became accessible to home cooks.

## 2. HISTORY
The intersection of laboratory equipment and culinary arts that the author observed in 2010 continued to evolve significantly. Sous vide cooking, which was still relatively niche in 2010, became mainstream over the next decade with consumer sous vide devices like Anova Culinary and Joule entering the market at accessible price points ($100-200). However, rotary evaporators for home use remained a novelty rather than widespread household items due to their high cost and complexity.

The molecular gastronomy movement, which drove much of this equipment crossover, peaked in influence in the 2010s but became more commercialized through restaurants rather than home adoption. Companies like Modernist Pantry made specialized equipment more available, but lab-grade gear like rotary evaporators largely stayed in professional or serious enthusiast circles. The predicted market for countertop rota-vaps never materialized at scale, with these devices remaining expensive specialty items ($2,000-10,000).

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: That rotary evaporators (rota-vaps) would become kitchen counter appliances for home use
  - **Reality**: This did not materialize on any significant scale. While some high-end enthusiasts and professional chefs adopted them, they remain expensive specialty items rather than mainstream kitchen equipment.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2/9**

This represents an interesting cultural observation about overlapping domains, but it documents a trend that remained relatively niche rather than transforming everyday life.
