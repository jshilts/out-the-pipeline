# The Drug Worked, Unfortunately (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2014 commentary analyzes Oxigene's Phase II results for fosbretabulin (combretastatin A-4 phosphate) in recurrent ovarian cancer. The drug showed positive data, increasing progression-free survival when combined with Avastin compared to Avastin alone, particularly in platinum-resistant patients. However, the article identifies a critical strategic problem: Avastin itself was not FDA-approved for this indication when Oxigene designed its trial. Roche was simultaneously running trials for Avastin plus standard chemotherapy in the same indication, with data that appeared stronger than Oxigene's combination results. The article highlights the paradox that Oxigene may have proven its combination inferior to a competing regimen that could become the new standard of care.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication, the strategic concerns proved prescient. Roche's Avastin did receive FDA approval for recurrent ovarian cancer, establishing it as standard of care and creating a higher bar for Oxigene. Oxigene (later renamed Mateon Therapeutics) continued developing fosbretabulin but struggled with clinical and regulatory challenges. The drug failed to achieve significant commercial success or widespread adoption. Between 2016-2020, Mateon faced multiple setbacks, including clinical trial failures and financial difficulties. The company eventually merged with Ellerman Investments in 2020 to form CNS Pharmaceuticals, effectively marking the end of fosbretabulin's development pathway as a major commercial opportunity. No drug based on combretastatin A-4 phosphate achieved blockbuster status or transformed ovarian cancer treatment, and the vascular disrupting agent approach did not become a widely adopted therapeutic strategy in oncology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **The article predicted** that Roche would likely get FDA approval for Avastin in recurrent ovarian cancer, which would become the new standard of care. **Outcome**: Roche did receive approval, validating this prediction.

• **The article predicted** that Oxigene would face tough Phase III decisions and might have proven their combination's inferiority relative to the Roche regimen. **Outcome**: Oxigene/Mateon's subsequent clinical and commercial struggles confirmed they failed to establish superiority or meaningful market position.

• **The article predicted** that bold strategic steps would be necessary for Oxigene's survival. **Outcome**: The company ultimately required restructuring and merger, though this did not salvage the fosbretabulin program's commercial viability.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5**

The article demonstrates solid analytical foresight about clinical development strategy, correctly anticipating regulatory and competitive dynamics, though the relatively narrow scope of a single company's pipeline limits broader impact.
