# Martin Shkreli Arrested (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports the arrest of Martin Shkreli, the controversial pharmaceutical executive, on securities fraud charges related to his former company Retrophin. The author notes that federal prosecutors and the SEC had brought both criminal and civil charges, alleging that Shkreli had been illegally moving money between entities to cover losses from his hedge fund activities. The piece suggests that given Shkreli's reputation for "loophole-seeking, the-rules-don't-matter behavior," the accusations seem plausible. The article also mentions the immediate market impact, with shares of KaloBios (a company Shkreli had recently acquired) dropping approximately 50% in premarket trading following the arrest.

## 2. HISTORY

Following his December 2015 arrest, Shkreli was charged with multiple counts of securities fraud, conspiracy, and other federal crimes. In August 2017, he was convicted on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The charges specifically related to his management of hedge funds MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, as well as his leadership role at Retrophin, where prosecutors proved he had used Retrophin assets to pay off investors from his failed hedge funds.

In March 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to 7 years in federal prison and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million. During his incarceration, Shkreli continued to generate controversy, including being banned from social media for harassing a journalist and having his internet access restricted in prison.

Separately, while serving his sentence, Shkreli faced antitrust charges related to his notorious 2015 decision as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals to raise the price of Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per pill. In 2021, he was convicted of antitrust violations for engaging in a scheme to monopolize the Daraprim market and was ordered to pay $64.6 million in disgorgement. He was also banned for life from the pharmaceutical industry. Shkreli was released from federal prison in May 2022 but was transferred to a halfway house before completing his sentence at home with electronic monitoring.

The case became emblematic of broader public concerns about drug pricing practices and pharmaceutical industry ethics, contributing to ongoing policy debates about healthcare affordability and pharmaceutical regulation in the United States.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific predictions about future events, but rather commentary on ongoing developments. The closest to prediction was the author's assessment that "confident swagger will not work as well as he may have become accustomed to" in Federal criminal proceedings. This assessment proved accurate: Shkreli's defiant public persona and courtroom demeanor did not prevent his conviction and significant prison sentence, confirming that his typical approach was indeed ineffective in the federal criminal justice system.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/10**

This article reports an early development in what became a multi-year saga involving white-collar crime, pharmaceutical industry ethics, and public policy debates. While significant within the scope of Shkreli's personal legal troubles and the broader drug pricing discussion, it represents one early chapter rather than a transformative event in biotechnology or pharmaceutical science itself.
