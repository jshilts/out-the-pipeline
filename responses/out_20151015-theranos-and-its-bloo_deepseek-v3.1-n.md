# Theranos And Its Blood Test Machine (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This October 2015 article captures the early breaking of the Theranos scandal. Theranos was a high-profile blood testing startup that claimed it could run numerous tests from just a single drop of blood using its proprietary "Edison" machine, promising faster, cheaper, and more accurate results than conventional laboratories. The company had attracted significant media attention since 2013 and was valued at billions of dollars.

The article summarizes a groundbreaking Wall Street Journal investigation by John Carreyrou revealing that Theranos's technology was struggling severely. Allegations included that the Edison machine was only being used for a small fraction of tests, employees had concerns about accuracy, the company failed to report problematic results to regulators, and they diluted blood samples to levels that could compromise results. The article notes the FDA had already requested Theranos stop using its nanotainer technology for all but one test, information the company had not disclosed publicly. The piece frames this as a collision between Silicon Valley hype and the rigorous demands of analytical chemistry and medical testing.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent developments following this article led to one of the most dramatic corporate collapses and fraud cases in modern American business history:

**Regulatory Actions and Clinical Impact**: 
- By July 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) banned Elizabeth Holmes from operating a clinical laboratory for two years and revoked Theranos's CLIA certification.
- Theranos voided or corrected tens of thousands of blood test results from 2014-2015, admitting the tests could not be relied upon. No Theranos-developed blood testing methods ever received FDA approval for clinical use.
- No drugs were approved or patient treatments developed based on Theranos technology, as the core premise was fundamentally flawed.

**Business Collapse**:
- Theranos's valuation plummeted from a peak of $9 billion in 2014 to effectively zero by 2018. The company filed for bankruptcy in September 2018.
- Investors lost over $700 million, including prominent figures like Rupert Murdoch, the Walton family, and Betsy DeVos.

**Criminal and Civil Consequences**:
- Elizabeth Holmes was convicted in January 2022 on four counts of fraud after a lengthy trial revealing systematic deception about the company's technology capabilities. She was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison.
- Sunny Balwani, Holmes's former partner and company president, was convicted on 12 counts of fraud and sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison.

**Policy and Industry Impact**:
- The case led to increased scrutiny of startup valuations and claims in the healthcare sector, particularly regarding diagnostic technologies.
- It highlighted the critical importance of scientific validation before scaling medical technologies.
- The case did not result in major changes to FDA regulatory frameworks, but reinforced the existing stringent requirements for medical diagnostics.

**Technology Adoption**:
- Theranos's microsampling blood testing approach was never adopted or validated by the scientific community or medical laboratories. The fundamental concept of running comprehensive panels from a single drop of blood proved scientifically unworkable at the time.
- No legitimate peer-reviewed publications validated Theranos's core technology, and subsequent analysis confirmed the methodology was physically and chemically implausible.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions and Outcomes**:

• **Implicit prediction that Theranos technology would be validated or exposed**: The article predicted a need for Theranos to "demonstrate, in great detail and at excruciating length, that their technology works the way that they say it does." **Outcome**: The technology was definitively proven to be fraudulent and non-functional through subsequent investigations, regulatory findings, and criminal trials.

• **Prediction about cult of personality vs. analytical chemistry**: The article noted that analytical chemistry "is not something that responds very well to well-crafted TED talks, high-profile magazine pieces, and photo shoots." **Outcome**: Completely validated. The scientific and medical communities ultimately rejected the hype, leading to criminal fraud convictions based on the gap between claims and actual technical capabilities.

• **Concerns about blood sample dilution**: The article raised concerns that small blood samples were "diluted to what could be problematic levels." **Outcome**: Later investigations confirmed this was scientifically unworkable and contributed to unreliable results.

• **Prediction that people "are going to be very upset if it falls apart"**: **Outcome**: Validated through investor losses, patient harm from unreliable results, and widespread public attention to healthcare fraud.

• **Implicit prediction about technology adoption**: Contrary to early claims of revolutionary impact, Theranos's technology never achieved clinical use, FDA approval, or scientific acceptance.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 8**

This article proved to be highly prescient analysis at the very beginning of the Theranos scandal, accurately identifying the fundamental tension between Silicon Valley hype culture and the rigorous evidence requirements of medical technology. It captured a watershed moment in healthcare startup history that had lasting implications for investor scrutiny, regulatory oversight, and the public understanding of medical device validation.
