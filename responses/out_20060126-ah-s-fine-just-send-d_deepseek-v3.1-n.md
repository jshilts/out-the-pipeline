# Article Title (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a humorous patent application error discovered in US patent application 20030004652, which published in early 2006. The patent described a system for monitoring animal behavior during drug testing, featuring a module with sensors to collect physical and biological data from test subjects. The system was designed to assess behavior, neurology, biochemistry, and physiology to observe drug effects and determine a drug's signature.

The article's main focus however was on a glaring error in the patent abstract where the drafters left in parenthetical editing comments. Specifically, the abstract included the phrase "(NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PORTABILITY)" in the middle of describing the module's portability advantages. The author criticizes this as a severe proofreading failure that could jeopardize the patent's novelty and enablement requirements.

## 2. HISTORY

The patent application US 20030004652 was indeed published on January 4, 2006, titled "System and method for assessing animal behavior and the behavioral effects of drugs." However, this application never matured into an issued patent and was abandoned by 2008, suggesting it failed to overcome the substantive patentability requirements.

The three listed inventors were Michael Brecht, Jian-Young Wu, and Daniel J. Gardner. The technology described was filed by New York University (NYU), indicating this was university research rather than startup innovation. In terms of technological development, the field of automated animal behavior monitoring did advance significantly after 2006, with companies like Noldus Information Technology, Clever Sys, and ViewPoint Behavior Technology developing sophisticated video-tracking and sensor-based systems for behavioral phenotyping.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did include a prediction about the patent's fate:

- **Prediction 1: "You're going to have a tough time with the novelty and enablement requirements"**
  - **Actual Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate. The patent application was abandoned in 2008 without issue, indicating the applicants either couldn't overcome patentability rejections or chose not to continue prosecution, possibly due to the quality issues highlighted in the article.

- **Prediction 2**: No explicit predictions about the broader field of animal behavior monitoring technology
  - **Actual Outcome**: The broader field succeeded despite this particular patent's failure. Automated behavioral monitoring systems became essential tools in pharmaceutical and academic research, with multiple commercial vendors succeeding where this NYU invention failed to gain traction.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article primarily serves as amusing legal trivia about a proofreading failure rather than substantive biotechnology content. While entertaining for patent professionals, it provides little insight into biotech industry developments, drug discovery outcomes, or meaningful technological trends, making it of limited long-term importance for understanding the biotech sector.
