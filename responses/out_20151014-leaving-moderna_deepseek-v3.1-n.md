# Leaving Moderna (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 blog post questions Moderna Therapeutics, describing it as a "well-funded enigma" despite having raised substantial capital and secured high-profile partnerships. The author highlights the departure of Moderna's head of research, Joseph Bolen (who joined from Millennium in 2013), as well as the earlier quiet departure of their cardiovascular research head to ISIS Pharmaceuticals. The central concern is the company's opacity—despite enormous funding and many development projects, no one outside the company knew key details about how their mRNA-based technology actually worked or performed. The article raises the question: if Moderna was truly a revolutionary platform ready to launch multiple drugs, why were senior research leaders leaving?

## 2. HISTORY
The skepticism expressed in this 2015 article proved largely unfounded in retrospect. Moderna went on to achieve remarkable success:

**Clinical and Regulatory Success:**
- Moderna's mRNA platform delivered the first clinical proofs of concept within a few years. Most notably, their COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273, later named Spikevax) received FDA emergency use authorization in December 2020 and full approval in January 2022. The vaccine demonstrated approximately 94% efficacy in Phase 3 trials and became one of the two dominant mRNA vaccines deployed globally.

**Commercial Impact:**
- Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine generated approximately $18.4 billion in revenue in 2021 and $19.3 billion in 2022, transforming the company from a pre-clinical stage startup into a major pharmaceutical company. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide received Moderna's vaccine.

**Pipeline Development:**
- Beyond COVID-19, Moderna advanced multiple programs into clinical trials including vaccines for influenza, RSV, CMV, and personalized cancer vaccines (mRNA-4157). Their RSV vaccine received FDA approval in May 2024, and their influenza vaccine candidate showed positive Phase 3 results.

**Business Evolution:**
- Moderna conducted a successful IPO in December 2018 at a $7.5 billion valuation. The company's market capitalization peaked at over $200 billion during the pandemic. The senior leadership turnover mentioned in the 2015 article did not prevent the company's ultimate success.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Implicit prediction in the article:** That Moderna's secretive nature and senior researcher departures suggested potential problems with the underlying technology or company trajectory.

**Outcome:** This prediction proved incorrect. The departures did not indicate fundamental problems with the mRNA platform. Moderna's technology ultimately proved highly effective, particularly for rapid vaccine development. The company's early-stage secrecy was characteristic of competitive biotech environments rather than a red flag.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 9**

This article represents a fascinating case study in the difficulty of evaluating early-stage biotech companies, particularly those with novel platforms. The skepticism expressed was reasonable given the available information in 2015, yet Moderna's subsequent success demonstrates how transformative validated platform technologies can be. The tension between the article's doubts and Moderna's eventual pandemic-response triumph makes this historically significant for understanding biotech investment, platform validation, and the evolution of mRNA therapeutics.
