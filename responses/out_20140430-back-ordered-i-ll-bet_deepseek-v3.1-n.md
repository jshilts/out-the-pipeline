# Back Ordered, I'll Bet (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a commercial listing on "Ebuychem.com" for "octa-azacubane" (C₈N₈), an exotic nitrogen-rich compound described as "a solid cube o' nitrogen atoms". The author notes they'd never heard of this supplier but found it intriguing that such a niche chemical was openly listed. The piece reflects skepticism about commercial availability of such an unusual material, and the author bets it would be "back ordered."

## 2. HISTORY
I can note a few relevant developments after 2014:

- **Octaazacubane** (C₈N₈) remains an exotic theoretical compound in experimental chemistry. It has not entered mainstream industrial production or routine research use. As far as I'm aware, no commercial therapeutics have been developed using octaazacubane, nor have any drugs targeting this molecule reached FDA approval.
- **E-commerce for chemicals** has broadly expanded since 2014, but most major platforms focus on catalog chemicals, reagents, and routine intermediates rather than highly unstable or theoretical target molecules priced for serious synthetic effort.
- **High-energy-density materials research** has continued, including other nitrogen-rich compounds as energetic materials or novel explosives, but octaazacubane is not a workhorse molecule in those programs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: That "octa-azacubane" would likely be "back ordered"—i.e., not actually available from a casual online seller.
- **Outcome**: Largely accurate. Octaazacubane has never become an off-the-shelf chemical, and I can find no FDA-approved drugs built around its chemistry or any substantial clinical pipeline. The compound remains an exotic, difficult synthetic target with no established supplier catalog presence. The broader idea—that hyper-exotic molecules are not genuinely available just because a webpage lists them—is empirically sound.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
This is a brief observational post rather than a research or policy piece, with limited relevance to biotechnology broadly. It highlights the gap between exotic chemistry and pragmatic availability but doesn't connect to downstream therapeutics or industry developments.
