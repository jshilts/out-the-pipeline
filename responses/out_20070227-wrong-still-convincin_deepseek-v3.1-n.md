# Wrong, But Still Convincing (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a major retraction scandal in structural biology involving Geoffrey Chang's research group at Scripps. The researchers had solved the structure of MsbA, a bacterial ABC transporter protein, using X-ray crystallography in 2001 - a significant achievement given the difficulty of crystallizing membrane proteins. However, in 2007 it was discovered that five papers on various protein structures had to be withdrawn due to erroneous data.

The problem was traced to a "homebrew software" bug that swapped two columns of data, producing structures that appeared valid but were completely wrong. The error became apparent when another research group at ETH Zurich solved a similar bacterial transporter structure that should have been comparable to Chang's MsbA structure but looked quite different. The article emphasizes how even "solid" experimental data like X-ray crystallography can produce convincing but incorrect results when computational processing goes wrong.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2007 retraction of five papers by Geoffrey Chang's group was one of several high-profile crystallography retractions during this period, marking a cautionary moment for structural biology. However, the field of ABC transporter research continued to advance substantially:

**Scientific Impact**: The ABC transporter field ultimately recovered and expanded significantly. More reliable structures of ABC transporters were eventually solved, including the correct MsbA structure and other medically relevant transporters. The P-glycoprotein (MDR1), which is crucial in cancer drug resistance, and CFTR, whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis, were among the important ABC transporters whose structures were better characterized following this period.

**Broader Consequences**: This incident did not derail drug development programs targeting membrane transporters. Several transporter-targeted drugs have reached the market, such as various P-glycoprotein inhibitors studied for overcoming multidrug resistance in cancer (though clinical success in this area has been mixed).

**Methodological Changes**: The incident reinforced the importance of validation in structural biology. It highlighted the need for multiple validation methods, cross-checking against related structures, and community scrutiny of published structures. This period also coincided with the rise of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as an alternative structural determination method that proved particularly valuable for membrane proteins.

**Clinical/Target Success**: While ABC transporters as drug targets have had mixed success, some specific targets have proven valuable. The broadest impact remains in understanding drug pharmacokinetics and resistance mechanisms, which has influenced drug development strategies even if direct targeting of specific transporters has been challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and observations about transporter biology and computational methods:

• **"Transporters are essential to understanding resistance to antibiotics and cancer therapies"** ✓ **Correct** - This prediction proved accurate. ABC transporters like P-glycoprotein have been extensively studied in cancer drug resistance, and efflux pumps remain important in antibiotic resistance research.

• **"We're not going to be able to get a handle on the often-inscrutable distribution of drug candidates in living systems until we know more about these proteins"** - **✓ Mostly validated** - Transporter biology has indeed become crucial for understanding drug ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), though progress has been incremental rather than revolutionary.

• **Implicit prediction that incorrect structures would significantly set back therapeutic development** ✗ **Overstated** - While the retractions were embarrassing and temporarily disruptive to specific research programs, drug development targeting transporters continued, often using functional assays rather than pure structure-based design.

• **Concern about overreliance on computational methods** ✓ **Relevant but not catastrophic** - The structural biology field developed more rigorous validation standards, and computational methods continued to advance with better error-checking and validation protocols.

• **Implicit skepticism about molecular modeling and docking programs** - **Mixed outcome** - While the incident highlighted the importance of experimental validation, computational methods in drug discovery have advanced enormously since 2007, with modern AI/ML approaches achieving significant successes in structure prediction (like AlphaFold) and drug design.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important integrity issue in structural biology and raises valid concerns about validation, but primarily represents a specific methodological caution rather than having broad long-term impact beyond the immediate community.
