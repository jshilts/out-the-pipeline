# The Chemistry Book Is Available (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
Derek Lowe announced the upcoming release of his first book, "The Chemistry Book," scheduled for February 2016 and available for pre-order on Amazon. The book is part of a series that includes similar titles like "The Physics Book" by Clifford Pickover, featuring 250 short essays on significant events, concepts, and discoveries in chemistry from prehistory to the present, each accompanied by a full-page illustration. Lowe mentioned that he selected the topics himself, incorporating some reader suggestions from his blog, and acknowledged that the book could easily have contained 250 more entries given the breadth of the field.

## 2. HISTORY
"The Chemistry Book" was successfully published in 2016 by Sterling Publishing as part of the "Sterling Milestones" series. The book received generally positive reviews and was well-received by both general readers and those with scientific backgrounds seeking accessible chemistry content. It followed the established format of the series with bite-sized, illustrated entries covering chemistry's history and key developments.

Following the book's publication, Lowe continued his successful career as a pharmaceutical researcher and prolific science writer, maintaining his influential "In the Pipeline" blog, which has become one of the most widely-read chemistry and drug discovery blogs. He later went on to publish additional books, including "The Drug Book" in 2018.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No significant predictions about future scientific or technological developments were made in this announcement post.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2/9**

This is a personal announcement about a book publication rather than an analytical article about biotechnology developments, making it primarily of interest to those following the author's work rather than having broader scientific significance.
