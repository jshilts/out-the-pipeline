# Scrape Off Some Attitude (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a commentary on professional elitism and bad behavior in academic chemistry conferences. The author recounts a story about a graduate student presenting a poster at an ACS conference who treated another attendee with dismissive contempt after learning about the attendee's institution. According to the account, the graduate student literally walked away mid-conversation upon hearing where the questioner was from.

The article's thesis is that such elitist attitudes rooted in academic pedigree—where people from "Big Name U" institutions look down on others—are not only unprofessional but ultimately counterproductive in real-world careers. The author argues that while pedigree might provide initial advantages like getting interviews, sustained success ultimately depends on actual performance and productivity, not institutional snobbery. The piece serves as a critique of hierarchical thinking in science and emphasizes that intelligent questions should be the only credential that matters in academic discourse.

## 2. HISTORY

This article appeared on Derek Lowe's influential blog "In the Pipeline," which has been running since roughly 2002 and became one of the most widely-read chemistry and pharmaceutical industry blogs. The blog itself continued publishing continuously through 2024 and remains active, accumulating significant influence in both academic and industry chemistry circles.

The specific incident described appears to be an isolated anecdote rather than a documented trend. There's no evidence this particular graduate student was ever identified or that the incident had any broader career consequences beyond serving as an example in this widely-read blog post.

More generally, discussions about elitism in STEM fields have continued over the subsequent years, with increasing attention to issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, this specific 2007 incident does not appear to have catalyzed any broader movements or policy changes, nor does it seem to have led to specific reforms in conference codes of conduct (though such codes have become more common in later years for other reasons).

The author's broader message about pedigree versus performance appears prescient in light of subsequent developments showing that success in drug discovery increasingly depends on interdisciplinary collaboration and that companies value demonstrated skills over academic prestige alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions and assertions about how the real world works:

• **"A degree from Big Name U is only partially going to offset [an obnoxious attitude]"** - This prediction appears to have been borne out. In the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, while prestigious academic backgrounds can provide initial advantages, sustained career success typically depends on productivity, collaboration skills, and results. Extremely difficult personalities often struggle regardless of pedigree.

• **"The wonderfulness of a marquee school background eventually goes stale"** and **"once you're through the door you generally have to produce something"** - This accurately predicted that pharmaceutical and biotech companies are primarily results-driven. While academic networks remain important for hiring, ultimate success depends on scientific contributions, drug development progress, and successful clinical outcomes rather than institutional prestige alone.

• **Implicit prediction: Professional behavior matters in science** - The article predicted that lack of basic professionalism would be career-limiting. This aligns with the broader evolution of scientific culture toward emphasizing collaborative skills alongside technical competence, particularly as drug discovery becomes more interdisciplinary.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a brief blog commentary about professional etiquette at academic conferences rather than a substantive piece about biotechnology developments. While the blog itself ("In the Pipeline") became influential in drug discovery circles, this particular article represents routine commentary on social dynamics rather than scientific or industry analysis. It has minimal long-term importance to biotechnology as a field.
