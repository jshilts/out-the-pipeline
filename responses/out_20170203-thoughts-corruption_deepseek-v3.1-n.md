# Thoughts on Corruption (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article provides a framework for understanding corruption by categorizing it into three levels of increasing severity. **Level One corruption** involves paying someone to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do—essentially getting favors or preferential treatment outside normal procedures, which the author characterizes as nearly universal human nature. **Level Two corruption** occurs when you must pay someone to do what they're already supposed to be doing, creating deadweight economic losses as basic functions require bribes just to operate normally. **Level Three corruption** represents the most destructive form: paying officials not to harm you, where government becomes a protection racket and the rule of law breaks down entirely.

The author contextualizes this by discussing the uncertain early days of the Trump administration's relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, the speculation around FDA commissioner appointments, and the general lack of policy clarity. The framework is presented as a tool to understand what might unfold over the next four years in business-government relations, with the rule of law identified as the ultimate antidote to sliding toward increasingly damaging forms of corruption.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at what happened after February 2017, several relevant developments occurred in pharmaceutical regulation and business-government relations:

**FDA Leadership and Policy**: Scott Gottlieb was confirmed as FDA Commissioner in May 2017. His tenure (2017-2019) was marked by efforts to speed drug approvals and increase generic competition, though these were largely continuations of existing FDA directions rather than radical departures. During the Trump years, the FDA maintained its scientific standards and regulatory processes despite political pressures. The accelerated COVID-19 vaccine approvals in 2020 under Stephen Hahn occurred under emergency conditions and followed established pathways like Emergency Use Authorization.

**Pharmaceutical Industry Outcomes**: The pharmaceutical industry experienced both continuity and change. Drug approval rates remained high, pricing pressures intensified with growing political attention to costs, and the industry faced scrutiny over opioid crisis culpability. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 eventually included drug price negotiation provisions, representing significant policy change, but this came later and through legislative rather than administrative corruption channels.

**Business-Government Relations**: The Trump administration's deregulatory agenda proceeded through formal rulemaking processes rather than arbitrary enforcement, though controversial appointments and ethical questions did arise. The rule of law framework the author describes as the antidote largely held in pharmaceutical regulation, with courts overturning some attempts to bypass normal procedures and established regulatory pathways continuing to function.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made general predictions implicitly rather than explicit forecasts:

• **Implicit prediction of potential regulatory corruption**: The author suggested watching for whether the new administration would slide toward Level Two or Three corruption in pharmaceutical regulation. **Reality**: While there were concerns about political interference (particularly around hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 treatments), the FDA largely maintained its regulatory integrity and scientific standards throughout the 2017-2021 period.

• **Implicit prediction about rule of law stability**: The framework suggested that business-government relations could deteriorate toward protection-racket dynamics. **Reality**: Despite political turbulence and some appointments that raised ethical concerns, the basic rule of law in pharmaceutical regulation proved resilient, with established procedures and judicial review continuing to constrain arbitrary actions.

• **Implicit concern about policy coherence**: The author noted the lack of discipline and cohesion in the new administration. **Reality**: The Trump administration did implement deregulatory policies and made controversial appointments, but pharmaceutical regulation maintained substantial continuity with previous administrations rather than fundamental breakdowns in governance.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides an enduring analytical framework for understanding corruption that remains relevant beyond the immediate political moment it addressed, making it more broadly applicable than typical political commentary while still being tied to transitory concerns about a specific new administration.
