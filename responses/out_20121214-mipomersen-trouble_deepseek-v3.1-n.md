# Mipomersen In Trouble (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Kynamro (mipomersen), an antisense oligonucleotide drug developed by Isis (now Ionis Pharmaceuticals) in partnership with Genzyme (now Sanofi) for treating familial hypercholesterolaemia by lowering LDL cholesterol levels. The piece focuses on the European Medicines Agency's rejection of the drug due to unacceptable risk/benefit ratio. While efficacy in reducing LDL was not questioned, significant safety concerns emerged, including liver toxicity leading to patient discontinuation and, more troublingly, increased cardiovascular events in treatment groups - the very outcome the drug was supposed to prevent. The author contextualizes this within lipid therapy development challenges, noting that statins remain unusual in their favorable safety and efficacy profile among cholesterol-lowering drugs.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the December 2012 European rejection, mipomersen (Kynamro) did receive FDA approval in the United States in January 2013 for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a rare genetic disorder affecting approximately 300 patients in the US. However, the drug's commercial trajectory was limited and problematic. Despite approval, Kynamro faced significant uptake challenges due to its safety profile and competition from newer therapies.

The drug's market performance remained niche and disappointing. In 2016, Kastle Therapeutics acquired North American rights to Kynamro, and by 2019, Kastle discontinued the drug's US marketing citing "business reasons" rather than pulling it for safety - essentially a commercial failure. The antisense approach itself faced continued validation challenges in the lipid space, though other mechanisms like PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab) launched in 2015 achieved better safety and efficacy profiles, capturing much of the addressable market for refractory high cholesterol.

The broader field of lipid-altering therapies continued evolving, with multiple drug classes reaching market success, validating the article's characterization of statins as outliers in their positive risk/benefit ratio. Mipomersen remained a cautionary case about efficacy demonstrating LDL reduction without necessarily translating to cardiovascular benefit or acceptable safety.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article is primarily analytical rather than predictive, focusing on current events (the EMA rejection) and general observations about lipid therapy development challenges. The closest to predictive content is the implication that non-statin lipid therapies would continue facing development hurdles, which was borne out by subsequent FDA approvals requiring cardiovascular outcomes data for lipid drugs and competitive dynamics favoring PCSK9 inhibitors over antisense approaches for cholesterol management.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

The article demonstrates solid analytical insight into drug development challenges and regulatory risk assessment, though its narrow focus on a single drug approval decision limits broader impact. The case proved representative of biotech's regulatory and commercial hurdles, but lacked the transformative importance of major therapeutic breakthroughs or policy shifts.
