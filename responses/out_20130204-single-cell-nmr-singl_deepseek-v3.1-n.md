# Single-Cell NMR? How About Single-Protein NMR? (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes breakthrough research from two teams publishing in *Science* showcasing a novel NMR technique using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond crystals. Unlike conventional NMR that faces signal-to-noise limitations at small scales, this method leverages single-atom magnetometers created when nitrogen atoms replace carbon atoms just beneath the diamond surface, creating negatively charged centers with useful spin states for detecting magnetic fields.

The technique demonstrated the ability to detect NMR signals in volumes as small as a few cubic nanometers at room temperature—comparable to the size of individual large proteins (a 50 kD protein has a volume of approximately 58 cubic nanometers). Researchers projected that sensitivity could eventually approach single-proton detection, potentially enabling MRI imaging of individual proteins and detailed intracellular imaging, including detecting ligand binding events on single protein molecules or tracking fluorinated drug candidates within cells.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following the 2013 publications, the NV center diamond NMR technique evolved significantly, though not exactly along the timeline or trajectory initially envisioned:

**Technical Progress:**
- The quantum sensing field using NV centers expanded rapidly, leading to demonstrations of nanoscale NMR and magnetic resonance imaging with steadily improving sensitivity
- By the late 2010s, researchers achieved detection of individual nuclear spins and small spin ensembles at room temperature
- The technique proved particularly valuable for studying solid-state systems, thin films, and material science applications rather than the biological imaging originally envisioned

**Biological Applications:**
- Imaging individual proteins via NV-NMR has remained challenging and has not become routine practice
- The technique found more success in studying electron spins and paramagnetic centers in biological systems
- Researchers successfully applied NV-based quantum sensors to detect single molecules in some contexts, but widespread protein-level NMR imaging did not materialize as predicted

**Industrial/Clinical Impact:**
- **No FDA-approved drugs emerged specifically from this technique** in the following decade
- The technology did not lead to widely adopted drug discovery methods or clinical diagnostics
- Academic research continued, but commercial applications remained limited compared to traditional NMR and other imaging modalities
- The method did not replace existing NMR infrastructure in pharmaceutical companies

**Research Ecosystem:**
- The papers spurred continued research into quantum sensing and NV centers in diamond
- Related techniques like magnetic resonance force microscopy also continued to develop
- The fundamental physics advanced significantly, but practical biological applications developed more slowly than anticipated

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"MRI imaging of individual proteins"** - This has been partially achieved in specialized research settings, but not as routine, widely-available technology. Some research groups have demonstrated single-molecule detection, but not full three-dimensional protein imaging at the scale envisioned.

- **"Detailed intracellular level" imaging** - While intracellular NMR remains challenging, quantum sensing with NV centers has enabled some nanoscale magnetic imaging within cells, though not at the level of routine detailed structural biology originally hoped for.

- **"Detecting a ligand binding event by NMR on an individual protein molecule"** - This specific capability has been demonstrated in certain experimental systems, particularly for studying protein-drug interactions at the single-molecule level in specialized laboratories.

- **"Following the distribution of a fluorinated drug candidate inside a single cell"** - Tracking individual drug molecules using this technique proved more difficult than anticipated, though related quantum sensing methods have been used to study small molecules in cells.

- **"Sensitivity may eventually approach the level of single protons"** - This has been achieved, though not initially in the biological contexts originally envisioned; single-proton detection was demonstrated in subsequent years in controlled experimental systems.

- **Projected "much smaller detection volumes" using NVs closer to the diamond surface** - This technical improvement did occur, with researchers achieving better surface control and smaller detection volumes, though practical biological applications remained challenging.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses genuinely transformative technology that did advance the field, and the excitement was justified in terms of fundamental physics breakthroughs. However, the anticipated biological applications developed much more slowly than predicted, preventing a higher score.
