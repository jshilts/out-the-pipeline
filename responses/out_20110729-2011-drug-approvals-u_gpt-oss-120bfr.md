# 2011 Drug Approvals Are Up: We Rule, Right? (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Wall Street Journal piece highlighted that the first half of 2011 saw an unusually high number of FDA new‑drug approvals, prompting the author to suggest that the pharmaceutical industry might finally be “turning a corner” after years of declining productivity.  The article contrasted this uptick with the pessimistic views of several industry observers (Bruce Booth, former Pfizer R&D chief John LaMattina, and Forbes columnist Matthew Herper), who argued that the newly approved medicines were largely the result of research begun in the 1990s.  In other words, any apparent renaissance could not be credited to recent changes in R&D practice or regulatory policy; it would take several more years before any genuine impact of newer approaches could be measured.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 approval trends** – The FDA’s “new molecular entity” (NME) approvals remained relatively high for the next decade, hovering between 27 and 59 per year.  After the 39 NMEs approved in 2011, the agency issued 39 again in 2012, 27 in 2013 (a dip), then climbed to 41 in 2014 and 45 in 2015.  A notable surge occurred in 2018 (59 NMEs), driven largely by oncology biologics and gene‑therapy products.  The overall average for 2011‑2023 is roughly 40 NMEs per year, which is higher than the early‑2000s average (~30) but not a steady upward trajectory.

**Regulatory reforms** – Several policy changes that began after 2011 helped sustain the higher approval rates: the 2012 FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) expanded expedited pathways; the 2016 21st Century Cures Act further broadened “breakthrough therapy” designations; and the FDA’s increased use of rolling reviews and real‑world evidence accelerated many submissions.  These mechanisms, however, mainly affected the speed of review rather than the underlying discovery productivity.

**Impact of the 2011 cohort** – Some of the drugs approved in 2011 have become clinically important and commercially successful.  Crizotinib (Xalkori) for ALK‑positive non‑small‑cell lung cancer and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for melanoma opened new therapeutic classes (targeted kinase inhibition and checkpoint immunotherapy, respectively) and paved the way for later blockbuster agents (e.g., pembrolizumab, alectinib).  Nevertheless, the majority of the 2011 NMEs were modest‑size molecules with limited market impact, and many have since faced generic competition or have been superseded by newer agents.

**R&D efficiency** – Despite the relatively stable approval count, the cost per approved NME continued to rise sharply.  Industry analyses (e.g., Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development) estimate that the average out‑of‑pocket R&D expense per NME exceeded $2.5 billion by the mid‑2020s, far higher than the “turnaround” implied by the 2011 headline numbers.  Failure rates in Phase II/III remained high, and the proportion of approvals that were biologics or cell‑based therapies grew from ~15 % in 2011 to >40 % by 2022, reflecting a shift in the nature of the pipeline rather than a simple productivity gain.

**Business outcomes** – Companies that secured 2011 approvals experienced mixed fortunes.  Large‑cap firms (e.g., Pfizer, Merck) continued to dominate revenue streams, while many mid‑size biotech firms that launched a single 2011 product either were acquired (e.g., Genentech’s acquisition of a small oncology biotech) or struggled to sustain pipelines.  The broader industry consolidation trend accelerated, with M&A activity reaching record levels in 2015‑2019, partly to acquire promising late‑stage assets rather than to capitalize on a sudden surge in early‑stage innovation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
*The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but the implied prediction was that the high 2011 approval count signaled a durable reversal of the “productivity slump.”*  

- **Prediction:** Recent R&D practices (post‑1990s) would quickly translate into a higher, sustained rate of new drug approvals.  
  **Outcome:** Approval numbers stayed above the early‑2000s baseline but fluctuated year‑to‑year; no clear upward trend directly attributable to newer R&D methods is evident. The rise in approvals is better linked to regulatory acceleration and the growth of biologics than to a wholesale improvement in discovery efficiency.  

- **Prediction:** The drugs approved in early 2011 would become major, long‑lasting revenue drivers.  
  **Outcome:** A few (e.g., crizotinib, ipilimumab) achieved blockbuster status and influenced subsequent drug classes, but most 2011 NMEs generated modest sales and were later eclipsed by newer agents.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** The industry’s “turnaround” would be reflected in faster pipeline progression and lower development costs.  
  **Outcome:** Development timelines have modestly shortened for drugs using expedited pathways, yet average R&D spending per NME has continued to climb, and the “valley of death” in Phase II remains a major bottleneck.  

Overall, the article’s optimism was premature; the data since 2011 show a more nuanced picture—higher approvals sustained by policy and biologic growth, but no decisive evidence that recent R&D changes alone have solved the productivity problem.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a useful snapshot of a pivotal moment in pharma discourse and prompts a lasting debate about how to interpret approval metrics, but its arguments are relatively narrow and its predictions have only partially borne out.
