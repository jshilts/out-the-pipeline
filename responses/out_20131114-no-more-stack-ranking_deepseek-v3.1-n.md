# No More Stack Ranking at Microsoft (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Microsoft's decision to abandon its controversial "stack ranking" performance review system in November 2013. Under stack ranking, managers were required to designate a predetermined percentage of team members as underperformers, regardless of the team's overall performance. The system was widely criticized for encouraging internal politicking, information withholding, and back-stabbing rather than fostering innovation and cooperation. 

Microsoft's head of human resources, Lisa Brummel, announced that the new system would feature "no more curve" and "no more ratings," giving managers flexibility to allocate rewards based on actual performance rather than forced distributions. The article notes that stack ranking had been blamed for Microsoft falling behind competitors in areas like mobile computing over the previous decade, and expresses hope that this change might start a trend away from such "rank-and-yank" systems.

## 2. HISTORY

Microsoft's elimination of stack ranking in 2013 marked a significant shift in the company's culture and performance management approach. The change came under CEO Steve Ballmer's leadership, just before Satya Nadella took over as CEO in February 2014. Nadella continued and accelerated the cultural transformation away from the competitive, zero-sum mindset that stack ranking had fostered.

The company's cultural shift away from stack ranking correlated with a period of renewed innovation and growth. In the years following 2013, Microsoft successfully transformed its business model toward cloud computing (Azure), subscription services (Office 365), and artificial intelligence partnerships. The company's market capitalization grew substantially, from approximately \$300 billion in 2013 to over \$2 trillion by the early 2020s, and employee satisfaction metrics improved.

The move also influenced broader industry practices. While stack ranking had been used by other major tech companies including GE (where it originated as "rank and yank"), Amazon, Yahoo, and others, Microsoft's public abandonment of the practice contributed to a wider industry trend away from forced-curve performance systems. By the late 2010s, many companies had shifted toward more continuous, qualitative feedback approaches rather than forced quantitative rankings.

However, the transition wasn't instantaneous. Microsoft spent several years refining its performance management system, moving through multiple iterations before arriving at its current approach. The company also continued to face challenges related to workplace culture and diversity in the years following the change, indicating that eliminating stack ranking alone didn't solve all organizational issues.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **Microsoft might "start a trend here"**: This prediction largely came true. Microsoft's highly publicized move away from stack ranking did contribute to broader industry trends toward more humane performance management systems, with many tech companies adopting similar changes in subsequent years.

- **The change could address Microsoft's innovation challenges**: This appears to have been validated. Microsoft experienced significant innovation success in cloud computing, AI, and enterprise software following the cultural shift, though multiple factors beyond just performance management contributed to this.

- **"Whatever system they're trying out could hardly be more demoralizing than what it's replacing"**: This was validated by subsequent reports of improved employee morale and Microsoft's rise in workplace satisfaction rankings, though some employees reported that the new systems still had their own challenges.

- **Implicit that the old system was responsible for Microsoft falling behind competitors**: This connection is difficult to prove definitively, though the elimination of stack ranking did coincide with a period of Microsoft's renewed competitiveness and innovation leadership.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6**

This article captures an important moment in organizational management history and Microsoft's cultural transformation. The elimination of stack ranking represented a significant acknowledgment that forced ranking systems can damage innovation and collaboration, with practical implications for how large technology companies approach performance management and cultural development.
