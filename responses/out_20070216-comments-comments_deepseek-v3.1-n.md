# Comments on Comments (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post addresses technical issues with the blog's commenting system that occurred in February 2007. The author, Derek Lowe, explains that legitimate comments were being incorrectly flagged as spam by automated filters. He provides context about the massive volume of comment spam he receives daily (200-300 spam emails plus a similar volume of comment spam), describing typical spam content including lottery scams, "African fortunes," and other fraudulent schemes. The post aims to reassure readers that the commenting problems were being resolved while giving insight into the challenges of blog spam management in the mid-2000s era of internet publishing.

## 2. HISTORY

This article appeared on Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which became one of the most influential chemistry and drug discovery blogs in the scientific community. At the time of this post, blog commenting systems across the web were experiencing growing pains as spam became more sophisticated and automated filtering became necessary.

Subsequent developments in online commenting reflect the broader evolution of scientific discourse online. Over the following years, **major scientific journals and publishing platforms increasingly moved toward moderated commenting systems**, with many implementing registration requirements and editorial oversight. The balance between open discussion and spam prevention remained an ongoing challenge.

Interestingly, **the broader trajectory moved away from blog-style commenting altogether** in many scientific contexts. Major platforms shifted toward more structured discussion formats, while social media platforms (Twitter launched in 2006, the year before this post) began to absorb much of the real-time scientific discussion that blogs previously hosted. By the 2010s, platforms like PubMed Commons attempted institutional comment systems, though these never achieved widespread adoption and were eventually discontinued.

The core problem Lowe describes - balancing open participation against spam and low-quality contributions - **remained largely unsolved across the next decade**, with many scientific platforms ultimately choosing to restrict or eliminate commenting rather than solve the moderation problem at scale.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in biotechnology, drug discovery, or scientific publishing. It was purely a technical/administrative post about blog maintenance. The post makes no scientific or industrial forecasts that can be evaluated against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This is a routine administrative blog post about comment spam management with no scientific content, making it virtually irrelevant to biotechnology industry analysis or scientific developments. While it provides a snapshot of 2007 blogging infrastructure challenges, it lacks substantive content for the purpose of analyzing biotechnology industry commentary.
