# Caring About Yields? (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 blog post reflects on the role and importance of chemical reaction yields in different contexts within pharmaceutical drug discovery. The author, Derek Lowe, contrasts the attitudes toward yields across three stages: early-stage medicinal chemistry, academic total synthesis, and process chemistry.

In early-stage medicinal chemistry—where the author works—the focus is on speed and purity rather than yield. The philosophy is "enough versus not enough": if you can obtain sufficient material to make analogs and run biological testing, the yield is adequate. A clean, easy-to-purify low-yield reaction may be preferable to a higher-yield reaction requiring extensive chromatography. This contrasts sharply with academic total synthesis (graduate work), where multi-step sequences make cumulative yields critical—a 50% yield late in a 27-step synthesis effectively wastes months of effort. Process chemistry would also prioritize yields for scalability and cost. The author acknowledges that most early compounds fail anyway, so speed of synthesis and testing outweighs optimizing yields.

## 2. HISTORY

The perspectives outlined in this 2012 article remain highly relevant and largely unchanged in pharmaceutical R&D practice through the subsequent decade.

The tension between early-stage speed and late-stage efficiency continues to define medicinal chemistry workflows. High-throughput synthesis and parallel chemistry approaches developed throughout the 2010s-2020s have, if anything, reinforced the "enough vs. not enough" mentality for early discovery. The emergence of DNA-encoded libraries (DEL), fragment-based drug discovery, and automated synthesis platforms prioritizes rapid generation of structure-activity relationship data over individual reaction optimization.

Process chemistry has evolved with increased emphasis on green chemistry principles, continuous flow systems, and biocatalysis, making yield optimization even more critical for environmental and economic reasons. However, these concerns remain downstream considerations.

Notably, the rise of academic chemical biology and drug discovery centers has bridged some gaps between academic synthesis and industrial practice, with greater appreciation for practical considerations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry developments, focusing instead on describing existing practices and philosophies regarding synthetic chemistry yields across different contexts. It was observational rather than predictive in nature.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3**

While the article provides valuable insight into practical medicinal chemistry decision-making, it addresses a niche operational topic rather than fundamental scientific advances or industry trends that would rank in higher percentiles of long-term importance.
