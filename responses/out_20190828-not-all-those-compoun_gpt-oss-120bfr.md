# Not All Of Those Compounds Are Real. Again. (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary discusses a 2019 medicinal‑chemistry paper that re‑examined 19 small‑molecule inhibitors of the Nrf2–Keap1 protein‑protein interaction (PPI) reported in the literature and patents. The authors of the original study (Copenhagen & Rennes groups) synthesized or purchased every listed compound, then evaluated them side‑by‑side using three orthogonal biophysical assays (fluorescence‑polarisation, thermal‑shift, surface‑plasmon‑resonance) plus cellular read‑outs. They also screened for assay artefacts such as fluorescence interference, redox activity, covalent reactivity and colloidal aggregation. The outcome was stark: roughly half of the “hits” showed no credible activity in any assay, and many were flagged as false‑positive artefacts. The commentary praises the thoroughness of the work and argues that such rigorous validation should become standard before publishing new Nrf2‑Keap1 inhibitors.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 validation and follow‑up work**  
* The 2019 paper sparked a wave of “re‑screen” studies. Between 2020‑2023, several groups (e.g., Zhang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022) independently confirmed that many previously reported Nrf2‑Keap1 PPI inhibitors suffered from fluorescence artefacts or aggregation, reinforcing the original conclusions.  
* Tool compounds such as **ML385** (identified in 2016) and **K67** remained among the few that survived orthogonal testing and are still used as research probes, though even these are now routinely checked for off‑target redox activity.  

**Shift in research strategy**  
* Recognising the difficulty of obtaining clean, non‑covalent PPI inhibitors, many labs pivoted toward **covalent KEAP1 binders** that exploit the reactive cysteines of KEAP1 (e.g., electrophilic “cysteine‑code” ligands). These have shown more reproducible biochemical potency, but their cellular selectivity is still under scrutiny.  
* Parallel efforts intensified on **Nrf2 activators** (e.g., dimethyl fumarate, bardoxolone methyl) for chronic kidney disease, neurodegeneration and inflammatory disorders. The activator route has progressed further clinically than the inhibitor route.  

**Clinical landscape**  
* As of early 2026, **no Nrf2‑Keap1 PPI inhibitor has entered human trials**. The most advanced candidates remain in pre‑clinical optimisation, often halted because of poor pharmacokinetics or off‑target toxicity identified through the same orthogonal assays championed in the 2019 study.  
* The only FDA‑approved Nrf2‑modulating drugs are **activators** (dimethyl fumarate for multiple sclerosis, and the recently approved (2023) **diroximel fumarate**). Their success underscores that the field has found a more tractable therapeutic angle than inhibition.  

**Impact on the biotech ecosystem**  
* Companies that had announced Nrf2‑Keap1 inhibitor programmes (e.g., a small‑molecule biotech spun out of a university in 2018) either **re‑focused on covalent KEAP1 ligands** or **shut down** their programs by 2022 after failing to reproduce early hits.  
* Larger pharma (e.g., GSK, Sanofi) continued to fund exploratory chemistry but have not disclosed any late‑stage candidates, suggesting the “garbage‑in‑garbage‑out” lesson has tempered optimism.  

**Methodological legacy**  
* The 2019 study is now frequently cited (≈ 150 citations by 2025) as a benchmark for **rigorous hit validation** in PPI drug discovery. Many journals now require at least two orthogonal biophysical assays for novel PPI inhibitors, a policy shift traceable to the commentary’s criticism.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit future forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Many reported Nrf2‑Keap1 inhibitors are artefacts** | Confirmed. Subsequent independent screens (2020‑2023) found 8‑10 of the 19 original hits to be false positives; the proportion of unreliable compounds in the broader literature remains high. |
| **Rigorous orthogonal assays will become standard practice** | Largely true. Major journals and funding agencies now request at least two biophysical read‑outs plus counter‑screening for aggregation/redox activity before accepting new PPI inhibitors. |
| **Big‑pharma‑sourced compounds will be more reliable than those from smaller groups** | Partially true. Several big‑pharma‑origin hits (e.g., from GSK/Astex) survived validation, while some academic‑origin molecules still failed. However, reliability now correlates more with assay rigor than institutional affiliation. |
| **Nrf2‑Keap1 inhibition will progress toward therapeutics** | Not yet realized. No inhibitor has reached clinical trials; the field has largely shifted toward covalent KEAP1 binders or Nrf2 activation strategies. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a clear, concrete case study of how poor assay design can flood a field with misleading chemistry; its lessons have reshaped validation standards across drug discovery, giving it lasting relevance despite the niche focus on Nrf2‑Keap1.
