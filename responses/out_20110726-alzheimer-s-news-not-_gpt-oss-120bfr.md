# Alzheimer’s: The News Is Not Getting Better (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary highlighted a puzzling safety signal that had emerged across several Alzheimer’s disease (AD) clinical programs: vasogenic edema (later termed “amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities‑E” or ARIA‑E). The phenomenon had first been noted with the anti‑amyloid antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab, and the author wondered why a completely different class—a γ‑secretase inhibitor (BMS‑708163, “avagacestat”)—was also showing the same side‑effect. The piece also reminded readers of the spectacular failure of Eli Lilly’s γ‑secretase inhibitor semagacestat, which not only failed to improve cognition but actually accelerated decline. The author concluded that the field faced a “big, important, unanswerable question” about whether the BMS compound could succeed, given the shared safety concerns and the broader uncertainty surrounding the amyloid hypothesis.

## 2. HISTORY  

**γ‑Secretase inhibitors**  
* **Avagacestat (BMS‑708163)** – After the 2011 safety signal, BMS continued a Phase II trial but halted development in 2013 when interim analyses showed no cognitive benefit and a high incidence of ARIA‑E and other adverse events. The program was formally discontinued.  
* **Semagacestat** – Completed a Phase III trial in 2010; the study was stopped early because treated patients declined faster than placebo. Development was terminated in 2011.  

**Anti‑amyloid antibodies**  
* **Bapineuzumab** – Phase III trials (2010‑2012) failed to meet primary endpoints; development stopped in 2013.  
* **Solanezumab** – Two large Phase III trials (EXPEDITION 1 & 2) in mild‑to‑moderate AD showed no significant benefit (2015). A subsequent trial in very mild AD (EXPEDITION‑3) also failed (2017). Development was halted for commercial use, though the antibody remains a research tool.  

* **Aducanumab (Biogen)** – Received FDA accelerated approval in June 2021 based on a surrogate biomarker (amyloid reduction) despite mixed clinical data. The approval sparked controversy, and the drug’s commercial uptake has been limited by payer restrictions and safety monitoring requirements for ARIA.  

* **Lecanemab (Eisai/Biogen)** – In the Phase III CLARITY‑AD trial (2022) the antibody slowed cognitive decline by ~27 % over 18 months. The FDA granted traditional approval in July 2023, and the drug has entered the market with a risk‑management plan for ARIA.  

* **Donanemab (Eli Lilly)** – The TRAILBLAZER‑ALZ 2 Phase III trial (2024) demonstrated a ~27 % slowing of decline in early AD, leading to FDA approval in late 2024. Post‑marketing data continue to monitor ARIA incidence.  

**Safety signal (ARIA)** – The edema observed in the 2011 article was later recognized as a class effect of amyloid‑targeting antibodies. Systematic monitoring with MRI has become standard in trials and in clinical use, allowing dose adjustments that mitigate severe cases.  

**Shift away from γ‑secretase and BACE inhibition** – Following repeated failures (including verubecestat, atabecestat, and umibecestat), the industry largely abandoned secretase inhibition as a viable strategy by 2018.  

**Policy and market impact** – The FDA’s accelerated‑approval pathway for aducanumab set a precedent that was applied to lecanemab and donanemab, prompting new guidance on biomarker‑based approvals. Payers have been cautious, often requiring evidence of clinical benefit beyond amyloid reduction.  

**Overall trajectory** – While the 2011 article’s gloom was justified for secretase inhibitors, the subsequent decade saw the emergence of approved anti‑amyloid antibodies, albeit with modest efficacy and continued safety monitoring. The amyloid hypothesis remains central but is now complemented by research into tau, neuroinflammation, and metabolic pathways.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *Avagacestat (γ‑secretase inhibitor) would likely fail in later trials because of safety/efficacy issues.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The program was stopped in 2013 after Phase II data showed no benefit and significant ARIA‑E.  

- **Prediction:** *γ‑secretase inhibition as a therapeutic class may be problematic.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. Both semagacestat and avagacestat failed; later BACE inhibitors also failed, leading the field to abandon secretase inhibition by the mid‑2010s.  

- **Prediction:** *The edema side‑effect seen with antibodies might also appear with non‑immune mechanisms (e.g., avagacestat).*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. While avagacestat did show ARIA‑E, the underlying mechanism is now thought to involve rapid amyloid clearance rather than immune activation, suggesting the side‑effect is linked to amyloid removal regardless of therapeutic class.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *If the amyloid hypothesis were wrong, the whole pipeline would stall.*  
  **Outcome:** Mixed. The hypothesis remains influential; several anti‑amyloid antibodies have achieved regulatory approval, but their modest clinical impact has spurred parallel investment in non‑amyloid approaches (tau antibodies, neuroinflammation modulators, gene therapies).  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
*The article captures a pivotal moment when safety concerns first crossed therapeutic classes, foreshadowing the later regulatory and clinical landscape of amyloid‑targeting drugs.*
