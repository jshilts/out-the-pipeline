# I will do such things - What they are yet I know not. . . (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes Aventis' defensive tactics against Sanofi's hostile takeover bid in early 2004. At the time, Aventis Chief Operating Officer Richard Markham and Igor Landau revealed that many of Aventis' products had "change of ownership clauses" in their joint venture and co-marketing contracts, which could allow partners to reclaim product rights if they disapproved of Sanofi. Simultaneously, Sanofi ran emotional advertising campaigns featuring sick children to pressure the merger. The author expressed skepticism about pharmaceutical mergers generally, noting that even successful mergers typically involved "terrible period of unfocused disruption" with research productivity losses. The market dynamics showed both companies' stocks moving in opposite directions, with investors betting Sanofi would need to improve its offer.

## 2. HISTORY

The Sanofi-Aventis merger did ultimately proceed in 2004, creating Sanofi-Aventis (later simply Sanofi). Despite the author's skepticism about big pharma mergers, this particular consolidation had significant long-term consequences. The combined entity became one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, though the integration process was indeed disruptive as predicted.

Key developments following the merger include major drug portfolio changes - while some legacy Aventis products faced challenges, the combined pipeline led to several important approvals. However, the merger also resulted in substantial restructuring, including research facility closures and workforce reductions that affected the "good people" the author worried would "hit the exits." Over the subsequent decade, Sanofi-Aventis maintained a mixed track record on research productivity, with some notable successes but also pipeline challenges that partially validated the author's concerns about scaling research organizations.

Public policy implications were limited - the merger received regulatory approval despite competitive concerns, reflecting broader consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical industry. Neither company's fundamental business model transformed dramatically through the merger, though Sanofi did gain significant scale in specific therapeutic areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Merger outcome prediction**: The author wrote "I have no useful predictions of whether this deal will go through" and "Even if Sanofi does succeed, it probably won't be on the terms they wanted." *Reality*: The merger did go through in 2004, though Sanofi did have to increase its offer from the initial bid, partially validating the prediction about terms.

• **Pharmaceutical merger effectiveness**: The author predicted that "pharmaceutical mergers have an unencouraging history" and that even successful ones involve "terrible period of unfocused disruption, during which many good ideas hit the wall and many good people hit the exits." *Reality*: The Sanofi-Aventis merger did involve significant disruption, restructuring, and research productivity challenges, making this prediction largely accurate about the integration process.

• **Research productivity scaling**: Predicted that research productivity doesn't scale linearly and that beyond a certain size, "it's more likely to fit an exponential curve - but in the wrong inflection." *Reality*: Post-merger Sanofi-Aventis faced ongoing challenges with R&D productivity, with fluctuating success rates and periodic pipeline gaps, suggesting the author's concerns about scaling research organizations had merit.

• **Market dynamics**: Noted that "someone else may well do the same" regarding competing offers. *Reality*: No competing bid emerged, though the market dynamics did force Sanofi to improve its terms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient skepticism about pharmaceutical merger rationales and research productivity scaling arguments, with many concerns validated by subsequent developments, even if the specific merger did proceed.
