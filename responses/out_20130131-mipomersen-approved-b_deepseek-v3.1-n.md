# Mipomersen Approved (Bonus Antisense Roundup Included) - January 2013

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the FDA approval of mipomersen (branded as Kynamro), developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, for treating homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The author notes this as the first pure antisense therapy approval since the initial wave of excitement about antisense technology in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The drug was approved with liver toxicity warnings, reflecting ongoing safety concerns, and had previously been rejected by the European Medicines Agency.

The article also surveys the broader antisense therapeutic landscape, examining several compounds in development: trabedersen (for pancreatic cancer), alicaforsen (for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), aganirsen (for eye vascular conditions), oblimersen (for CLL), and custirsen (in Phase III trials). The author concludes that antisense drug development faces similar challenges to conventional pharmaceuticals - mixed efficacy results and safety concerns - and notes that while orphan indications show promise, broader applications remain limited by the difficulty of identifying truly targeted therapies.

## 2. HISTORY
After the 2013 approval, mipomersen experienced significant commercial challenges. It remained available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) due to hepatotoxicity concerns. The drug never achieved broad market adoption, generating relatively small sales figures. By 2022, Genzyme (Sanofi's specialty care unit) discontinued mipomersen in the United States while maintaining availability in select international markets. The drug's limited patient population (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia affects approximately 1 in 300,000 people) combined with the liver toxicity issues constrained its commercial viability.

The broader antisense field evolved significantly after 2013. **Alicaforsen** failed in Crohn's disease but later showed more promise in ulcerative colitis; development continued but with limited success. **Custirsen** (OGX-011) failed in Phase III trials for prostate cancer around 2014-2016, leading Oncogenex to abandon development. **Oblimersen** never achieved significant clinical adoption, with its development largely discontinued in favor of newer targeted therapies. **Trabedersen** showed limited success against pancreatic cancer, with subsequent development remaining limited.

More broadly, antisense technology evolved toward improved delivery mechanisms and targeted indications. The field's most significant commercial success emerged with **Spinraza (nusinersen)**, approved by the FDA in December 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy, which became a major commercial success. Later advances included the approval of **Tegsedi (inotersen)** and **Waylivra (volanesorsen)** in the late 2010s, demonstrating continued but targeted progress in the antisense space.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article included several predictions and assessments about antisense therapy development:

- **Mipomersen would have limited market impact due to liver toxicity issues**: ✅ **Correct** - The drug never achieved significant market penetration and was eventually discontinued in the US market by 2022 due to both safety restrictions and limited patient population.

- **Antisense development faces similar challenges to conventional drug development**: ✅ **Correct** - Subsequent development showed mixed results with efficacy failures, safety concerns, and most candidates failing to reach approval or commercial success.

- **Custirsen Phase III trials would determine its future**: ✅ **Correct** - The drug failed in its Phase III prostate cancer trials around 2014-2016, effectively ending its development.

- **Spotlight indication claims that antisense would revolutionize drug development were overblown**: ✅ **Correct** - Rather than revolutionizing all drug development, antisense found niche success with orphan indications (like Spinraza for SMA) rather than broad-spectrum applications.

- **The antisense field would continue struggling to find good targets for major unmet medical needs**: ✅ **Correct** - Most success came in narrowly-defined orphan indications rather than major disease categories like cardiovascular disease or common cancers.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

The article successfully anticipated the commercial challenges faced by mipomersen and highlighted the persistent gap between antisense technology's theoretical promise and practical clinical limitations. It demonstrated prescient understanding of drug development realities in a field often characterized by hype cycles.
