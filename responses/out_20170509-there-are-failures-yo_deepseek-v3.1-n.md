# There Are Failures, You Know (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the failure of Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug solanezumab, an amyloid-targeting antibody that showed no efficacy despite years of clinical trials starting from mouse models in 2001 through final Phase III results in 2016. The author uses this case to argue that the FDA's rigorous approval standards worked correctly by preventing what would have been an estimated $10 billion expenditure on an expensive placebo.

The article responds to an NEJM paper arguing that the regulatory system functioned as intended. It addresses debates around the 21st Century Cures Act and proposals to approve drugs based solely on safety, letting the market determine efficacy. The author notes the immense pressure for Alzheimer's treatments but argues that controlled clinical trials remain essential because healthcare markets cannot effectively discover therapeutic utility, and early conditional approval would have wasted resources while giving patients false hope.

## 2. HISTORY

The amyloid hypothesis and BACE inhibitors continued to face major setbacks. Merck's verubecestat failed Phase III in 2017, Johnson & Johnson halted atabecestat development in 2018, and Eli Lilly's own BACE inhibitor lanabecestat was terminated in 2018. AstraZeneca axed its BACE program in 2019. In 2019, Biogen's aducanumab showed mixed results and was initially halted before the controversial 2021 FDA approval under accelerated approval based on biomarker data rather than clear clinical benefit.

The field's struggles deepened when Roche's gantenerumab failed two Phase III trials in 2022, and Eli Lilly's donanemab trials showed modest effects in 2023 but with significant safety concerns including brain swelling and bleeding. 

By 2024, the amyloid approach faced a crisis of confidence. While Biogen's lecanemab showed some clinical benefit in 2023, the effects were modest (27% slowing on cognitive scales) at enormous cost and concerning side effects. The hypothesis that removing amyloid plaques would meaningfully improve Alzheimer's symptoms increasingly appeared incomplete or wrong.

During this period, no amyloid-targeting therapy demonstrated transformative clinical benefit. The most successful showed only marginal slowing of decline at tremendous cost, far from the breakthrough patients needed. The failures validated the author's core concern: approving drugs on biomarkers rather than proven clinical benefit could saddle healthcare systems with expensive therapies of questionable value.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"People would line up to buy anything that got FDA approval, no matter how tenuous the evidence was"**: This proved accurate. When Biogen's aducanumab received controversial FDA approval in 2021 despite uncertain clinical benefit, Medicare and patients faced enormous costs. Subsequent analyses questioned whether benefits outweighed risks.

• **"We would have spent at least ten billion dollars injecting Alzheimer's patients with an expensive placebo"**: This projection underestimated actual outcomes. The amyloid pathway failures consumed tens of billions across multiple companies without producing effective treatments. The opportunity cost reflected Bastiat's broken window fallacy—resources directed at failed amyloid approaches could have funded alternative research.

• **"Alzheimer's disease might well turn into the next place in which we thrash out [regulatory] positions"**: Correct. The aducanumab approval in 2021 created a firestorm over FDA standards, accelerated approval pathways, and whether biomarker data justified approval without clear clinical benefit. This became a defining controversy in drug regulation.

• **Implicit prediction that amyloid drugs "would not work"**: The author expressed skepticism about amyloid approaches. The subsequent decade proved this correct—every major amyloid-targeting drug either failed or showed only marginal benefit, suggesting the amyloid hypothesis was incomplete or wrong.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience about Alzheimer's drug development challenges, regulatory policy debates, and the social costs of medical false hope—all central to the next decade of biopharmaceutical failures and controversies.
