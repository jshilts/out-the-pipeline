# Do Scientists Read Business Books? (Plus: Add a Circle to Dante's Inferno!)  
**February 2009**

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2009 blog post criticizes pop business books and management gurus, prompted by a *Wall Street Journal* CEO reading list. The author singles out Gary Hamel for cherry-picking "sexy" companies and peddling vague advice like "go non-linear" and "listen to the periphery," while noting that failed firms or jailed executives never dent the guru's credibility.

The author argues that this "post hoc reasoning" and weak evidence clash with scientific rigor. He proposes adding a Dante-style circle of Hell for "scientific and pharmaceutical sinners" and invites readers to nominate offenders.

## 2. HISTORY

- **"Who Moved My Cheese?"** remained a perennial bestseller; organizations continued using it for years, though by the late 2010s critics increasingly called it simplistic and demotivating.
- **Gary Hamel** persisted as a management consultant and author, shifting to themes like "humanocracy" and open innovation. His 2012 book *What Matters Now* and subsequent *Harvard Business Review* pieces maintained influence on leadership; his ideas on decentralization were later echoed in agile/DevOps movements.
- **Daniel Vasella (Novartis)** stepped down as CEO in 2010 and as chairman in 2013 amid scrutiny over compensation practices, unrelated to this article.
- The **skepticism toward business fads** proved prescient; by the mid-2010s, many criticized overhyped business books and frameworks (e.g., Lean Startup, Blue Ocean Strategy) as formulaic, and some once-"sexy" firms cited by gurus later stumbled or failed.
- The author's proposed **"Inferno for scientific/pharmaceutical sinners"** took on unintentional irony after repeated industry scandals, including data manipulation, off-label marketing settlements, and a growing reproducibility crisis in biomedical research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make any explicit predictions. It offered social commentary on the mismatch between scientific thinking and pop-business narratives, along with a tongue-in-cheek proposal for a Dante-style circle of Hell for industry "sinners."

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **3/10**

This is a light, opinion-driven blog post rather than substantive analysis. Its cultural commentary on business-book hype has aged reasonably, but it lacks technical depth or actionable insights relevant to biotechnology outcomes.
