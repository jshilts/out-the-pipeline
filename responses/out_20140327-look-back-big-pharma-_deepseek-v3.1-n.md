# A Look Back at Big Pharma Stocks (Mar 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article revisits big pharma stock performance across different time periods, updating a previous analysis from 2010 about "Big Pharma's Lost Decade." The analysis compares major drug companies (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, and others) against the S&P 500 index using four different timeframes: since 2010, ten-year period, since 2000, and since 1990.

Key findings include Bristol-Myers Squibb leading recent performance due to excitement around their oncology pipeline, while Johnson & Johnson shows consistent long-term performance across multiple time horizons. Pfizer demonstrated massive growth during the late 1990s, driving merger activity, but has seen mixed results depending on the timeframe. The author discusses pharma diversification strategies, citing J&J's medical device and consumer businesses as stabilizing factors, and references Bernard Munos's view that portfolio management has failed to protect against patent cliffs, suggesting that undiversification may be risky given the inability to adequately mitigate drug R&D risk. Pfizer is noted as currently experimenting with undiversification by shedding non-pharma assets.

## 2. HISTORY
Since March 2014, several significant developments occurred in the pharmaceutical industry:

**Business Restructuring & M&A**: Pfizer followed through on undiversification strategies, completing major acquisitions including Hospira (2015, $17B), Medivation (2016, $14B), and attempting the massive Allergan merger (2015-2016, cancelled due to tax inversion rule changes). They later acquired cancer drug maker Array BioPharma (2019, $11.4B) and completed the $43B acquisition of Seagen in 2023. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers Squibb made the landmark $74B acquisition of Celgene in 2019, significantly expanding their oncology and immunology portfolios.

**Drug Pipeline Outcomes**: Bristol-Myers Squibb's oncology excitement materialized, with immunotherapies like Opdivo (nivolumab) gaining multiple approvals across various cancer types, though facing stiff competition from Merck's Keytruda. J&J maintained steady performance, with drugs like Imbruvica (for blood cancers, partnered with Pharmacyclics/AbbVie) becoming major revenue drivers. Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine developed with BioNTech became one of the bestselling drugs in history during 2021-2022.

**Stock Performance (2014-2024)**: J&J continued its steady growth pattern, maintaining consistent dividends and performance. Bristol-Myers Squibb initially struggled post-2019 Celgene acquisition with debt concerns but recovered. Pfizer experienced volatility, with strong COVID vaccine-driven gains in 2021-2022 followed by declines as vaccine sales normalized. The broader pharma sector faced increasing pricing pressure, opioid litigation costs (particularly J&J and others), and growing focus on drug pricing reforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Pfizer's Undiversification Strategy**: The author noted Pfizer "is trying right now" to shed non-pharma assets and experiment with focusing on pure pharma. **Outcome**: Pfizer largely succeeded in becoming more focused on patented pharmaceuticals through multiple divestitures and major pharma-focused acquisitions, though the strategy showed mixed stock performance results, with significant COVID-19 vaccine success but subsequent revenue declines.

• **Diversification Value Debate**: The article presented competing views on diversification vs. undiversification, with Bernard Munos arguing against undiversification due to inability to mitigate R&D risk. **Outcome**: The question remained unresolved, with both diversified companies (J&J) and focused companies showing success, though market conditions increasingly favored scale and focus in core therapeutic areas, particularly oncology.

• **Portfolio Management Failure**: Munos argued portfolio management "has failed miserably across the board" to protect against patent cliffs. **Outcome**: Major patent cliffs continued post-2014 affecting companies like Pfizer (Lipitor), Bristol-Myers Squibb (Plavix), validating the difficulty of managing through major revenue losses from blockbuster drugs going generic.

• **J&J's Long-term Performance Continuation**: The article noted J&J "just keeps banging away" with steady performance across timeframes. **Outcome**: J&J generally maintained this pattern through 2024, though facing challenges including opioid litigation settlements, talc litigation, and proposed spinoff of consumer health (completed as Kenvue in 2023).

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
This article provides reasonably interesting historical context about pharma stock performance and diversification strategies, but focuses primarily on backward-looking financial analysis rather than forward-looking biotech innovation or scientific breakthroughs that would command higher interest.
