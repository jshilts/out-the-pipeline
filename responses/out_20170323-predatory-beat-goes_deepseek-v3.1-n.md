# The Predatory Beat Goes On (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes a sting operation conducted by researchers who created a fictitious scientist named Anna O. Szust ("Oszust" means "fraud" in Polish) with completely fabricated credentials—fake degrees, non-existent book chapters, and zero actual publications or citations. The researchers applied on her behalf to editorial boards of 360 journals across three categories: reputable Journal Citation Reports (JCR) journals, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and journals from Beall's List of predatory publishers.

The results were striking: None of the 120 JCR journals accepted the fake editor. Eight of the DOAJ journals did, while 40 out of 120 Beall's List journals (33%) accepted Szust onto their editorial boards. The article also reveals that at least a dozen journals requested payment or profit-sharing arrangements, with some offering percentage splits of revenue for organizing conferences or launching new journals—resembling multilevel marketing schemes.

## 2. HISTORY

The Szust sting operation, published by Bohannon et al. in *Nature* (March 2017), became one of the most cited studies exposing predatory publishing practices. It significantly raised awareness about the scale and brazenness of predatory journals, which charge publication fees while providing minimal or no peer review.

Following this exposure:
- **Policy changes**: Many institutions and funding agencies implemented stricter guidelines about where researchers could publish, often creating "white lists" of legitimate journals.
- **DOAJ reforms**: The Directory of Open Access Journals significantly tightened its inclusion criteria and membership monitoring after 8 of its listed journals failed the sting.
- **Beall's List shutdown**: Jeffrey Beall's controversial list of predatory publishers, which had been a key resource despite criticisms of its subjective nature, was taken down in January 2017, partly due to legal pressures and the controversy highlighted by studies like this one.
- **Still listing Szust**: The fact that 11 journals continued listing the nonexistent researcher months after being informed exemplified the lack of editorial oversight.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction**: The article suggests predatory publishers would continue finding new ways to exploit researchers by stating "The predatory junk journals will do what ever they can think of to bring in customers and cash, with no restrictions and no shame."
  - **Outcome**: This proved largely accurate. Research has shown continued proliferation of predatory journals using increasingly sophisticated tactics, including hijacking legitimate journal websites and creating mirror sites.

- **Implicit prediction**: The comparison to multilevel marketing schemes ("For every new journal you start, you earn new referral fees!") suggested the predatory publishing model would expand through recruitment-based growth.
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Subsequent investigations revealed predatory publishers actively recruiting researchers as "editors" or "guest editors" through unsolicited emails, sometimes expecting them to recruit authors.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article covers an important but increasingly well-documented issue in academic publishing. While the sting operation was methodologically significant and widely publicized, the predatory publishing problem was already known at the time, and subsequent years have shown this to be one of many quality problems more endemic to certain regions and fields rather than across all biotechnology fields.
