# Two Alzheimer's Updates (Lilly and TauRx)
30 Jun 2015

## 1. SUMMARY

This June 2015 commentary analyzes two significant Alzheimer's disease therapeutic programs generating market excitement. Eli Lilly's stock had surged 32% over the previous year due to impending Phase III data for solanezumab, their amyloid-beta antibody. The author provides context on Lilly's expensive, largely unsuccessful Alzheimer's research history, including a gamma-secretase inhibitor that worsened symptoms and a failed beta-secretase inhibitor. Solanezumab had previously shown disappointing results except in early-stage patient subgroups, prompting Lilly to launch dedicated Phase III trials in that specific population. The commentary expresses concern about potential ambiguous results that could pressure FDA approval despite unclear efficacy.

The second update covers TauRx Therapeutics and their methylene-blue-based tau aggregation inhibitor program, seven years after initial promising Phase II data. Recent TauRx publications revealed complex pharmacokinetic challenges: their original oxidized methylene blue formulation (MTC) suffered from inconsistent absorption, particularly with food, and dose-dependent hematological toxicity due to hemoglobin oxidation. TauRx shifted to a reduced form (LMTX) to circumvent formulation issues, with Phase III trials ongoing. The author notes confusing Phase II results where mild patients showed imaging improvements without cognitive benefit, while moderate patients showed cognitive improvements without corresponding imaging changes.

## 2. HISTORY

**Eli Lilly's Solanezumab:**
The optimism described in June 2015 proved unfounded. In November 2016, Lilly announced that solanezumab failed both Phase III trials (EXPEDITION3 and the extended study) in mild Alzheimer's patients, showing no significant cognitive or functional benefits compared to placebo. The company discontinued the program, taking a $150 million charge and ending a decade-long, billion-dollar investment in this antibody approach. This failure contributed to broader skepticism about amyloid-targeting therapies, though the amyloid hypothesis continued to drive research investment into newer antibodies.

The solanezumab failure was part of a long pattern: multiple Phase III anti-amyloid antibodies failed between 2012-2019 without demonstrating clear clinical efficacy, despite sometimes showing amyloid plaque reduction on PET imaging. This highlighted the gap between target engagement and meaningful patient benefit that the 2015 commentary presciently identified.

**TauRx's LMTX Program:**
In July 2016, TauRx announced that their Phase III LMTX trials failed to meet primary endpoints. The reduced methylene blue formulation showed no significant cognitive or functional benefits in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. While there were some positive signals in exploratory analyses of patients not taking other Alzheimer's medications, these subgroup findings did not provide sufficient evidence for approval. The company continued smaller studies but lost significant momentum.

The broader tau aggregation inhibition field has remained challenging. Unlike the amyloid field, which eventually produced controversial approvals (see below), tau-targeting therapies have not yet demonstrated clear Phase III success, though multiple programs remain in development with different mechanisms.

**Industry-Wide Context:**
Several years after this 2015 article, Biogen's controversial aducanumab (another amyloid antibody) would receive FDA approval in June 2021 despite mixed clinical trial data and strong opposition from expert advisory panels—precisely the regulatory pressure scenario the author feared with Lilly's solanezumab. This approval generated intense scientific debate about FDA standards and the strength of evidence required for Alzheimer's drugs. The uptake of aducanumab was limited by coverage restrictions, safety concerns, and continued uncertainty about clinical benefit, with many health systems declining to prescribe it.

The treatment landscape slowly evolved from the "basically zero" success rate of 2015, with lecanemab receiving traditional FDA approval in July 2023 based on clearer (though modest) clinical benefit. However, these newer anti-amyloid antibodies carry risks including brain bleeding and swelling, limiting their use. The 2015 article's skepticism about Alzheimer's antibody efficacy proved largely justified for solanezumab and reflected broader challenges that continued throughout the late 2010s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Lilly's solanezumab would likely fail ("clearly negative") or produce ambiguous results that would create regulatory pressure despite unclear efficacy.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. The drug clearly failed in November 2016, producing unambiguous negative results that ended the program.

• **Prediction**: If solanezumab results were ambiguous, FDA would face intense pressure to approve despite insufficient evidence, fueled by desperate families.
  - **Outcome**: **Partially predictive**. While solanezumab didn't create this scenario, Biogen's aducanumab did exactly this six years later, generating enormous controversy when approved despite equivocal efficacy data.

• **Prediction**: Alzheimer's antibodies had "a very hard time showing efficacy under any circumstances" and the field's overall clinical success rate was "basically zero."
  - **Outcome**: **Half-accurate**. This remained largely true through the late 2010s, with multiple antibody failures. However, lecanemab eventually demonstrated modest but statistically significant benefit in 2023, though controversy persists about clinical meaningfulness.

• **Prediction**: TauRx's Phase III trials would be a "real finger-crossing exercise, both for efficacy and tox."
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. LMTX failed its primary endpoints in 2016, confirming the need for crossed fingers but producing disappointment rather than success.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable scientific prescience and captures a pivotal moment in Alzheimer's drug development. The author correctly anticipated the failure of one major program (solanezumab), foreshadowed the regulatory controversies that would later emerge with other drugs, and highlighted the persistent gap between Alzheimer's drug hype and clinical reality—a pattern that would continue for years beyond 2015.
