# That Pew Survey and Its Problems (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques a Pew Research Center survey that highlighted stark differences between the general public and AAAS scientists regarding the safety of GMOs in food. While nearly 90% of scientists considered GMOs safe, less than 50% of the public shared this view. The author, citing Dan Kahan of Yale Law School's Cultural Cognition Project, argues that the survey is fundamentally flawed because it asks the general public about a topic they largely don't understand. 

The piece demonstrates this misunderstanding through several examples, including that half of survey respondents claimed to check food labels for GMO content when no such mandatory GMO labeling existed in the US at the time. The author suggests this is equivalent to polling the public on highly specialized topics like rhodanines in drug discovery or cell penetration of stapled peptides - the results are meaningless because respondents lack basic contextual understanding. The article emphasizes that interpreting such survey results without accounting for knowledge gaps is methodologically unsound and potentially misleading.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2015 article, several significant developments occurred regarding GMOs, public understanding, and policy:

**Regulatory and Policy Changes**: In 2016, President Obama signed the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, which mandated federal GMO labeling requirements to take effect by 2022. This created the standardized "bioengineered" labeling that now exists, directly addressing the article's observation that no such labels existed in 2015.

**Scientific Consensus Strengthened**: The scientific consensus on GMO safety became even more robust. A 2016 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report reviewed nearly 900 studies and found no substantiated evidence that GMO crops pose different health risks than conventionally bred crops. This reinforced the AAAS position that the original Pew survey highlighted.

**Public Engagement and Education**: The period saw increased efforts by scientific organizations to communicate about GMOs more effectively. However, public understanding remained limited, with subsequent surveys continuing to show significant gaps between scientific consensus and public perception, validating the article's concern about meaningful polling.

**Market Developments**: The market for non-GMO products grew substantially, with the "Non-GMO Project Verified" label becoming increasingly common on grocery store shelves, despite the scientific consensus on safety. This revealed preference dynamic - where consumers pay premiums for non-GMO labeled products while simultaneously consuming GMO foods unknowingly - continued to evolve as the article had noted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, but several implicit expectations can be identified:

• **Implicit prediction that informed surveys would remain difficult**: The article suggested that asking meaningful questions about GMOs required basic understanding that was lacking. **Outcome**: Subsequent surveys continued to show substantial knowledge gaps, with later studies confirming that many consumers remained confused about what GMOs are, their prevalence, and the scientific consensus on safety - validating the methodological concerns raised.

• **Implicit expectation about the futility of broad GMO polling**: The piece implied that broad opinion polling on specialized topics like GMOs would continue to be problematic. **Outcome**: Later research methods evolved to include more nuanced assessments of both knowledge and attitudes, though many mainstream surveys continued using similarly broad questions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important methodological issue in polling and science communication with lasting relevance to how we interpret public opinion on scientific topics. While it correctly identified fundamental problems with GMO polling methodology and made prescient observations about the complexity of public understanding, its primarily critical focus limits broader significance compared to articles that framed constructive solutions or more transformative insights about science communication.
