# AstraZeneca Cutting Back - Some More (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article from February 2014 reports that AstraZeneca announced another round of job cuts, eliminating 550 positions from the company. The specific divisions affected by these cuts were not disclosed in the announcement. The author notes that AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly were among the big pharmaceutical companies in the worst shape at that time, suggesting ongoing struggles within these organizations. The post appears to be a brief industry update noting continued contraction at a major pharmaceutical company.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 job cuts, AstraZeneca underwent significant transformation over the subsequent decade. Contrary to the article's pessimistic tone, the company staged a remarkable turnaround:

**Leadership and Strategy Changes**: In 2012, Pascal Soriot became CEO and began implementing a revival strategy focused on returning to growth by 2017. The company shifted focus toward three main therapeutic areas: oncology, cardiovascular/metabolism, and respiratory/inflammation.

**Major Acquisitions and Pipeline Development**: 
- 2015: Completed the $4 billion acquisition of Actavis' branded respiratory business
- 2015: Acquired ZS Pharma for $2.7 billion, gaining a position in hyperkalemia treatment
- 2016: Completed the $4.3 billion acquisition of Acerta Pharma, gaining access to Calquence (acalabrutinib) for blood cancers

**Drug Development Successes**: Several major drugs gained FDA approval and achieved significant commercial success:
- Tagrisso (osimertinib) for EGFR-positive lung cancer (approved 2015) - became a blockbuster drug
- Imfinzi (durvalumab) for various cancers (approved 2017)
- Lynparza (olaparib) for ovarian cancer (approved 2014, expanded to other indications)
- Farxiga (dapagliflozin) expanded approvals to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease

**Research Infrastructure**: Rather than continuing to shrink research capabilities, AstraZeneca made strategic investments in research sites, particularly in Cambridge, UK and other locations, though some consolidation occurred.

By 2023, AstraZeneca had transformed from the struggling company described in the 2014 article into one of the strongest-performing pharmaceutical companies, with revenues growing from around $25 billion in 2014 to over $45 billion by 2023, driven largely by its successful oncology and rare disease portfolios.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not explicitly contain forward-looking predictions, but the underlying implication was that AstraZeneca's continued job cuts signaled ongoing decline and poor prospects compared to other major pharmaceutical companies.

**Implicit Prediction**: Continued struggles and decline for both AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly among big pharma companies.

**Actual Outcome**: The prediction proved incorrect, particularly for AstraZeneca. While Eli Lilly also achieved significant success (particularly with diabetes drugs like Trulicity and Mounjaro), AstraZeneca executed one of the most successful turnarounds in the pharmaceutical industry during this period, transforming from a company in distress to a leader in oncology and specialty care medicines.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article captures a moment in time showing a major pharmaceutical company's struggles, but its significance is primarily as a brief industry note rather than a substantive analysis of long-term trends. The turnaround that followed makes this snapshot historically interesting as a "before" picture, but the article itself provides minimal context or analytical depth.
