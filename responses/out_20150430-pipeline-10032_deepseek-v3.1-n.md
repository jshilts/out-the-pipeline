# Asking the Employees (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary article discusses employee suggestion programs in the workplace, using Chemistry World's coverage of such initiatives in the chemical industry as a starting point. The piece highlights how difficult it is to genuinely implement programs that encourage employees to propose improvements, noting that while many companies claim to want employee input, actual implementation varies widely. The article provides a concrete example from BASF, which implemented over 23,000 employee proposals in 2014, saving €53 million, illustrating the potential impact of well-established idea management programs. The author notes that this success story comes from a company with 65 years of experience in this area, making the culture "firmly established." The article concludes by asking readers about their own experiences with employee suggestion programs in drug research companies, querying whether such initiatives are taken seriously or merely receive lip service in their industry.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this article's publication, employee engagement and innovation programs continued to evolve within the life sciences and biotechnology sectors:

**Industry Adoption and Evolution:**
- Pharmaceutical companies increasingly formalized innovation programs and internal venture incubators. Companies like Pfizer (Pfizer Centers for Therapeutic Innovation), Novartis (Novartis Biome), and Roche expanded internal innovation platforms that effectively institutionalized employee input mechanisms.
- The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023) dramatically accelerated digital transformation in workplace collaboration tools, making remote suggestion submission and virtual innovation sessions standard practice across the industry.
- Employee resource groups (ERGs) and diversity, equity & inclusion (DEI) initiatives became formal channels for employee input, expanding beyond traditional suggestion boxes to systematic feedback mechanisms.

**Methodology Sophistication:**
- Digital platforms replaced paper-based suggestion systems, with companies implementing enterprise software like Idea Management Systems, collaborative innovation platforms, and internal crowdsourcing tools.
- Hackathons and innovation challenges became common in pharmaceutical companies, with many hosting internal competitions for process improvements and research innovations.
- Companies increasingly linked suggestion programs to formal recognition and reward systems, including financial incentives, career advancement opportunities, and public acknowledgment.

**Broader Industry Context:**
- The culture of open innovation continued to grow, with companies increasingly looking externally for ideas while maintaining internal suggestion mechanisms as complementary approaches.
- However, consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry (increased M&A activity 2015-2024) likely created challenges for maintaining consistent corporate culture and suggestion programs across merged entities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in employee suggestion programs or their outcomes. Rather, it served as a discussion prompt asking readers for their experiences and observations about the sincerity and effectiveness of such programs. The article was primarily descriptive and investigative rather than predictive in nature.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses a legitimate workplace topic and provides useful concrete data about BASF's program, but it is relatively narrow in scope and short-term in relevance. While employee engagement remains an ongoing concern for companies, the central question posed (how drug companies handle employee suggestions) is more of operational interest than fundamental scientific or biotechnological importance, and the discussion format yields diminishing insight over time as workplace practices evolve and company-specific anecdotes lose relevance.
