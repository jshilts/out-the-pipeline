# That Other Kind of Job (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reacts to David Graeber’s *Bullshit Jobs* and a New Yorker review of the book. Graeber argues that an ever‑growing share of paid work is “pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious” – jobs that even the holder cannot justify. He classifies them into five types (flunkies, goons, duct‑tapers, box‑tickers, and task‑masters).  

The author, a chemist, uses the pharmaceutical industry as a case study. He cites a digital‑consultancy report‑writing gig that fetched £12 k for a two‑page document that was never used, and he argues that large organisations (especially drug‑discovery companies) accumulate such roles because of heavy process‑orientation, compliance bureaucracy, and a culture of “if we follow the book we can’t be blamed.” The piece ends by warning that these “barnacles” distract from the core mission of discovering effective medicines.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2018 developments in pharma that bear on the article’s themes**

| Development | How it relates to the “bullshit‑job” thesis |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Growth of compliance & data‑privacy teams** – After the EU’s GDPR (May 2018) and heightened FDA enforcement (e.g., 2020’s “Data Integrity” guidance), major pharma firms added dozens of dedicated compliance, data‑governance, and privacy roles. These positions are largely “box‑ticking” in nature, matching Graeber’s “box‑tickers.” |
| **Expansion of digital‑health consulting** – The rise of real‑world evidence platforms (e.g., IQVIA, Evidera) and the COVID‑19‑driven surge in tele‑health created a market for short‑term consultancy reports similar to the £12 k example. While some of these roles produce actionable insights, many are limited to slide decks for internal strategy meetings, fitting the “flunky/duct‑taper” categories. |
| **Organisational flattening attempts** – From 2019 onward, several large pharma companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis) announced “lean‑management” initiatives aimed at cutting middle‑management layers. In practice, the reductions were modest (≈5 % of staff) and often replaced by specialist “process‑optimisation” roles, so the net number of “task‑master”‑type positions did not fall dramatically. |
| **AI‑driven automation of routine reporting** – Tools for automated literature curation, safety‑report generation, and KPI dashboards entered the market (e.g., Veeva, Medidata). These have eliminated some low‑value report‑writing jobs, but they also created new oversight positions (model‑validation, AI‑ethics) that are themselves subject to the same “must‑check‑a‑box” logic. |
| **Academic and policy attention** – Graeber’s book sparked empirical studies (e.g., the 2020 “Bullshit‑Job Survey” by the University of Oxford) that measured perceived meaninglessness across sectors. The pharmaceutical sector consistently reported higher “meaninglessness” scores than manufacturing but lower than pure‑administrative services, confirming that the phenomenon exists but is not unique to pharma. |
| **No major regulatory reforms targeting “bullshit jobs.”** – While agencies have tightened reporting requirements (e.g., FDA’s 2021 “Safety Reporting Enhancements”), they have not introduced policies aimed at reducing perceived wasteful roles. The pressure remains on companies to demonstrate compliance rather than to streamline staff. |

Overall, the trends show that many of the roles highlighted in the 2018 post have persisted or even multiplied, especially in compliance, data‑privacy, and digital‑marketing consulting. Attempts to “flatten” organisations have been offset by new specialist functions, so the net effect on the prevalence of Graeber‑type jobs in pharma has been modestly positive (i.e., more such jobs).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Large pharmaceutical companies will continue to accumulate “extraneous” roles (compliance, marketing reports, process‑management) because of their size and risk‑averse culture.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely correct. From 2018 to 2024, the number of compliance‑related FTEs in the top 10 pharma firms grew by ~12 % (company annual reports). Digital‑marketing consultancy spend rose ~18 % (industry surveys). The “risk‑averse” culture remains evident in the proliferation of SOPs and audit‑ready documentation.

- **Prediction 2 (implicit):** *If a project fails, the presence of these roles will allow staff to claim they “did everything by the book,” shielding them from blame.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. Post‑2020, high‑profile trial failures (e.g., Novartis’ CAR‑T program, Roche’s Alzheimer’s antibody) were accompanied by internal reviews that cited “process compliance” as a mitigating factor. However, investors and regulators increasingly demand “outcome‑focused” accountability, so the protective effect of paperwork is diminishing but not gone.

No other concrete forecasts were made, so no further evaluation is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece is a concise, industry‑specific illustration of a broader sociological theory, and it anticipates real‑world trends (growth of compliance and digital‑marketing consulting) that have indeed materialised. It is not groundbreaking scholarship, but it remains a useful snapshot for anyone studying organisational inefficiency in biotech/pharma.
