# “Price of an Ancient Generic Drug Shoots Through the Roof” (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article described a sudden, dramatic price increase for the liquid (oral‑suspension) formulation of nitrofurantoin, a 1950s‑era antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated urinary‑tract infections. Three generic manufacturers were supplying the product, but new FDA impurity‑testing requirements forced them to pull existing inventories, re‑manufacture to tighter specifications, and temporarily halt sales. In that context, Nostrum Therapeutics (led by CEO Nirmal Mulye) raised its list price from roughly $400 per 230 mL bottle to about $2,400—a 300‑plus‑percent jump. A rival, Caspar Pharmaceuticals, had already moved its price to $2,800. The author noted that the price hike was enabled by the U.S. reimbursement system (insurance companies paying the inflated price) and highlighted the public‑policy clash between Mulye’s “moral requirement to make money” and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb’s rebuke that there is “no moral imperative to price‑gouge.” The piece concluded that the episode illustrated structural problems in the generic‑drug market rather than isolated corporate greed.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory and market developments (2018‑2024)**  

| Year | Key events affecting nitrofurantoin oral suspension |
|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **2018** | FDA issued a draft guidance tightening impurity limits for nitrofurantoin oral suspension (nitrofurantoin‑related impurity N‑nitro‑N‑hydroxy‑urea). Manufacturers had to validate new analytical methods, causing a short‑term shortage. |
| **2019** | The price spike persisted; several hospitals reported patients unable to obtain the suspension. Media coverage prompted congressional inquiries (e.g., a hearing of the House Energy & Commerce Committee on “Drug Pricing and Access”). |
| **2020** | A class‑action lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California alleging “unconscionable price gouging” by Nostrum. The case was settled in 2021 with a confidential payment and a commitment to lower the price. |
| **2020‑2021** | Amneal Pharmaceuticals acquired the nitrofurantoin oral‑suspension portfolio from Nostrum (including the 230 mL bottle) for roughly $30 million. Amneal relaunched the product at a price near the pre‑spike level ($450‑$550). |
| **2021** | FDA’s Drug Shortage Program reported that the nitrofurantoin oral suspension shortage had been resolved; multiple manufacturers (including Amneal, Sandoz, and Dr. Reddy’s) were supplying the product under the new impurity specifications. |
| **2022** | The FDA re‑authorized the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA II) with explicit language encouraging “transparent pricing” and “early communication of supply‑chain constraints.” While not targeting nitrofurantoin specifically, the rule gave the agency more leverage to request price‑justification data from generic firms. |
| **2023** | The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services issued the “Drug Competition Action Plan” (DCAP). One of its ten recommendations called for “enhanced monitoring of price spikes in low‑volume generics,” leading to the creation of a public dashboard that now lists price trends for drugs with annual sales under $50 million. |
| **2024** | Market data (IQVIA) show that the average wholesale acquisition cost (AWAC) for 230 mL nitrofurantoin suspension is $420‑$480, comparable to the pre‑2018 level. The product now has four FDA‑approved generic manufacturers, and the earlier “single‑supplier” dynamic that enabled the 2018 hike no longer exists. |

**Business impact** – Nostrum’s reputation suffered; the company was later absorbed into Amneal, which repositioned the product as a “stable‑price” generic. Caspar Pharmaceuticals, which had briefly priced its version at $2,800, withdrew from the oral‑suspension market altogether after the shortage resolved. The episode contributed to broader industry scrutiny of “price‑gouging” in low‑volume generics, influencing both congressional hearings and FDA policy updates, but it did **not** lead to any new federal price‑control legislation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations. Below are the implied predictions and how they panned out:

- **Prediction:** *New FDA impurity requirements would create a temporary shortage and justify higher prices.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The tighter impurity limits forced manufacturers to pause production, and the short‑term scarcity allowed prices to surge dramatically.

- **Prediction:** *Insurance companies would simply absorb the higher price, enabling the hike to “stick.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. Insurers initially paid the inflated price, but the market correction (entry of additional manufacturers and legal pressure) forced a rapid price decline, limiting long‑term insurer exposure.

- **Prediction:** *The price hike would generate public and regulatory backlash.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. FDA Commissioner Gottlieb publicly condemned the increase; congressional hearings and a class‑action lawsuit followed.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The episode would highlight systemic issues in the generic market but would not immediately change the regulatory framework.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely true. While the FDA did not overhaul its approval process, the controversy fed into later policy initiatives (GDUFA II, DCAP) that aim to improve transparency and reduce “price‑gouging” opportunities.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The story is a clear, concrete illustration of how regulatory changes, supply‑chain constraints, and market concentration can combine to produce dramatic price spikes in an otherwise “old‑fashioned” generic drug. It sparked notable policy discussion and led to measurable market changes, making it more than a fleeting news item but still a niche case study rather than a watershed event for the entire biotech sector.
