# CRISPR In the Courts (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2014 Independent article reports on the emerging legal battle over CRISPR gene-editing technology between two competing consortia, both co-founded by key CRISPR co-discoverers. On one side is Emmanuelle Charpentier's Crispr Therapeutics, backed by $25 million in venture capital and advising Nobel Laureate Craig Mello. On the other side is Jennifer Doudna's Editas Medicine, with $43 million in funding and advisors including George Church and Feng Zhang—who had just secured the first US patent on CRISPR technology for use in human cells, much to Charpentier's dismay. The article frames this conflict as evidence of CRISPR's transformative potential, particularly for human gene therapy applications, while expressing concern that legal disputes might slow clinical progress.

## 2. HISTORY
The patent dispute between the Broad Institute (Feng Zhang) and UC Berkeley (Doudna/Charpentier) evolved into one of the most significant biotechnology patent battles in history. The US Patent and Trademark Office ultimately ruled in favor of the Broad Institute in 2017, granting them priority for CRISPR applications in eukaryotic cells, while Berkeley maintained rights to the foundational CRISPR-Cas9 system. This split led to complex licensing arrangements and ongoing litigation that spanned multiple jurisdictions internationally.

More significantly, both companies matured into major clinical development platforms. Editas Medicine advanced EDIT-101 (AGN-151587) into clinical trials for Leber congenital amaurosis 10 (LCA10), marking the first in vivo CRISPR editing trial in humans in 2019. While early results showed some efficacy signals, the program was ultimately discontinued. The company shifted focus to other ocular and blood disorder programs, with several candidates now in clinical development.

Crispr Therapeutics achieved landmark success with exa-cel (formerly CTX001), an ex vivo CRISPR-edited cell therapy for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. The therapy demonstrated transformative clinical results with sustained elimination of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients and transfusion independence in β-thalassemia patients. Exa-cel received UK approval in November 2023 and FDA approval in December 2023, becoming the first commercially approved CRISPR-based therapeutic. The treatment has since entered limited clinical use, though high costs (~$2 million per patient) and complex manufacturing present substantial access barriers.

CRISPR technology also found widespread adoption beyond therapeutics, with broad use in basic research, agricultural applications, and diagnostic tools, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic where CRISPR-based diagnostics emerged as rapid testing platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Gene therapy applications would be a major driver**: This prediction proved remarkably accurate. Both companies built substantial pipelines around genetic diseases, leading to actual FDA-approved therapies (exa-cel) within a decade.

• **Legal wrangling might slow down progress**: While patent disputes created significant complexity and licensing challenges, they did not prevent clinical advancement. Both academic groups and companies continued aggressive R&D throughout the legal battles, resulting in multiple clinical programs and eventual approval.

• **Implicit prediction that CRISPR would become a clinical reality**: The article's framing suggested gene therapy was getting "another crack" - this proved prescient. Unlike previous gene therapy setbacks, CRISPR-based approaches demonstrated efficacy and safety, leading to regulatory approvals and real patient treatments.

• **Large commercial value driving the conflict**: The venture capital investments ($25M and $43M) proved modest compared to subsequent developments. Both companies eventually went public (Editas in 2016, CRISPR Therapeutics in 2016) with multi-billion dollar market capitalizations, validating the enormous commercial potential.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when CRISPR's commercial and clinical potential began crystallizing. It accurately identified the key players and conflicts that would shape the next decade of gene editing development, with several of its implicit predictions about clinical translation coming to fruition.
