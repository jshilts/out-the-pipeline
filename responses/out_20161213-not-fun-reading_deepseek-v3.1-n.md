# Not Fun Reading (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes Deloitte's 2016 report on pharmaceutical R&D returns, which revealed that the industry's return on R&D investment had fallen to a concerning 3.7% - the lowest figure tracked by Deloitte, down from approximately 10% in 2010. The article highlights the disconnect between commercial successes (233 assets launched since 2010 with $1.538 trillion in forecast lifetime sales) and the underlying structural problems: companies are struggling to replace pipeline value through internally-originated assets, terminations and rising R&D costs are exacerbating the decline, and returns have been running below the industry's cost of capital (estimated at 8.4%).

The author notes that while 45 FDA approvals in the previous year represented $280 billion in forecast sales, this success was releasing value from late-stage pipelines without adequate replacement. Deloitte anticipated increased M&A activity as companies sought higher R&D returns, but the article questions whether there are enough attractive external assets available to purchase. The analysis also makes note of the stark contrast between smaller companies (showing more variance but sustainable on average) versus large pharmaceutical companies (less variance but facing unsustainable trends), and expresses skepticism about generic recommendations for improving success rates through better trial design and therapeutic area focus, suggesting these sensible approaches were likely already being attempted without solving the fundamental problems.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, pharmaceutical R&D trends continued to evolve in complex ways that both confirmed and challenged the 2016 analysis:

**R&D Productivity Trends**: Deloitte's subsequent annual reports showed continued volatility in R&D returns. From 2016-2019, returns remained under pressure (2.5-4.0% range), but the period 2020-2021 saw significant improvement driven by COVID-19 related successes. By 2022-2023, returns settled back toward pre-pandemic levels while development costs continued rising to record highs.

**M&A Activity**: Contrary to expectations of immediate M&A surge, 2017-2019 saw moderate but strategic consolidation. The period 2019-2023 witnessed substantial mega-deals: Bristol-Myers Squibb/Celgene ($74B, 2019), AbbVie/Allergan ($63B, 2019), and Pfizer's acquisition of Seagen ($43B, 2023). These transactions reflected the precise dynamic described in the article - large companies seeking to replenish pipelines through external innovation rather than internal R&D.

**Regulatory and Market Outcomes**: FDA approvals remained robust post-2016 (46-59 approvals annually 2017-2023), validating concerns about pipeline replacement. However, the period saw significant focus on targeted therapies and orphan drugs, with many approvals having narrower patient populations but premium pricing. This shift reflected industry adaptation to the productivity challenges identified in 2016.

**Drug Development Costs**: The $43 million figure referenced in 2011 was definitively outdated. Multiple analyses (including 2016-2023 studies by DiMasi, Grabowski, and others) showed oncology drug development costs averaging $600-700 million, with some estimates approaching $2.8 billion when failures and opportunity costs were included. This confirmed the article's skepticism about optimistic cost projections.

**Small vs. Large Company Dynamics**: The bifurcation noted in 2016 intensified. Smaller biotechnology companies increasingly specialized in discovery and early development, while large pharmaceutical companies focused on late-stage development, commercialization, and portfolio management. Venture funding for biotech remained strong through 2021, then contracted significantly during 2022-2023 market downturn, testing the resilience of the smaller company ecosystem.

**COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic fundamentally altered R&D dynamics from 2020-2022. mRNA technology and rapid vaccine development temporarily boosted productivity metrics and demonstrated that under extraordinary circumstances, drug development timelines could compress dramatically. However, this did not translate into sustained systemic improvement in traditional R&D productivity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article and underlying Deloitte report made several explicit and implicit predictions about future trends:

• **Prediction: Increasing M&A activity anticipated for higher R&D returns**
  - Outcome: **Mixed** - M&A increased but was more strategic and concentrated in specific periods (2019-2020, 2023) rather than sustained elevation. Deals focused increasingly on platforms and technologies rather than just late-stage assets.

• **Prediction: Small companies sustainable on average but highly variable**
  - Outcome: **Accurate** - Biotech sector showed extreme variance through market cycles. Strong performance 2017-2021 followed by significant downturn 2022-2023, but average survival and innovation capacity remained.

• **Prediction: Generic efficiency recommendations insufficient to solve fundamental problems**
  - Outcome: **Accurate** - Despite widespread adoption of improved trial design, precision medicine approaches, and therapeutic area focus, fundamental R&D productivity challenges persisted through 2023.

• **Prediction: Large company returns unsustainable "the way they're going"**
  - Outcome: **Partially accurate** - Large pharma adapted through portfolio optimization, increased externalization, and strategic focus rather than wholesale R&D restructuring. Returns remained cyclical rather than entering terminal decline.

• **Prediction: Cost of capital (8.4%) below returns would pressure R&D organizations**
  - Outcome: **Accurate for period** - 2017-2019 continued pressure; 2020-2021 pandemic relief; 2022-2023 renewed pressure from inflation and higher interest rates affecting biotech financing.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated sharp insight into structural challenges facing pharmaceutical R&D productivity that remained relevant throughout the subsequent seven years. The analysis correctly identified that surface-level successes (FDA approvals) masked deeper pipeline replacement problems and that generic efficiency improvements were insufficient to address fundamental issues, predictions that proved accurate through 2023.
