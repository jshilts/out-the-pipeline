# Lilly Steps In for AstraZeneca's Secretase Inhibitor: A Hindsight Analysis

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on a September 2014 deal where Eli Lilly acquired development rights to AstraZeneca's beta-secretase inhibitor AZD3293 (later named LY3314814, then lanabecestat) for Alzheimer's disease. The compound was originally developed by Astex using fragment-based drug discovery methods. The deal made strategic sense for both companies: AstraZeneca was scaling back its central nervous system (CNS) research infrastructure and moving toward a more virtual/collaborative model, while Lilly needed a beta-secretase inhibitor after their own compound failed the previous year. 

The author, Derek Lowe, notes the grim historical context—Alzheimer's drug development has historically shown 0-1% success rates—and expresses measured optimism that beta-secretase deserves another serious attempt despite AstraZeneca's own estimated 9% success probability being viewed skeptically. The piece captures the high-risk, bet-the-company approach that major pharma companies were taking toward Alzheimer's drug development, acknowledging that results would take years given the notoriously slow pace of Alzheimer's clinical trials.

## 2. HISTORY

What followed was a multi-billion dollar disappointment that perfectly illustrates why Alzheimer's drug development is considered one of the most challenging areas in medicine. Here's what happened after the 2014 deal:

**Clinical Development (2014-2018):** Lanabecestat progressed through Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials with mixed results. The drug did show good penetration of the blood-brain barrier and evidence of target engagement (reducing beta-amyloid levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid), which initially seemed promising.

**Phase 3 Failure (2018-2019):** In June 2018, Lilly and AstraZeneca announced that lanabecestat failed in two Phase 3 trials (AMARANTH in early Alzheimer's disease and DAYBREAK-ALZ in mild Alzheimer's dementia). An independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trials due to futility—the drug was not working and showed no benefit on cognitive or functional measures. The announcement came as a major blow to the amyloid hypothesis and to Lilly's Alzheimer's portfolio.

**Further Disappointments:** This failure was part of a broader pattern. Lilly's solanezumab (another anti-amyloid antibody) had failed in 2016, and the company's gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat had failed spectacularly in 2010, actually worsening cognition. By 2019, Lilly had spent decades and billions pursuing amyloid-targeting Alzheimer's drugs with essentially nothing to show for it.

**The Wider Context:** Lanabecestat's failure occurred alongside dozens of other amyloid-targeting drug failures from companies including Pfizer, Roche, Merck, and others. The field was experiencing what some called a "graveyard of amyloid drug failures."

**Limited Silver Linings:** The decade did end with some limited progress—Biogen's aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 despite weak efficacy data, and lecanemab (Leqembi) showed modest but statistically significant benefits in 2022-2023. However, these drugs have had minimal real-world impact due to limited efficacy, safety concerns, and practical challenges with administration and cost.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**

- **Timeline:** Lowe correctly predicted that "it'll take years... Alzheimer's trials are painfully slow." Lanabecestat was in development for 4-5 years post-deal before its 2018-2019 failure.

- **High-Risk Nature:** The author's characterization of Lilly's "bet-the-ranch approach" and discussion of 0-1% historical success rates proved prescient. The skepticism about AstraZeneca's 9% success estimate was well-founded.

- **Industry Dynamics:** The observation about AZ moving to a "virtual/collaborative approach" for CNS research accurately captured broader industry trends toward outsourcing and partnership models.

**What the Article Got Wrong (or Couldn't Have Known):**

- **Compound Success:** The hopeful note that "beta-secretase deserves to have another good shot taken at it" proved overly optimistic. Lanabecestat failed definitively, adding to the mounting evidence challenging the amyloid hypothesis.

- **Lilly's Alzheimer's Strategy:** The deal was presented as a strategic move to maintain Lilly's Alzheimer's pipeline, but it became another in a series of expensive failures that raised questions about the wisdom of repeatedly pursuing the same target mechanisms.

- **Field Progress:** The implied hope that this compound might break the pattern of Alzheimer's failures was misplaced. The subsequent decade brought more failures than breakthroughs, with even the "successful" drugs offering only modest benefits.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/10**

This article captures a fascinating moment in pharmaceutical history, but its primary interest is as a case study in failed drug development rather than as a breakthrough moment. Here's why it ranks in the 70th-79th percentile:

**High Interest Factors:**
- Alzheimer's drug development represents one of the greatest unmet medical needs and most challenging therapeutic areas, making any major development inherently significant
- The deal illustrates the complex strategic calculus of big pharma—portfolio management, risk distribution, and the economics of late-stage drug development
- The subsequent failure highlights the persistent challenges of the amyloid hypothesis, which has dominated Alzheimer's research for decades despite minimal success
- The story exemplifies the tension between scientific hope and harsh clinical reality in drug development

**Moderate Interest Limitations:**
- The article is brief and primarily reports a business transaction rather than deep scientific insight
- Unlike some drug development stories, this one doesn't introduce revolutionary new biology or novel therapeutic approaches
- The outcome, while important to those involved, didn't fundamentally change the Alzheimer's field or drug development paradigms
- Many similar "promising Alzheimer's drug advances" stories have appeared over the years with similar eventual outcomes

The article's enduring value lies in documenting the persistence of pharmaceutical companies in pursuing incredibly difficult therapeutic targets despite overwhelming odds, and as a reminder of how poorly we still understand complex neurodegenerative diseases—lessons that remain highly relevant today as the field continues grappling with the same fundamental challenges.
