# Richard Heck, 1931-2015 (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This obituary commemorates Nobel laureate Richard Heck, who died at age 84 in October 2015. Heck shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Ei-ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki for developing metal-catalyzed coupling reactions, particularly the Heck reaction. The article reflects on how palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions—now ubiquitous in organic synthesis—were considered obscure and unreliable when first developed in the 1950s-1980s. Heck began this work at Hercules using organomercurials, later moving to aryl halides at the University of Delaware. The piece notes that even in 1982, Heck could comprehensively review every known instance of his reaction, contrasting sharply with its current widespread use. The author describes how these reactions became so commonplace in pharmaceutical chemistry that some companies worried about structural bias in their compound libraries, and jokingly suggests a "cap-and-trade" system for coupling reactions.

## 2. HISTORY
The Heck reaction and related palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions have become foundational tools in organic synthesis since the article's publication. The technology has continued its trajectory of widespread adoption in pharmaceutical drug development, with numerous FDA-approved drugs synthesized using these methods. The development of new catalytic systems has progressed significantly, with improvements in catalyst efficiency, substrate scope, and reaction conditions. The field has seen continued academic research into asymmetric variants and green chemistry applications. No major policy changes specifically related to these reactions have occurred. The commercial market for palladium catalysts and related reagents remains substantial, supported by ongoing pharmaceutical and fine chemical manufacturing demands.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5**

This is a well-written obituary reflecting on an important scientific career, but it's primarily historical commentary rather than analysis with testable forward-looking implications, placing it around the median for interest level.
