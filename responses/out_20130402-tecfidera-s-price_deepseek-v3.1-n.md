# Tecfidera's Price (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary examines Biogen Idec's newly approved multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), priced at $54,900 per year. The article notes the irony that this is an industrial chemical available in bulk quantities historically used topically for psoriasis in Germany since the 1990s.

The author explains that while dimethyl fumarate had been known since 1959 for psoriasis treatment and its immune-modulating properties suggested potential MS applications, only Biogen (through its 2006 acquisition of Swiss company Fumapharm) invested the resources to conduct clinical trials and obtain FDA approval for MS. The article acknowledges that drug pricing is driven by development costs and market willingness to pay rather than manufacturing costs. However, it raises concerns about potential "homebrew" compounding since Biogen lacks composition-of-matter patents and only holds method-of-use patents, creating enforcement challenges similar to those seen with Makena and colchicine.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 FDA approval, Tecfidera became one of the most successful MS therapies:

**Clinical & Market Performance:**
- Tecfidera demonstrated sustained efficacy in reducing annualized relapse rates by approximately 50% compared to placebo across clinical trials
- It became one of the top-selling oral MS drugs, with peak annual sales reaching approximately $4.4 billion in 2019
- The drug maintained strong market position despite entry of newer therapies like Roche's Ocrevus and Novartis's Mayzent

**Generic Competition & Pricing Evolution:**
- Generic versions (dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules) entered the market in 2020 following patent litigation
- By 2023-2024, multiple generic manufacturers received FDA approval, significantly reducing costs
- List prices remained high (often $80,000-100,000+ annually) but actual net prices varied dramatically with rebates and insurance negotiations

**Safety Profile Evolution:**
- Post-marketing surveillance revealed increased concerns about progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but serious brain infection, particularly in patients with prolonged lymphopenia
- The FDA added black box warnings regarding PML risk in 2015-2016
- This led to enhanced monitoring requirements and affected prescribing patterns

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions about Tecfidera's trajectory:

• **"Secondary market in dimethyl fumarate might develop"** - While some compounding occurred, particularly for psoriasis treatment, widespread homebrew use for MS did not materialize as predicted. Biogen's formulation patents and FDA regulatory oversight limited this practice more effectively than anticipated.

• **Pricing concerns about $54,900 annual cost** - This severely underestimated actual price escalation. Rather than decreasing, list prices increased to $80,000-100,000+ annually by the late 2010s, though net prices with rebates were lower. The generic entry (2020+) did eventually reduce costs substantially.

• **Patent enforcement challenges** - Biogen successfully defended its patents through 2020 despite litigation from generic manufacturers. The enforcement proved more robust than the author's comparison to Makena and colchicine suggested, partly due to formulation patents and regulatory barriers.

• **Insurance acceptance at $54,900** - This prediction proved correct. Payers widely covered Tecfidera despite high costs, viewing it as competitively priced against alternatives like Gilenya ($60,000) and considering its oral administration advantages over injectable therapies.

• **Market position relative to competitors** - The author's implicit assumption that Tecfidera would compete primarily with Gilenya was accurate, though the MS market evolved with additional oral therapies (Aubagio, Mayzent, Vumerity) and monoclonal antibodies (Ocrevus, Kesimpta), creating a more crowded competitive landscape than anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important moment in pharmaceutical pricing debates and highlighted how industrial chemicals can be repurposed as expensive medicines when companies invest in clinical validation. The case study proved prescient about broader industry trends toward high drug prices and patent strategies.
