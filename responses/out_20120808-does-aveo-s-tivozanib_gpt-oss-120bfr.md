# Does Aveo's Tivozanib Work, or Not? (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary reported on AVEO Pharmaceuticals’ Phase III trial of tivozanib versus sorafenib (Nexavar) in patients with metastatic renal‑cell carcinoma (RCC). The study showed a clear improvement in progression‑free survival (PFS) for tivozanib, but overall survival (OS) at one year was slightly lower (77 % vs. 81 %). The author highlighted the FDA’s concern that the OS signal might be “misleading” because many patients in the sorafenib arm crossed over to receive tivozanib after progression, whereas few tivozanib‑treated patients received subsequent therapy. The piece concluded that, while the PFS gain was promising, the drug’s ultimate value and regulatory fate were uncertain.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory trajectory**  
* **2013 FDA review** – The FDA’s Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee voted **against** approval, citing the lack of OS benefit and the crossover design that made the OS data uninterpretable. AVEO’s New Drug Application was therefore **rejected**.  
* **2015 acquisition** – AVEO was bought by **LG Chem** (≈ $2 billion), which continued development of tivozanib.  
* **European approval** – After additional data from the TIVO‑2 trial (a Phase III study in previously treated RCC), the European Medicines Agency granted a **conditional marketing authorization** in **2017**; the drug entered the EU market as **Fotivda**.  
* **U.S. approval** – A third pivotal trial, **TIVO‑3** (2019), again demonstrated a statistically significant PFS advantage over sorafenib (median PFS ≈ 11.9 mo vs. 9.1 mo) but no OS improvement. In **February 2021** the FDA approved tivozanib for patients with RCC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy, citing the PFS benefit and the unmet need for additional options.  

**Clinical impact**  
* **Adoption** – Tivozanib is now positioned as a **second‑line or later** oral VEGFR‑TKI, typically used after failure of a PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitor or a different TKI. Its uptake has been modest because the RCC treatment landscape has shifted toward immune‑checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab + axitinib, etc.) that provide both PFS and OS benefits.  
* **Safety profile** – Compared with sorafenib, tivozanib shows **lower rates of hand‑foot syndrome and hypertension**, which has been a selling point for clinicians seeking a better‑tolerated TKI.  

**Business outcome**  
* **Revenue** – Fotivda generated **≈ €30 million** in EU sales in 2022, far below the blockbuster expectations that surrounded the early hype.  
* **Pipeline** – LG Chem has not pursued further indications for tivozanib (e.g., colorectal or glioblastoma) after early‑phase setbacks, focusing instead on its broader oncology portfolio.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2012 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **PFS benefit would not translate into OS advantage** | Confirmed. Both the 2012 trial and later TIVO‑3 showed **no OS improvement** versus sorafenib. |
| **FDA would be reluctant to approve because of OS concerns** | Accurate. The FDA initially **rejected** the application in 2013; approval only came after a second‑line indication and additional data in 2021. |
| **Crossover from sorafenib to tivozanib would confound OS data** | Correct. A large proportion of sorafenib patients crossed over to tivozanib, making the OS comparison difficult and contributing to the FDA’s skepticism. |
| **The drug could become a new standard of care** | Not realized. While tivozanib is approved, it is **not a first‑line standard**; immunotherapy‑based regimens dominate first‑line RCC treatment. |
| **AVEO’s stock would suffer long‑term** | Partially true. AVEO’s share price collapsed after the FDA warning, and the company was eventually **acquired** (ending its independent existence). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in RCC drug development and foreshadows regulatory hurdles that later proved decisive, making it a useful case study of how PFS‑driven data can mislead expectations. However, the piece is relatively narrow in scope and the subsequent story, while instructive, did not reshape the broader oncology field.
