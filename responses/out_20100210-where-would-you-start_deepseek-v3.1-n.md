# Where Would You Start a Company? (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2010 commentary discusses strategic considerations for starting a small drug company across different therapeutic areas. The author analyzes oncology as oversaturated with clinical trial challenges, anti-infectives as offering only niche opportunities without blockbuster potential, cardiovascular/metabolics (including diabetes) as difficult due to stiff safety requirements and market saturation, Alzheimer's/CNS as high-risk but high-reward with huge unserved markets, and the Genzyme model of orphan diseases as potentially feasible but challenging due to disparate specialties. The piece reflects the biopharma landscape and risk calculus facing entrepreneurs at the time.

## 2. HISTORY
**Oncology**: The sector saw massive growth post-2010, but the author's concerns about patient recruitment and competition proved prescient. Immuno-oncology exploded with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Keytruda approved 2014, Opdivo 2014), CAR-T therapies (Kymriah 2017), and continued development across many companies. While successful drugs emerged, the crowded space meant many trials failed or produced incremental benefits, validating the "need a real edge" caution.

**Anti-infectives**: The niche prediction largely held true. The field saw some advances with new antibiotics for resistant infections (ceftazidime/avibactam 2015, meropenem/vaborbactam 2017), but pharmaceutical companies increasingly exited antibiotic R&D due to economic challenges and stewardship pressures. The predicted lack of blockbusters proved accurate.

**Cardiovascular and metabolics**: The diabetes market saw continued innovation with SGLT2 inhibitors (Invokana 2013) and GLP-1 agonists expanding beyond diabetes, but the author's caution about stiff safety criteria proved correct—several diabetes drugs faced cardiovascular safety scrutiny. PCSK9 inhibitors (Praluent 2015, Repatha 2015) succeeded but with slower uptake than predicted.

**Alzheimer's/CNS**: This became a graveyard for drug development. Beta-amyloid programs consistently failed (solanezumab, gantenerumab stopped), with the exception of Aduhelm (2021) and Leqembi (2023), which showed modest benefits amid controversy and limited uptake. The "tightrope of risk and reward" assessment was accurate—CNS remained extremely challenging.

**Orphan diseases/Genzyme model**: This area boomed exactly as envisioned. Vertex's cystic fibrosis drugs (Kalydeco 2012, Orkambi 2015, Trikafta 2019) became multi-billion dollar successes. Rare disease companies like Alexion (Soliris 2007, but expanded post-2010) and BioMarin thrived. The orphan drug market exceeded expectations, with over 600 orphan drug approvals by 2020 and companies building portfolios across multiple rare diseases contra the "disparate specialties" concern.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Finding patients for clinical trials is a major problem" [Oncology]**: ✓ **ACCURATE**. Oncology trials now face unprecedented competition for patients, with some studies unable to complete enrollment.
  
- **Anti-infectives as "niche products" without "almighty blockbusters"**: ✓ **ACCURATE**. No new antibiotic achieved blockbuster status; most faced limited use due to resistance concerns and stewardship.
  
- **"Safety criteria for a new therapy are now very stiff" [Diabetes]**: ✓ **ACCURATE**. FDA required cardiovascular outcomes trials, leading to drug withdrawals and label warnings.
  
- **"Alzheimer's...unserved market...for a lot of damned good reasons"**: ✓ **ACCURATE**. Scores of failed trials demonstrated the scientific difficulty; approved drugs had modest benefits and usage.
  
- **Orphan diseases "feasible, with some luck"**: ✓ **ACCURATE BUT UNDERSTATED**. Rare disease became one of biopharma's most successful areas, with spectacular commercial successes exceeding the modest prediction.
  
- **Cardiovascular as "not recommended"**: ≈ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**. The field saw innovation but revenue growth was slower than expected; many companies reduced cardiovascular research.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article demonstrates remarkable foresight about biopharma industry dynamics, particularly its accurate cautions about Alzheimer's difficulty and its recognition—even if understated—of orphan drugs' potential, making it highly relevant for understanding 2010-2020 industry evolution.
