# A Grim Future? Here Are the Numbers (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article presents a stark analysis of pharmaceutical R&D productivity decline by Kelvin Stott, showing that industry return on investment (IRR) had been steadily decreasing and was projected to hit zero within a few years, with negative returns following. The analysis tracked historic P&L performance using a 13-year average investment period per project, finding the decline consistent with earlier reports from Deloitte, BCG, and McKinsey. The central thesis was that traditional small-molecule drug discovery faced diminishing returns due to rising costs and fewer breakthrough opportunities. The author suggested that escaping this trajectory required abandoning conventional approaches in favor of emerging modalities like cell therapies, immunotherapies, gene therapies, and tissue engineering—similar to how "peak oil" predictions were averted through technological breakthroughs like fracking.

## 2. HISTORY
The period following the article's publication did not see the pharmaceutical industry collapse as dramatically projected. Several developments moderated the grim trajectory:

**Financial Performance**: Major pharmaceutical companies maintained profitability through 2018-2024, though R&D productivity challenges persisted. Industry revenues grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022) due to vaccine and therapeutic development, providing substantial cash flows that temporarily offset underlying productivity issues.

**Technology Adoption**: The shift toward novel modalities accelerated substantially:
- **Cell and Gene Therapies**: Multiple CAR-T cell therapies gained FDA approval (Kymriah, Yescarta, others), with high price points ($373,000-$475,000) and growing clinical adoption
- **Gene Therapies**: Luxturna (2017), Zolgensma (2019), and others achieved approval, though manufacturing complexity and cost remained barriers
- **Immunotherapies**: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors became blockbuster drugs (Keytruda reached $17+ billion annually), validating immunooncology as a major therapeutic area
- **mRNA Technology**: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated mRNA vaccine development and validation, opening new therapeutic possibilities
- **ADC Development**: Antibody-drug conjugates gained traction with multiple approvals

**Structural Changes**: Industry consolidation continued through major acquisitions and partnerships focused on novel modalities. Companies increasingly externalized innovation by partnering with or acquiring biotech firms specialized in advanced therapies.

However, the fundamental challenge of rising R&D costs relative to output persisted. R&D expenditure continued increasing across the industry, while the number of new molecular entities approved annually remained relatively stable.

The article's predicted collapse didn't materialize by 2024, but productivity pressures continued shaping industry evolution toward more targeted, specialized, and expensive therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: Pharma IRR would hit zero within "a few years" and continue into negative territory**
- **Outcome**: Industry IRR didn't reach zero in the subsequent ~7 years. Companies maintained sufficient profitability through price increases, operational efficiency, successful launches in novel modalities, and pandemic-related revenues. However, R&D productivity challenges persisted with return rates remaining under pressure.

**• Prediction: Traditional small-molecule drug discovery would become commercially unsustainable**
- **Outcome**: Small molecules continued representing a significant portion of new approvals and pipeline assets. However, the shift toward biologics, cell/gene therapies, and other novel modalities accelerated, validating the strategic need for diversification. Small molecules now coexist with advanced therapies rather than being abandoned.

**• Prediction: Cell-based therapies, immunotherapies, gene therapies, and tissue engineering would become the primary growth areas**
- **Outcome**: Largely accurate. CAR-T therapies, gene therapies, and immunooncology drugs achieved major commercial success. The FDA approved numerous advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), though manufacturing complexity, high costs, and limited patient populations constrained widespread adoption compared to traditional drugs.

**• Prediction: New breakthrough technologies would be needed to avert terminal decline**
- **Outcome**: Technological breakthroughs in gene editing (CRISPR), mRNA platforms, and manufacturing capabilities provided new pathways for value creation. These advances enabled novel therapeutic approaches and temporarily offset productivity declines.

**• Implicit prediction: Industry consolidation or fundamental business model transformation would be necessary**
- **Outcome**: Continued M&A activity and strategic partnerships expanded, particularly around novel modalities and platform technologies. Companies increasingly adopted hybrid models combining internal R&D with external innovation sourcing.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

The article provided prescient analysis of pharmaceutical R&D productivity challenges and accurately identified emerging therapeutic modalities as the industry's future, though the timeline for traditional models' collapse proved overly pessimistic. Its recognition of the need for technological disruption was validated by subsequent developments, making it relevant for understanding industry evolution despite missing the precise timing.
