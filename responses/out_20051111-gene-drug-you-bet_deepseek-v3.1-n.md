# Gene to Drug: You Bet (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post references a November 11, 2005 Wall Street Journal column by science journalist Sharon Begley that expressed caution about genomics-based drug discovery. The article appears to have highlighted the gap between the initial hype surrounding genomic research in the late 1990s and early 2000s and the actual delivery of new medicines. The author notes that caution was "appropriate" regarding whether the sequencing of the human genome would quickly translate into new drugs, suggesting that the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries were grappling with how to convert genetic information into viable therapies.

## 2. HISTORY
Following 2005, the genomics-to-drug pipeline evolved more slowly and complexly than many had anticipated:

**Scientific Progress:**
- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) began identifying disease-related genetic variants more systematically starting around 2007-2008, but the effect sizes were often small and clinical translation remained challenging
- Next-generation sequencing technologies (available from ~2007 onward) dramatically reduced sequencing costs but revealed enormous complexity in gene regulation, epigenetics, and non-coding regions
- The ENCODE project (completed 2012) demonstrated that most of the genome was functional in some capacity, complicating simple gene-to-disease narratives

**Drug Development Outcomes:**
- Very few drugs directly emerged from genomics in the immediate post-2005 period; most successful drugs had discovery pathways beginning before the genomic era
- Pharmacogenomics found limited but important applications (e.g., warfarin dosing, cancer therapies like trastuzumab for HER2+ breast cancer)
- Cancer treatment saw the most successful applications through targeted therapies against specific genetic mutations (e.g., EGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors), though these often benefited subsets of patients
- Drug approvals lagged significantly; most genomics-inspired approaches remained in early discovery phases well into the 2010s

**Industry Impact:**
- Pharmaceutical companies began deprioritizing or restructuring genomics divisions in the late 2000s due to high costs and limited near-term returns
- Many biotech companies promising genomic-based drug discovery either failed, pivoted, or were acquired at lower valuations

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Based on the article's implied context of cautious skepticism:

• **Predicted:** Genomics would not quickly deliver the promised wave of new drugs
• **Reality:** Accurate. While genomics did eventually contribute to some breakthrough therapies (particularly in oncology and rare genetic diseases), the timeline was much longer and more limited in scope than the hype of 1998-2005 suggested. Most therapeutic advances came from areas already in development rather than newly identified genetic targets.

• **Predicted:** The complexity of biological systems would undermine simple gene-to-drug pipelines
• **Reality:** Validated. Research post-2005 revealed enormous complexity in gene regulation, protein interactions, and disease mechanisms. Most common diseases proved to be polygenic with environmental interactions, making simple interventions rare.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an early and prescient voice of realism in genomics-based drug discovery, capturing a crucial moment when expectations began aligning with biological complexity.
