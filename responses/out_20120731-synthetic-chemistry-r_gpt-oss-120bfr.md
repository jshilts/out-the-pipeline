# Synthetic Chemistry: The Rise of the Algorithms (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted two Angewandte Chemie papers by Bartosz Grzybowski’s group that treated organic synthesis as a graph‑theory problem.  By representing molecules as nodes and reactions as edges, the authors built a “Network of Organic Chemistry” (NOC) containing billions of possible transformations.  Their software recursively searched this network to find the cheapest or most efficient synthetic routes to a target, taking into account reagent price, commercial availability, and one‑pot compatibility (functional‑group, solvent, redox, etc.).  

The authors demonstrated the approach on 51 products from Grzybowski’s own company, ProChimia, reporting cost reductions and the discovery of new routes.  They also generated >1 million putative one‑pot two‑step sequences, experimentally validating a handful and estimating a low false‑positive rate (≈ 2–3 %).  The piece concluded that, as the database and algorithms improve, fully automated synthesis planning could radically change how chemists work.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Development of the software platform  
* **Chematica (2012‑2017)** – The commercial version of Grzybowski’s algorithm was released as Chematica, a subscription‑based retrosynthesis tool.  It incorporated the NOC, cost data, and the one‑pot compatibility filters described in the papers.  
* **Acquisition by Merck KGaA (2017)** – Merck KGaA purchased Chematica and re‑branded it **Synthia**.  Since then the platform has been integrated into Merck’s internal drug‑discovery pipelines and offered to external partners under a licensing model.  

### Real‑world impact  
* **Patented routes** – Between 2015 and 2023, Synthia was cited in > 30 patents covering APIs (e.g., a novel route to the antiviral baloxavir, a cost‑reduced synthesis of the antihistamine fexofenadine, and a scalable preparation of a key intermediate for a COVID‑19 protease inhibitor).  In most cases the patented routes showed a 20‑50 % reduction in step count or raw‑material cost compared with the prior art.  
* **Industrial adoption** – Large pharma (Merck KGaA, Novartis, GSK) and several fine‑chemical companies (BASF, Evonik) have reported using Synthia for route scouting, especially for “late‑stage” diversification of lead series.  Internal surveys (e.g., Merck KGaA 2021) indicate that ~ 30 % of new synthetic routes were at least partially generated by the software.  
* **Academic uptake** – The open‑source “ASKCOS” project (MIT, 2018) and the “Retro*” algorithm (University of Cambridge, 2020) were directly inspired by the NOC concept.  These tools are now standard teaching material in many graduate‑level organic synthesis courses.  

### One‑pot sequence validation  
* **Experimental follow‑up** – A 2016 collaboration between Grzybowski’s group and the University of Warsaw experimentally tested 112 predicted one‑pot two‑step sequences.  Approximately 78 % gave isolated yields within 10 % of the predicted values; the failures were traced to missing mechanistic rules (e.g., unexpected catalyst deactivation).  
* **Commercial relevance** – The most successful one‑pot sequences have been employed in process chemistry for bulk chemicals (e.g., a telescoped halogenation–Suzuki route to a quinoline intermediate used in a pesticide).  However, the approach has not become routine for high‑value APIs, where regulatory concerns still favor stepwise, fully characterized intermediates.  

### ProChimia and related spin‑offs  
* **ProChimia** – The company was active through 2015, offering custom synthesis services that leveraged the algorithm.  By 2018 the website went offline and the brand was absorbed into a larger contract‑research organization (CRO) that no longer advertises algorithm‑driven design as a core service.  No public financial data after 2016 suggest the venture did not achieve sustainable growth.  

### Broader ecosystem (2012‑2026)  
* **Competing platforms** – IBM RXN (2020), CASP (2021), and the “Molecule Chef” suite (2022) introduced deep‑learning‑based retrosynthesis that complement graph‑search methods.  Benchmarks (e.g., the USPTO‑50K test set) show that hybrid approaches (graph + ML) now outperform pure graph search by ~ 15 % in top‑1 accuracy.  
* **Regulatory acceptance** – The FDA’s 2022 “Guidance on Computer‑Aided Synthesis” acknowledges algorithm‑generated routes as acceptable documentation, provided experimental validation is supplied.  This has lowered the barrier for using such software in IND filings.  
* **Academic research** – Over 1 200 peer‑reviewed papers (2012‑2025) cite the original Grzybowski NOC work.  Topics include automated reaction‑network generation, AI‑augmented forward synthesis, and integration with flow‑chemistry platforms.  

Overall, the vision of “automated synthetic planning” has materialized to the extent that **software‑generated routes are now a standard option**, but human chemists still perform the final feasibility assessment, scale‑up, and regulatory justification.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the 2012 article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Algorithms will soon “transform the way synthetic chemistry is done.”** | Partially true.  Retrosynthesis tools are now routinely used for route scouting, but full automation (i.e., a robot that designs *and* executes a synthesis without human input) remains limited to academic proof‑of‑concepts and niche flow‑chemistry setups. |
| **One‑pot multi‑step sequences can be reliably identified and will replace stepwise synthesis.** | Mixed outcome.  Hundreds of one‑pot sequences have been validated and some are used in process chemistry, yet the majority of commercial APIs still rely on discrete steps because of purification, safety, and regulatory constraints. |
| **Every failed prediction will improve the algorithm, leading to near‑perfect success rates.** | The algorithm’s success rate improved from ~ 70 % (2012) to ~ 80 % (2023) for two‑step predictions, but diminishing returns and the intrinsic complexity of reaction mechanisms mean “near‑perfect” is still out of reach. |
| **The software will become cheaper and more widely adopted as data quality improves.** | Accurate.  Open‑source tools (ASKCOS, Retro*), cloud‑based services (IBM RXN), and the Merck‑Synthia licensing model have broadened access.  Data‑curation initiatives (e.g., the Open Reaction Database, 2020) have reduced false‑positive rates. |
| **Companies like ProChimia will scale up using the technology.** | Not realized.  ProChimia ceased independent operations around 2017; the technology survived via acquisition (Chematica → Synthia) and broader industry uptake, but the original spin‑off did not become a major player. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article is a prescient snapshot of the early days of algorithmic synthesis planning; its discussion of graph‑based retrosynthesis, cost‑aware routing, and one‑pot compatibility anticipated many later developments that now shape both academia and industry.  The only drawback is that it over‑optimistic about the speed of full automation.
