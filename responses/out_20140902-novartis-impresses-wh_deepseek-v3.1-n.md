# Novartis Impresses Where Others Have Failed (September 2014)

## 1. Summary

The article discusses Novartis's positive Phase III results for LCZ696, a combination therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF) consisting of valsartan (an angiotensin II antagonist) and AHU-377 (a neprilysin inhibitor). Compared to the standard therapy enalapril (an ACE inhibitor), LCZ696 demonstrated superior outcomes, reducing cardiovascular death risk by 20% and hospitalization risk by 21% with comparable safety. 

The author notes this success is particularly noteworthy because similar dual-pathway approaches had previously failed, specifically Bristol-Myers Squibb's Vanlev (omapatrilat), which was rejected by the FDA due to angioedema side effects. Despite the author's own past skepticism about ACE/neprilysin combinations ever reaching market, LCZ696's strong clinical performance suggested a genuine therapeutic advance for CHF patients. The article also reflects on how such incremental innovations are often dismissed as "me-too" drugs, yet can deliver meaningful clinical benefits even in well-studied therapeutic areas.

## 2. History

LCZ696 (approved as **Entresto**/sacubitril-valsartan) received **FDA approval in July 2015** for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), making it the first new heart failure drug in over a decade. The approval was based on the landmark PARADIGM-HF trial, which demonstrated compelling efficacy over enalapril.

In the years following approval, Entresto achieved significant clinical adoption and became a **blockbuster drug**, generating billions in annual revenue for Novartis. Clinical guidelines were updated to include Entresto as a recommended therapy, displacing ACE inhibitors in many cases for HFrEF patients. The drug demonstrated real-world effectiveness consistent with trial data, showing reduced hospitalizations and mortality in practice.

The success prompted further research into its use across heart failure subtypes. In **February 2021**, the FDA expanded Entresto's indication to include **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** based on the PARAGON-HF trial, significantly broadening its eligible patient population. Research also explored sacubitril-valsartan in other cardiovascular conditions.

The drug faced some payer challenges initially due to cost concerns, but its demonstrated clinical benefits and subsequent generic competition planning helped address access issues. Beyond Entresto itself, its success rekindled pharmaceutical interest in neprilysin inhibition and combination approaches in cardiovascular drug development.

## 3. Predictions

**Predictions (implicit or explicit) and outcomes:**

• **That LCZ696 would reach market**: The article stated "the future of the therapy, barring any sudden misfortunes, looks assured." **✓ Accurate** - FDA approved in 2015.

• **That it would become a major therapy**: The article's tone suggested this would be an important drug, referencing its powerful clinical data. **✓ Accurate** - Entresto became a blockbuster and guideline-recommended therapy.

• **That the drug would face comparisons to and potential combination with diuretics**: The author questioned how it would compare to ACE/diuretic combinations. **Partially accurate** - Diuretics remain standard of care alongside Entresto, but no major head-to-head comparative trial fundamentally challenged the drug's role.

• **The "me-too" criticism concern**: The article noted critics might dismiss this as derivative despite its innovation. **Minor validation** - While the drug faced payer scrutiny over cost, most clinical evaluation focused on its demonstrated superiority rather than "me-too" criticisms.

• **That a dual angiotensin/neprilysin approach could succeed differently than omapatrilat**: The author reflected on how LCZ696's different mechanism (receptor antagonist vs. enzyme inhibitor) might explain success vs. prior failures. **✓ Accurate insight** - The valsartan component proved superior to omapatrilat's ACE inhibitor approach in safety profile.

## 4. Interest

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in cardiovascular drug development, correctly identifying that meaningful innovation can emerge from seemingly incremental approaches in well-established therapeutic areas. The LCZ696 success story became one of the most important cardiovascular drug launches of the 2010s, fundamentally changing heart failure treatment paradigms and cementing the viability of neprilysin inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.
