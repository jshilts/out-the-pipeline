# Think Your Drug Is Strange-Looking? Beat This (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2012 blog post discusses a research paper featuring an extremely unusual fluorescent nanographene compound with remarkable chemical properties. The molecule has a molecular weight of 2428 amu (M+1 peak at 2429), melts above 300°C, and displays extreme hydrophobicity—described as "three-dimensional asphalt, decorated around its edges with festive scoops of lard." Despite its non-drug-like characteristics, researchers successfully administered it to mice using Pluronic surfactant to achieve water solubilization as 100nm particles. The compound showed low cytotoxicity and organ accumulation (particularly liver), and demonstrated photobleaching resistance, making it potentially useful as a fluorescent imaging agent. The paper suggested future applications in chemotherapy platforms.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2012 paper by Shinden et al. (Organic Letters, DOI: 10.1021/ol302833t) on "3D nanographene" based on triptycene frameworks represented early exploration of large, highly aromatic nanostructures for biological applications. In subsequent years, this research direction evolved but did not lead to FDA-approved drugs or widespread clinical adoption.

**Research trajectory**: The specific compound described never progressed to approved therapeutics. Nanographene research continued, but clinical translation focused on more biocompatible carbon nanomaterials like graphene oxide and carbon dots with better aqueous solubility profiles.

**Imaging applications**: While fluorescent nanomaterials for bioimaging advanced significantly (quantum dots, carbon dots, and various nanoparticles became standard tools), the extremely hydrophobic, high-molecular-weight triptycene-based structures did not see widespread adoption. The photobleaching resistance property was valuable, but less extreme fluorophores proved more practical for routine biological imaging.

**Drug development**: The article's skepticism about using such molecules as chemotherapy platforms proved prescient. No drugs based on this specific molecular architecture reached clinical trials or FDA approval. The pharmaceutical industry continued to favor more drug-like molecules with better solubility, metabolic stability, and clearance profiles.

**Nanotechnology outcomes**: While molecular nanotechnology research continued, biomedical applications converged on more pragmatic synthetic approaches. The "least drug-like molecule" distinction highlighted the boundary between chemical possibility and practical therapeutics—a boundary that largely held firm.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"When will we see its like again?"** - The author expressed skepticism about seeing similar molecules dosed in animals. **Outcome**: While exotic nanomaterials continued to be tested in research settings, such extreme chemical structures remained rare in biological studies and never became mainstream in drug development.

• **Implicit prediction about chemotherapy platform potential** - The original paper suggested chemotherapeutic applications, while the blog author treated this as boilerplate optimism. **Outcome**: The skepticism proved justified—no chemotherapy drugs emerged from this molecular platform.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

This article was highly interesting for its time, capturing a moment when nanotechnology ambitions intersected with practical drug development constraints. While the specific research direction didn't revolutionize medicine, it illuminated important boundaries in drug design and the gap between chemical novelty and therapeutic viability. The post remains a valuable case study in managing expectations about emerging technologies.
