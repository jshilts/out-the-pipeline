# PhDs On Food Stamps? (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Chronicle article highlighted a modest rise in the share of people with graduate degrees who were receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, “food stamps”) benefits.  Between 2007 and 2010 the proportion of doctorate holders on SNAP grew from 0.05 % to 0.15 %, and for master’s‑level holders from 0.5 % to 1.3 %.  The piece argued that, while the absolute numbers were tiny, the increase reflected the overall growth in the highly‑educated population (from ~20 million in 2007 to ~22 million in 2010, about 4–5 % of the U.S. population).  The author cautioned against sensational headlines, noting that the data were not broken down by age or field of study and that most of the anecdotal cases involved humanities graduates.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 SNAP enrollment trends** – SNAP participation peaked in 2013 at roughly 47 million recipients (the height of the Great Recession recovery) and then gradually declined to about 38 million by 2020.  The share of recipients holding a bachelor’s degree or higher has remained low.  USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) reports consistently show that **≈5 % of SNAP households have a college degree**, and **well under 1 % have a graduate degree**.  The specific figures for doctorate holders are typically reported as **0.1–0.2 %**, essentially unchanged from the 0.15 % level cited for 2010.

**Growth of the highly‑educated population** – Census Bureau data indicate that the number of adults with a graduate or professional degree rose from ~22 million in 2010 to about **23–24 million by 2020**, representing roughly **9–10 % of the adult population**.  The overall proportion of the U.S. population with any post‑secondary credential continued its long‑term upward trend, reaching **≈20 % with a bachelor’s degree or higher** by 2020.

**Labor‑market context** – Unemployment rates for people with a bachelor’s degree fell below 5 % by 2015 and stayed in the low‑single‑digits through the 2020s, while the unemployment rate for those with graduate degrees was consistently **≈2–3 %**.  Consequently, the economic pressure that might push a graduate‑degree holder onto SNAP has been relatively limited compared with the broader population.

**Policy developments** – The 2014 Farm Bill made modest changes to SNAP eligibility but did not target education level.  During the COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2021) SNAP benefits were temporarily expanded, and enrollment surged to **≈42 million**, yet the demographic composition remained similar: the proportion of highly‑educated recipients did not rise appreciably.

**Overall assessment** – The article’s observation that a small but growing slice of the graduate‑educated population was on SNAP proved accurate in the sense that the **absolute share stayed under 0.2 %** and the **trend has been essentially flat** since 2010.  The phenomenon has never become a major policy concern; it remains a statistical footnote rather than a systemic issue.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article did not lay out explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction:** The share of graduate‑degree holders on SNAP would continue to rise as the overall number of degree holders grew.  
  **Outcome:** The share rose slightly from 0.05 % (2007) to 0.15 % (2010) and has hovered around **0.1–0.2 %** ever since.  The increase has been modest, matching the article’s caution that the phenomenon is not “widespread.”

- **Prediction (implicit):** Economic downturns could push more highly‑educated people onto assistance programs.  
  **Outcome:** The Great Recession’s tail end (2009‑2010) did see a small uptick, but the subsequent recovery and low unemployment for degree holders limited further growth.  Even the COVID‑19‑related SNAP expansion did **not** produce a noticeable surge among graduate‑degree recipients.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  
The piece is a useful snapshot of a niche demographic statistic during a turbulent economic period, but the underlying trend remained minor and has not generated lasting policy or scholarly impact.
