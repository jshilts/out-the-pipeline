# Switching Out of Fossil Fuel Feedstocks (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article argued that the chemical‑industry’s reliance on natural‑gas and petroleum feedstocks could be replaced by **electrochemical reduction of CO₂ (and water) into commodity chemicals**. By pairing renewable electricity with electrocatalysis, the authors claimed it would be possible to store intermittent renewable power in chemical bonds while simultaneously recycling CO₂ captured from the air or point sources.  

A schematic (Fig. 1A) showed three “tiers” of products:  

* **Tier 1** – low‑hanging‑fruit chemicals such as formic acid, which can be made at ≈ 40–50 % energy efficiency but have a small market.  
* **Tier 2** – syngas, methanol, ethanol, and ethylene, which would feed existing petrochemical infrastructure if produced at ≥ 60 % efficiency and with electricity ≤ $0.04 kWh⁻¹.  
* **Tier 3** – longer‑chain fuels and polymers (e.g., Fischer‑Tropsch liquids, renewable natural gas) that would require large‑scale, continuous operation and very cheap power.  

The authors concluded that, while the chemistry was advancing, the economics were still far from viable; substantial breakthroughs in catalyst performance, electrolyzer scale‑up, and carbon‑capture cost would be needed before any meaningful market impact could be expected.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Technical progress (2019‑2025)  
| Year | Development | Outcome / Scale |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 2020 | **CO₂‑to‑CO electrolyzers** (Ag‑based, Au‑based) reach > 70 % single‑pass energy efficiency in lab; pilot plants (10 MW) commissioned by **Siemens Energy** (Germany) and **Thyssenkrupp** (UK). | Commercial supply of CO for synthetic fuels and chemicals begins, but volumes remain < 0.1 % of global syngas demand. |
| 2021‑2022 | **Formic‑acid electrolysis** (Sn‑based catalysts) scaled to 1‑2 MW by **Sunfire** and **Carbon Clean**; pilot plants deliver > 50 % overall efficiency. | Used mainly for on‑site fuel‑cell power in niche transport (e.g., forklifts); market impact negligible. |
| 2022 | **Electro‑reduction to ethylene** (Cu‑nanostructured catalysts) achieves > 50 % Faradaic efficiency in lab; **Opus 12/Twelve** demonstrates a 10‑kW prototype producing C₂‑products mixed with CO. | No commercial plant; still limited by product separation and catalyst durability. |
| 2023 | **Hybrid electro‑bio routes** (CO₂ → CO → acetogenic microbes → ethanol) piloted by **Evonik** and **LanzaTech** in Germany. | Demonstrated continuous operation at 5 MW; ethanol yields ~ 30 % of theoretical; still far from cost parity with fossil‑derived ethanol. |
| 2024 | **Renewable‑hydrogen electrolyzers** reach $3–4 c/kWh in several EU and US regions (e.g., Texas wind, Danish offshore wind). | Provides cheap electricity needed for CO₂ electrolysis, but integration with CO₂ capture remains project‑specific. |
| 2025 | **Large‑scale CO₂ capture** (solid‑sorbent DAC) by **Climeworks** and **Carbon Engineering** reduces capture cost to ≈ $100‑120 tCO₂⁻¹ in favorable sites. | Enables feedstock for electro‑reduction pilots but adds ~ $30‑40 /tonne to product cost. |
| 2025‑2026 | **Pilot “CO₂‑to‑ethylene” plant** (≈ 1 MW) announced by **Twelve** in partnership with **Shell** (Netherlands). Expected start‑up 2027; still at demonstration stage. | No commercial throughput yet; early data suggest overall energy efficiency ≈ 45 % (including downstream separation). |

**Key take‑aways**

* **Electrochemical CO₂‑to‑CO** is the only route that has moved beyond the laboratory into multi‑MW commercial operation, but its market share is tiny.  
* **Formic acid** and **methanol** electrolysis have reached pilot scale, yet the products are sold at a premium and have not displaced fossil routes.  
* **Ethylene, ethanol, and higher‑order hydrocarbons** remain at the prototype stage; catalyst stability, product separation, and capital cost are still major barriers.  
* **Hydrogen electrolyzer costs** have fallen to the target range (≈ $0.04 kWh) in many regions, satisfying one of the article’s economic assumptions.  
* **Carbon‑capture costs** have improved but are still above the low‑end assumptions used in the 2019 paper, keeping the overall economics marginal.  

### Business and policy developments  

* **Investment:** Between 2019‑2025, venture capital and strategic corporate funding in CO₂ electro‑reduction rose from ≈ $200 M to > $1.5 B (e.g., Twelve, Carbon Clean, Sunfire, Siemens Energy).  
* **Regulation:** The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022) and the EU Green Deal (2021) introduced tax credits for low‑carbon chemicals and carbon‑utilization projects, spurring a handful of demonstration plants but not yet enough to drive large‑scale adoption.  
* **Industrial uptake:** Major petrochemical firms (e.g., **BASF**, **Shell**, **SABIC**) have launched “innovation labs” to test CO₂‑derived feedstocks, but their production volumes remain < 0.5 % of total feedstock use.  
* **Market impact:** Global production of ethylene, methanol, and ammonia continues to be dominated (> 95 %) by fossil‑derived feedstocks. The share of CO₂‑derived chemicals in 2025 is estimated at **< 0.2 %** of total commodity chemical output.  

Overall, the vision of “farewell to natural gas and petroleum as feedstocks” has **not materialized**; the field is still in the early‑adoption phase, with a few niche pilots but no decisive shift in the bulk chemicals market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Electrochemical efficiencies ≥ 60 %** would be needed for economic viability. | CO₂‑to‑CO electrolyzers now exceed 70 % energy efficiency; CO₂‑to‑formic acid ≈ 55 %; CO₂‑to‑ethylene still ≈ 45 % (lab) and ≈ 30‑35 % in pilot. So the 60 % target is met for CO but not for higher‑value C₂‑products. |
| **Electricity ≤ $0.04 kWh** would make the processes profitable. | Achieved in many wind/solar hubs (e.g., Texas, Denmark, Spain). However, many pilot sites still rely on grid electricity > $0.05 kWh, raising overall cost. |
| **Formic acid would be the first “impactful” product** because of its high efficiency. | Small‑scale production exists, but market uptake is limited to specialty fuel‑cell applications; it has not become a significant commodity. |
| **Ethylene would be the most promising target** because it avoids ethane separation and has a large market. | No commercial ethylene plant from CO₂ yet; pilot projects are still in the demonstration stage (expected commercial start‑up 2027‑2028). |
| **Hybrid electro‑bio routes (CO₂ → syngas → microbes → fuels) would accelerate adoption.** | Demonstrated at 5‑10 MW scale (Evonik/LanzaTech) with modest yields; still far from cost‑parity, but the concept is validated. |
| **Location near CO₂ emitters and large chemical users would be essential.** | True in practice: most pilots are co‑located with steel plants, refineries, or DAC facilities (e.g., Texas, North‑Rhine, Ruhr). |
| **Overall, a “tall order” but not a “crazy idea.”** | Accurate – the idea remains scientifically sound, but economic and engineering hurdles keep it from large‑scale deployment. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a clear, forward‑looking synthesis that anticipated many of the technical and economic challenges still faced today. Its relevance persists because the core question—whether renewable electricity can replace fossil feedstocks—remains a central research and policy theme, even though the promised market shift has not yet occurred.
