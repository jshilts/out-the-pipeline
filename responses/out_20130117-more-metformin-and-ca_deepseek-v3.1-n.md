# More on Metformin and Cancer (and Alzheimer's) (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary discusses metformin, a widely used diabetes drug, and explores emerging evidence that it may have effects beyond glucose control, particularly in cancer prevention and Alzheimer's disease. The article highlights metformin's unusual properties—it's a small, polar molecule that reduces glucose through mechanisms that were unknown when it was first approved. The author notes conflicting evidence regarding Alzheimer's: a 2009 study suggested it might worsen Alzheimer's pathology, while a 2012 rodent study in obese mice showed improved neurodegenerative effects in the hippocampus, though applicability to non-diabetic humans remained unclear.

For cancer, the article cites growing evidence linking metformin use to lower incidence of some cancers, referencing a PNAS paper suggesting the compound works by modifying inflammatory pathways through Src and NF-κB mechanisms. The author mentions multiple clinical trials already underway combining metformin with chemotherapy regimens and expresses optimism about the "intersection of metabolism and cancer" as a promising research area.

## 2. HISTORY

**Cancer Research and Clinical Trials:**
After 2013, numerous clinical trials examined metformin's potential in cancer treatment, with largely disappointing results. The large-scale TORCH trial and other major studies failed to show significant survival benefits when metformin was added to standard cancer therapies. By 2020-2022, many oncologists had concluded that metformin did not deliver the hoped-for anti-cancer effects in clinical practice, despite promising preclinical and epidemiological data.

**Alzheimer's Disease:**
Subsequent research on metformin and Alzheimer's remained mixed and inconclusive. Longitudinal studies showed inconsistent results, with some suggesting potential benefits while others found no effect or possible worsening of cognitive outcomes. The drug did not emerge as a proven Alzheimer's treatment, and the "Type III diabetes" hypothesis for Alzheimer's did not translate into clinical practice.

**FDA Approvals and Clinical Practice:**
Metformin did not receive any new FDA approvals for cancer or Alzheimer's indications between 2013-2024. It remains primarily a diabetes medication, though it did gain additional approvals for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). No major clinical guidelines incorporated metformin for cancer prevention or Alzheimer's treatment.

**Drug Development:**
Pharmaceutical companies investigated metformin's mechanisms for developing new drugs targeting metabolic pathways in cancer, but no blockbuster drugs emerged from this research area by 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I very much look forward to seeing the results" (of metformin added to chemotherapy regimens)** - This prediction of promising clinical trial results was not realized; major trials showed disappointing outcomes with no significant survival benefits.

• **"There's a lot of really useful stuff to be found in it"** (referring to the metabolism-cancer intersection) - While research continued in this area, it did not yield the expected transformative clinical applications or drugs, with most clinical trials failing to demonstrate benefits.

• **Implicit prediction that metformin would prove effective for cancer treatment** - Clinical evidence accumulated after 2013 did not support this, with systematic reviews and meta-analyses showing limited to no benefit.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article captures an important moment in drug repurposing research and highlights the challenges of translating epidemiological associations and preclinical data into clinical benefits. While the topic was scientifically interesting and actively researched, the ultimate clinical impact was minimal, making it more historically significant as a cautionary example than as a breakthrough.
