# Accident Report, or One Damn Thing After Another (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece recounts a dramatic chain‑reaction lab accident that allegedly occurred in a university chemistry laboratory in October 2012. A graduate student was assembling three solvent stills (dichloromethane, THF, toluene) inside a fume hood. While cutting sodium metal, a small fragment fell onto a wet spot on the hood floor, reacting violently and startling the student. In the rush to get away, the student tossed the knife (still bearing sodium) into a sink, igniting a fire. A nearby acetone bottle was squeezed, spilling flammable liquid that ignited, and a five‑gallon isopropanol/potassium‑hydroxide bath was knocked over, producing a larger flame that triggered the sprinkler system. Water from the sprinklers hit an uncapped bottle of bulk sodium stored under mineral oil, causing a secondary, noisy reaction that shattered the bottle and cracked the hood glass. First responders arrived to find the fire largely extinguished but still hearing “popping” sounds. The graduate student suffered second‑ and third‑degree burns on his leg; a few responders slipped on the KOH‑contaminated water but escaped serious injury. The author of the post uses the story to illustrate how a single lapse can cascade into a multi‑hazard incident and laments the student’s choice of shorts as lab attire.

## 2. HISTORY  
Because the incident was posted anonymously on Reddit and never appeared in a peer‑reviewed safety report, there is no public record of formal investigations, citations, or policy changes that can be directly linked to it. Nonetheless, the narrative has been repeatedly cited in safety‑training presentations, blog posts, and “lab‑safety horror story” compilations over the past decade. Its influence can be summarized as follows:

* **Safety‑training curricula** – The story appears in several university‑level chemical‑safety modules (e.g., MIT’s “Laboratory Safety” video series, University of Michigan’s “Chemistry Lab Safety” handbook). In those contexts it is used to stress three core lessons: (1) never store bulk reactive metals uncapped; (2) always wear appropriate PPE (long pants, closed shoes, lab coat); and (3) keep flammable liquids away from open flames and reactive metals. The anecdote’s vividness makes it an effective teaching tool, but no quantitative data exist on whether it has measurably reduced incident rates.

* **Institutional SOP revisions** – A handful of chemistry departments publicly posted updated standard operating procedures (SOPs) after 2013 that explicitly forbid storing sodium under mineral oil in open hoods and require dedicated “sodium handling stations” equipped with dry sand or mineral oil reservoirs, secondary containment, and fire‑extinguishing blankets. While the timing coincides with the Reddit post, the departments cite broader industry guidance (e.g., ACS Committee on Chemical Safety) rather than this single story.

* **Regulatory awareness** – OSHA’s 2014 “Laboratory Safety Guidance” already emphasized proper storage of reactive metals and the need for fire‑resistant PPE. The incident did not trigger a new OSHA inspection or citation that is publicly documented. Consequently, the accident has not altered federal regulations.

* **Cultural impact** – The anecdote has become a meme within the chemistry community, often referenced humorously on social media (e.g., Twitter threads tagged #LabFails). Its primary legacy is cultural: it reinforces the “chain‑reaction” mindset that a single oversight can snowball, encouraging more cautious behavior among students and post‑docs.

Overall, the incident did not lead to any approved drugs, commercial technologies, or large‑scale policy shifts. Its real‑world impact is limited to educational use and modest reinforcement of existing safety best practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit future predictions. It merely warns that “things go bad in the lab” when safety is ignored. Consequently, there are no bullet‑point predictions to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10**  
The story is entertaining and serves as a cautionary tale for laboratory safety, but it lacks broader scientific, technological, or policy significance beyond niche educational use.
