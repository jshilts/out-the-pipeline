# Ars Longa, But Instructions to Authors Say (December 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques scientific writing style, prompted by online discussions about Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style." A Nature editor argues that scientists benefit from following Strunk and White's brevity advice, especially given the tendency for verbose, jargon-heavy writing in technical papers. The author recounts an example where a colleague wrote extensively about "systematically investigating steric and electronic factors" when they simply meant "we did the SAR for the 4-position of the ring." The article identifies two problematic patterns: younger scientists emulating unnecessarily complex writing they've been exposed to, and established researchers attempting overly sophisticated "style" through complex sentence structures and obscure vocabulary that impresses some readers but reduces clarity. The author's recommendation is that clear, concise writing without embellishment is superior to poor stylistic attempts.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2006, scientific writing and publishing practices have evolved significantly. Nature and other major journals have maintained and expanded editorial services, with many now offering professional editing and plain-language summary services. The scientific community has increasingly emphasized reproducibility and clarity, leading to initiatives like the EQUATOR Network's reporting guidelines and requirements for structured abstracts and data availability statements. Grant agencies, including the NIH, now often require plain-language summaries for public communication. However, scientific writing remains challenging; studies continue to show that many papers are difficult to understand, even for specialists. The rise of preprints and open access has increased publication volume, potentially exacerbating clarity issues as rapid publication may reduce editorial oversight. Nature Publishing Group has maintained its reputation for editorial quality, and systematic attempts to improve scientific communication have become more common, though the fundamental tension between technical precision and accessibility persists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain specific predictions about the future of scientific writing or publishing. It was primarily commentary on contemporary practices rather than forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a reasonably well-written commentary about scientific writing styles, but it addresses a perennial issue with standard observations. The topic lacks the novelty, technical depth, or long-term significance that would warrant higher interest, falling into the familiar category of "scientific writing needs improvement" discussions that appear regularly in academic circles.

## 5. RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS

The article's core criticisms remain relevant today. Scientific writing continues to struggle with clarity, and the tension between technical precision and comprehensibility persists. The example of convoluted SAR descriptions remains apt - medicinal chemistry papers still often present data in unnecessarily complex ways. The broader trend toward improving scientific communication has seen mixed results; while awareness of the problem has grown and tools like AI-assisted editing have emerged, the fundamental incentives of academic publishing (publication pressure, technical specialization, and the need to demonstrate expertise) continue to favor dense, specialized writing. The author's preference for plain style over pretentious complexity aligns with modern plain-language movements, though achieving this in practice remains challenging across diverse scientific fields.
