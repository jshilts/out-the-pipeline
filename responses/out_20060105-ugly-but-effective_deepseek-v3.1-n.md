# Ugly, But Effective (January 5, 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2006 blog commentary responds to biologist Paul Ewald's "Dangerous Ideas" entry promoting the "New Germ Theory" - the hypothesis that many chronic diseases have infectious origins. Ewald apparently argued that even if vaccines could be developed for conditions like cardiovascular disease, pharmaceutical companies would refuse to develop them in order to protect revenue from existing chronic disease medications.

The author forcefully refutes this argument by noting the enormous financial incentive a company would have to develop such "wonder cures." A one-time curative vaccine would capture the entire therapeutic market, as patients would pay substantial amounts to eliminate lifelong medication regimens. The commentary argues that profit incentives, far from preventing such innovations, would drive companies to scramble for these breakthroughs, and that weakening patent protections would only slow development of such high-risk, high-reward therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent 18 years revealed a more nuanced reality regarding both the New Germ Theory and pharmaceutical incentives:

**New Germ Theory Development**: Research into infectious causes of chronic diseases has had mixed results. The clearest success came with the recognition that **Helicobacter pylori causes most peptic ulcers and gastric cancers**, leading to antibiotic treatments that cure rather than just manage the condition. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have dramatically reduced cervical cancer rates. However, most chronic diseases have not yielded clear infectious etiologies, though research continues into associations between gut microbiome composition and various conditions.

**Pharmaceutical Economics**: The fear of "curing diseases out of existence" has proven largely unfounded. Companies have indeed pursued curative therapies where scientifically feasible, particularly when they can command premium pricing. Examples include:
- **Gilead's hepatitis C drugs** (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) - priced at $84,000-$94,000 for a 12-week curative course, generating billions in revenue
- **CAR-T cell therapies** for certain cancers - one-time treatments costing $375,000-$475,000
- **Gene therapies** for rare diseases - most expensive drugs ever developed (e.g., Luxturna at $850,000, Zolgensma at $2.1 million)

The business model has evolved toward "pay-for-cure" rather than "pay-for-chronic-management" where possible, contradicting Ewald's assumption that chronic treatments are more profitable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "A company that comes up with this wonder cure would scoop up the revenue from the entire therapeutic area"**
- **Outcome**: **Partially correct**. The author correctly anticipated that curative therapies could command premium pricing. However, the market dynamics have been more complex. Gilead's hepatitis C cures did initially dominate, but faced significant payer pushback over pricing and competition from other curative regimens. The high prices have limited patient access, creating ongoing tension between profitability and public health.

**Prediction: "Profit-minded companies would scramble for curative breakthroughs"**
- **Outcome**: **Correct**. Pharmaceutical companies have indeed pursued curative therapies aggressively where scientifically feasible, particularly for cancer and rare diseases. The emergence of gene therapy and cell therapy as major investment areas demonstrates this. However, the scientific barriers remain substantial, and most attempts fail in clinical trials.

**Prediction: "Patent seizure [compulsory licensing] would slow development"**
- **Outcome**: **Difficult to evaluate**. While compulsory licensing threats occasionally emerge, most drug pricing controversies in developed countries have been resolved through negotiations rather than patent seizures. The link between patent protection strength and R&D investment remains debated among health economists.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates surprisingly prescient understanding of pharmaceutical industry incentives, correctly predicting that curative therapies would emerge as major profit centers. The core argument against conspiracy theories about chronic disease management remains relevant in contemporary health policy debates. While the "New Germ Theory" angle proved less impactful than hoped, the economic analysis of drug development incentives has aged well and offers useful historical context for current discussions about healthcare innovation incentives.
