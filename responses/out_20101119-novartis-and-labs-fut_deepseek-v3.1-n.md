# Novartis and the Labs of the Future (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 commentary examines Novartis's "Labs of the Future" (LOTF) initiative in Basel, which was designed as an open-lab concept to break down traditional research silos. The article highlights interviews with two Novartis biologists, Bouwmeester and Korthäuer, who describe a workspace featuring open spaces without functional cells like separate coffee rooms or lab rooms, big screens, video cameras on laptops for informal communication, virtual reality rooms with ultra-high-resolution displays, haptic interfaces, and even robots transporting materials via elevator shafts. The management anticipated that removing physical barriers would create new social dynamics and increase interaction across hierarchies.

The author expresses skepticism about the concept, particularly questioning whether removing walls would actually improve productivity and noting practical challenges like video transmission delays in global collaborations. The commentary references Tom Wolfe's critique of modernist architecture to suggest that such designs often prioritize ideology over the actual preferences and needs of the people using the spaces.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2010 article, Novartis continued to implement and expand its open-lab concept. In 2013, the company completed construction of the new headquarters in Basel featuring many of the LOTF principles. However, the real-world outcomes were mixed and more nuanced than the original vision suggested.

While Novartis did achieve some successes, the broader pharmaceutical industry's experience with open-plan labs has been tempered by practical realities. Research productivity in drug discovery did not show dramatic improvements attributable solely to workspace design. Novartis's R&D productivity, measured by FDA drug approvals, remained relatively stable through the 2010s, with notable successes like the CAR-T therapy Kymriah (approved 2017) and the gene therapy Zolgensma (approved 2019), but these innovations resulted from scientific advances rather than architectural changes.

The open-lab concept did gain some traction across the industry, with other major pharmaceutical companies experimenting with similar designs. However, many organizations discovered that complete removal of private spaces created challenges for focused work, and hybrid approaches became more common. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 fundamentally challenged the open-office model, forcing companies to re-evaluate the value of physical co-location versus remote work capabilities.

Novartis has continued to maintain and update its facilities, but the initial vision of revolutionary productivity gains from purely architectural changes did not materialize as dramatically as envisioned. The company's R&D investments and pipeline success during this period were driven more by scientific strategy, therapeutic area focus, and technological capabilities in areas like biologics and cell therapy rather than workspace design alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Removal of walls and open spaces would create new dynamics, with employees experiencing positive changes within 1-2 months, leading to improved interaction and productivity.
  - **Reality**: While the physical spaces were built as described, the automatic productivity gains did not materialize as quickly or dramatically as predicted. Companies generally found that workspace design alone doesn't drive major productivity improvements.

• **Prediction**: Video conferencing and virtual reality rooms with ultra-high-resolution would enable seamless global collaboration between Basel, Cambridge, and Shanghai.
  - **Reality**: The technology improved substantially over the subsequent decade, but the prediction underestimated the ongoing challenges of time zones, cultural differences, and the value of in-person interactions for complex scientific collaboration.

• **Prediction**: The open lab concept would represent a fundamental shift in how pharmaceutical research is conducted.
  - **Reality**: The concept influenced workspace design across the industry, but it did not revolutionize the fundamental nature of drug discovery. Traditional lab organization and specialized workspaces remained necessary for many research activities.

• **Author's Implicit Prediction**: The initiative would face significant challenges and might not deliver on its promises.
  - **Reality**: This proved accurate - while the facilities were built, the revolutionary productivity gains did not materialize, and the broader industry adopted a more balanced approach to workspace design.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3/10**

This article captures a specific moment in corporate workspace design enthusiasm but addresses a secondary factor in pharmaceutical R&D success. While it provides insight into management thinking of the era, it lacks long-term importance as workspace design proved to be a minor influence compared to scientific strategy, therapeutic advances, and regulatory pathways in determining pharmaceutical industry success.
