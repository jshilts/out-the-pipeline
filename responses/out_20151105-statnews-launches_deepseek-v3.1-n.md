# Statnews Launches (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief announcement introduces Statnews, a new pharmaceutical and health news publication launched by the Boston Globe. The article notes that the Boston/Cambridge area has a massive presence in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry, making it an ideal location for a dedicated health news organization. The author mentions that Statnews has assembled an excellent team of journalists, including recognizable names in science reporting such as Ed Silverman and his Pharmalot blog, which found a new home at the publication. The piece indicates the author's positive expectations for what the new venture will produce.

## 2. HISTORY
Following its November 2015 launch, Statnews quickly established itself as a significant player in health and medical journalism. The publication became known for breaking major healthcare stories, including investigative pieces on drug pricing, pharmaceutical industry practices, and public health issues. Ed Silverman's Pharmalot column continued to be a prominent feature, covering pharmaceutical industry news extensively. 

Statnews expanded its coverage beyond Boston/Cambridge to national and international health topics, including the opioid crisis, FDA regulatory decisions, and healthcare policy. The publication gained recognition for its in-depth reporting, winning several journalism awards for healthcare coverage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Statnews became a leading source for pandemic-related news, providing daily updates on vaccine development, public health measures, and pharmaceutical responses. The publication maintained its editorial independence despite being owned by Boston Globe Media Partners, continuing to build its reputation for credible, in-depth health journalism through 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made implicit predictions about Statnews's potential success and impact:
- **That Statnews would produce significant journalism from its Boston base**: This prediction was validated. Statnews became a major health news source with national reach and influence.
- **That the assembled team of journalists would create valuable content**: Confirmed. The publication consistently produced high-quality investigative and breaking news coverage.
- **That Boston/Cambridge's biotech concentration would support such a venture**: The region's continued growth as a biotech hub (with companies like Moderna gaining prominence) provided abundant news opportunities that Statnews effectively covered.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article announced an important new addition to health journalism that would later prove significant, particularly during major health crises. However, as a brief launch announcement, it lacks the substantive technical or scientific content that would rank higher in lasting importance.
