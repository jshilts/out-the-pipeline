# Chem‑Geekery: Name Reactions You’ve Never Run (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 blog post is a light‑hearted inventory of classic “named” organic reactions that the author, despite a long career, has never performed personally. After listing dozens of reactions he *has* done (Diels‑Alder, Claisen rearrangement, Jones oxidation, etc.), he enumerates a second set that he has never set up on purpose—straight aldol condensations, Fischer indole synthesis, Skraup quinoline synthesis, Baylis‑Hillman, Ritter, Cope rearrangement, Julia olefination, Pictet‑Spengler, Nazarov cyclization, pinacol coupling, ene reactions, among others. The post ends by inviting readers to share the most famous reactions they’ve never run, framing the list as a conversation about gaps in practical laboratory experience.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Continued relevance of the listed reactions**  
- **Aldol condensations** remain a workhorse in both academic and process chemistry; modern variants (e.g., organocatalytic and metal‑catalyzed asymmetric aldol reactions) have become routine, especially after the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for organocatalysis.  
- **Fischer indole synthesis** is still used for constructing indole cores, but its harsh acidic conditions have led many medicinal chemists to prefer metal‑catalyzed or photoredox‑mediated indole formations.  
- **Skraup quinoline synthesis** is largely confined to specialty‑chemical production; the reaction’s high temperature and toxic reagents have limited its adoption in modern pharma pipelines, where milder oxidative cyclizations are favored.  
- **Baylis‑Hillman (Morita‑Baylis‑Hillman) reaction** saw a surge of interest in the 2010s due to asymmetric catalysis and its ability to forge densely functionalized allylic alcohols. However, scale‑up challenges (low turnover, competing side reactions) have kept it mostly in the research laboratory rather than large‑scale manufacturing.  
- **Ritter reaction** (conversion of nitriles to amides) has been supplanted in many process routes by newer amide‑forming methods (e.g., direct amidation using coupling reagents or catalytic C–N bond formation) that avoid the use of strong acids and hazardous reagents.  
- **Cope rearrangement** and **Nazarov cyclization** have both benefited from catalytic and asymmetric variants discovered after 2011, but they remain niche transformations used when a specific carbon‑framework is required.  
- **Julia olefination** has largely been eclipsed by the Horner‑Wadsworth‑Emmons and olefin metathesis methods for constructing alkenes, though modern Julia‑Lythgoe variants still see occasional use for stereoselective synthesis.  
- **Pictet‑Spengler** cyclization continues to be a key step in alkaloid synthesis; recent biocatalytic and metal‑catalyzed versions have broadened its scope.  
- **Pinacol coupling** has been revitalized by photoredox and electrochemical methods that allow milder conditions and better control over stereochemistry.  
- **Ene reactions** have experienced a renaissance through metal‑catalyzed and organocatalytic variants, especially in the synthesis of complex terpenes.

**Impact of automation and AI**  
Since 2011, the rise of automated synthesis platforms (e.g., flow reactors, robotic workstations) and AI‑driven retrosynthetic tools (IBM RXN, Synthia, etc.) has increased exposure of chemists to a broader menu of named reactions. Many of the “never‑run” reactions now appear as suggested steps in computer‑generated synthetic routes, prompting labs to test them on small scale before committing to scale‑up.

**Educational trends**  
Organic chemistry curricula have continued to teach these classic reactions, but there is a noticeable shift toward modern catalytic methods (C–H activation, photoredox, biocatalysis). Consequently, newer graduates may be more familiar with contemporary transformations than with some of the older, harsher named reactions highlighted in the post.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but implicit expectations can be inferred:

- **Implicit expectation:** Chemists will eventually try the reactions they have never run.  
  - **Outcome:** Over the past decade, many of the listed reactions have indeed been revisited in research labs, especially when new catalytic or mechanistic advances made them more attractive. However, several (e.g., Skraup, Ritter) remain rarely performed outside of legacy processes.

- **Implicit expectation:** The “most famous” reactions will retain relevance.  
  - **Outcome:** Reactions such as the aldol condensation and Fischer indole synthesis have remained central to synthetic strategy, while others (Baylis‑Hillman, Julia olefination) have seen modest but steady use, often in specialized contexts.

No bold, quantifiable predictions (e.g., “this reaction will become a blockbuster industrial method”) were made, so there is nothing to directly confirm or refute.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10**  
The piece is an engaging, community‑building anecdote that highlights gaps in practical experience, but it offers limited substantive insight into scientific trends or future directions. Its value lies mainly in prompting discussion among practicing chemists rather than delivering lasting technical impact.
