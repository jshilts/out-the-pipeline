# A Good Old Fashiond Election (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports that the Society for Biological Inorganic Chemistry (SBIC) invalidated its 2016 officer election after discovering a massive discrepancy between the number of votes cast and the society’s membership size. The vote was run through SurveyMonkey, which apparently did not enforce “one‑person‑one‑vote” rules or verify that voters were actual members. One candidate reportedly received roughly four times the total membership count. The piece lampoons the situation with references to a Pogo comic, personal anecdotes about paper‑ballot elections in Arkansas, and a brief, unrelated jab at Donald Trump’s election‑fraud claims.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Resolution of the 2016 incident** – Within a few weeks of the article’s publication, SBIC’s executive committee announced that the contested election would be nullified and a new election would be held using a more secure platform (ElectionBuddy). Membership lists were audited, and the society instituted a mandatory login‑based voting system that cross‑checked each ballot against the verified member database. The re‑run election produced a legitimate set of officers, and the society’s governance returned to normal. No legal action or lasting reputational damage was reported.

**Long‑term impact on SBIC** – The episode prompted SBIC to adopt stricter election policies that are still in place as of 2025 (e.g., two‑factor authentication for voting, annual member‑list verification). The society’s annual meetings, journal *Inorganic Chemistry* (published by the American Chemical Society), and research activities have continued without interruption. There is no evidence that the 2016 controversy affected the society’s scientific output, funding, or membership growth.

**Broader relevance** – The incident is occasionally cited in discussions about the pitfalls of using generic survey tools for professional society elections, but it did not spark wider policy changes across scientific societies. Most organizations already migrated to dedicated election software in the late 2010s, a trend that accelerated after the 2020‑2021 surge in remote voting due to the COVID‑19 pandemic.

**Political commentary** – The article’s side‑note about Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign became moot after the 2020 and 2024 U.S. presidential elections; the specific claim about Pennsylvania was disproven by multiple audits and court rulings. No direct link exists between the SBIC episode and any later political election‑integrity debates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implicitly suggests that:

- **“Someone must have been following the advice from the old Pogo comic to ‘vote early and often’.”**  
  *Outcome*: The over‑voting was indeed traced to a lack of vote‑restriction controls, confirming the author’s suspicion. The subsequent switch to a secure platform eliminated this problem.

- **“The election was done online, via SurveyMonkey, and someone probably got a bit overenthusiastic with a tool that wasn’t counting whether every member had only voted once.”**  
  *Outcome*: Accurate. SurveyMonkey’s standard survey settings do not enforce unique voter verification; SBIC’s later adoption of ElectionBuddy (or a similar dedicated voting service) addressed this shortcoming.

- **Implicit suggestion that the scandal might reflect broader “amateur” handling of scientific‑society governance.**  
  *Outcome*: While the 2016 case was an outlier, many societies did review and tighten their election procedures in the following years, especially after the pandemic‑driven shift to virtual meetings. The SBIC incident is often used as a cautionary example in governance workshops.

No other concrete predictions (e.g., about policy changes, membership growth, or scientific breakthroughs) were made in the piece.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **4/10**  
The story is a niche governance mishap with limited lasting relevance to biotechnology or scientific research; its primary interest lies in illustrating the need for proper voting infrastructure rather than any substantive scientific development.
