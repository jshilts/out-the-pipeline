# An Unexpected Halt in Multiple Myeloma for Venetoclax (March 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that the Roche‑AbbVie partnership’s Phase III trial of venetoclax (Venclexta/ABT‑199) combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma was abruptly placed on a partial clinical hold. The hold was triggered by an interim safety analysis showing a **~20 % higher mortality** in the venetoclax arm compared with dexamethasone‑only control, a signal the author described as “completely unexpected.” The piece noted that venetoclax had already been approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and was under investigation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but that the myeloma data suggested a distinct safety profile. The author concluded that the unexpected excess deaths cast doubt on all ongoing venetoclax‑based myeloma studies and called for an explanation of the underlying cause.

## 2. HISTORY  
**BELLINI trial outcome (Sept 2019)** – The Phase III BELLINI study (venetoclax + bortezomib + dexamethasone vs. bortezomib + dexamethasone) confirmed the interim finding: progression‑free survival improved (median ~11 mo vs 7 mo), but overall survival was worse (hazard ratio ≈ 1.9) because of **excess infections and treatment‑related deaths**. The FDA placed a **partial clinical hold** on further enrollment of venetoclax‑containing myeloma trials.

**Post‑hold analyses (2020‑2021)** – Sub‑group analyses identified that patients whose myeloma harbored the **t(11;14) translocation** (or showed high BCL‑2 expression) derived a clear benefit without the excess mortality seen in the broader population. The safety signal was largely driven by patients lacking this biomarker, who experienced more severe infections.

**Regulatory resolution (Nov 2022)** – Based on the biomarker‑selected data, the FDA granted **accelerated approval** for venetoclax **in combination with dexamethasone** for adult patients with **relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma carrying t(11;14)** who have received at least one prior therapy. The label explicitly restricts use to this genetically defined subgroup and requires enrollment in a post‑marketing confirmatory trial.

**Commercial impact** – Roche (through its Genentech subsidiary) now markets venetoclax for CLL, AML, and the t(11;14)‑myeloma indication. The myeloma indication represents a **niche market**: as of 2024, sales from the MM label are a small fraction of total Venclexta revenue (< 5 %). The earlier safety concerns slowed broader adoption and limited the drug to specialist centers that perform routine cytogenetic testing.

**Partnership dynamics** – The original Roche‑AbbVie co‑development agreement remained in place for CLL and AML. In 2020 AbbVie announced it would **focus venetoclax development on CLL**, while Roche took primary responsibility for the myeloma program. No public termination of the collaboration occurred; instead, the parties simply divided responsibilities.

**Subsequent trials** – After the hold, Roche launched **biomarker‑driven studies** (e.g., venetoclax + pomalidomide + dexamethasone) restricted to t(11;14) patients. Early results (2023‑2024) show high overall response rates (≈ 80 %) and manageable safety, reinforcing the precision‑medicine approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the 2019 article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“The excess mortality was unexpected and could jeopardize all venetoclax myeloma trials.”** | The excess mortality was confirmed in BELLINI, leading to a hold. However, **biomarker‑selected sub‑populations** (t 11;14) showed benefit, allowing the program to continue and eventually gain approval. |
| **“The problem is not yet understood; the clinical path forward is unclear.”** | Subsequent mechanistic work linked the deaths to **infection risk in patients with low BCL‑2 dependence**. The path forward became **precision‑targeted**: restrict use to t 11;14 or high BCL‑2 expression. |
| **Implicit expectation that venetoclax would be broadly useful in myeloma.** | The drug proved **useful only in a small genetic subset**; broad‑myeloma use never materialized. |
| **No impact on CLL/AML approvals.** | Correct – CLL and AML approvals proceeded (AML received full approval in 2021). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when a high‑profile targeted therapy encountered a safety setback that reshaped its development strategy. The subsequent shift to a biomarker‑driven indication illustrates how precision oncology can rescue a drug after a major failure, making the story both scientifically and commercially instructive.
