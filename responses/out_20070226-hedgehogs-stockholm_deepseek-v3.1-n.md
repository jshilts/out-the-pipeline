# Hedgehogs in Stockholm (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary reflects on why certain eminent scientists never receive Nobel Prizes, prompted by the death of chemist F. Albert Cotton, who was frequently mentioned as a contender but never won. The author argues that scientists who are generalists—working across multiple areas—are at a disadvantage compared to specialists with a single, well-defined breakthrough accomplishment. The article uses Harvard chemist George Whitesides as a contemporary example of a "fox" (generalist) rather than a "hedgehog" (specialist), noting that Nobel committees seem to prefer recognizing specific, focused achievements. The piece frames this through Isaiah Berlin's hedgehog-fox metaphor and suggests this dynamic occurs across multiple disciplines.

## 2. HISTORY
Looking at developments since 2007:

**F. Albert Cotton (died 2007)**: His legacy in inorganic chemistry and metal-metal bonding remains foundational, but no posthumous Nobel recognition occurred, consistent with the Nobel Foundation's policies.

**George Whitesides**: As of 2024, he has still not received a Nobel Prize despite remaining highly influential in chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology. His broad, interdisciplinary approach—while generating substantial impact across multiple fields—may have reinforced the article's hypothesis about Nobel selection patterns favoring focused, singular breakthroughs.

**Nobel Prize patterns in chemistry since 2007**: The Nobel Committee has continued to recognize specific, well-defined achievements: molecular machines (2016), cryo-electron microscopy (2017), directed evolution/enzyme engineering (2018), and lithium-ion batteries (2019). These awards largely fit the "hedgehog" pattern of single, transformative contributions rather than broad influence across many areas.

**Academic impact**: Whitesides has since become one of the most cited chemists globally, with his diverse work spanning soft lithography, microfluidics, self-assembly, and origin-of-life chemistry. However, the proliferation of his influence across many domains may have reinforced rather than resolved the Nobel dilemma described in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article includes an implicit prediction rather than explicit forecasts:

- **Implicit prediction about Nobel selection patterns**: The piece suggests the Nobel Committee would continue favoring specialists with clear, singular accomplishments over generalists with broad impact across multiple domains. This prediction held largely true—the subsequent Nobel selections in chemistry align with this hedgehog-favoring pattern, while versatile, cross-disciplinary researchers like Whitesides remain without the prize despite ongoing significant contributions to science.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
While the article provides interesting commentary on Nobel Prize selection dynamics, it focuses on institutional recognition mechanisms rather than substantive scientific content or biotechnology developments.
