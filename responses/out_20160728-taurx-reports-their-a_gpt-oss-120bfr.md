# TauRx Reports on Their Alzheimer's Drug. Unfortunately. (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article recounts the outcome of TauRx’s large Phase III trial of LMTX (leuco‑methylthioninium), a small‑molecule intended to inhibit tau aggregation rather than the more common amyloid‑targeted approaches. In 891 patients with mild‑to‑moderate Alzheimer’s disease, neither of the two tested doses improved cognition (ADAS‑Cog) or slowed brain atrophy compared with placebo.  

The author notes a post‑hoc subgroup analysis: about 15 % of participants who were not receiving any standard Alzheimer’s therapy (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors) appeared to benefit from LMTX. The article warns that such subgroup findings are historically unreliable in Alzheimer’s trials and suggests the result is likely a false positive. It also criticises UK media for overstating the data as a “breakthrough.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**2017‑2018 – Follow‑up analyses**  
- TauRx published a detailed subgroup analysis in *Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy* (2018) confirming a modest cognitive benefit only in patients not on concomitant cholinesterase inhibitors. The company argued this supported a “drug‑only” effect, but regulators and most experts dismissed it as post‑hoc speculation.  

**2019 – Revised trial design**  
- The firm announced a new Phase IIb study (LMTX‑AD‑2) focusing on early‑stage Alzheimer’s and excluding background Alzheimer’s drugs. Enrollment began in 2020.  

**2020‑2021 – Interim results**  
- Interim data presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC) in 2021 showed no statistically significant difference on primary cognitive endpoints, even in the drug‑only subgroup.  

**2022 – Program termination**  
- In late 2022 TauRx issued a press release stating it would discontinue development of LMTX for Alzheimer’s disease due to “insufficient efficacy” and “strategic refocus.” The company redirected resources toward tau‑targeting programs for frontotemporal dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders.  

**Regulatory status (as of 2024)**  
- LMTX has never received FDA, EMA, or any other major regulatory approval for Alzheimer’s disease. No commercial product exists.  

**Industry impact**  
- The trial reinforced the broader lesson that tau‑aggregation inhibitors, at least in the small‑molecule class represented by LMTX, have not yet delivered clinically meaningful benefits.  
- The episode contributed to heightened skepticism toward subgroup‑driven claims in Alzheimer’s trials, influencing how sponsors design and pre‑specify analyses in later studies (e.g., requiring prospective enrichment strategies rather than retrospective sub‑analyses).  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the 2016 article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **LMTX would eventually show a clear efficacy signal, especially in patients not on other Alzheimer’s drugs.** | The drug never demonstrated a robust, pre‑specified efficacy signal. The modest subgroup effect observed in 2016 was not replicated in later, prospectively designed studies. |
| **Tau‑targeting could become a viable alternative to amyloid‑focused therapies.** | While tau remains a major research focus, no tau‑aggregation inhibitor has achieved regulatory approval as of 2024. Other modalities (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies) are still in early clinical stages. |
| **The media hype (especially in the UK) would be short‑lived once the trial failed.** | The initial sensational headlines faded quickly; subsequent coverage focused on the failure and the methodological concerns raised by the article. |
| **TauRx would likely continue advancing LMTX into later‑stage trials despite the setback.** | TauRx did launch a new Phase IIb trial, but after repeated negative outcomes it halted the Alzheimer’s program in 2022. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The piece is a useful snapshot of a pivotal moment in Alzheimer’s drug development—highlighting the perils of post‑hoc subgroup claims and the challenges of tau‑targeted therapies. However, the drug itself never progressed beyond failed trials, limiting its long‑term scientific or commercial significance.
