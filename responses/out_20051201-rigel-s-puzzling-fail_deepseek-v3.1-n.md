# Rigel's Puzzling Failure (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes Rigel Pharmaceuticals' clinical trial failure of R112, an inhaled Syk kinase inhibitor for nasal allergies. The drug had shown promise in an earlier 300-patient trial but failed to meet endpoints in a larger 400-patient study comparing R112 against placebo and GSK's Beconase (an inhaled steroid). While Beconase showed statistical significance versus placebo, R112 did not.

The author explores potential reasons for this discrepancy, dismissing the possibility that Syk kinase is a fundamentally poor target since it plays a well-established role in mast cell signaling during allergic responses. Instead, the article proposes that the first trial's shorter two-day evaluation period may have missed a compensatory biological mechanism that emerges with repeated dosing. The author notes that Rigel had partnerships with other companies, including Pfizer, which was developing next-generation Syk inhibitors for asthma.

## 2. HISTORY

**R112 and Allergy Program**: Rigel's R112 program for allergic rhinitis was ultimately discontinued after the Phase II failure described in the article. The company did not successfully bring an allergy drug to market based on this mechanism.

**Syk Kinase Inhibitors in Autoimmune Diseases**: The Syk kinase target did find eventual success, but in different therapeutic areas than allergies. **Fostamatinib (Tavalisse)** was approved by the FDA in April 2018 for chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune disorder. Rigel itself developed this oral Syk inhibitor after pivoting away from allergy indications.

**Asthma Market**: The Pfizer collaboration mentioned in the article did not result in an approved Syk inhibitor for asthma. The asthma therapeutic area proved challenging for Syk inhibition, and no marketed drugs emerged from this pathway specifically for asthma.

**Rigel's Business Trajectory**: Rigel's stock declined significantly after this 2005 failure but recovered partially when the company shifted its focus to other indications like ITP. The pivot to autoimmune diseases proved more fruitful than the original allergy focus.

**Clinical Lesson**: The case highlighted the importance of trial design duration and the challenges of demonstrating sustained efficacy, particularly in allergy models where compensatory mechanisms can develop.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Pfizer will be paying to find out [about compensatory mechanisms in asthma]"**: This partnership did not lead to successful asthma treatment. Syk inhibitors for asthma faced similar challenges as in allergies, and no asthma drug reached the market through this collaboration. The compensatory mechanism concern appears to have been validated - sustained inhibition proved problematic.

• **Implicit prediction that compensatory mechanisms might emerge in repeated dosing**: This was validated by subsequent developments. The biology was more complex than initial two-day studies suggested, and sustained therapeutic effect remained challenging.

• **Implicit prediction that Syk remained a reasonable target**: This was partially validated - while allergy/asthma applications failed, the target succeeded in autoimmune indications like ITP years later.

• **Implicit expectation that partnerships with other companies (beyond Pfizer) would bear fruit**: Rigel did eventually succeed with fostamatinib for ITP, demonstrating that the kinase inhibitor platform had value, just not in the originally intended allergic disease indications.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article offers a prescient analysis of clinical trial design issues and target validation challenges that remain highly relevant to drug development. The Syk kinase story illustrates how a validated biological target can work in some disease contexts but fail in others, making it valuable for understanding therapeutic translation.
