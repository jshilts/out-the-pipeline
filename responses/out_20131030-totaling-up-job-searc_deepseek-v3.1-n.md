# Totaling Up a Job Search (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary article from October 2013 discusses chemistry blogger See Arr Oh's analysis of the costs—both financial and temporal—associated with conducting a job search in that era. The article references See Arr Oh's blog post where he breaks down the equation that "time equals money" in the context of job hunting, concluding that the process demanded substantial amounts of both resources. Despite the challenging landscape for drug discovery careers at the time, the commentary notes that See Arr Oh remained committed to pursuing work in pharmaceutical research. The author endorses See Arr Oh's expertise in the field and writing ability, while observing that many qualified professionals were available for hire, suggesting that companies could rapidly staff productive departments with the talent then on the market.

## 2. HISTORY

I cannot provide a detailed historical analysis of subsequent developments related to this particular article. This appears to be a brief commentary about an individual blogger's job search experience rather than a substantive analysis of biotechnology industry trends, technologies, or companies. There are no specific companies, drugs, technologies, or policy initiatives mentioned that would enable me to track concrete outcomes and real-world impact following the article's publication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No verifiable predictions about biotechnology industry developments, drug approvals, clinical outcomes, business growth, or policy changes are present in this article that could be evaluated against later events.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article appears to be personal commentary about an individual's job search rather than substantive content about biotechnology developments, making it effectively off-topic for the intended analysis framework.
