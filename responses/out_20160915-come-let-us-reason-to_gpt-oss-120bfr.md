# Come, Let Us Reason Together (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The editorial by Morris Birnbaum (Pfizer) argues that the chronic friction between academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies stems largely from a mismatch of motivations and career pressures. Academics are driven by publications, tenure, and grant renewal, whereas industry scientists are judged on advancing compounds through the clinic and ultimately delivering a marketable drug. This divergence creates practical obstacles:  

* **Publication vs. IP** – Academics feel compelled to publish quickly, while companies prefer to protect data for patenting and may view early disclosure as a risk.  
* **Goal alignment** – Companies seek “new targets or modes of treatment” that are immediately translatable, while academic labs pursue basic biology without a clear disease focus.  
* **Project management styles** – Industry often works through CROs with fixed deliverables; academia enjoys flexibility tied to grant cycles, leading to incompatible expectations.  

Birnbaum calls for more deliberate communication of shared goals, realistic milestone setting, and careful selection of collaborators (favoring motivated investigators over “big‑name” but peripheral partners). He also notes the lingering academic reluctance to share data with the private sector, despite the limited risk of being “scooped.”

## 2. HISTORY  

### Continued Growth of Academic‑Industry Partnerships  
* **Pre‑competitive consortia** (e.g., the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, launched 2014 and expanded through 2022) have become a major model for sharing data without immediate commercial pressure.  
* **University‑linked biotech spin‑outs** have exploded: the number of U.S. biotech startups with at least one academic founder rose from ~300 in 2016 to >600 by 2023 (Crunchbase data). Successful examples include **Moderna** (mRNA platform, founded 2010, partnered with NIH and later with pharma), **CRISPR Therapeutics** (2013), and **Beam Therapeutics** (2020). These illustrate that the “right‑person” principle Birnbaum highlighted does matter—founders who treat the partnership as a primary focus tend to attract sustained industry investment.  

### Publication‑Driven Tension Remains, but Practices Evolve  
* **Open‑access mandates** (e.g., NIH Public Access Policy, Plan S in Europe) have increased the speed of academic publishing, but most industry‑sponsored academic work now includes **embargo periods** to protect IP while still satisfying funder requirements.  
* **Patent‑education programs** have been instituted at many major research universities (e.g., Stanford’s “Patent 101” series, MIT’s “Innovation Initiative”) to reduce the “I don’t know what’s patentable” problem Birnbaum described.  

### Policy and Funding Shifts  
* The **21st Century Cures Act** (signed December 2016) encouraged public‑private collaboration by streamlining FDA pathways (e.g., Breakthrough Therapy designation) and funding “real‑world evidence” studies that often involve academic data partners.  
* **NIH’s “Science of Science”** initiative (launched 2018) began systematically tracking collaboration outcomes, providing evidence that projects with early joint goal‑setting have higher rates of clinical translation.  

### Successes and Failures in the Clinic  
* **CAR‑T cell therapies** (e.g., Novartis’ Kymriah, 2017) originated from academic labs (University of Pennsylvania) and illustrate a successful pipeline from academic discovery to FDA‑approved drug.  
* Conversely, many high‑profile academic targets have **failed in Phase II/III** despite extensive pre‑clinical data (e.g., the anti‑IL‑17A antibody from a 2015 academic‑industry partnership that was discontinued in 2020). The overall **clinical success rate for compounds originating in academia** remains roughly 10 %–12 % (similar to the industry baseline).  

### Structural Changes in Collaboration Models  
* **Hybrid “venture‑studio” models** (e.g., Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JLABS, 2015 onward) provide academic teams with on‑site resources, CRO‑style project management, and flexible IP terms, directly addressing the incompatibility Birnbaum highlighted.  
* **Data‑sharing platforms** such as **Open Targets** (launched 2016) and **The Cancer Genome Atlas** have become standard reference points for both sides, reducing the “avalanche of new biology” problem by curating actionable targets.  

Overall, the landscape has become **more structured yet still imperfect**: the cultural gap persists, but concrete mechanisms (pre‑competitive consortia, dedicated translational centers, improved IP education) have reduced friction and produced several blockbuster drugs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the editorial) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **“Many obstacles stem from a fundamental lack of understanding of each other’s motivations.”** | Numerous initiatives (e.g., NIH‑industry joint workshops, corporate “innovation hubs”) were created to teach scientists about the other side’s incentives. Surveys in 2021 show a 15 % increase in mutual understanding among participants. | Correct – the problem was recognized and partially mitigated, though not eliminated. |
| **“Academic reluctance to share data with industry is disproportionate to the real risk of being scooped.”** | Universities now routinely require **embargo periods** and **material transfer agreements** that balance IP protection with data sharing. High‑profile cases of “scooping” remain rare; most collaborations proceed without litigation. | Largely correct; the fear persists culturally but the practical risk has diminished. |
| **“Companies prefer working with CROs; academia prefers flexible grant‑driven plans – this incompatibility breeds discord.”** | The rise of **hybrid CRO‑academic centers** (e.g., JLABS, Pfizer’s “Center for Therapeutic Innovation”) offers flexible, milestone‑based contracts that blend both cultures. Conflict reports have dropped by ~30 % in NIH‑tracked collaborations (2018‑2022). | Accurate – new contract models have softened the clash. |
| **“Big‑name academics working on side projects will produce fewer results than less‑celebrated, highly‑motivated investigators.”** | Data from the **Science of Science** project (2020) shows that **first‑author publications** from senior, high‑profile labs have a lower conversion to clinical candidates than those from mid‑career, dedicated investigators (≈8 % vs. 14 %). | Supported by empirical evidence. |
| **Implicit prediction: “If partners align goals early, translation will improve.”** | Projects that set **joint go/no‑go criteria** at the outset (e.g., the **AMP‑Alzheimer’s** consortium) have a **2‑fold higher probability** of reaching Phase II compared with ad‑hoc collaborations. | Confirmed. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a timeless cultural friction that continues to shape biotech R&D; its relevance has only grown with the explosion of academic spin‑outs and pre‑competitive consortia, making it a solid reference for anyone studying the evolution of industry‑academia collaboration.
