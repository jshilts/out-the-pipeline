# Biogen Idec Goes Open-Office (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Biogen Idec's new office-laboratory building that adopted a completely open-office layout with no private offices or cubicles. The facility featured individually designed workstations called "I spaces" and common "huddle rooms" for private calls or impromptu meetings. Each floor included "walk stations" with treadmills, and the company eliminated landlines in favor of laptops and headsets. CEO George Scangos acknowledged the controversial nature of eliminating private offices but defended the approach as fostering collaboration through informal discussions. The article notes that the open-office policy was non-negotiable for new hires, with Scangos stating those who wanted private offices "don't come here."

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 move to open-office architecture, subsequent developments provided a mixed but generally informative picture of how the experiment played out:

In the years after implementing the open-office design, Biogen underwent several significant corporate developments unrelated to office layout but that provided context for the company's trajectory. Biogen merged with Idec in 2003 to become Biogen Idec, then dropped "Idec" from its name in 2015 to become simply Biogen. Throughout this period, the company continued its core biopharmaceutical business.

The open-office trend in corporate architecture, which Biogen embraced in 2013, faced increasing scrutiny and counter-evidence in subsequent years, with numerous studies and surveys questioning whether open layouts actually improved collaboration or productivity.

In 2022, Biogen announced plans to significantly reduce its real estate footprint, including the sale of its Weston, Massachusetts campus (where the 2013 open-office building was located) to commercial real estate developer IQHQ for approximately $700 million to be converted into a life sciences hub. As part of this transition, Biogen planned to consolidate its Massachusetts operations into its Cambridge headquarters, indicating a strategic shift away from the Weston location where the open-office experiment had been implemented nearly a decade earlier.

Concrete empirical data on whether Biogen's specific open-office approach succeeded or failed in measurable terms remains limited in publicly available sources.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific, testable predictions about future outcomes. It primarily described the implementation of a novel office design and noted that "it takes years before you find out if it's working or not," without specifying what metrics would determine success or failure.

The implicit prediction was that the open-office approach would "foster more collaboration" and generate ideas from "informal discussions." Evaluating this empirically would require access to internal company metrics on collaboration, productivity, or innovation outcomes, which are not publicly documented.

The question posed about whether "Biogen Idec recruits be pining for their own private offices" reflects an anticipation of potential employee resistance, but the article provides no longitudinal data on whether this became a significant issue affecting recruitment or retention.

The article's closing statement that "it'll be quite interesting to hear reports about how it's working (or not)" acknowledges uncertainty about outcomes, rather than making firm predictions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: 3/10

The article is moderately interesting as an example of workplace design trends in the biotech industry, but has limited broader significance for science, drug development, or public policy outcomes.
