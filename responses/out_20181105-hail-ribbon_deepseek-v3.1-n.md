# Hail to the Ribbon (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article celebrates the 50-year career of Jane Richardson at Duke University, who invented the ribbon diagram around 1980. The ribbon diagram is a visual representation method for protein structures that uses ribbon-like coils for alpha-helices, flat arrows for beta-sheets, and rope-like lines for unstructured loops. By abstracting away side chains and focusing on the protein backbone's overall topology, the technique makes it easier to recognize structural motifs and patterns.

The author argues that the ribbon diagram exemplifies effective scientific visualization by strategically "leaving things out" following an "as simple as possible, but no simpler" principle. By removing the clutter of bond details and side chains while preserving backbone geometry, ribbon diagrams enable researchers to identify common structural elements like beta barrels, coiled-coils, and Greek key motifs. The piece notes this was particularly striking given that when Richardson started in 1969, only about 20 protein structures existed, compared to the thousands available by 2018.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2018, the ribbon diagram has remained a standard and fundamental visualization tool in structural biology. The Protein Data Bank (PDB), which the article noted hadn't existed when Richardson began her work, has continued to grow exponentially, reaching over 200,000 structures by 2024.

The central achievement the article highlights—making protein secondary and tertiary structures intuitively visible—has not been replaced or superseded. Ribbon diagrams continue to feature prominently in publications, textbooks, and educational materials. While alternative and richer representations exist (surface representations, space-filling models), the ribbon diagram persists as a primary method for conveying overall topology and motifs efficiently.

Jane Richardson's foundational contribution has become even more relevant amid the structural biology revolution catalyzed by AlphaFold. The explosion of predicted protein structures made design principles and motif recognition increasingly important, and the intuitive pattern-matching the ribbon diagram enables remains valuable for navigating large structure datasets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article focuses on retrospective appreciation rather than explicit forward-looking predictions. However, the author's implicit assumptions and the state of the field at the time can be evaluated:

- **Implicit assumption that ribbon diagrams would remain useful**: This prediction has held up well. Ribbon diagrams continue to be widely used and are not displaced by newer methods. Rather, they persist alongside other representations as a reliable standard for communicating protein structure.
- **Implicit assumption about continued growth in structural information**: The article notes how far structural biology had already come since Richardson's early days. This continued apace, with the PDB's growth accelerating further after 2018, reinforcing the need for effective motif visualization.
- **Implicit assumption that pattern recognition and visual information bandwidth would remain important**: The emphasis on the brain's visual pattern-matching capabilities and Tufte's principles of data visualization proved prescient. Even as AI methods have become more prominent, human interpretation and pattern recognition remain central to structural biology.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article remains moderately interesting, focusing on an historically important but stable visualization tool. While effective communication of protein structure is crucial, the core visualization approach it celebrates did not evolve dramatically after 2018, and no major shifts in application or adoption occurred.
