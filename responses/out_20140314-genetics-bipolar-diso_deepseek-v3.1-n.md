# The Genetics of Bipolar Disorder: What A Tangle (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary discusses a genetic study of bipolar disorder conducted on 388 Old Order Amish individuals, which included detailed SNP analysis and whole-genome sequencing. Despite the unique population characteristics (genetic isolate with many parent-child relationships providing additional analytical power), the study found no convergence of evidence for specific risk loci or common pathways. The authors noted "striking haplotype and locus heterogeneity," suggesting that bipolar disorder likely arises from multiple different genetic mechanisms rather than a simple genetic signature.

The commentary concludes that bipolar disorder appears to be a "network disease" where the same phenotype can result from various combinations of genetic and environmental factors. The author suggests that rather than continuing to focus on complex upstream genetic causes, future progress might come from studying downstream disease processes, brain function, and neurotransmission patterns that could represent convergence points for the multiple pathways leading to the disorder.


## 2. HISTORY

This 2014 article captured an important inflection point in psychiatric genetics. Subsequent developments largely validated its core insights:

**Genetic Complexity Confirmed**: Large-scale GWAS studies published after 2014 (including major initiatives like the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) confirmed extreme polygenicity. By 2019, the largest bipolar disorder GWAS identified over 30 risk loci, but each contributed very small effect sizes (odds ratios typically <1.1). This supported the "network disease" concept, but with even more complexity than implied in 2014.

**No Major Genetic Breakthroughs for Clinical Practice**: Despite massive increases in sample sizes (studies now include hundreds of thousands of individuals), no genetic markers have achieved clinical utility for bipolar disorder diagnosis or treatment selection as of 2024. Polygenic risk scores remain research tools with limited predictive power.

**Drug Development Challenges**: The pharmaceutical industry's hopes for genetically-targeted psychiatric drugs largely failed to materialize. Several major companies reduced or exited psychiatric drug development between 2015-2020 due to poor success rates in clinical trials, despite increased genetic understanding.

**Continued Focus on Neurobiology**: Research shifted toward understanding neural circuits and brain network dysfunction, aligning with the article's suggestion to study "downstream" processes. This included neuroimaging studies and investigations of neurotransmission systems, though with limited therapeutic translation so far.

**Precision Medicine Limitations**: The much-hyped precision psychiatry movement has struggled with implementation, particularly for bipolar disorder, where genetic complexity makes personalized treatment based on genetics impractical for most patients.


## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and observations about the future of bipolar disorder genetics:

• **"If there were anything close to a simple genetic sequence for bipolar disorder, it would have been found by now"** - **ACCURATE**: Subsequent massive GWAS studies confirmed extreme polygenicity with hundreds of risk variants, each with very small effects. No simple genetic signature emerged.

• **"These various susceptibilities and tendencies all slide towards a similar disease process which can be modified"** - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**: Research did shift toward downstream mechanisms, but the hope that this would lead to effective interventions hasn't fully materialized. While we better understand neural circuits involved, therapeutic modifications remain limited.

• **"Advances in studying brain function and patterns of neurotransmission will shed some light"** - **MIXED ACCURACY**: These areas did advance (neuroimaging, circuit neuroscience), but they haven't provided the hoped-for therapeutic breakthroughs. Basic understanding improved, but clinical translation remained elusive.

• Implicit prediction that larger cohorts would continue to be pursued - **ACCURATE**: Research continued with ever-larger sample sizes, but incremental gains diminished as sample sizes grew beyond hundreds of thousands.


## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article was remarkably prescient about the limitations of genetic approaches to complex psychiatric disorders. It correctly anticipated the continued complexity that would emerge from larger studies and the ongoing challenges in translating genetic findings into clinical practice. The "network disease" concept has become increasingly central to understanding psychiatric disorders, making this commentary historically significant for accurately assessing the field's trajectory at a crucial moment.
