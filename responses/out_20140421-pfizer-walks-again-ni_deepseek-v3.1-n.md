# Pfizer Walks Again By Night (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses breaking news from April 2014 that Pfizer had attempted a bid to acquire AstraZeneca, reportedly offering around $101 billion. The author expresses surprise at this development, given that Pfizer's CEO Ian Read had previously signaled a strategic shift away from large-scale acquisitions toward focusing on internal drug discovery and maintaining "the right size" for the company. The piece notes that AstraZeneca appeared unenthusiastic about the offer and that talks had ceased at the time of publication. The article frames this event as a potential return to Pfizer's "old habits" of pursuing major mergers and acquisitions, suggesting concern about what this might mean for the broader pharmaceutical industry.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Actual Outcome of the 2014 Bid Attempt:**
Pfizer's initial $101 billion approach in April 2014 was indeed rejected by AstraZeneca. However, this was not the end of the story. Pfizer continued pursuing the deal and ultimately made a formal $118 billion takeover offer in May 2014, which AstraZeneca's board again rejected as undervaluing the company. The attempted acquisition ultimately failed, partly due to political concerns in the UK about potential job losses and research cutbacks, as well as AstraZeneca's successful defense strategy emphasizing their promising pipeline.

**What Actually Happened to Pfizer's Strategy:**
Contrary to the pattern suggested in the article, Pfizer did not abandon its large-scale acquisition strategy after this failure. In 2015, Pfizer acquired Hospira for $17 billion, and most notably in 2016, pursued the $160 billion acquisition of Allergan (which ultimately failed due to US Treasury tax inversion rules). In 2019, Pfizer completed a major merger of its consumer healthcare business with GlaxoSmithKline, and most significantly, in 2020, spun off its established drugs business Upjohn to merge with Mylan, creating Viatris. The company has continued to pursue a mixed strategy of both internal R&D and strategic acquisitions.

**AstraZeneca's Subsequent Trajectory:**
AstraZeneca did not remain an acquisition target. Under CEO Pascal Soriot, the company successfully defended itself and went on to significantly strengthen its pipeline and performance. The company made major advances in oncology (particularly with its immunotherapy drugs) and later played a crucial global role in COVID-19 vaccine development through its partnership with Oxford University. By 2023, AstraZeneca's market capitalization had grown to exceed what Pfizer had offered in 2014, vindicating the board's rejection of the takeover.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions Implicit in the Article:**
- **Pfizer would continue pursuing large acquisition targets** → **Partly accurate**. While the AZ deal failed, Pfizer continued attempting major deals (Allergan attempt 2015-2016, various other strategic acquisitions)
- **The failure to acquire AstraZeneca would leave Pfizer strategically adrift** → **Inaccurate**. Pfizer eventually found other strategic paths including the major Viatris spinoff/merger and focused internal development
- **Other pharmaceutical companies would be at risk from Pfizer's renewed "hunger"** → **Partly accurate but overstated**. While Pfizer remained active in M&A, the feared wave of megamergers didn't materialize in the exact form anticipated

**Larger Strategic Questions:**
The concern about Pfizer losing its strategic direction proved somewhat misplaced. The company did continue major M&A activity, but also maintained significant internal R&D investment. The broader prediction that "no one is safe" from Pfizer's acquisition appetite was partially borne out, though the specific target (AstraZeneca) ultimately proved to be making the right decision in remaining independent and went on to significantly outperform expectations.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article captures an important moment in pharmaceutical industry consolidation dynamics, and the failed takeover attempt did have lasting implications for both companies' strategies. However, the broader narrative suggested—that this represented a fundamental shift back to Pfizer's old ways—was only partially realized, and the specific prediction about continued pursuit of this particular deal proved incorrect. The article is most interesting as a case study in how market speculation and company strategic positioning can diverge from ultimate outcomes.
