# Good Advice: Get Lost! (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary piece highlights Regeneron's science-first approach to drug development, contrasting it with industry practices that emphasize marketing and acquisitions. The article describes how CEO Leonard Schleifer and R&D head George Yancopoulos built Regeneron through internal discovery rather than acquisitions, with all 11 drugs in their pipeline at the time stemming from in-house research. Schleifer explicitly rejected the industry adage that "blockbusters aren't discovered, they're made" by commercial teams, instead emphasizing that "science, science, science—that's what this business is about." The piece positions Regeneron as a rare example of scientific integrity driving biotech success.

## 2. HISTORY
After this 2013 article, Regeneron's science-driven strategy continued to prove remarkably successful. Eylea (aflibercept), mentioned as a recent win, became a multi-billion dollar blockbuster for age-related macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. The company's pipeline mentioned at the time would go on to deliver several major drugs, most notably Dupixent (dupilumab), developed in partnership with Sanofi, which became one of the world's top-selling drugs by treating atopic dermatitis, asthma, and other inflammatory conditions through IL-4/IL-13 pathway inhibition. Regeneron also played a significant role in the COVID-19 pandemic, developing the antibody cocktail REGEN-COV, which received emergency use authorization and generated substantial revenue before being deauthorized as variants emerged. The company maintained its science-first culture, expanded its R&D operations, and continued to avoid major acquisitions while growing into one of the world's largest and most successful biotechnology companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction about science-first approach**: The article strongly implies that prioritizing science over commercial hype would lead to sustainable success. This proved accurate—Regeneron's continued focus on internal R&D and scientific discovery resulted in multiple blockbuster drugs and significant company growth.

• **Implicit rejection of "blockbusters are made" philosophy**: Schleifer's dismissal of the commercial-focused model as the primary driver of drug success. The subsequent decade showed that while marketing and commercialization matter, Regeneron's scientific foundation consistently delivered clinically and commercially successful products, validating their approach.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important moment in biotech history and showcases a successful counter-narrative to acquisition-driven growth strategies, with Regeneron's subsequent success making the piece more insightful in retrospect.

## 5. ANALYSIS
The article presents a compelling case study in biotech strategy. Schleifer's "science, science, science" philosophy was not just rhetoric—Regeneron's subsequent success with Eylea, Dupixent, and other therapies demonstrated that deep scientific understanding and internal R&D capabilities could drive both innovation and commercial success. The contrast between Regeneron's organic growth and the industry's acquisition-hungry approach highlighted a meaningful strategic divergence. While some companies thrived through business development and M&A, Regeneron proved that sustained investment in fundamental research and scientific talent could produce a durable competitive advantage. The company's trajectory post-2013 validated the article's implicit thesis about the long-term value of science-first biotech strategy.
