# Crestor: Risks Up, Risks Down (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses AstraZeneca's JUPITER trial results for Crestor (rosuvastatin), which showed that the statin reduced cardiovascular events in patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels despite having reasonable cholesterol numbers. The trial demonstrated a relative risk reduction from 1.8% (placebo) to 0.9% (Crestor), meaning 120 patients needed treatment for 1.9 years to prevent one cardiovascular event.

The author raises concerns about whether this absolute risk benefit justifies expanding treatment to a wider patient population, considering costs and side effects (including a statistically significant increase in diabetic symptoms). The article contrasts how society evaluates risk differently when a drug causes harm versus when it fails to provide benefit, using Vioxx's withdrawal as an example where cardiovascular risks (at similar statistical levels) led to market removal.

## 2. HISTORY

The JUPITER trial proved pivotal for Crestor's commercial success. The FDA approved an expanded indication for Crestor in February 2010 based on JUPITER data, allowing use in individuals with normal cholesterol but elevated C-reactive protein levels. This significantly expanded the eligible patient population.

Crestor became one of the world's top-selling statins, generating billions in annual revenue for AstraZeneca. However, the drug faced increasing generic competition, particularly after its patent expired in the US in 2016 (various countries had different expiration dates). Generic rosuvastatin became widely available at substantially lower cost.

Clinical practice evolved to incorporate inflammation markers alongside traditional lipid panels in cardiovascular risk assessment. The concept of treating residual inflammatory risk became more established. Other statins, including atorvastatin (Lipitor), demonstrated similar pleiotropic effects beyond cholesterol reduction.

Long-term follow-up studies and real-world evidence generally reinforced statin benefits but also highlighted the importance of individualized risk assessment, especially considering the diabetes risk that emerged as a consistent concern across statin trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "That's going to be enough, all by itself, to expand the market for Crestor (and probably the other statins as well)"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ CORRECT. The FDA did approve the expanded indication, and statins remained the cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention. However, the broader market expansion happened differently than expected—rather than a major surge in statin prescriptions overall, the impact was more nuanced with increased focus on risk stratification.

**Prediction: "The question is whether the others will have the same effect. You'd think so, especially a similar strong one like Lipitor"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ CORRECT in principle about class effects, ✓ CORRECT that Lipitor and other statins showed similar pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects in subsequent studies. However, ⚠️ INCORRECT in underestimating regulatory complexity—only Crestor obtained the specific FDA-approved indication based on C-reactive protein reduction because they were the ones who conducted and funded the large outcome trial.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**
The article correctly identified a consequential shift in cardiovascular disease prevention and raised important questions about risk-benefit assessment that remain relevant in evidence-based medicine debates.
