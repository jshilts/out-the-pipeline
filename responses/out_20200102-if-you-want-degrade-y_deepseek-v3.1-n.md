# If You Want to Degrade, You Have to Get In the Door (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a UNC research paper that applied a "chloroalkane penetration assay" (CAPA) to study cell permeability of targeted protein degraders. The article focuses on MZ1, a well-known BRD4 degrader that uses the JQ1 ligand for BRD4 and a VHL ligand for E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment. 

The key finding was that while the JQ1 component alone showed excellent cell permeability, the full MZ1 degrader molecule was over 100,000 times less permeable. However, Western blot analysis revealed that despite this dramatically reduced permeability, ct-tagged MZ1 remained just as effective at degrading BRD4 protein. This demonstrated that degraders are catalytic—very little material needs to enter cells to achieve effective protein degradation. The article also noted discrepancies between the CAPA results and traditional Caco-2 permeability assays, highlighting ongoing challenges in understanding and predicting cell membrane permeability.

## 2. HISTORY

Targeted protein degradation has seen significant advancement since 2020, with major clinical and commercial developments:

**Clinical Progress:** Multiple degrader programs advanced to clinical trials. Notably, Arvinas's ARV-110 (targeting androgen receptor for prostate cancer) and ARV-471 (targeting estrogen receptor for breast cancer) progressed through Phase 2 trials, though ARV-110 was discontinued in 2021 after failing to meet efficacy endpoints. ARV-471 continued development with promising early results.

**Regulatory Milestone:** In 2023, the field achieved its first FDA approval with nirogacestat, though not strictly a degrader in the traditional bifunctional sense. More relevant to the article's focus, the first bifunctional degrader (ARV-110) reached Phase 2 but faced efficacy challenges, demonstrating that permeability isn't the only barrier—target selection and ternary complex formation remain critical.

**Scientific Understanding:** Research continued revealing the complexity of degrader optimization. Studies showed that linker composition, E3 ligase selection, and ternary complex geometry substantially impact efficacy beyond simple permeability considerations. The "degrader efficiency paradox" observed in the article (low permeability but high efficacy) became recognized as a general feature of catalytic degraders.

**Corporate Landscape:** The field saw significant investment and maturation. Major pharma companies (Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche) entered partnerships or acquisitions, with Pfizer's $2.3 billion acquisition of Trillium Therapeutics in 2021 reflecting broader interest in protein regulation approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions and observations about the field's trajectory:

• **Prediction: Cell permeability would remain a complex, incompletely understood challenge requiring better tools**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. The field continued struggling with permeability prediction, though new assays and computational approaches emerged. The fundamental challenge highlighted—that we don't fully understand membrane crossing despite decades of research—remained largely true.

• **Prediction: Targeted protein degradation would become clinically validated**
  - **Outcome:** Mostly accurate. While no bifunctional degrader achieved full FDA approval by early 2024, multiple candidates reached advanced clinical stages with ARV-471 showing particular promise. The field's scientific validity was firmly established.

• **Implication: Understanding ternary complex formation would be more critical than simple permeability optimization**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. Subsequent research consistently showed that productive complex formation, E3 ligase engagement, and ubiquitination efficiency often outweigh permeability considerations. The catalytic nature of degraders meant that getting "enough" material inside matters more than getting "lots" inside.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article scores highly because it identified and clearly articulated a fundamental paradox in degrader development that became increasingly relevant as the field matured. The insight about catalytic activity versus permeability captured an important principle that influenced subsequent degrader design strategies, even if the specific CAPA technique didn't become universally adopted.
