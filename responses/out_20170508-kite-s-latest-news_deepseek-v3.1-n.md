# Kite's Latest News (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief May 2017 commentary discusses a patient death in Kite Pharma's CAR-T cell therapy trial, involving multiple organ failure followed by cerebral edema. The article notes that this follows similar problems at competitor Juno Therapeutics the previous year, creating a "jumpy" atmosphere among researchers and investors in the CAR-T field. The author characterizes CAR-T therapy as having extraordinary potential—pulling some patients "practically out of the grave"—but highlights the significant challenge posed by individual variability in immune responses. Patient outcomes range from life-saving to rapidly fatal, with insufficient ability to predict which result will occur. The piece closes with criticism of "immune-boosting" supplements, noting that a boosted immune system isn't desirable for most people.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article's publication in May 2017, Kite Pharma achieved a landmark success: **Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel)** received **FDA approval in October 2017** for treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. This made it the second CAR-T therapy approved in the US, following Novartis's Kymriah (approved August 2017).

**Clinical uptake and expansion:** Yescarta demonstrated real-world effectiveness, leading to **broad adoption** in hematologic oncology practice. The FDA subsequently expanded its indications, and by 2024 Yescarta had become a **blockbuster drug** with annual sales exceeding $1 billion.

**Corporate changes:** In **August 2017** (just months after this article), **Gilead Sciences acquired Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion**, validating the commercial potential despite safety concerns. The acquisition was finalized in October 2017, coinciding with Yescarta's approval.

**Safety improvements:** Subsequent years saw development of better toxicity management protocols, particularly for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), helping mitigate the cerebral edema and organ failure risks highlighted in the article.

**Juno's fate:** The competitor mentioned in the article, Juno Therapeutics, saw its CAR-T program delayed by safety concerns but was ultimately **acquired by Celgene in 2018 for $9 billion**. Their lead candidate eventually gained FDA approval as Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel) in 2021.

The CAR-T field evolved into a **mature therapeutic modality** with multiple approved products and a growing pipeline targeting various hematologic malignancies and, increasingly, solid tumors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction (explicit):** The article anticipated that the field would "need to have a better handle on how individuals will react to the engineered T cells" because of high variability in patient responses.

• **Outcome: PARTIALLY CORRECT** - The field did develop better toxicity management protocols and gained understanding of factors predicting response and toxicity, but **individual variability remains a significant clinical challenge**. Response prediction has improved through biomarkers and patient selection criteria, but perfect prediction remains elusive, and serious adverse events still occur despite advances.

**Implicit prediction:** The jumpy market sentiment and negative investor reaction would continue given safety concerns.

• **Outcome: INCORRECT** - Despite the safety concerns highlighted in May 2017, **Kite was acquired for $11.9 billion just three months later**, and the CAR-T market proved highly attractive to investors. By 2024, the global CAR-T market exceeded $3 billion annually with multiple blockbuster products.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in CAR-T therapy development—the tension between extraordinary efficacy and serious safety concerns at the precise time when regulatory approval was imminent. The Kite patient death in May 2017 could have derailed the field, but instead it preceded the most important year in CAR-T history (2017 saw two FDA approvals and a major acquisition). The article's context makes it historically significant, though its forward-looking analysis was too pessimistic relative to how quickly the field would mature.
