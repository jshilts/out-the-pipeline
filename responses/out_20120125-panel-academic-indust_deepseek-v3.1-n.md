# Panel on Academic-Industrial Collaboration in Drug Discovery (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief Science Magazine blog post from January 2012 announced an upcoming panel discussion titled "Bridging the Valley of Death" at the SLAS2012 conference in San Diego, focused on academic-industrial collaboration in drug discovery. The panel was moderated by Bill Janzen (UNC) and Michelle Palmer (Broad Institute), featuring panelists from academia (John Luk from National University of Singapore, Rudy Juliano from UNC, John Reed from Sanford-Burnham), and pharmaceutical industry (Mao Mao from Pfizer, Alan Palkowitz from Eli Lilly).

The author, Derek Lowe, solicited questions from readers for this panel, noting that the discussion would be live-streamed and questions would be gathered through social media. The post framed the central challenge as overcoming the "Valley of Death" - the gap between academic research discoveries and their translation into commercially viable drug development programs.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2012 saw significant evolution in academic-industrial drug discovery collaborations, though many fundamental challenges persisted:

**Institutional Developments:**
- **NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences)**: Established in 2011, gained momentum post-2012 with programs like the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) and Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) to address the "Valley of Death"
- **Academic drug discovery centers proliferated**: Universities like UNC, UCSF, Harvard, and others expanded dedicated drug discovery institutes with industry-style capabilities
- **New collaboration models**: Public-private partnerships like the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP, launched 2014) brought together NIH, industry, and nonprofits

**Pfizer's trajectory**: The company underwent significant restructuring, closing several R&D sites including their La Jolla facility (where Mao Mao was based) in 2014, reflecting industry-wide shifts toward external innovation and academic partnerships rather than solely internal discovery

**Industry-wide shifts**:
- Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly relied on external innovation through academic collaborations, biotech partnerships, and licensing deals
- Venture philanthropy models emerged (e.g., Michael J. Fox Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation) that successfully bridged academic research and drug development
- The biotech sector exploded with startup companies often founded on academic discoveries, leading to successful IPOs and acquisitions

**Scientific advances**: The 2012-2020 period saw breakthroughs in gene therapy, immunotherapy (CAR-T cells approved 2017), CRISPR technology, and RNA therapeutics that often originated from academic labs but required industrial partnerships for development

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article didn't contain explicit predictions but rather framed ongoing challenges. The panel discussion's framing of the "Valley of Death" represented an implicit prediction that this gap would remain a critical bottleneck requiring dedicated intervention strategies.

If evaluated against subsequent developments:
- The **"Valley of Death" problem persisted** but new institutional mechanisms (NCATS, academic drug discovery centers, venture philanthropy) emerged to address it
- **Academic-industrial collaboration models evolved** beyond simple licensing to include co-development, shared risk, and integrated partnerships
- **Industry did increasingly "bridge the valley"** through strategic partnerships, though often via startup intermediaries rather than direct academic partnerships

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the topic of academic-industrial collaboration is important, this particular article was primarily an announcement/solicitation for questions rather than substantive analysis or commentary, limiting its lasting value as historical document for hindsight analysis.
