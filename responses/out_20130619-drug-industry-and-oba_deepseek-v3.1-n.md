# The Drug Industry and the Obama Administration (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This June 2013 commentary responds to a Forbes article by John Osborne describing the Obama administration's apparent misconceptions about pharmaceutical industry. The article argues that administration officials held a persistent "NIH and universities discover all the drugs" mindset, failing to recognize industry's essential role in conducting expensive large-scale clinical trials and regulatory approval despite spending nearly double NIH's $30 billion budget. The author provides extensive links to his prior posts defending industry's contribution to drug development.

The piece also discusses political tensions, particularly that the drug industry's continued profitability during the economic downturn generated suspicion. A central issue involves the $80 billion deal Billy Tauzin negotiated in 2009 where PhRMA agreed to support the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in exchange for the administration resisting further price controls or concessions. The author expresses concern that the White House might demand additional "installment payments" beyond this original agreement, particularly regarding Medicare Part D rebates that the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction panel had recommended.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent years after this June 2013 article reveal several important developments in pharmaceutical policy and industry-government relations:

**Affordable Care Act Implementation and Drug Costs**: The ACA continued implementation, and by 2015 concerns about rising drug prices intensified significantly. The issue became prominent during the 2016 presidential campaign, with both Democratic candidates and Donald Trump criticizing pharmaceutical pricing practices.

**Medicare Part D Rebates**: The Trump administration made several attempts to address drug pricing through regulatory changes, including proposed rules that would have restructured Medicare Part D rebates, though these faced legal challenges and implementation delays.

**Industry Profitability and Public Perception**: The pharmaceutical industry faced increasing public scrutiny in subsequent years, particularly over drug pricing controversies like the Martin Shkreli/Turing Pharmaceuticals case (2015), Mylan's EpiPen pricing (2016), and various insulin pricing issues that drew Congressional hearings.

**21st Century Cures Act (2016)**: This bipartisan legislation aimed to accelerate drug development and approval processes, providing some balance to the industry-government relationship by streamlining FDA processes and increasing NIH funding.

**CARES Act and COVID Response**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry played a crucial role in Operation Warp Speed, leading to rapid development and approval of vaccines and therapeutics. This temporarily improved the industry's public image but also sparked debates about intellectual property rights and global access.

**Inflation Reduction Act (2022)**: This landmark legislation included provisions allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, representing the most significant change to pharmaceutical pricing policy in decades.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"The administration will likely demand additional installment payments beyond the original $80 billion ACA deal"**: While the Trump administration did not honor the spirit of this deal and pursued different types of pharmaceutical concessions, the **Inflation Reduction Act of 2022** eventually implemented much more substantial changes than the original $80 billion agreement, including Medicare drug price negotiation provisions.

- **"Medicare Part D rebates would become a continued policy target"**: **Correct**. Various administrations continued pursuing changes to Medicare Part D rebates through different mechanisms, with Trump's proposed rebate rule changes and ultimately Biden's Inflation Reduction Act significantly restructuring Medicare drug benefits.

- **"The perception that NIH discovers all drugs while industry merely commercializes would persist in policy discussions"**: **Partially accurate**. The industry did face continued policy challenges and public skepticism, particularly around pricing issues, though Operation Warp Speed during COVID-19 temporarily highlighted industry's drug development capabilities.

- **"Deals like the Tauzin agreement would be subject to re-negotiation when politically convenient"**: **Accurate**. The original ACA framework was repeatedly challenged, and by 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act fundamentally altered parts of the pharmaceutical policy landscape beyond what was envisioned in 2009-2010.

- **"The industry's perceived lack of friends in the Obama administration would continue"**: **Accurate for Obama's second term, but changing with subsequent administrations**. The Trump administration had a complex relationship (criticizing high prices but promoting deregulation), while the Biden administration has been more overtly critical and implemented substantial policy changes through the Inflation Reduction Act.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important ongoing tension in U.S. healthcare policy between government, academia, and industry roles in drug development, but focuses primarily on a specific political moment rather than fundamental scientific or medical advances.
