# How Not to Invest in Biopharma (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses retail investors who apparently invested their life savings into Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, a small biotech stock, based on rumors and speculation. When the investment performed poorly, these investors directed their anger at financial journalist Adam Feuerstein, who had published critical analysis of the company's prospects.

The piece characterizes this behavior as reckless speculation equivalent to "hold my beer" stunts, suggesting that investing serious money in highly speculative biotech stocks based on rumors is fundamentally unsound. The context involves Provectus's skin cancer drug development program and the speculative trading dynamics surrounding clinical-stage biopharma companies.

## 2. HISTORY
The Provectus story played out as a cautionary tale about biotech speculation:

- **Clinical Development**: Provectus's lead drug PV-10 (rose bengal), being developed for melanoma and other cancers, failed to gain FDA approval. The drug showed some promise in early trials but ultimately did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy in larger studies.

- **FDA Proceedings**: In 2015-2016, the FDA required additional clinical data before considering approval. The company struggled with trial design and enrollment challenges, typical problems for small biotech firms with limited resources.

- **Stock Performance**: Provectus's stock (ticker: PVCT) experienced extreme volatility. After trading at speculative highs around $3-4 in early 2014 during the peak of retail investor enthusiasm, it declined significantly, eventually trading in pennies by the late 2010s. The company underwent reverse stock splits to maintain exchange listings.

- **Business Outcomes**: Provectus continued as a development-stage company for years but never achieved profitability or drug approval. The company faced numerous securities-related issues and investor lawsuits over disclosure practices and failed partnership deals.

- **Wider Biopharma Context**: This period (2014-2020) saw a biotech boom-bust cycle. The broader industry experienced both remarkable successes (CAR-T therapies, checkpoint inhibitors) and numerous failures, particularly among small-cap companies without proven platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made implicit predictions through its cautionary tone:

- **Biotech speculation based on rumors ends badly**: This prediction proved accurate. Small-cap biotech stocks, especially those without significant institutional backing or scientific validation, remained highly risky investments.

- **The importance of regulatory validation over hype**: This was validated. Over the subsequent decade, FDA approval became an even more critical filter, with companies facing increasing scrutiny over trial design, endpoints, and manufacturing standards.

- **The continuing role of experienced biotech analysts**: This proved prescient. Adam Feuerstein continued his work (moving to STAT News), and the biotech sector remained complex enough that expert analysis retained significant value in separating promising science from hype.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**

This article ranks in the middle decile of interest – while it addressed a recurring theme in biopharma investment, it focused more on investor behavior than scientific or policy developments with lasting impact on the field.
