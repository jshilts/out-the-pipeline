# A Quasicrystal Nobel Prize (October 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article celebrates the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Dan Shechtman for the discovery of quasicrystals—solid materials that display “forbidden” five‑fold rotational symmetry.  The author explains why such symmetry was thought impossible in ordinary crystals, recounts the controversy sparked when Shechtman reported the first metallic quasicrystal in the early 1980s, and notes the opposition from Linus Pauling.  The piece also points out that the mathematical ideas behind quasicrystals were already known from Penrose tilings and medieval Islamic art.  Finally, the author argues that, despite the fascinating physics, quasicrystals have not yet made a noticeable impact on everyday life.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Scientific progress (2011‑2024)**  
* **Continued discovery of new quasicrystalline phases.**  Since the Nobel award, dozens of synthetic alloys (e.g., Al‑Pd‑Mn, Al‑Cu‑Fe, Ti‑Zr‑Ni) and several natural quasicrystals have been identified.  The first natural quasicrystal, icosahedrite (Al₆₃Cu₂₄Fe₁₃), was reported in a 2009 meteorite; subsequent finds in the Khatyrka meteorite (2011) and in a Russian mineral (2015) confirmed that quasicrystals can form in nature.  

* **Materials‑property research.**  Researchers have demonstrated that quasicrystals can exhibit low friction, high hardness, and unusual electronic/thermal transport.  These traits have motivated niche applications such as wear‑resistant coatings for aerospace components, non‑stick cookware surfaces, and thermoelectric materials.  Commercial uptake remains limited; the most widely marketed product is a quasicrystalline coating (e.g., “Al‑Cu‑Fe‑based” coating) used in some high‑performance bearings, but sales volumes are modest.  

* **Photonic and metamaterial engineering.**  The aperiodic order of quasicrystals has been exploited to fabricate photonic quasicrystals that control light in ways impossible with periodic photonic crystals.  Demonstrations include broadband omnidirectional reflectors and waveguides, but these remain largely in research labs rather than mass‑produced devices.  

* **Theoretical advances.**  Higher‑dimensional crystallography, which underpinned the original explanation, has been refined and applied to soft‑matter systems (e.g., block‑copolymer self‑assembly) and to the design of quasicrystalline topological insulators.  The field has grown steadily, with the number of peer‑reviewed papers on quasicrystals roughly doubling between 2011 and 2023.  

**Impact on the broader scientific community**  
* The Nobel prize dramatically raised the profile of a once‑controversial field.  Funding agencies (e.g., NSF, DOE) added dedicated programs for aperiodic materials, and several university groups established “quasicrystal” research labs.  

* The controversy surrounding Pauling’s opposition faded after his death in 1994; the article’s claim that U.S. crystallographers avoided the field “because of Pauling’s influence” is now seen as historically accurate for the 1980s‑early 1990s but no longer relevant.  

**Policy and industry**  
* No major regulatory changes or large‑scale industrial standards have been introduced specifically for quasicrystals.  Their niche status means they are treated like any other alloy under existing safety and environmental regulations.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“No effect on anyone’s daily life”** – the author doubts any practical impact. | Partially true.  Quasicrystals have entered a few specialized products (wear‑resistant coatings, niche cookware, some thermoelectric modules), but they are not part of mainstream consumer goods.  The overall daily‑life impact remains minimal. |
| **U.S. crystallographers avoided the field because of Pauling’s influence.** | Historically accurate for the 1980s‑early 1990s; after Pauling’s death and the Nobel award, U.S. groups actively entered the field, publishing many high‑impact papers. |
| **The Nobel prize would legitimize the field and spur further research.** | Correct.  Post‑2011, the number of publications, conferences, and funded projects on quasicrystals increased markedly. |
| **Quasicrystals would remain a scientific curiosity with “odd properties.”** | Largely correct.  Their properties are indeed unusual, and while they have inspired new concepts (photonic quasicrystals, topological phases), they have not become a mainstream technology. |
| **Potential political controversy (e.g., claims of Iranian anticipation).** | No significant political controversy materialized; the discussion stayed within scientific circles. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when a once‑controversial discovery received the highest scientific honor, and the subsequent decade has shown both genuine scientific progress and limited commercial translation, making it highly interesting for the history of science and materials research.
