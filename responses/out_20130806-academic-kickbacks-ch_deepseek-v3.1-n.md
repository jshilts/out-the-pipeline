# Academic Kickbacks in China? (Aug 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" discusses a letter from Stanford emeritus professor James Collmann published in C&E News, which raised allegations that obtaining large research grants in China required illegal cash kickbacks to officials at granting agencies. The author treats these claims as plausible, drawing parallels to corruption patterns he observed in US politics (Arkansas, Illinois, and other states), emphasizing that corruption exists on different scales and frequencies across countries but follows similar patterns. Lowe also frames this issue by contrasting it with legitimate university overhead systems in US academia, where institutions take a substantial percentage off grant money for administrative costs and other approved uses, while noting that US overhead arrangements are explicit and institutional rather than covert payments to individuals. The post invites readers to share their own experiences or assessments of these claims.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2013 article, China's research integrity landscape has seen documented progress mixed with ongoing challenges:

**Systemic Improvements (2013-2022):**
- China significantly increased research funding through programs like the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and Ministry of Science and Technology grants, with more transparent application and review processes.
- The central government launched anti-corruption campaigns that extended to academic and research funding channels, particularly after 2015.
- Publication ethics infrastructure was strengthened through institutional review boards and collaboration with international standards.

**Continued Problems:**
- Continuing high-profile retractions from Chinese institutions, including organized paper mills and fraudulent peer review rings over 2014-2020, suggested systemic integrity challenges despite funding system reforms.
- Transparency International's corruption perception indices continued to show China performing below top-tier countries, with academic sectors reflecting broader governance patterns.
- Human resources studies through the 2010s consistently showed the largest portion of Chinese returnee scientists' work time was consumed by grant applications and bureaucratic processes rather than research itself.

**US Context Comparison:**
The overhead system Lowe mentioned became even more institutionalized, with top US universities taking 50-70% overhead rates by 2020, remaining fully legitimate and transparent within federal guidelines. However, occasional cases like the 2015 case at Columbia University, where overhead funds were improperly used, showed that even transparent systems require ongoing scrutiny.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was primarily descriptive rather than predictive, but its underlying implications can be evaluated:

- **Implicit assumption: Cultural universality of corruption patterns** - The author's comparison of Chinese grant practices to US political corruption suggested similar fundamental dynamics across systems. This has proven broadly accurate, but China's subsequent intensive anti-corruption campaigns have demonstrated that systemic interventions can alter baseline corruption levels, even if they don't eliminate them completely.

- **Implicit assumption: Transparency as key differentiator** - The article contrasted China's alleged kickback system with the US's explicit overhead arrangements as more legitimate due to transparency. This distinction has remained generally valid because transparency enables accountability, but the high overhead percentages (60-70% at top universities) have continued to draw criticism for reducing funds reaching actual research.

The article did not make specific falsifiable predictions, instead offering a framework for understanding corruption's role in grant systems.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article highlights a persistent structural issue - resource allocation integrity - in research ecosystems worldwide, using a transnational comparison that remains policy-relevant today. However, as a blog post based on anecdote rather than systematic research, it has limited empirical depth compared to formal studies of grant allocation ethics or academic corruption.

## 5. ANALYSIS

This piece marked an important moment in public discussions about research funding ethics and the globalization of science. Its timing coincided with the dramatic expansion of China's R&D spending (which tripled from 2010 to 2020) and the corresponding debate about how this growth could either improve or corrupt scientific practices.

Lowe's reluctance to cite specific evidence ("never applied for a grant in China") appropriately tempered his claims, and framing corruption as "differences in degree" avoided the problematic assumption that such practices were uniquely Chinese. However, as a jumping-off point for deeper analysis, the article succeeded, as indicated by significant reader engagement at the time.

The perspective that university overhead systems represent an institutionalized form of grant-based resource capture also provided a thought-provoking comparison for considering different corruption formalization levels across research systems.
