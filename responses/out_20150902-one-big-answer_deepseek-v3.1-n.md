# That One Big Answer (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary by Derek Lowe discusses the "foxes-and-hedgehogs" dichotomy in drug discovery, drawing on Isaiah Berlin's concept that foxes know many things while hedgehogs know one big thing. Lowe argues that drug discovery is inherently multifactorial and complex, yet has repeatedly fallen victim to "hedgehog thinking" - the tendency to embrace single Big Ideas as universal solutions. 

He cites examples of such Big Ideas that permeated drug discovery over the previous three decades: structure-based design, molecular modeling, high-throughput screening (HTS), combinatorial chemistry, diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS), and the Rule-of-5. Lowe contends that these concepts, while valuable within their proper domains, were often hyped beyond their actual applicability by their originators or by management seeking simple strategies. He identifies management as particularly vulnerable to this "This Explains Everything" syndrome because single-factor solutions present as easy-to-grasp strategies. The commentary warns against expecting single-factor solutions to solve multifactorial problems and notes how skeptics of these approaches are often dismissed as lacking vision.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2015, the pattern Lowe identified has both continued and evolved. Several trends emerged that reflect both the persistence of hedgehog thinking and the growing recognition of complexity:

**Continued Big Ideas:** The industry saw new candidates for "hedgehog" approaches emerge, particularly artificial intelligence and machine learning in drug discovery. Companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, and Insilico Medicine promoted AI-driven drug design as transformative, with mixed but generally incremental results. While AI has found genuine utility in specific applications, early claims of revolutionary impact largely mirrored the hype cycles Lowe described.

**Clinical Reality:** The fundamental challenge of drug discovery - high failure rates in clinical trials - persisted. Between 2015-2024, drug development success rates remained stubbornly low, with roughly 90% of drugs failing in clinical trials. This reinforced Lowe's point about multifactorial complexity: even with better tools, biological systems proved resistant to single-factor solutions.

**Rule-of-5 Evolution:** The Rule-of-5 itself evolved, with researchers recognizing more exceptions and nuances. The pharmaceutical industry increasingly accepted that while the rule provided useful heuristics, successful drugs often violated these guidelines, supporting Lowe's argument about bounded applicability.

**Business Outcomes:** Companies that built strategies around single technological approaches often struggled. Combinatorial chemistry platforms from the 1990s-2000s largely failed to deliver the promised productivity gains. Similarly, while HTS became standard practice, it didn't solve the fundamental challenges of identifying viable drug candidates.

**Scientific Recognition:** The broader scientific community showed growing acknowledgment of biological complexity, with systems biology and network approaches gaining traction, aligning with Lowe's "fox" perspective that multiple factors must be considered simultaneously.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The commentary contains implicit rather than explicit predictions:

• **That single-factor solutions would continue to disappoint in multifactorial drug discovery**: ✓ **Accurate**. The period 2015-2024 showed continued struggles with drug development productivity and the limitations of silver-bullet approaches.

• **That management would remain vulnerable to "This Explains Everything" thinking**: ✓ **Accurate**. The emergence of AI/machine learning as the latest "big idea" in drug discovery demonstrated continued susceptibility to overarching solutions, with companies and investors often promoting AI as transformational rather than as another tool with specific applications.

• **That hedgehog thinking would persist despite evidence of complexity**: ✓ **Accurate**. The pattern repeated with new technologies, suggesting the underlying cognitive and organizational drivers remained.

• **Implicitly, that approaches acknowledging complexity would be more fruitful**: △ **Partially accurate**. Systems approaches gained recognition, but drug discovery remained difficult regardless of philosophy, suggesting both foxes and hedgehogs face fundamental biological challenges.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a persistent, important dynamic in pharmaceutical R&D with broad applicability to complex systems thinking. The fox-vs-hedgehog framework provides lasting analytical value for understanding technology hype cycles.
