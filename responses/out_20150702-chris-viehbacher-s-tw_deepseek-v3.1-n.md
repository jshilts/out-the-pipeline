# Chris Viehbacher's Two Billion Dollars (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

Chris Viehbacher, former CEO of Sanofi, announced he was launching a $2 billion biotech fund that would both found new companies and look beyond trendy fields like oncology to find value. Viehbacher argued that "truly disruptive thinking" cannot happen inside large organizations, comparing Big Pharma to old Hollywood studios that maintained fixed infrastructure, whereas modern studios operate as lean, project-based entities. He advocated that biopharma value comes from specialization and avoiding fixed costs. The article author generally agreed that large company inertia stifles disruptive innovation, but disagreed with Viehbacher's earlier comments that innovative people don't work at large companies, noting that good people exist within big organizations even if their ideas face structural headwinds.

## 2. HISTORY

**Viehbacher's Post-2015 Trajectory:** The $2 billion fund referenced in the article was Gurnet Point Capital, which Viehbacher co-founded. By 2016-2018, Gurnet Point made several investments in companies including precision medicine startup Thrive Earlier Detection (founded 2019), though the firm maintained a relatively low public profile compared to some venture funds. 

**Industry Structure Evolution (2015-2025):** The outsourcing and "virtual company" model Viehbacher championed continued to gain momentum. In 2024-2025, several major "billion-dollar exits" and acquisitions involved lean biotechs, including Merck's $1.3 billion acquisition of Eyebiotech (October 2024), Cellares' $355 million Series D (2024), and Novo Nordisk's $1.3 billion acquisition of Cardior (March 2024). These transactions supported the thesis that value can be created efficiently outside large pharma. However, contrary to the "freelancer" prediction, the biotech workforce remained predominantly traditional employment-based. CROs did see substantial growth, but the model remained hybrid rather than fully virtualized.

**Big Pharma R&D Productivity:** The notion that large organizations can't innovate was challenged by significant in-house successes. Moderna developed mRNA vaccines within a large company structure and achieved one of the fastest vaccine development timelines in history during COVID-19. Merck's KEYTRUDA franchise, largely developed internally, became one of the world's best-selling drugs.

**Clinical Trial Reality:** The article's characterization of "binary events" was prescient but incomplete. While trial failures remained common post-2015 (e.g., Alzheimer's drug failures by Roche, Eli Lilly, and Merck in subsequent years), the industry did not see fundamental structural changes to reduce this variability. Regulatory approaches did adapt—e.g., accelerated approvals expanded—but the high-risk nature of biopharma persisted.

**Investment Dynamics:** VC funding grew substantially post-2015, peaking around 2021, but remained cyclical. 2022-2023 saw a significant downturn, then rebounded partially in 2024. Oncology continued to dominate investment despite Viehbacher's call to look elsewhere, though rare diseases and gene therapy did emerge as major investment categories.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

* **Prediction:** "You can't have truly disruptive thinking inside big organizations" and innovation requires going outside Big Pharma's walls.
  - **Outcome:** **Mixed.** While numerous breakthrough innovations emerged from small biotechs (CRISPR therapeutics, CAR-T cells, gene therapies), major innovations also came from within large companies, including mRNA vaccines (Moderna) and revolutionary immunotherapies (Merck's KEYTRUDA). Big Pharma demonstrated it could innovate under crisis conditions.

* **Prediction:** The industry will move toward a project-based freelance model like modern Hollywood studios, with specialization reducing fixed costs.
  - **Outcome:** **Partially incorrect.** An ecosystem of CROs and specialized service providers did grow, enabling leaner biotechs. However, the workforce remained largely employment-based rather than freelance, and many successful companies still maintained substantial in-house infrastructure. The model evolved toward hybrid approaches rather than radical decentralization.

* **Prediction:** Value in biopharma will come from avoiding "red-hot fields like oncology" to find less competitive opportunities.
  - **Outcome:** **Incorrect.** Oncology has remained by far the largest therapeutic area for investment, approvals, and revenue through 2024. Therapeutic areas like rare diseases and gene therapy also grew substantially, but oncology retained its central position with massive commercial successes like KEYTRUDA, OPDIVO, TECENTRIQ, and others. 

* **Prediction (Implicit):** The biopharma industry is becoming increasingly unpredictable and nerve-wracking, with too many binary outcomes for job security to be realistic.
  - **Outcome:** **Accurate.** High attrition rates for clinical trials, persistent FDA approval unpredictability, and market volatility characterized the 2015-2025 period. The 2022-2024 sector downturn resulted in substantial layoffs across the industry, validating the job insecurity prediction.

* **Prediction:** Fixed costs are the enemy of value creation in biopharma.
  - **Outcome:** **Overgeneralized.** While lean biotechs demonstrated value creation, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the limitations of entirely virtual models—the companies with infrastructure like Moderna could rapidly scale manufacturing. Fixed costs in manufacturing became an advantage during the vaccine rollout, and subsequent supply chain challenges reinforced the value of integrated capabilities.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article anticipated important structural debates about biotech financing and organizational efficiency that remained highly relevant over the subsequent decade, though it oversimplified the innovation capacity of large organizations.
