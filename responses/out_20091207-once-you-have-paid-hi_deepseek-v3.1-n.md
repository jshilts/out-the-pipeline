# Once You Have Paid Him the Danegeld. . . (Dec 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article uses Rudyard Kipling's poem "Danegeld" as a metaphorical framework to comment on the biotechnology industry, specifically referencing a contemporary news story about Danish pharmaceutical company Genmab and its relationship with larger partners. The poem's central message—that paying tribute (Danegeld) to invaders only leads to more demands—appears to be applied to the dynamics between smaller biotech companies and larger pharmaceutical partners.

Based on the ABC News reference about Genmab, the article likely discussed how smaller biotech firms face pressure to make concessions to larger partners, potentially compromising long-term independence for short-term survival. The Kipling reference suggests the piece warned against a pattern where initial compromises lead to increasingly unfavorable terms over time.

## 2. HISTORY

**Genmab's trajectory post-2009:**
- In December 2009, Genmab faced significant financial challenges and was restructuring after its lead antibody drug candidate showed disappointing results
- The company successfully restructured and shifted focus to other candidates, notably daratumumab (Darzalex)
- Darzalex received FDA approval in 2015 for multiple myeloma and became a blockbuster drug, generating revenues over $6 billion annually by 2021
- Genmab maintained relative independence despite partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, creating a more sustainable business model
- The company expanded into bispecific antibodies and other formats, maintaining its position as an innovative antibody company

**Broader biotech-pharma relationship patterns (2009-2024):**
- The industry saw continued consolidation with large pharma acquiring biotech companies at various stages
- Partnership models evolved to include more flexible structures (option-based deals, profit-sharing arrangements)
- Many biotech companies successfully leveraged partnerships to fund development while maintaining some independence
- The "Danegeld" concern—being trapped in unfavorable partnerships—remained relevant, though outcomes varied significantly by company strategy and negotiation position

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions based on the Danegeld metaphor:

• **Prediction: Continued demands after initial concessions**
  - **Reality:** Mixed outcomes. While some companies did face increasingly unfavorable terms, others like Genmab successfully navigated partnerships and achieved long-term success

• **Prediction: Loss of independence for smaller biotechs**
  - **Reality:** Context-dependent. Many biotechs were acquired, but others maintained independence through strategic financing and pipeline management. Companies like Moderna (founded 2010) achieved massive scale while remaining independent

• **Prediction: Unfavorable dynamics in biotech-pharma relationships**
  - **Reality:** Valid concern that persisted. However, market dynamics evolved with more sophisticated partnership structures and alternative financing options (venture capital growth, public markets) reducing purely extractive relationships

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addressed a real and persistent tension in biotech-pharma relationships using an apt historical metaphor. While it didn't predict the specific successful outcomes (like Genmab's recovery), the core concern about partnership power dynamics remained relevant, making it moderately interesting for understanding industry structure.
