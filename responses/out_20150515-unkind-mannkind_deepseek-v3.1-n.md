# Unkind to Mannkind (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article from May 2015 discusses Mannkind's inhaled insulin product Afrezza, which had recently launched through a partnership with Sanofi. The author expresses skepticism about Afrezza's commercial prospects, comparing it to Pfizer's earlier inhaled insulin product Exubera, which failed commercially in 2007. The article cites prescription data suggesting weak market adoption of Afrezza, and questions whether there is sufficient demand for inhaled insulin as an alternative to injectable insulin. The author had previously been critical of Mannkind and notes the company's unusual retail investor following.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Afrezza continued to face significant commercial challenges:

**Regulatory and Launch Context**: Afrezza was FDA-approved in June 2014 for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Sanofi and Mannkind entered a commercialization partnership, with the product launching in early 2015.

**Market Performance**: Afrezza's sales remained extremely low compared to injectable insulin products. By January 2016, just months after this article, Sanofi terminated its partnership with Mannkind, returning all commercialization rights to Mannkind. This termination was widely attributed to disappointing sales figures.

**Post-Partnership Era**: Mannkind continued to market Afrezza independently but never achieved significant market penetration. The company struggled financially and implemented multiple reverse stock splits to maintain listing requirements.

**Clinical and Practical Barriers**: Healthcare providers and patients continued to prefer traditional injection methods for several reasons: dosing precision with inhalable products remained a concern; the requirement for pulmonary function testing discouraged prescribing; and the established efficacy and lower cost of injectable insulin made clinicians hesitant to switch patients.

**Long-term Outcome**: Unlike injectable insulins, which remain the standard of care, inhaled insulin never gained meaningful market share. Afrezza remained a niche product with minimal impact on diabetes treatment paradigms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Predicted Failure of Commercial Adoption**: The author predicted that Afrezza would fail to gain market acceptance, similar to Exubera. This prediction proved accurate, as Afrezza achieved only minimal sales and never became a significant treatment option for diabetes patients.

• **Comparison to Exubera's Fate**: The article drew parallels between Afrezza and Pfizer's Exubera, suggesting that market rejection was likely. This comparison was highly accurate—both products failed to capture significant market share, and both faced termination of major pharmaceutical partnerships within a short time after launch.

• **Skepticism About Market Demand**: The author questioned whether sufficient demand existed for inhaled insulin. This skepticism was well-founded; despite multiple attempts by various companies, inhaled insulin has never achieved meaningful market adoption, and self-injection remains the dominant delivery method for insulin therapy.

• **Overall Assessment Accuracy**: The article's overall assessment that Afrezza would struggle commercially proved prescient, with the Sanofi partnership ending within a year and the product remaining commercially unsuccessful.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates strong analytical foresight in predicting the failure of a biopharmaceutical product based on understanding market dynamics and therapeutic inertia, making it a valuable case study in biotechnology commercial assessment.
