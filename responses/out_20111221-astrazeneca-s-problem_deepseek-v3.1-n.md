# AstraZeneca's Problems (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses AstraZeneca's severe pipeline setbacks in late 2011, occurring during what the author describes as "one of the nastiest patent cliffs in the industry." Two major drug candidates had recently failed: **olaparib**, a PARP inhibitor being developed for ovarian cancer that showed promise in progression-free survival but failed to demonstrate overall survival benefit, and **TC-5214 (mecamylamine)**, a nicotinic antagonist for depression from Targacept that missed its primary endpoint. Both compounds came through inlicensing deals (olaparib from KuDOS, TC-5214 from Targacept), raising questions about AstraZeneca's acquisition strategy. The article notes that while cancer and depression have high inherent failure rates, these failures were particularly problematic given AstraZeneca's patent expiration crisis, potentially forcing further R&D cost-cutting measures that the author suggests would be counterproductive.

## 2. HISTORY

**Olaparib** ultimately proved to be one of the most remarkable drug development turnaround stories. After the 2011 setback, AstraZeneca continued development in different patient populations. In **December 2014**, olaparib received **FDA approval** under the brand name **Lynparza** for advanced ovarian cancer in patients with BRCA mutations—the first PARP inhibitor approved worldwide. The drug went on to receive numerous additional approvals across multiple cancer types including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. As of 2021, Lynparza had generated over **$2.3 billion in annual revenue**, becoming a blockbuster drug and cornerstone of targeted cancer therapy.

**TC-5214 (mecamylamine)** for depression definitively failed and was **abandoned** after multiple Phase III trial failures between 2011-2012. Targacept's stock plummeted, and the collaboration with AstraZeneca was terminated.

Regarding **AstraZeneca's broader trajectory**: The company did undergo significant **R&D restructuring** and cost-cutting during 2012-2016, including closing research sites and reducing headcount. However, contrary to the article's pessimistic tone, AstraZeneca managed to stabilize and grow substantially. Notably, during the **COVID-19 pandemic**, AstraZeneca developed one of the first approved vaccines (in partnership with Oxford University), becoming a major global vaccine supplier with billions of doses delivered worldwide in 2021-2022. By 2023, the company had rebuilt a strong oncology portfolio beyond just olaparib, including drugs like Tagrisso and Imfinzi.

**PARP inhibitors as a class** flourished after 2014, with multiple competitors entering the market (Pfizer's Talzenna, Clovis's Rubraca, GSK's Zejula), validating the mechanism but also confirming the initial concerns about patient selection and appropriate indications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"What does this say about AstraZeneca's whole inlicensing strategy?"** - This implied criticism proved mostly wrong. While TC-5214 failed, olaparib eventually succeeded spectacularly through the KuDOS acquisition, validating at least some inlicensing decisions. AstraZeneca continued successful partnerships and acquisitions, including the $15.6 billion acquisition of Alexion in 2021.

- **"Additional development failures increase the probability that management will reassess the likely return on investment from additional R&D investment and cut costs further"** - This prediction about cost-cutting proved **true** in the short term (2012-2016 restructuring), but the implication that this would harm productivity was **too pessimistic**. AstraZeneca ultimately achieved significant R&D success and maintained innovation capacity.

- **"Well, that'll really make R&D more productive"** - This sardonic remark suggesting cost-cutting would backfire proved **incorrect** as AstraZeneca's R&D eventually produced major successes including multiple blockbuster cancer drugs and a COVID-19 vaccine.

- **"Oncology is a crap shoot"** - This characterization proved **accurate but incomplete**. While cancer drug development remained challenging, the emergence of biomarkers and targeted therapies (like BRCA testing for PARP inhibitors) significantly improved success rates in specific patient populations, which is exactly what happened with olaparib.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article is highly interesting not because of its predictions (most of which were wrong about olaparib), but because it captures how quickly drug development fortunes can reverse, and how initial setbacks—even those seeming definitive—can become major successes through persistence and scientific insight. It serves as a valuable case study about not abandoning potentially valuable mechanisms too quickly.
