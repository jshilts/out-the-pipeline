# Down With the Ullmann (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article expresses strong frustration with the Ullmann reaction, a traditional copper-mediated method for forming biaryl ethers in organic synthesis. The author characterizes it as difficult, unreliable, and representative of a broader problem: when there are numerous literature methods for performing a reaction, it typically indicates that no truly satisfactory approach exists. Even when the Ullmann reaction does work, the author notes concerns about metal impurities compromising results. The overall tone is that this classic reaction is more trouble than it's worth in practical laboratory settings.

## 2. HISTORY

The author's frustrations reflected a growing consensus in the synthetic chemistry community. In the years following 2013, several significant developments addressed the limitations of traditional Ullmann chemistry:

**Palladium-catalyzed alternatives became dominant**: The Buchwald-Hartwig amination, already established by 2013, continued to expand its scope and reliability. More importantly for biaryl ether formation specifically, palladium-catalyzed methods using ligands like SPhos, XPhos, and BrettPhos demonstrated superior functional group tolerance, milder conditions, and higher yields across diverse substrate classes.

**Copper catalysis improved**: While the author expressed strong skepticism about copper chemistry generally, subsequent research actually refined copper-catalyzed methods. Systems using copper(I) sources with appropriate ligands (diamine, amino acid-based) provided more reliable protocols for biaryl ether formation, though these still generally required higher temperatures than palladium alternatives.

**Photoredox and other methods emerged**: Post-2013 saw the rise of photoredox catalysis for C-O bond formation, offering completely metal-free alternatives or complementary reactivity patterns.

**Practical adoption**: In pharmaceutical and industrial settings, the transition away from classical Ullmann conditions accelerated. Process chemistry groups increasingly specified palladium-based methods for scale-up due to reproducibility and impurity profile advantages. Several drug development programs explicitly avoided Ullmann chemistry in their synthetic routes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains one clear implicit prediction about the Ullmann reaction's future utility:
- **Predicted continued difficulty and limited improvement**: While not explicitly stated, the author's tone and framing suggested that the fundamental problems with Ullmann chemistry would persist as an inherent limitation of copper-mediated processes.

**Actual outcome**: Mixed accuracy. While classical Ullmann conditions remain challenging, the broader prediction underestimated continued methodological development. Research in subsequent years produced more reliable copper-based protocols through better ligand design and understanding of reaction mechanisms. However, the author's core premise proved largely correct - the field moved toward fundamentally different approaches (palladium, photoredox) rather than perfecting the problematic Ullmann chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article captures an important sentiment in synthetic chemistry and highlights a genuine pain point that influenced subsequent methodological development, but it addresses a relatively narrow technical topic without broader implications beyond the chemistry community.
