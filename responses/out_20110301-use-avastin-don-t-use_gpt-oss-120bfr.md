# Use Avastin! Don't Use Avastin! (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary argued that, although Genentech/Roche’s anti‑VEGF drug **Avastin (bevacizumab)** is expensive for its approved oncology indications, it is a *much cheaper* alternative to **Lucentis (ranibizumab)** for treating wet age‑related macular degeneration (AMD). Both antibodies target VEGF; Lucentis is an ophthalmic‑formulated version of the same molecule and costs roughly $2,000 per intravitreal injection, whereas repackaged Avastin can be administered for about $50.  

At the time, many U.S. ophthalmologists were already using off‑label Avastin, but the author noted a lack of definitive head‑to‑head data. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) trial was about to report results, and Roche was reportedly offering rebates to encourage Lucentis use. The piece warned that Roche would likely argue for the more profitable drug in each indication, regardless of clinical equivalence.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Key clinical trials (2011‑2012)**  
| Trial | Design | Main finding (visual acuity) | Safety | Impact |
|-------|--------|------------------------------|--------|--------|
| **CATT** (Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials) – NIH‑funded, published *NEJM* 2011 | Randomized 1,185 patients, bevacizumab vs. ranibizumab, monthly or PRN dosing | No clinically meaningful difference in mean change in visual acuity at 1 yr (≈ +8 letters for both) | Similar rates of ocular and systemic adverse events; slightly higher injection frequency for bevacizumab in PRN arm | Provided the first large, rigorously controlled evidence that off‑label Avastin is essentially as effective as Lucentis for AMD. |
| **IVAN** (UK) – published *Lancet* 2012 | 610 patients, bevacizumab vs. ranibizumab, monthly vs. discontinuous dosing | Equivalent visual outcomes; bevacizumab required marginally more injections | Comparable safety; a small excess of systemic serious adverse events with bevacizumab (not statistically robust) | Reinforced CATT conclusions; influenced UK NHS policy to favor bevacizumab for cost reasons. |

**Regulatory and market developments**  

* **FDA stance** – Bevacizumab remains **unapproved** for intra‑ocular use; however, the FDA has not taken action against off‑label compounding because the drug is supplied in single‑use vials for oncology.  
* **Reimbursement** – Medicare and many private insurers continued to reimburse bevacizumab at the lower cost, while some health plans instituted prior‑authorization for ranibizumab.  
* **Roche’s response** – Roche introduced **aflibercept (Eylea)** in 2011 for AMD, a distinct VEGF trap priced between Avastin and Lucentis, and later offered **rebates** and **patient‑access programs** for ranibizumab to retain market share.  
* **Biosimilars** – The first FDA‑approved ranibizumab biosimilar, **Byooviz (ranibizumab‑mvzr)**, entered the U.S. market in 2021 at roughly 30‑40 % lower price than the reference product, but still considerably above bevacizumab.  
* **New agents** – **Faricimab (Vabysmo)**, a bispecific antibody targeting VEGF‑A and Ang‑2, received FDA approval in 2022, offering longer dosing intervals (up to 16 weeks) and further expanding therapeutic options.  

**Clinical practice**  

* By 2023, surveys of retina specialists in the U.S. and Europe consistently reported that **≈ 70 %** of intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections for AMD were still bevacizumab, driven primarily by cost‑effectiveness.  
* Real‑world registries (e.g., IRIS, FRB) show visual outcomes for bevacizumab comparable to ranibizumab and aflibercept when dosing frequency is matched.  
* No major safety signal has emerged that would contraindicate bevacizumab’s off‑label use; systemic adverse‑event rates remain low and comparable across agents.  

**Policy**  

* The U.S. **Medicare Part B** payment system (average sales price) keeps bevacizumab’s reimbursement at ~ $50‑$60 per dose, reinforcing its dominance in cost‑constrained settings.  
* Some European health systems (e.g., NHS England) formally recommend bevacizumab as first‑line therapy for AMD, citing the CATT/IVAN evidence and cost savings of > $1 billion annually.  

Overall, the NIH‑funded trial the article referenced **validated** the clinical equivalence of Avastin and Lucentis for AMD, leading to sustained off‑label use of Avastin and prompting Roche to diversify its ocular portfolio rather than rely solely on Lucentis.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“The NIH head‑to‑head trial will likely show Avastin is not inferior, and Roche will dislike the results.”*  
  - **Outcome:** CATT (NIH‑funded) demonstrated non‑inferiority; Roche’s subsequent launch of aflibercept and rebate programs suggests the company indeed responded defensively. ✅  

- **Prediction:** *“Roche will argue for Lucentis in AMD while pushing Avastin for metastatic breast cancer, maximizing revenue.”*  
  - **Outcome:** Roche continued to market Lucentis for AMD and offered rebates to ophthalmologists; simultaneously, it promoted Avastin for oncology despite mixed efficacy in breast cancer (the FDA withdrew its breast‑cancer indication in 2011). The pattern aligns with the revenue‑maximizing behavior described. ✅  

- **Prediction:** *“Avastin will be the bargain alternative and may become widely adopted.”*  
  - **Outcome:** Avastin remains the most commonly used anti‑VEGF for AMD in the U.S. and many other countries, largely because of its low price. ✅  

- **Prediction:** *“The market will provide perverse incentives that could hinder objective assessment.”*  
  - **Outcome:** Rebates for Lucentis and the introduction of aflibercept created a competitive pricing environment, but the CATT trial’s public data mitigated the incentive to suppress evidence. Partial alignment. ⚪

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when cost‑driven off‑label use challenged pharmaceutical pricing strategies; the subsequent real‑world impact on clinical practice and health‑policy makes it highly relevant, though the core argument was already being debated in the literature.
