# Thoughts on Sci-Hub (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2016 commentary addresses the emergence of Sci-Hub, a website created by Alexandra Elbakyan that made over 48 million copyrighted journal articles available for free through unauthorized means. The author acknowledges frustration with the scientific publishing industry, particularly companies like Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley, whose business models rely on charging high prices for access to research that authors provide for free. The piece criticizes U.S. copyright law as "a travesty," noting the stark contrast between drug patents that expire within years of market entry (leading to generic competition and price drops) and copyright protections that extend 95 years after publication for scientific papers. Despite acknowledging legitimate grievances against publishers and supporting copyright reform, the author ultimately concludes that Sci-Hub represents illegal theft of property, even if obtained through objectionable business practices. The commentary argues that while change is needed, it should occur through legal channels rather than wholesale violation of existing law.

## 2. HISTORY

**Sci-Hub's Continued Operation and Growth**: Despite multiple legal challenges and court orders, Sci-Hub has continued operating through domain changes and mirror sites. As of 2024, the platform reportedly hosts over 88 million papers, nearly doubling from the 48 million mentioned in 2016.

**Legal Developments**: In 2017, Elsevier won a $15 million judgment against Sci-Hub in U.S. federal court. In 2020, major U.S. internet service providers were ordered to block Sci-Hub domains. However, enforcement has been limited, with the platform remaining accessible through alternative domains and VPNs. Elbakyan faces potential extradition issues but has continued her advocacy from abroad.

**Institutional and Policy Responses**: Open access policies have gradually expanded. Major funders including the NIH, Wellcome Trust, and European research councils implemented mandates requiring publicly funded research to be made freely available. In 2018, "Plan S" was launched by European funders, requiring immediate open access to research results by 2021. In 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy mandated that all federally funded research be made freely available by 2025, effectively eliminating embargo periods for U.S. government-funded work.

**Publisher Business Model Evolution**: Publishers have adapted through "transformative agreements" that bundle subscription costs with open access publishing fees. However, concerns about high article processing charges (APCs) persist, with typical fees ranging from $2,000-$11,000 per article at major journals. The market concentration has remained high, with the top five publishers controlling over 50% of published articles.

**Usage and Impact**: Studies indicate Sci-Hub usage remains widespread globally, particularly in countries with limited institutional access to subscription journals. Research suggests Sci-Hub users access articles across all disciplines and geographic regions, with many scientists viewing it as a practical solution to access barriers rather than an ideological statement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author suggested that "changes are already underway" in scientific publishing through "actions of elected officials, business owners, authors, and customers" and was "fine with letting the messy process continue to see what we end up with."  
**Outcome**: This proved largely accurate. Major policy changes occurred through government mandates (OSTP 2022 policy, Plan S 2018), institutional actions (university negotiations with publishers), and market evolution (transformative agreements). However, the pace has been gradual, and publishers have adapted their business models rather than fundamentally transforming them.

• **Prediction**: The author viewed Sci-Hub as a "warning" about the "fragility" of existing publishing models.  
**Outcome**: Accurate. Sci-Hub demonstrated that technical barriers could be overcome when users perceive legitimate needs unmet by legal channels. However, rather than causing publisher collapse, it has served as both pressure point and justification for policy reforms toward open access.

• **Prediction**: While not explicitly stated as a prediction, the author's concern about setting a precedent where "wholesale violation of law" becomes normalized did not materialize in the way feared.  
**Outcome**: Sci-Hub remained a specialized case rather than triggering broader disregard for intellectual property law in science. Most researchers continue publishing through traditional channels while benefiting from expanded legal open access options.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated prescient understanding of the systemic tensions in academic publishing and accurately identified Sci-Hub as symptomatic of deeper structural problems rather than mere piracy. The piece anticipated both the continued viability of such platforms and the gradual policy evolution toward open access that has indeed unfolded over the subsequent eight years, making it more insightful than contemporaneous discussions that focused solely on legality or access arguments.
