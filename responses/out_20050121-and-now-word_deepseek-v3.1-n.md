# And Now A Word. . . (21 Jan 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief editorial-style article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog announced that the site had begun accepting sponsored content, as indicated by advertisements appearing on the right side of the page. The author expressed appreciation for the sponsors and explicitly invited other potential advertisers to reach out, describing the Pipeline readership as consisting of people working in or interested in science, well-read, and inclined to share their opinions openly.

The piece represents a milestone in science blogging's commercialization, showing how influential niche scientific content platforms began monetizing their audiences in the mid-2000s.

## 2. HISTORY

"In the Pipeline" became one of the most successful and long-running science blogs in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space. Derek Lowe's blog, which began in 2002, has continued operating for over two decades under various platforms including Corante, Science Magazine, and currently hosted by AAAS.

The sponsorship model announced in 2005 evolved significantly over time. The blog maintained its independence and editorial voice while sustaining itself through various revenue streams including display advertising, sponsored content, and eventually platform support when it moved under Science Magazine's umbrella. Lowe's blog became required reading for many pharmaceutical industry professionals, medicinal chemists, and biotechnology researchers.

The broader context is that this period (2005) represented an early phase of professional science blogging gaining commercial viability, preceding the rise of social media platforms like Twitter and the subsequent migration of scientific discourse to those platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained no predictive content - it was purely an announcement about business arrangements for the blog. The author made no forward-looking statements about biotechnology, pharmaceutical research, or scientific developments.

• *Advertisement revenue viability for science blogs*: The article implicitly suggested that niche science content could attract commercial sponsorship. This proved largely successful for major science blogs like "In the Pipeline," though the overall market for standalone science blog advertising has become more challenging with the rise of social media and centralized platforms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article has minimal long-term significance beyond documenting an early example of science blog monetization - an administrative announcement rather than scientific or industry analysis.
