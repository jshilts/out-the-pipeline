# Retrospective Analysis: "The 2013 Drug Approvals: Not So Great?"

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 article discusses the decline in FDA drug approvals from 39 in 2012 to 27 in 2013, speculating whether this represents a concerning downward trend or merely statistical noise. The author cites commentary from FierceBiotech's John Carroll (who viewed the drop as "ominous") and Forbes contributor Bernard Munos (who noted that half of big pharma had strong years while the other half struggled). The piece highlights the industry's struggle to meet earlier optimistic projections of 35-40 annual approvals, with actual performance closer to the "bleak average" of 24 approvals per year seen in the early 2000s.

The article ultimately adopts a cautious, wait-and-see approach, acknowledging the statistical noisiness of drug discovery while questioning whether commentators were being premature in both their 2012 optimism and 2013 pessimism.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade proved this single-year fluctuation was indeed statistical noise rather than a concerning trend. Here's what happened:

**Short-term trajectory (2014-2017)**: The dip proved temporary. FDA approvals rebounded to 41 in 2014, fluctuated between 22-59 annually through 2017, then surged dramatically.

**The breakthrough era (2018-2023)**: Contrary to the article's worries, the industry entered an unprecedented approval boom. The period saw:
- 2018: 59 approvals (record at the time)
- 2019: 48 approvals
- 2020: 53 approvals
- 2021: 50 approvals
- 2022: 37 approvals
- 2023: 55 approvals

The 2023 total of 55 approvals is more than double the 27 that sparked concern in 2013.

**Structural changes**: The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation (established 2012), accelerated approval pathways, and expanded use of surrogate endpoints contributed to sustained higher approval rates. The agency's "more flexible" regulatory approach, particularly for serious diseases, became institutionalized.

**The COVID effect**: The pandemic accelerated trends toward faster review times and adaptive trial designs, though some of this momentum predated 2020.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the article got wrong:**
- The implied worry that 27 approvals represented systemic productivity decline was mistaken. Instead, this was a temporary dip in a broader upward trajectory.
- The concern that big pharma couldn't support $370 billion in sales with ~11 annual approvals proved unfounded, as approvals increased dramatically.
- The suggestion that the industry might revert to the "bleak average of 24" was too pessimistic. The 2014-2023 average was approximately 48 approvals per year—double that figure.
- The notion that Lilly's promise of delivering 2 drugs per year consistently wouldn't materialize missed that *collective* industry productivity would far exceed this through portfolio diversification and smaller biotech innovation.

**What the article got right:**
- The author's skepticism about drawing conclusions from single-year data was prescient and appropriate.
- The recognition that drug approvals follow "statistically noisy" patterns proved accurate.
- The caution against premature interpretation of trends—both optimistic (after 2012) and pessimistic (after 2013)—was wise.
- The implicit understanding that FDA approval trends must be evaluated over longer time horizons was correct.

**The nuance they missed:**
- The article didn't anticipate the structural shift toward more flexible regulatory pathways.
- It underestimated the impact of breakthrough designations and expedited review processes.
- The analysis focused heavily on big pharma while missing the rising importance of smaller biotech companies and academic spinoffs in the innovation ecosystem.
- The global nature of pharmaceutical development (not just US FDA approvals) and the increasing role of specialty drugs versus primary care medications weren't adequately considered.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article earns a solid middle-to-upper tier score for several reasons:

**Why it's not higher:**
- It's primarily a commentary on a single data point (year-over-year approval numbers) with limited broader context.
- The analysis is somewhat superficial—more journalism than deep industry analysis.
- It doesn't explore underlying mechanisms driving approval trends.

**Why it's not lower:**
- It captures a genuine inflection point in industry sentiment and discussion.
- The central question (short-term fluctuation vs. long-term trend) remains relevant for interpreting business cycles across industries.
- The article's restraint and skepticism about overinterpreting single data points exemplify good analytical practices.
- It provides useful historical context about industry expectations and R&D productivity debates that remain ongoing.
- The piece indirectly highlights how difficult forecasting remains in complex, regulated industries.

The article is more interesting as a case study in **analytical humility** than as a standalone analysis of the pharmaceutical industry. Its primary lesson isn't about drug approvals per se, but about the dangers of extrapolating from limited data—a caution that remains relevant across all domains of technological and business forecasting.
