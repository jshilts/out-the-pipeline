# How Not To Do It: Ruining Stuff (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is not actually about the biotechnology industry, but rather a humorous cautionary post about laboratory mishaps. The author recounts an incident from the late 1980s where someone destroyed a $15,000 chiral chromatography column by using an incompatible solvent (methylene chloride) that washed off the expensive chiral packing material. The column was a Chiracel column used for separating enantiomers, where the packing was only layered onto a support rather than chemically bonded, making it solvent-sensitive. The post invites readers to share their own laboratory horror stories of valuable equipment or materials being ruined through easily preventable mistakes, setting up what appears to be a series seeking reader submissions about "how not to do it" in laboratory settings.

## 2. HISTORY

The post was published on a blog called "In the Pipeline" (referring to drug development pipeline), authored by medicinal chemist Derek Lowe. This blog has been running continuously since 2002 and remains active today, focusing on drug discovery, pharmaceutical industry commentary, and laboratory culture. Lowe continued this type of content over the years, with the blog consistently ranking among the most-read chemistry and drug discovery blogs. The "How Not To Do It" theme became a recurring feature where readers shared laboratory mishap stories. The blog's ongoing relevance led to Lowe compiling many posts into published books, and he continues as a prominent voice critiquing both the science and business aspects of drug development, often highlighting reproducibility issues and practical laboratory challenges that remain central concerns in pharmaceutical research. The pharmaceutical industry itself has continued grappling with similar themes of quality control, proper procedure adherence, and risk management in laboratory settings, with regulatory agencies like the FDA maintaining stringent requirements for documentation and procedure compliance in drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There were no specific predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical development in this article - it was purely a retrospective anecdote about laboratory practices. The article's tone was cautionary but anecdotal, not forward-looking. No substantive claims were made that could be validated or invalidated through later events, as the focus was on learning from past mistakes rather than forecasting future developments. The implicit suggestion that such mishaps were common and worth sharing stories about did reflect an ongoing reality in laboratory settings, where documentation and training continue to be important for preventing costly errors in pharmaceutical research.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article concerns a laboratory anecdote about equipment damage, which is entirely off-topic for the requested biotechnology industry analysis.
