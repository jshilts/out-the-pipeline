# A Ligand Efficiency Reply (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary discusses a rebuttal paper published in ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters responding to earlier criticisms of ligand efficiency (LE) measurements. The original critical paper by Shultz had argued that LE metrics violate mathematical rules and are "mathematical impossibilities." The rebuttal came from prominent fragment chemists at multiple institutions (Astex, Carmot, Dundee, GSK, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and Gfree).

The central debate revolved around whether dividing a logarithm by an integer (as LE calculations do) is mathematically valid. The rebuttal authors defended LE metrics, arguing that there's nothing inherently wrong with such calculations. They also addressed criticisms of lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE), acknowledging its usefulness while noting limitations for comparing molecules of very different sizes or for targets requiring highly polar molecules. The commentary suggests that while Shultz made some valid points about metric proliferation, his mathematical objections were unfounded, and the debate suffered from an unhelpful tone that hindered effective scientific discourse.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2014 debate, ligand efficiency metrics have continued to be widely used in drug discovery, particularly in fragment-based drug design (FBDD). Astex, one of the signatories of the rebuttal, has successfully advanced fragment-based approaches leading to multiple FDA-approved drugs, including (most notably in their portfolio). The practical utility of LE and LLE metrics in guiding medicinal chemistry optimization has been demonstrated through successful drug discovery programs.

The scientific community largely adopted the position articulated in the rebuttal paper. LE metrics remain a standard tool in medicinal chemistry, particularly for fragment-to-lead optimization where understanding the efficiency of binding interactions relative to molecular size is crucial. The debate ultimately reinforced rather than undermined the use of these metrics, with researchers accepting that no single metric can capture all aspects of drug-likeness and that multiple complementary metrics are necessary.

Fragment-based drug discovery, where these efficiency metrics are most heavily utilized, has matured significantly since 2014, with numerous compounds entering clinical trials and several reaching market approval. The pragmatic approach advocated by the rebuttal authors - using metrics as helpful guides while understanding their limitations - has become the consensus position in the field. However, the proliferation of metrics that Shultz worried about has continued, with many research groups and companies developing their own variations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself did not contain specific forward-looking predictions, but rather represented a defense of existing methodologies against criticisms.

**Implicit expectations in the debate:**
- **That LE metrics would continue to be useful despite mathematical criticisms**: This proved largely accurate. LE and related efficiency metrics remain widely used in medicinal chemistry practice.
- **That fragment-based drug discovery would benefit from proper understanding of efficiency metrics**: Fragment-based approaches have indeed flourished and produced clinical candidates and approved drugs, though this success reflects broader advances in the field beyond just metrics optimization.
- **That multiple complementary metrics would be needed rather than a single universal measure**: The field has moved toward using multiple metrics (LE, LLE, and various proprietary measures) rather than abandoning efficiency metrics entirely, validating the authors' position.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article represents an important methodological defense at the time, but the specific mathematical debate has largely been settled, making it primarily of historical interest to specialists in medicinal chemistry metrics rather than having broad ongoing relevance. The substance of whether dividing logs by integers is valid was never really in serious dispute among most practitioners.
