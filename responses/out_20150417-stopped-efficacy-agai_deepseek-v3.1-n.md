# Stopped For Efficacy - Again (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that Bristol-Myers Squibb halted a trial of their anti-PD-1 antibody Opdivo (nivolumab) for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer due to overwhelming efficacy—making it unethical to continue the trial. This followed Merck's similar early halt of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) just weeks earlier for the same reason. The author notes that nivolumab had already demonstrated similar activity in other lung cancer trials, reinforcing that PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors are justifying the excitement surrounding them and signaling a major transformation in oncology treatment.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent years validated the article's enthusiasm. Both Opdivo (nivolumab) and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) received FDA approval and became blockbuster immunotherapies:

- **Opdivo** was first approved in 2014 for melanoma, then received accelerated approval for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 2015, with full approval in subsequent years across multiple indications
- **Keytruda** received its first approval in 2014 for advanced melanoma and expanded rapidly across NSCLC, head and neck cancer, and many other tumor types

The PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor class fundamentally transformed oncology practice. By 2020-2025, these drugs became standard of care for numerous cancer types, generating billions in annual revenue and demonstrating durable responses in subsets of patients. The mechanism—releasing T-cell brakes to fight cancer—proved broadly effective across multiple tumor types, though response rates vary significantly between cancers and patient populations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There is one main prediction in the article worth evaluating:

- **Prediction**: "Oncology is really going through a big change, and we can hope that this is just the start"
  - **Outcome**: Remarkably accurate. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were indeed just the start. The field expanded to include:
    - Additional checkpoint targets (CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3)
    - Combination therapies (ipilimumab + nivolumab for melanoma)
    - Expansion across dozens of cancer types
    - Adjuvant and neoadjuvant applications (treating earlier-stage disease)
    - Combination with chemotherapy and targeted therapies
    - Biomarker development (PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, MSI-H) to better select patients

The prediction correctly anticipated that these early successes represented a paradigm shift rather than a isolated breakthrough.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in oncology history—the moment when PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors proved definitively effective, presaging their transformation from experimental drugs into foundation-of-care therapies across multiple cancers.
