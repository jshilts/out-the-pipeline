# The ACS Journals Tighten Up Screening Standards (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a policy statement by editors-in-chief of ACS journals regarding assay interference compounds in drug screening research. The editors established stricter standards requiring researchers to actively examine compounds for known classes of assay interference and provide firm experimental evidence from at least two different assays when reporting activity. The policy emphasizes that while computational filters exist to prescreen problematic compounds, there is no substitute for well-controlled experimental evidence, encapsulated by the principle "nullius in verba" (take nobody's word for it).

The commentary also references an ongoing controversy about curcumin, with some researchers defending its clinical potential despite concerns about its promiscuous binding behavior and assay interference properties. The author argues that the new standards will improve the medicinal chemistry literature by filtering out poorly controlled papers while still allowing unusual but legitimate compounds to be published if supported by rigorous experimental evidence.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2017 ACS policy formalized growing concerns within the drug discovery community about the reproducibility crisis and the cost of pursuing false-positive screening hits. In the years following this announcement:

**Academic Response and Impact**: The policy contributed to a broader movement toward more rigorous standards in chemical biology and drug discovery publications. Several high-profile journals implemented similar requirements, extending beyond just ACS publications. The emphasis on counter-screening and orthogonal assay validation became more standardized practice in academic drug discovery centers.

**Industry Adoption**: Pharmaceutical companies had already been implementing similar quality control measures internally, but the ACS policy helped establish clearer community-wide expectations for academic publications. This reduced the gap between academic publications and industry standards, making academic research more directly translatable.

**PAINS Awareness**: The focus on Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) expanded significantly. Researchers developed more sophisticated computational filters and databases, while also recognizing that some PAINS alerts could be overcome with proper experimental controls. The field moved toward a more nuanced understanding rather than outright rejection of PAINS-substructure-containing compounds.

**Clinical Outcomes**: The curcumin controversy mentioned in the article continued, with mixed clinical trial results in subsequent years. While some studies showed modest benefits in specific contexts, curcumin generally failed to demonstrate the broad-spectrum therapeutic effects often claimed, validating the concerns raised about its promiscuous behavior and poor pharmacokinetic properties.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: The ACS standards would improve the med-chem literature by requiring better experimental controls.

**Outcome**: **Substantially correct**. The policy contributed to a broader trend toward improved experimental rigor in chemical biology publications. The reproducibility of published results in medicinal chemistry showed gradual improvement, though challenges remain across all scientific fields. The emphasis on orthogonal assay validation became more widespread.

**Prediction**: Computational filters alone would prove insufficient for identifying problematic compounds, and experimental validation would remain essential.

**Outcome**: **Correct**. Subsequent research confirmed that in silico PAINS filters have significant limitations, including both false positives (flagging legitimate compounds) and false negatives (missing actual interference compounds). The field converged on a consensus that computational tools are useful for prioritization but cannot replace well-designed experimental counter-screens.

**Prediction**: Curcumin research would face higher scrutiny but would continue, requiring more rigorous experimental support to publish in good journals.

**Outcome**: **Correct**. Curcumin research did continue but with increased awareness of its problematic properties. High-quality journals indeed demanded more extensive control experiments. The broader research community developed a more balanced view—acknowledging curcumin's limitations while still investigating specific contexts where it might have utility.

**Prediction**: The standards would not constitute a "witch hunt" against unusual structures, and legitimate odd structures would continue to be published.

**Outcome**: **Correct**. The implementation did not result in widespread rejection of unusual chemotypes. Instead, it fostered better experimental documentation of why unusual compounds are worth pursuing, strengthening rather than eliminating such research.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important policy shift in chemical research publication standards, addressing a significant practical problem in drug discovery. The standards influenced both academic and industry practices and contributed to ongoing discussions about research quality and reproducibility.
