# A Terrifically Bad Promotional Idea (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Cyagen, a biological supplies company, for launching a "citation reward program" that pays researchers to cite their products in published academic papers. Cyagen offered vouchers for future purchases based on the journal's impact factor, ranging from smaller amounts for lower-tier journals to $5600 for publications in prestigious venues like the New England Journal of Medicine. Ben Goldacre discovered that Cyagen had compiled a list of 164 papers that already cited the company, yet none of the recent papers declared receiving these payments when they should have under conflict of interest disclosure requirements. The author distinguishes this practice from traditional promotional activities like providing free T-shirts or lunch, viewing citation payments as crossing an ethical boundary into buying placement in scientific literature, which compromises academic integrity.

## 2. HISTORY

In the period following this article's publication, the practice of citation reward programs faced significant backlash and scrutiny within the scientific community. The immediate response centered on disclosure violations, as researchers should have declared these payments as conflicts of interest per standard publication ethics. The academic publishing community became more vigilant about potential industry-induced bias in citations, and many journals strengthened their disclosure requirements.  

After exposure in 2015, Cyagen discontinued their citation rewards program. Various scientific integrity organizations issued warnings about such schemes, emphasizing how they could distort science by encouraging unnecessary citations. The broader biotech industry supply houses largely avoided implementing similar programs, with most companies preferring standard academic outreach strategies like conference sponsorships, equipment grants, and educational materials rather than direct payment for literature references. The emphasis shifted toward transparent sponsorship with proper acknowledgment procedures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Authors would have to declare conflicts of interest**: The article predicted that researchers would need to disclose Cyagen payments. *What happened*: Following the exposure and intense criticism, journals indeed strengthened their requirement for detailed conflict of interest disclosures, though most programs like this one were abandoned rather than formalized into accepted practices.

• **This practice crosses an ethical line**: The author predicted such programs would damage research integrity. *What happened*: Scientific consensus broadly condemned such schemes, with major publishers issuing guidance against citation-for-hire arrangements and similar reward systems being discontinued across the industry.

• **Hot agar mix over someone's head**: The author joked about consequences for those who developed this program. *What happened*: While not literal, the company faced significant reputational damage and public shaming within the research community.

• **Cyagen had compiled a long list of papers (164)**: The article identified an existing pattern. *What happened*: After exposure, scrutiny fell on the researchers involved, with many likely facing institutional review and increased attention on their disclosure compliance going forward.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures critical developments in publication ethics, exposing a serious breach of scientific integrity and providing lasting lessons about conflict of interest transparency. The core issue—industry payments influencing scholarly citations—remains relevant today as we contend with broader concerns about research integrity and commercial influence on science.
