# Aveo Gets Bad News on Tivozanib (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the FDA committee's rejection of Aveo Pharmaceutical's kidney cancer drug tivozanib on May 2, 2013. The drug was a kinase inhibitor for advanced renal cell carcinoma that had demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to Nexavar (sorafenib) in Phase III trials. However, the sorafenib arm showed better overall survival rates, creating regulatory concerns.

Several key issues plagued the application: the Phase III trial was conducted in Eastern Europe, raising questions about applicability to US patients; it was a "crossover" study design that complicated interpretation of results due to many patients switching between medications; and Aveo appeared to have limited financial resources, potentially impacting trial quality. The FDA had previously recommended a second trial in a US-comparable population, but the company was unable to conduct one, creating a high-risk situation where they were essentially "betting the company" on this single drug.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the FDA committee rejection in May 2013, Aveo Pharmaceuticals faced significant consequences. The FDA officially rejected tivozanib in June 2013, causing the company's stock to plummet and leading to substantial layoffs. The company was forced to restructure and seek strategic alternatives.

However, the tivozanib story did not end there. Aveo eventually found a path forward by pursuing approval in other indications and markets. The drug was later approved in the European Union in 2017 for advanced renal cell carcinoma under the brand name Fotivda. Subsequently, in March 2021, the FDA approved tivozanib for adults with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma following two or more prior systemic therapies, representing a remarkable turnaround for the drug eight years after its initial rejection.

During the intervening years, the competitive landscape for renal cell carcinoma had evolved significantly with the approval of multiple new therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination regimens, which changed the standard of care and positioning for tivozanib in the treatment algorithm.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article and its sources contained several implicit predictions that can be evaluated with hindsight:

- **Implication that Aveo would fail completely**: The article suggested Aveo had "bet the company" with the implication this would be fatal. **Outcome**: While Aveo faced severe difficulties including stock crash and layoffs, the company survived and ultimately achieved FDA approval for tivozanib in 2021, albeit in a different treatment context.

- **Concerns about Eastern European clinical trials**: The article raised questions about relying on Eastern Europe for pivotal trials. **Outcome**: This concern proved valid in the short term, as evidenced by the FDA's 2013 rejection citing population comparability issues. However, the underlying data eventually gained regulatory acceptance in both Europe and later the US, suggesting the issues were more about trial design and positioning rather than fundamental data problems.

- **Challenges with crossover trial design**: The article highlighted problems with crossover trials impairing statistical interpretation. **Outcome**: This concern was prescient, as the crossover design complications contributed significantly to the initial FDA rejection and led to extensive regulatory discussions about data interpretation that took years to resolve.

- **Resource constraints leading to suboptimal trials**: The suggestion that smaller companies cutting costs on trials face regulatory risks. **Outcome**: This proved accurate in the short term, though Aveo eventually overcame these limitations through partnership strategies and pursuing different indications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an important case study in drug development, regulatory persistence, and the evolution of clinical development strategies over time. It demonstrates how initial FDA rejections don't necessarily represent final outcomes, and how regulatory paths can evolve over nearly a decade. The tivozanib story illustrates broader themes about trial design, international clinical research, and the challenges smaller companies face when betting on single products, while also showing that persistence and adaptation can sometimes lead to eventual success.
