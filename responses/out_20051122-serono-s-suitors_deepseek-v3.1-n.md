# Serono's Suitors (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Serono, a large but low-profile privately held biotech company that had grown significantly due to its multiple sclerosis drug Rebif. The company had recently settled with the US government for $725 million over illegal marketing practices for Serostim, its growth hormone product for HIV-related wasting. Serono had promoted unapproved uses of Serostim through dubious diagnostic devices and direct physician kickbacks, including paying doctors based on prescription volume and funding vacations. With the scandal behind them, Serono faced the challenge of over-reliance on Rebif for revenue and had hired investment bankers, raising questions about potential acquisition suitors and whether any company would pay premium prices for a firm dependent on a single blockbuster drug nearing patent expiration.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Merck KGaA Acquisition (2006-2007):** In September 2006, just months after this article, German pharmaceutical company Merck KGaA (not to be confused with Merck & Co. in the US) announced it would acquire Serono for approximately $13.3 billion. The deal closed in January 2007, creating Merck Serono. This acquisition was driven by Merck KGaA's strategic pivot toward biotechnology and the desire to strengthen its pipeline with Rebif and other Serono assets.

**Rebif's Market Trajectory:** Rebif (interferon beta-1a) remained a significant multiple sclerosis treatment but faced increasing competition from newer oral therapies like Gilenya (fingolimod, approved 2010) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate, approved 2013). While Rebif maintained market share in the injectable MS space, the overall MS treatment landscape shifted toward oral and higher-efficacy options, constraining Rebif's peak sales potential.

**Merck Serono Restructuring:** In 2012, Merck KGaA announced major restructuring of its Merck Serono division, including significant job cuts and the relocation of its headquarters from Geneva to Darmstadt, Germany. The division continued to face challenges maintaining competitive R&D productivity and market position.

**Pipeline Evolution:** Following the acquisition, Merck Serono continued developing various biotech candidates but experienced mixed results typical of pharmaceutical pipelines, with some successes and notable failures across oncology, neurology, and rare disease indications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I'm not sure who's going to line up to buy them"**: Merck KGaA emerged as a willing buyer within months, contrary to the article's skepticism about acquisition interest, though it wasn't a company starting with "P" (perhaps the author was thinking Pfizer or other majors didn't materialize).

• **The suggestion that Rebif would be the primary acquisition rationale**: This proved accurate—Merck KGaA specifically cited Rebif's MS franchise and Serono's biotech platform as key strategic assets driving the acquisition decision.

• **Concern about buying "for nearly the highest price it's ever commanded"**: The $13.3 billion valuation reflected confidence in both immediate revenue streams and long-term biotech capabilities, though subsequent restructuring suggests integration and market challenges emerged.

• **Rebif patent life concerns**: While interferon-based MS treatments faced increased competition from newer mechanisms, Merck's established global marketing infrastructure likely helped maximize Rebif's commercial potential during its remaining patent-protected period.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article captures an important biotech M&A moment and correctly identifies Serono's core vulnerability (single-product dependency), but the imminent Merck KGaA acquisition and changing MS treatment landscape quickly dated its M&A skepticism. The $725 million settlement context provides lasting relevance regarding pharmaceutical marketing ethics.
