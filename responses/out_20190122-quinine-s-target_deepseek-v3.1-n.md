# Quinine's Target (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2019 article discusses a breakthrough in understanding how quinine, the classic antimalarial drug, actually works. Despite being used for centuries, quinine's molecular mechanism of action had remained unclear. A Singapore-Karolinska research collaboration used MS-CETSA (Mass Spectrometry-Cellular Thermal Shift Assay) technology to identify the target. The technique works by heating cells and measuring which proteins are stabilized when a drug binds, then using mass spectrometry to monitor the entire proteome for these stabilization patterns.

They discovered that quinine binds to *Plasmodium falciparum* purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PfPNP), an enzyme involved in the parasite's purine salvage pathway. The researchers obtained a crystal structure showing quinine bound to this target, providing visual confirmation. Interestingly, mefloquine also showed weaker binding to the same enzyme, while other antimalarials like chloroquine and primaquine did not, explaining why identifying this mechanism had been so difficult.

## 2. HISTORY  

The MS-CETSA target identification method has continued to develop and gain acceptance in the drug discovery field since 2019. Academic labs and pharmaceutical companies have increasingly adopted thermal shift-based approaches for target deconvolution, particularly for phenotypic screening hits where the mechanism is unknown.

Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) inhibitors have been investigated as antimalarials, building on earlier work referenced in the 2019 study. However, no PNP-targeting antimalarial drugs have reached widespread clinical use or FDA approval based on this mechanism since the article's publication. The drug development pipeline for malaria has remained challenging, with ongoing needs for new mechanisms due to resistance.

PfPNP has not emerged as a major validated drug target in malaria therapeutics post-2019. While the structural work provided important basic science insights, it has not translated into new approved therapies. The malaria field continues to rely primarily on artemisinin-based combination therapies, with resistance remaining a significant concern.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The article suggested that the mystery of quinine's mechanism was largely solved** - This appears accurate from a basic research perspective; subsequent literature has generally accepted PfPNP as a primary target, though quinine's pharmacology likely involves additional mechanisms.

• **Implicit prediction that understanding this mechanism could inform drug development** - While scientifically valuable, this has not led to new drugs or dramatically changed antimalarial development strategies in the following years.

• **Expectation that MS-CETSA would prove valuable for further target identification** - This has been validated; thermal shift assays have grown in use for target deconvolution in drug discovery programs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses an important historical question in pharmacology, but the findings have had limited translational impact or broader scientific influence. Basic mechanism elucidation for a legacy drug, while intellectually satisfying, ranks lower in long-term importance compared to discoveries driving new therapies or fundamental biological insights.
