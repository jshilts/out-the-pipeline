# Recent Clinical Trials (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This May 2015 commentary by Derek Lowe discusses a Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper analyzing clinical trials that began during the 2005-2009 period. The analysis covered over 14,000 trials and revealed several trends: industry sponsorship increased from under 60% to over 70%; oncology and CNS remained the two largest therapeutic areas, though oncology saw small decreases; anti-infectives (likely including Hepatitis C treatments) rose to overtake cardiovascular trials; and metabolic disease trials increased steadily.

A notable finding was that clinical trial lengths decreased across all three phases during this period, with Phase I showing the biggest reduction. However, the authors noted this decrease plateaued in 2008-2009, suggesting potential limits to acceleration. The regression analysis couldn't attribute the shortening to specific factors like therapeutic area, sponsor type, or trial phase. The article speculates on whether the trend continued and considers the cost implications of shorter trials, noting that while shorter trials should cost less, designing trials to run faster might increase setup expenses.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in the 2015 analysis continued to evolve with significant real-world implications:

**Industry Sponsorship**: The shift toward industry-sponsored trials accelerated further. By 2015-2020, industry funding accounted for approximately 75-80% of clinical trials, reflecting the growing complexity and cost of drug development that made academic centers increasingly dependent on pharmaceutical partnerships. This had concrete policy implications, including increased scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest and transparency requirements for clinical trial data.

**Oncology Trials**: Contrary to the small decreases noted in 2005-2009, oncology trials surged dramatically post-2015, driven by breakthrough developments in immuno-oncology (checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab and nivolumab received FDA approval around 2014-2015), CAR-T cell therapies (approved in 2017), and personalized cancer vaccines. The field became the dominant therapeutic area, with hundreds of trials initiated annually.

**Hepatitis C**: The article's mention of anti-infectives growth was prescient regarding Hep C. Direct-acting antivirals like sofosbuvir (approved in 2013) and combination therapies such as Harvoni (2014) revolutionized treatment, leading to cure rates exceeding 95%. However, this success story was soon tempered by pricing controversies and access restrictions that limited widespread patient uptake initially, though generic versions later improved accessibility.

**Trial Lengths**: The trend toward shorter trials did continue, particularly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on traditional trial designs. The pandemic necessitated decentralized and adaptive trial designs, which further reduced trial timelines. However, this compression created new challenges around data quality, regulatory complexity, and the balance between speed and thorough safety evaluation.

**Cost Dynamics**: The speculation about cost trade-offs proved accurate. While shorter trials did reduce some operational costs, the complexity of adaptive trial designs and requirements for real-world evidence actually increased overall drug development costs. The average cost to bring a drug to market continued climbing, reaching estimates of $2-3 billion by the late 2010s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I'll bet, though, that this hasn't [continued to decrease], for just those reaching-the-limits reasons mentioned above"** - **Incorrect**: Clinical trial lengths did continue to decrease, especially with the adoption of adaptive trial designs, real-world evidence incorporation, and the emergency acceleration driven by COVID-19 vaccine development. The compressed timelines for mRNA vaccine trials (Pfizer-BioNTech completed Phase III in approximately 8 months) demonstrated that the perceived limits were not absolute.

• **"There's only so much you can do to speed things up"** - **Partially correct but overly pessimistic**: While traditional trial designs did face practical limits, innovations in trial design (adaptive protocols, platform trials, basket trials), regulatory pathways (Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Priority Review), and technology adoption (wearables, telemedicine, AI-driven patient recruitment) collectively enabled meaningful acceleration beyond the 2005-2009 baseline.

• **Implicit prediction about cost balance**: **Accurate**: The trade-off between shorter trials and rising costs did manifest as predicted. While efficiency improvements reduced certain operational components, the increased complexity of regulatory requirements, need for biomarker testing, companion diagnostics, real-world evidence collection, and post-marketing commitments offset potential savings. The development of value-based pricing models further complicated cost calculations.

• **Implicit prediction that Hep C work drove anti-infectives growth**: **Confirmed but short-lived**: The Hepatitis C developments did indeed drive the growth mentioned, but by 2017-2018, with most patients treated, this category's growth plateaued and then declined, displaced by new infectious disease challenges (emerging pathogens, antimicrobial resistance) that required different investment patterns.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides useful historical data and thoughtful commentary on mid-2010s clinical trial trends, with accurate observations about trial length reduction and cost dynamics. While it captured important shifts, it underestimated the transformative potential of new trial methodologies and the dramatic therapeutic area rebalancing that followed, particularly the explosion in immuno-oncology.
