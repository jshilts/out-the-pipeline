# The Baran Group Blog (And Some Others?) (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short post from March 2013 announced that Phil Baran's research group at Scripps had launched a blog called "Open Flask" (http://openflask.blogspot.com/), where group members were posting content ranging from recent chemical synthesis work to lighter topics like jelly beans. The author welcomed Baran's group to the scientific blogging community and noted that their own blogroll was outdated and needed updating. The piece served primarily as both an announcement of a new chemistry blog and a call for readers to recommend other scientific websites worth including in an updated blogroll.

The article appears to be a typical informal science blog post from the early 2010s era of scientific blogging, focused on community-building and sharing resources rather than presenting research findings or scientific analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

The Open Flask blog appears to have been part of the broader movement of research groups and scientists maintaining active blogs in the 2010s. However, like many academic blogs from that period, it likely had a limited lifespan and audience reach. 

I do not have specific information about the long-term impact or continued operation of this particular blog, as this would require internet access to verify its current status, archive content, or measure its influence on the chemistry community. Academic blogs from this era varied widely in their longevity and impact—some became influential platforms, while others were abandoned as social media platforms and other communication channels evolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in science, biotechnology, or blogging. It was primarily an announcement and community update rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This brief blog post about another chemistry group's blog launch has minimal long-term importance for understanding the biotechnology industry or scientific developments. It serves mainly as a historical snapshot of early 2010s scientific blogging culture rather than addressing substantive scientific or biotech topics.
