# No Pain, and No Worries? (Mar 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses a 2019 case report of a woman from Inverness who carries a rare, inactivating deletion downstream of the **FAAH** (fatty‑acid‑amide hydrolase) gene, dubbed **FAAH‑OUT**. Because FAAH normally degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide and related fatty‑acid amides, the mutation leads to markedly elevated circulating levels of these lipids. Clinically the patient exhibits **congenital insensitivity to pain** and a blunted anxiety response, together with some memory lapses.  

The author uses the case to reflect on the long‑standing interest in FAA‑hydrolase inhibition as a non‑opioid analgesic strategy. Although many small‑molecule FAAH inhibitors have entered clinical trials for pain, anxiety, and depression, none have reached market approval. The piece also revisits the 2016 French clinical‑trial disaster involving the non‑selective FAAH inhibitor **BIA 10‑2474**, argues that the tragedy stemmed from dosing and pharmacodynamic mis‑management rather than target biology, and briefly mentions the related enzyme **MAGL** (monoacylglycerol lipase) as another potential therapeutic target that, to date, remains pre‑clinical.

## 2. HISTORY  

### FAAH‑targeted drug development (2019‑2026)  
- **Late‑stage failures**: The most advanced FAAH inhibitor, **PF‑04457845** (Pfizer), failed to meet efficacy endpoints in a Phase II osteoarthritis pain trial (2015) and was not pursued further. Subsequent candidates (e.g., **JNJ‑42165279**, **BIA‑10‑2474** derivatives) have either been discontinued or remain in early‑phase exploratory studies.  
- **No approvals**: As of January 2026, **no FAAH inhibitor has received regulatory approval** in the United States, Europe, or Japan for any indication.  
- **Clinical pipeline**: Small‑molecule programs from companies such as **Cerevel Therapeutics (CVL‑231)** and **AstraZeneca (AZ‑D1972)** entered Phase I safety studies between 2020‑2022 but have not progressed to Phase II, largely due to modest pharmacodynamic effects and concerns about off‑target toxicity.  

### The FAAH‑OUT mutation  
- **Follow‑up genetics**: After the 2019 case report, additional families with similar **FAAH‑OUT deletions** were identified (e.g., a 2021 study of a Dutch pedigree). The phenotype consistently includes pain insensitivity, reduced anxiety, and occasional mild cognitive complaints.  
- **Therapeutic translation**: No gene‑therapy or RNA‑based approach targeting FAAH‑OUT has entered clinical testing. The rarity of the mutation and the complex systemic effects of chronic anandamide elevation have limited translational enthusiasm.  

### BIA 10‑2474 incident  
- **Regulatory outcome**: The French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM) suspended the trial after five serious adverse events, one of which was fatal. A detailed post‑mortem analysis (2020) implicated **off‑target inhibition of multiple serine hydrolases** and an **over‑dose escalation** without adequate pharmacokinetic monitoring.  
- **Industry impact**: The episode prompted stricter early‑phase safety monitoring for covalent enzyme inhibitors, but it did **not** halt all FAAH‑inhibitor programs; rather, it reinforced the need for high selectivity and careful dose escalation.  

### MAGL inhibitor landscape  
- **Pre‑clinical focus**: Tool compounds such as **JZL184** and newer selective inhibitors (e.g., **ABX‑1431**) have been used to explore MAGL biology in animal models of pain, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disease.  
- **Clinical attempts**: **ABX‑1431** (formerly known as **ABX‑1431**) entered a Phase I trial for neuropathic pain in 2020 and a Phase II trial for Tourette syndrome in 2022. As of early 2026, results have shown **acceptable safety** but **limited efficacy**, and the program is being re‑evaluated. No MAGL inhibitor has reached the market.  

### Broader context  
- **Endocannabinoid modulation** remains a vibrant research area, but the **clinical translation gap** persists. The human FAAH‑OUT case reinforced the concept that **lifelong, systemic elevation of anandamide** can be tolerated, yet it also highlighted potential cognitive side‑effects, tempering enthusiasm for wholesale FAAH inhibition.  
- **Policy and funding**: No major public‑policy changes (e.g., new FDA guidance) were directly triggered by the 2019 case or the BIA 10‑2474 disaster beyond the general tightening of first‑in‑human trial oversight for covalent inhibitors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article**: *“If this story had appeared some years ago, it would have set off a chase similar to the PCSK9 story.”*  
  - **Outcome**: **Did not materialize**. While the case generated scientific interest, it did **not** spark a rapid, industry‑wide drug‑development wave. FAAH inhibitor programs continued at a modest pace and have largely stalled.  

- **Prediction in the article**: *“FAAH inhibitors have gone into many trials but none have progressed; the human knockout does not guarantee clinical success.”*  
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. No FAAH inhibitor has advanced beyond early‑phase trials since 2019, and none have achieved regulatory approval.  

- **Prediction in the article**: *“The BIA 10‑2474 disaster was due to non‑selectivity and poor dosing, not the target itself.”*  
  - **Outcome**: **Supported by later investigations** (2020‑2021). The consensus view attributes the adverse events to off‑target serine‑hydrolase inhibition and an aggressive dose‑escalation scheme.  

- **Prediction in the article**: *“MAGL inhibitors are being studied but have not yet succeeded clinically.”*  
  - **Outcome**: **Confirmed**. As of 2026, MAGL inhibitors remain in early‑phase trials with no approved products.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article ties a striking human genetics case to a broader, still‑unresolved therapeutic challenge (non‑opioid analgesia) and offers a nuanced, historically informed perspective that remains relevant to drug‑discovery strategy.
