# In Hoc Signo Non Vinces (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The author confesses to a long-standing prejudice in medicinal chemistry: an outright refusal to use naphthalene-containing compounds in drug design. He views naphthalene groups as "potency through greasiness"—compromising solubility, inflating molecular weight, and risking unfavorable metabolites, all for a modest in vitro activity boost. He extends similar suspicion to cyclohexyl groups, arguing that researchers often add these hydrophobic "slabs of lard" as quick structure–activity relationship (SAR) placeholders, then struggle to replace them later. In his view, this is wasteful: SAR campaigns are long, and medicinal chemists should screen only molecules likely to yield developable leads from the start (e.g., tetrahydropyranyl instead of cyclohexyl). While acknowledging successful naphthalene drugs like naproxen, he maintains a strict "No Naphthyls" policy—optimizing for quality over convenience and publishability.

## 2. HISTORY

From 2010 to the present, the tension between lipophilic binding groups and developability has persisted, with many of the author's concerns validated but his rigid rule generally not adopted.
- **Fragment-to-lead strategies and crystallography** gained prominence in the early 2010s, encouraging researchers to start from small, soluble fragments and add binding elements surgically rather than troweling on grease. Even so, lipophilic groups such as cycloalkyls and aromatics remained common anchors to pick up binding affinity in hit-to-lead work.
- **Solubility and permeability prediction tools** (e.g., LogP/LogD calculators, in silico solubility models) became routine in project informatics; computational alerts for high lipophilicity and poor solubility are now standard gatekeepers before synthesis. However, potency gains from hydrophobic contacts often kept lipophilic groups in the running.
- **Practical outcomes remained pragmatic**: While most discovery chemists accept the risks of naphthyls, they continue to appear in SAR. For example, naphthyl ethers and amides are present in numerous bioactive molecules and development candidates (e.g., some kinase programs). Cyclohexyl is ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and is often retained in drug candidates if it proves essential for potency and selectivity.
- **The broader trend toward "escape from flatland"** (3D-rich, saturated building blocks) grew after 2010. Yet industry practice rarely imposed outright taboos—instead, researchers monitor lipophilicity, plan isosteric replacements early, and deprioritize greasy hits in lead optimization.
- **Targeted protein degradation** (PROTACs) took off in the mid-2010s, where high molecular weight and lipophilicity are accepted tradeoffs for efficacy, and naphthalene-containing linkers or E3 ligase recruiters are not uncommon. This subfield explicitly tolerates physicochemical liabilities that the author would reject.

In short, the author's concerns proved prescient for developability risks, but a blanket "No Naphthyls" rule did not become industry standard. Most teams mitigate risks through multiparameter optimization and computational flagging rather than hard structural taboos.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **SAR is long, and life is short**: True in spirit, but the response differed by context. Industrial timelines remain pressured, yet lipophilic hits are still pursued when they offer clear affinity advantages, with follow-up optimization intended to dial back the hydrophobicity.
- **Cyclohexyl will need replacing by THP (tetrahydropyranyl) later**: THP and other polarity-building isosteres are now standard tool-kit replacements for cyclohexyl when feasible. However, many programs still retain cyclohexyl if it is essential for potency and selectivity—pragmatism often outweighs dogma.
- **Just making the THP derivative in the first place** would save time: This viewpoint has become more common, especially in fragment-based design and early hit exploration, where quality matters over volume. Even so, many teams still run cyclohexyl/naphthyl analogs as part of broad SAR sweeps to map the pocket, then replace them selectively post-validation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

An entertaining polemic with some practical validity, but too narrow and idiosyncratic to rank highly against broader advances in drug design and discovery. It reflects a medicinal chemist's personal heuristic rather than a pivotal insight that reshaped practice.
