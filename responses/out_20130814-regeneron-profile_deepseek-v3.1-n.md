# A Regeneron Profile (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This Forbes profile highlights Regeneron's transformation under CEO Leonard Schleifer and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos, two scientists from Queens who built the company with a disciplined approach to drug discovery. The article emphasizes key lessons from Roy Vagelos (former Merck CEO who became Regeneron's chairman), particularly focusing on: (1) avoiding drugs where efficacy cannot be predicted until after expensive clinical trials—specifically avoiding neuroscience expansion and Alzheimer's, which many other companies were abandoning; and (2) balancing early-stage discovery with robust human testing to understand both disease biology and unexpected side effects. The company applied these principles to mitigate the two primary reasons drugs fail.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 article, Regeneron continued its disciplined approach with significant real-world outcomes:

**Eylea (aflibercept)**: Already approved for wet AMD in 2011, it gained multiple additional indications and became a blockbuster drug with peak annual sales exceeding \$8 billion by 2021, demonstrating sustained clinical adoption.

**Dupixent (dupilumab)**: Approved in 2017 for atopic dermatitis (eczema), this became Regeneron's most successful drug with sales growing to over \$11 billion by 2023. It received additional approvals for asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis.

**Praluent (alirocumab)**: The PCSK9 inhibitor approved in 2015 for cholesterol management faced commercial challenges despite clinical efficacy—sales remained modest compared to expectations, reflecting market access and pricing issues common with new biologic therapies.

**COVID-19 response**: Regeneron developed REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), which received Emergency Use Authorization in 2020 but faced reduced effectiveness against variants and was deauthorized in 2022, demonstrating both rapid-response capabilities and the unpredictability of pandemic science.

The strategy of avoiding neuroscience targets largely persisted, with most industry players continuing to struggle with Alzheimer's drug development despite ongoing efforts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Avoiding neuroscience bets when outcomes are unpredictable**: The strategy of not expanding into neuroscience due to unpredictable clinical trials largely proved wise. Most Alzheimer's drugs continued to fail in later-stage trials through 2023, with only a few modestly successful therapies emerging. The prediction that companies would keep abandoning Alzheimer's work was partially true—there were notable withdrawals but also continued investment by some players.

- **Focusing on both early discovery and human testing**: This balanced approach appeared validated by Regeneron's subsequent track record, with fewer late-stage failures than many competitors.

- **Understanding disease biology to reduce failure**: The emphasis on biological understanding seemed prescient given the continued high failure rates in drug development across the industry, particularly in complex diseases.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7.5/10**

The article provides a valuable case study of how the disciplined approach it describes actually played out, with both major successes (Dupixent) and instructive challenges (Praluent), though it focuses mainly on one company's strategy and doesn't capture broader biotech trends beyond drug development methodology.
