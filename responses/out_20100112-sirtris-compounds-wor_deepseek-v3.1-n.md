# The Sirtris Compounds: Worthless? Really? (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 article discusses growing doubts about the scientific foundation of GlaxoSmithKline's $720 million acquisition of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals in 2008. Sirtris had been developing resveratrol-like compounds targeting sirtuins (particularly SIRT1), with potential applications for diabetes and aging. The article highlights two major challenges: first, a study from Amgen suggesting that SIRT1/resveratrol effects might be experimental artifacts from fluorescent peptide assays, and second, new research from Pfizer published in the *Journal of Biological Chemistry* demonstrating that Sirtris's compounds (including SRT1720) appeared to activate SIRT1 only with artificial fluorogenic substrates—not with native peptide substrates. Pfizer's team found that these compounds bind to the SIRT1-fluorophore complex rather than SIRT1 itself, and their *in vivo* experiments failed to reproduce Sirtris's reported efficacy in diabetic mouse models. At higher doses, SRT1720 caused weight effects and death, while lower doses showed no improvement in diabetic parameters and instead increased feeding and weight gain. The article questions whether these findings render the compounds "worthless" and what this means for GSK's high-profile investment.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication, the Sirtris story continued to unfold with mixed outcomes:

**Scientific Community's Response**: The concerns raised in the article proved largely accurate. Multiple research groups confirmed that sirtuin-activating compounds (including resveratrol and synthetic molecules like SRT1720) showed artifactual activation in assays using fluorescent substrates, leading many to conclude that specific, direct SIRT1 activation by small molecules remained unproven *in vitro*.

**Clinical Development and Regulatory Outcomes**:
- GSK ultimately halted or reprioritized much of Sirtris's original clinical pipeline. The company discontinued several SRT1-activator programs (including SRT2104) after outcomes failed to meet efficacy targets in Phase II trials across various conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk, inflammatory diseases, age-related disorders).
- Some Sirtris programs did advance. SRT2104, for instance, reached late-stage trials for psoriasis and other indications, but these generally did not lead to FDA approval or widespread clinical adoption.

**FDA Approvals and Patient Uptake**: No Sirtris-originated sirtuin activator received FDA approval for anti-diabetic or anti-aging indications. Resveratrol itself remains available as a dietary supplement but has not achieved regulatory approval as a therapeutic.

**Business Impact**:
- GSK took significant write-downs related to the Sirtris acquisition, reflecting both the scientific challenges and lack of clinical success. By the mid-2010s, many original Sirtris programs had been terminated or de-prioritized within GSK's portfolio.
- Sirtris's founder, David Sinclair, continued to pursue sirtuin-related research at Harvard and through other ventures, but the initial high-profile promise did not translate into blockbuster drugs or widespread therapeutic application.

**Public Policy and Broader Implications**: The FDA did not establish a formal "anti-aging" regulatory framework. Meanwhile, broader interest in aging biology and metabolic interventions spurred continued research, but concrete, proven pharmacological interventions remained elusive for years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, but it raised critical questions and highlighted existing uncertainties:

- **Sirtris/GSK Response**: The article anticipated follow-up commentary from GSK regarding Pfizer's findings. GSK did eventually respond, generally defending the acquisition's rationale while gradually winding down or redirecting programs amid clinical setbacks.
- **"Worthless" Compounds**: Though initially framed as potentially "worthless," the compounds did advance into clinical trials but largely failed to demonstrate robust efficacy, lending weight to the skeptics' concerns about their mechanism and value.
- **Sirtuin Activation as a Druggable Target**: The field faced broader questions about whether small-molecule SIRT1 activation was truly achievable and therapeutically relevant. In subsequent years, many research efforts shifted focus toward understanding sirtuin biology in more nuanced contexts rather than pursuing direct activators for diabetes or aging.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addressed critical questions about a high-profile, high-cost biotechnology acquisition at a crucial moment, highlighting discrepancies between published claims and independent verification that foreshadowed clinical failures and strategic reassessments. Its skepticism proved prescient and informs ongoing discourse about drug development rigor and target validation.
