# Thoughts on What Used to Be Schering-Plough (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The author reflects on Merck's acquisition of Schering-Plough in November 2009, drawing from personal experience working at Schering-Plough in the late 1980s/early 1990s. He describes the constant merger rumors that permeated the company during his tenure there, illustrating this with an anecdote about a false 1992 rumor that Schering-Plough would merge with Upjohn. The article expresses skepticism about pharmaceutical mega-mergers generally, arguing that large companies face slower decision-making, bureaucratic inertia, and groupthink that can lead to poor strategic choices. The author cites Pfizer's inhaled insulin disaster (Exubera) as evidence that large organizations can convince themselves of flawed ideas despite external skepticism. While wishing well for both Merck and former Schering-Plough employees, the author expresses regret that such consolidations continue happening in the industry.

## 2. HISTORY

**Merck/Schering-Plough Merger Aftermath**: The $41 billion merger was completed in November 2009, creating the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company at the time. The combined entity faced significant integration challenges and cost-cutting measures typical of such consolidations.

**Post-Merger Restructuring**: Merck subsequently announced major layoffs totaling approximately 15,000-16,000 positions as part of integration efforts. The company maintained a strong presence in areas like cardiovascular drugs (inheriting Schering-Plough's Zetia/Vytorin franchise), but faced patent cliffs on key products.

**Pipeline and Regulatory Outcomes**: Several drugs mentioned or implied in the merger context experienced mixed results:
- **Vytorin/Zetia**: Continued to generate substantial revenue but faced ongoing questions about efficacy and cost-effectiveness
- The merger did not prevent generic competition from eroding revenue from blockbuster drugs

**Merck's Subsequent Performance**: Merck remained a top-tier pharmaceutical company but continued facing the fundamental challenges the author identified - the need for constant R&D productivity while managing large-company bureaucracy. Like other majors, Merck pursued additional acquisitions and partnerships to bolster its pipeline.

**Industry Trend Validation**: The author's broader critique of pharmaceutical mega-mergers proved prescient. Large mergers continued (Pfizer-Wyeth 2009, AbbVie spin-off 2013, numerous others), but often failed to deliver promised synergies or sustainable R&D productivity improvements. The fundamental tension between size/efficiency and innovative agility remained unresolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit and Explicit Predictions:**

• **Prediction**: Large pharmaceutical mergers don't generally work out "to the benefit of everyone involved"
  - **Outcome**: **Mostly Accurate**. Post-merger evidence showed that while mergers achieved cost-cutting and temporary financial benefits, they rarely solved underlying R&D productivity problems. The promised "synergies" often resulted in job cuts and reduced research diversity rather than breakthrough innovation.

• **Prediction**: Merck/Schering-Plough would face delayed, drawn-out decision-making and slow strategic clarity
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. The integration process was indeed protracted, with restructuring announcements continuing years after the merger. Like Pfizer's slow post-merger adjustments mentioned in the article, Merck's integration followed a similar pattern of gradual, painful adaptation.

• **Prediction**: Big companies are more prone to groupthink and can convince themselves of poor ideas (citing Pfizer's Exubera)
  - **Outcome**: **Consistently Supported**. The pharma industry continued seeing examples of expensive failures that suggested institutional groupthink, including other late-stage trial failures and products that underperformed despite massive investment.

• **Prediction**: Mega-companies don't solve the fundamental challenges of drug discovery productivity
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Despite numerous large mergers in the 2010s, R&D productivity challenges persisted across the industry, with high failure rates and expensive development costs remaining endemic problems.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While focused on a specific historical moment, this article captures enduring truths about pharmaceutical industry consolidation and organizational dynamics that remain relevant. The author's insider perspective provides genuine insight into how merger discussions actually unfold within companies.
