# All Those Drug-Likeness Papers: A Bit Too Neat to be True? (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary discusses a critical paper by Peter Kenny and Carlos Montanari challenging the statistical rigor of "drug-likeness" research, particularly work building on Lipinski's Rule of Five. The authors argued that many published studies had exaggerated correlations between molecular properties (like lipophilicity, molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors) and drug success by using problematic data analysis methods.

The critique focused on several specific issues: the inappropriate binning of continuous data into averaged categories, showing correlations between median values rather than actual data points, and creating oversimplified "rules of thumb" that predict abrupt property changes at arbitrary cutoff values. The authors questioned papers like the "Escape from flatland" (2009) and "ADMET rules of thumb" (2008) studies, noting that such analyses could mislead drug discovery teams into adopting overly restrictive design criteria, thereby limiting innovation while appearing scientifically rigorous.

Kenny and Montanari emphasized they weren't dismissing the importance of physicochemical properties, but rather calling for more honest assessment of correlation strengths and avoidance of statistical artifacts that make weak trends appear robust.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 critique had significant impact on how the field approached drug-likeness modeling and property-based design guidelines:

**Methodological Changes**: Following this critique, research groups became more cautious about binning continuous property data and more rigorous in reporting actual correlation strengths rather than just statistical significance. Studies increasingly included primary datasets as supplementary materials and avoided over-interpretation of weak trends.

**Lipinski Rule Evolution**: Rather than abandoning property-based guidelines, the field moved toward more nuanced approaches. Research showed that while Lipinski's Rule of Five remained relevant for orally administered drugs, many successful drugs violated these rules. Analyses revealed that the pharmaceutical industry's compound libraries had become larger and more lipophilic over time, prompting reevaluation of optimal property ranges.

**Practical Impact**: Pharmaceutical companies began adopting more flexible, context-dependent property guidelines rather than rigid cutoffs. The critique contributed to a shift away from universal "drug-likeness" scores toward project-specific property optimization. This didn't lead to specific FDA-approved drugs directly, but influenced how drug discovery teams approached molecular design and screening library curation.

**Continued Relevance of Core Properties**: Despite the statistical concerns raised, lipophilicity, molecular weight, and hydrogen bonding remained central to drug design. However, the field became more sophisticated in understanding when and how these properties mattered, with better appreciation for nonlinear relationships and therapeutic area-specific considerations.

The paper stimulated ongoing debate about data analysis standards in medicinal chemistry publications and contributed to higher standards for statistical rigor in the field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2013 article contained several implicit predictions and recommendations:

• **That overly rigid property cutoffs would hinder drug discovery** - This proved largely accurate. The following decade saw successful drugs approved that violated Lipinski rules, including many kinase inhibitors, CNS drugs, and biologics, validating the need for flexible guidelines rather than rigid cutoffs.

• **That the field needed smaller, local datasets rather than universal rules** - This approach gained traction, with many groups developing target-class-specific or therapeutic-area-specific property guidelines, though universal screening rules remained in use for early-stage libraries.

• **That correlation inflation would yield initiative to "hungrier, more agile competitors"** - Partially accurate. Smaller biotech companies did prove more willing to explore challenging chemical space, though large pharma also adapted by adopting more sophisticated computational approaches rather than simple rule-based filtering.

• **That the critique would "stimulate debate"** - Successfully achieved. The paper became widely cited and influenced how subsequent drug-likeness studies were conducted and reviewed.

• **That simplicity in drug-likeness models might indicate irrelevance** - This perspective gained acceptance, with the field recognizing that genuinely predictive models often require multiple parameters and nonlinear relationships rather than simple cutoff rules.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addressed a critical methodological issue in pharmaceutical research that had real impact on how drug discovery was conducted. It successfully challenged widespread practices and contributed to more rigorous statistical standards in the field.
