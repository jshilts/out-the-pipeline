# Good Fortune Smiles On Someone's Onyx Option Trades (July 2013)

## 1. Summary

This commentary article discusses suspicious options trading activity surrounding Amgen's acquisition offer for Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013. The piece highlights that in the days leading up to the acquisition announcement, there was unusually high volume in Onyx call options, particularly July call options that were nearly expired and worth only $1-2 before the news. Following the acquisition announcement, these same options surged to approximately $30, representing a massive overnight profit. The article notes that trading analytics firm Trade Alert observed call volumes more than double the normal level, with their president describing the activity as "suspect" and suggesting the buyers may have had advance knowledge of the deal. The author speculates this type of activity would likely draw SEC investigation.

## 2. History

Following the July 2013 article, Amgen successfully completed its acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals in October 2013 for approximately $10.4 billion. The deal centered primarily on Onyx's multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis (carfilzomib), which had received FDA approval in 2012. 

Regarding the suspicious options trading mentioned in the article, I cannot provide specific details about any SEC investigations or outcomes from this particular case, as such regulatory investigations are typically not publicly disclosed unless they result in enforcement actions. The pharmaceutical industry has unfortunately seen numerous instances of insider trading violations over the years, particularly around major drug approvals and acquisitions, but I do not have confident knowledge of the specific outcome of this Onyx options investigation.

In terms of the actual business impact, Kyprolis went on to become an important treatment for multiple myeloma, generating substantial revenue for Amgen. However, I should note that I do not have precise current revenue figures or market share data for this specific drug readily available.

## 3. Predictions

The article made the following prediction/implication:

**Prediction**: The article strongly implied/anticipated that the suspicious options trading activity would trigger an SEC investigation, stating "they're going to need it in order to persuade anyone that good luck was all that was involved."

**Actual outcome**: While I cannot definitively confirm whether the SEC actually investigated this specific case (SEC investigations are typically not publicly disclosed unless enforcement actions result), such unusual options activity preceding major M&A announcements would indeed be consistent with the types of cases that commonly draw regulatory scrutiny. The broader pattern the article identified—that sudden, well-timed options gains before major biopharma events often indicate insider trading—has been repeatedly validated by numerous SEC enforcement actions in subsequent years across the industry.

## 4. Interest

Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an important but narrow aspect of biopharmaceutical industry dynamics—insider trading around M&A—rather than the scientific breakthroughs or clinical outcomes that typically have broader industry impact. While suspicious trading is a significant compliance and ethics issue, the article's long-term relevance is limited compared to pieces discussing actual biotechnology innovations or therapeutic advances.
