# Analysis of "A Bit More Realism in Consulting" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques two management consulting reports about the pharmaceutical industry, contrasting McKinsey's optimistic assessment of big drug mergers with a more realistic Deloitte analysis. The author highlights Deloitte's finding that while FDA approvals were increasing (39 new molecular entities in 2012, the highest since 1996), the underlying economics of pharmaceutical R&D were deteriorating significantly. Key concerning trends included: R&D returns declining since 2010, development costs rising 18% from $1.094 billion to $1.290 billion (2010-2013), and forecasted peak sales per asset plummeting over 40% from $816 million to $466 million over the same period. The article presents a nuanced view - not "relentlessly gloomy" but certainly challenging, ending with a skeptical reference to biosimilars in China as one potential bright spot that sounds almost too good to be true.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in 2014 have largely persisted and in some cases accelerated:

**R&D Productivity Crisis Deepened**: The period 2014-2020 saw continued struggles with pharmaceutical R&D productivity. While FDA approvals remained relatively strong (averaging around 40-50 per year), the fundamental economics didn't improve dramatically. Development costs continued rising, with some estimates by 2020 showing average costs approaching $2-3 billion per approved drug when failures are included.

**Patent Cliff Impact**: The 2010-2015 period represented one of the largest patent expiration waves in pharmaceutical history, with drugs like Lipitor, Plavix, and Singulair losing exclusivity, removing over $50 billion in annual revenue from major companies. This exacerbated the revenue pressure that Deloitte identified.

**Biosimilars Market Evolution**: Contrary to the article's somewhat skeptical tone about "Biosimilars...in China!", the biosimilars market did develop significantly post-2014, though growth was more measured than explosive. The US biosimilars market finally gained momentum after regulatory pathway clarity, but uptake remained slower than in Europe.

**Industry Restructuring Continued**: The merger trend continued with major deals like Pfizer-Allergan (attempted, 2016), Bristol-Myers Squibb-Celgene (2019), and AbbVie-Allergan (2019), suggesting companies continued pursuing scale as a response to the pressures Deloitte identified.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions**:
- The R&D productivity crisis was real and persistent - development costs did continue rising
- Patent expirations created sustained revenue pressure throughout the 2010s
- The industry faced genuine economic headwinds that required strategic responses
- Mergers and consolidation continued as companies sought scale and efficiency

**Incorrect or Overstated Predictions**:
- The "Biosimilars...in China!" opportunity was more nuanced - while biosimilars grew, the market development was slower and more complex than implied
- The article may have underestimated the industry's adaptive capacity - companies did find ways to maintain profitability through portfolio optimization, specialty drugs, and international expansion
- The implied skepticism about McKinsey's merger optimism may have been too harsh - while mergers didn't solve all problems, they did help companies achieve necessary scale and portfolio rationalization

**Partially Correct**:
- FDA approvals remained relatively strong, suggesting the regulatory environment wasn't the primary constraint
- The fundamental tension between rising R&D costs and revenue pressure persisted, validating Deloitte's core analysis
- The need for new business models became increasingly apparent, leading to more focus on rare diseases, precision medicine, and outcomes-based pricing

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 8/9**

This article falls in the 80-89th percentile of interest and importance. While it's a relatively short industry commentary rather than a major research piece, it captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical industry evolution with remarkable prescience. The analysis correctly identified structural challenges that would define the next decade of pharmaceutical strategy and accurately questioned industry hype while highlighting genuine insights from sober analysis. The article's value lies not just in its specific predictions but in exemplifying how to critically evaluate industry reports and separate genuine trends from consultant optimism. Its framing of the R&D productivity crisis as a fundamental business model challenge rather than a temporary issue proved highly insightful, making it a valuable piece of business and industry analysis that has aged well.
