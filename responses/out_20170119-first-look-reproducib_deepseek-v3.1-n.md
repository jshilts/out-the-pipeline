# A First Look at Reproducibility in Cancer Biology (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the initial results from the Reproducibility Project (Cancer Biology), an initiative attempting to replicate findings from high-profile cancer biology studies. The project initially aimed to reproduce 50 prominent papers but had to scale back to 29. The first five published results showed mixed outcomes: two papers (cimetidine as an antitumor agent from *Science Translational Medicine* and BET bromodomain inhibition from *Cell*) reproduced reasonably well but with statistical caveats; two others were inconclusive due to experimental complications; and one (*Science* paper on iRGD peptide enhancing doxorubicin tumor penetration) failed to reproduce completely.

The author notes that the iRGD paper's original author, Erkki Ruoslahti, disputed the reproducibility failure, claiming his work had been successfully reproduced in multiple other labs. The article concludes that cancer biology replication faces inherent challenges due to experimental complexity, undocumented variables, and insufficient methodological detail in original publications. However, the project cannot distinguish between non-reproducibility due to technical issues versus fundamentally invalid findings.

## 2. HISTORY
The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CB), launched in 2013 by the Center for Open Science, systematically attempted to replicate findings from 53 high-impact cancer biology papers published between 2010-2012. The project's final results, published after this blog post, confirmed significant reproducibility issues.

**Completion and Final Outcomes (2017-2021):** 
By 2021, the project had completed replication attempts on 50 of the original 53 papers. The findings revealed that only **46% of the original effects were successfully replicated**, with most replication effect sizes being substantially smaller than originally reported. Approximately 32% of replication attempts provided inconclusive evidence rather than clear success or failure. The project identified inadequate methodological reporting in original papers as a major barrier—only 40% of the studies provided sufficient detail for direct replication.

**Field-Specific Impact:**
The cancer biology reproducibility crisis accelerated several concrete changes. Major journals including *Nature*, *Science*, and *Cell* implemented more stringent data availability requirements and methodological reporting standards. Funding agencies like the NIH began mandating more detailed experimental design documentation in grant applications. Training programs emerged to improve research rigor, and institutions established research quality assurance offices.

**Commercial and Clinical Consequences:**
The reproducibility issues had tangible impacts on drug development. Pharmaceutical companies reported increased preclinical failure rates due to inability to reproduce published academic findings, contributing to the recognized "Valley of Death" between academic discovery and clinical translation. Some companies responded by creating internal validation labs dedicated to reproducing key academic findings before committing resources. The crisis particularly affected early-stage biotech startups that had built their scientific foundations on published papers that couldn't be reproduced.

Contrary to some expectations, however, the reproducibility crisis did not fundamentally derail the cancer drug development pipeline, which continued advancing with more cautious validation approaches. FDA approval rates for oncology drugs remained relatively stable, though development timelines may have increased due to more extensive validation requirements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction that reproducibility problems would be revealed**: This was **confirmed**. The project's final results showed only 46% replication rate, validating concerns about reproducibility issues in the field.

• **Implicit prediction that failed replications might indicate fundamentally invalid science**: This was **partially accurate but overly simplistic**. Later research showed most failures stemmed from technical complexities rather than scientific misconduct or completely invalid findings. The line between technical and fundamental failure remained blurry.

• **Prediction that original papers lacked sufficient detail for replication**: This was **strongly confirmed**. The project's systematic documentation revealed widespread deficiencies in methodological reporting across top-tier journals.

• **Prediction that the project wouldn't answer fundamental questions about invalid vs. technical failures**: This was **proved prescient**. The RP:CB project struggled to draw clear conclusions about why studies failed to replicate, and the field continues debating how to distinguish genuine scientific invalidity from technical replication challenges.

• **Author's skepticism about whether reproducibility findings would surprise working biologists**: This was **validated**. Most responses from the research community acknowledged that the findings confirmed what experienced researchers already suspected about experimental variability in cancer biology.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **7/10**
This article warrants a high interest rating because it documented early evidence of systematic reproducibility problems that catalyzed major reforms across cancer biology and shaped ongoing debates about research quality. The issues identified had concrete downstream effects on drug development, publishing standards, and funding policies.
