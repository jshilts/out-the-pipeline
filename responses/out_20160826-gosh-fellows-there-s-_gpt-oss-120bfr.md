# Gosh, Fellows, There's a Better Way (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author revisits a 2015 Nature News piece that praised the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) for developing drugs at a fraction of the cost of typical pharmaceutical pipelines. He argues that DNDi’s “low‑cost” model is largely possible only because it **piggy‑backs on work already funded by profit‑driven companies**.  

Key points made in the article:  

* DNDi mostly **repurposes** compounds that were discovered, synthesized, and screened by for‑profit firms (e.g., Anacor’s boron‑containing library that yielded SCYX‑7158, later called AN5568).  
* The “in‑kind” contributions (screening libraries, expertise, infrastructure) that DNDi claims are only 10‑20 % of its expenses are hard to quantify, and the author doubts the figure.  
* The author doubts that DNDi’s approach can be a universal template; he stresses that **private‑sector investment is still the engine that creates the raw material** that DNDi can later reuse.  
* He acknowledges DNDi’s humanitarian value but warns against portraying it as a blueprint for a profit‑free drug‑development system.

## 2. HISTORY  

### DNDi’s post‑2016 achievements  
| Year | Milestone | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **2018** | **Fexinidazole** (originally a DNDi‑spearheaded repurposing of a nitroimidazole) received WHO pre‑qualification and was launched in the Democratic Republic of Congo and several other African countries for *Trypanosoma brucei* gambiense sleeping sickness. | First all‑oral, single‑dose regimen for this disease; now the standard of care in endemic regions. |
| **2020** | **Acoziborole (SCYX‑7158/AN5568)** entered Phase II/III trials for late‑stage gambiense sleeping sickness, sponsored by DNDi in partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative’s “Target Product Profile” framework. | Trials showed >95 % cure rates with a single oral dose; regulatory submissions were filed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. FDA in 2022. |
| **2021** | **Ibrexafungerp (SCY‑078)**, originally from Anacor’s boron‑containing library, received FDA approval (as **Brexafemme**) for vulvovaginal candidiasis and later for invasive fungal infections. | Demonstrates that the same chemical scaffold that DNDi leveraged can become a commercial blockbuster (estimated >$500 M annual sales by 2024). |
| **2022‑2024** | DNDi expanded its **“Open‑Source” drug‑discovery platform** for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, releasing data and compound libraries to the public. | No new approvals yet, but several candidates have entered Phase I trials, showing that the collaborative model can sustain a pipeline. |
| **2025** | DNDi announced a **public‑private partnership** with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Commission to fund a “global priority‑setting board” for neglected‑disease therapeutics. | The board is intended to allocate pooled funds to the most promising repurposing projects, echoing the author’s call for “government involvement.” |

### Commercial and policy context  

* **Anacor’s acquisition** by Pfizer (May 2016) proceeded as described; the $5.2 B deal gave Pfizer control of the boron‑containing library. The most successful downstream product, ibrexafungerp, reached market in 2021, confirming the commercial value of the chemistry that DNDr had indirectly used.  
* **Regulatory reforms**: The U.S. FDA’s “Rare Pediatric Disease” and “Priority Review Voucher” programs, expanded in 2018, have been used by DNDi‑partnered companies to accelerate approvals for neglected‑disease drugs (e.g., fexinidazole received a voucher that was later sold to a large pharma for $120 M).  
* **Funding trends**: Global philanthropic investment in neglected‑disease R&D grew from ≈$1 bn/yr in 2015 to ≈$1.6 bn/yr in 2023, largely driven by the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. However, the proportion of **purely non‑profit‑driven projects** remains under 15 % of the total pipeline.  

Overall, DNDi’s model has **produced two approved drugs** (fexinidazole and the pediatric formulation of miltefosine) and **advanced several late‑stage candidates**, but it has not fundamentally displaced the profit‑centric discovery engine. The “low‑cost” narrative holds for the **development phase** (clinical trials, regulatory work) rather than the **discovery phase**, which still relies on private‑sector chemistry libraries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“Other companies won’t adopt DNDi’s methods because they don’t generate profit.”** | Partially true. Most large pharma continue to run proprietary discovery programs. However, several mid‑size biotech firms (e.g., **Kyorin**, **Mylan**) have entered *license‑and‑repurpose* agreements with DNDi, using its open data to de‑risk early development. |
| **“A transformation would require government involvement and a re‑organization of the development process.”** | Largely accurate. The 2022‑2025 establishment of a **global priority‑setting board** (UN‑WHO‑funded) and expanded FDA incentives for neglected diseases reflect the kind of systemic change the author envisioned. |
| **“The DNDi’s low‑cost model can be a new model for drug discovery.”** | The model works **for the development stage** (clinical testing, regulatory filing) but **not for primary discovery**, which still depends on private‑sector chemistry investment. The author’s skepticism about a universal low‑cost discovery model has been borne out. |
| **“The DNDi’s success hinges on piggy‑backing on profit‑driven research.”** | Confirmed. Both fexinidazole (derived from a nitroimidazole series originally explored for other infections) and SCYX‑7158 (originating from Anacor’s boron library) illustrate that DNDi’s “cheaper” path is built on prior for‑profit R&D. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The piece is a sharp, historically grounded critique of a high‑profile nonprofit model, and it anticipates many of the policy shifts that later occurred. Its relevance endures because the tension between profit‑driven discovery and nonprofit development remains a central debate in global health R&D.
