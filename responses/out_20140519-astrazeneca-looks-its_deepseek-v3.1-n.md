# AstraZeneca Looks At Its Own History, And Cringes (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

AstraZeneca published an internal review in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery examining its small-molecule drug projects from 2005-2010, identifying systemic problems in their R&D approach. The company's leadership acknowledged that a volume-based strategy—prioritizing numerical goals like increasing the number of candidates entering clinical development—had backfired severely. They proposed the "Five R's" framework (right target, right patient, right tissue, right safety, right commercial potential) and emphasized the need for the "right culture."

The analysis revealed that while AstraZeneca's preclinical and Phase I performance was comparable or better than industry averages, Phase II failure rates were significantly higher, suggesting poor project selection. Safety and toxicity issues were the dominant cause of failures, with 75% of preclinical safety closures being compound-related rather than target-related. The review documented how pressure to meet volume targets led to "progression-driven" behaviors rather than "truth-seeking" scientific inquiry, resulting in projects advancing too far before being halted and a bloated portfolio with approximately 50% back-up molecules that failed for the same reasons as lead compounds.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2014 analysis, AstraZeneca underwent substantial R&D transformation. The company restructured its pipeline and research approach based on the findings, which coincided with broader industry recognition of these systemic issues. Pharmaceutical R&D productivity metrics did not dramatically improve industry-wide in the subsequent years (2014-2020), though companies increasingly shifted toward more targeted approaches and biomarker-driven drug development.

The specific framework of the "Five R's" did not become a widely adopted industry standard or significantly influence public policy. However, the underlying principles—particularly patient stratification, target validation, and greater emphasis on early-stage go/no-go decisions—became central to pharmaceutical R&D discourse. AstraZeneca's publicly reported R&D productivity showed improvement in later years, with several major drug approvals including cancer therapies and cardiovascular drugs, though attributing success solely to these reforms versus other strategic changes (such as oncology focus and biologics investment) is not straightforward.

The broader pharmaceutical industry continued grappling with high Phase II failure rates through the 2010s, with many companies adopting similar critiques of volume-driven metrics while struggling to implement effective alternatives in practice.
