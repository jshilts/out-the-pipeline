# The Dover Decision (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the closing arguments in the *Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District* trial, which centered on the Pennsylvania school district's requirement that "intelligent design" be taught in 9th-grade biology classes. The author expresses strong opposition to intelligent design, calling it "pernicious nonsense" and rejecting the argument from incredulity—the idea that complexity requires an intelligent designer. The article draws parallels to *McLean v. Arkansas* (1982), an earlier case that struck down mandated teaching of "creation science," and suggests that intelligent design is simply an evolved form of creationism. The author notes that the Discovery Institute (defending the ID position) explicitly stated they wanted to "use the courts to change the culture," and expresses hope that the court will reject their arguments, while acknowledging that anti-evolution forces will likely continue to evolve new strategies regardless of the outcome.

## 2. HISTORY

**Subsequent Legal Developments:**

On December 20, 2005, Judge John E. Jones III issued a sweeping 139-page ruling that struck down the Dover school board's intelligent design policy as unconstitutional. The court found that intelligent design was not science but rather a form of creationism, violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

**Key findings from the decision:**
- Intelligent design "is not science" and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents"
- The school board had acted with the "breathtaking inanity" of religious purpose
- ID fails to meet the criteria for scientific methodology

**Scientific and Educational Impact:**
The Dover decision significantly strengthened the legal precedent against teaching intelligent design in public schools. Mainstream scientific organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, continued to firmly reject intelligent design as unscientific. No major school districts subsequently adopted intelligent design curricula in the face of this legal precedent.

**Continued Anti-Evolution Efforts:**
Following the Dover defeat, anti-evolution activists shifted strategies away from direct intelligent design advocacy toward:
- "Academic freedom" bills seeking to protect teachers who critique evolution
- "Teach the controversy" approaches
- Climate change denial using similar rhetorical tactics
- More subtle attempts to insert religious concepts into science education

The Discovery Institute, while continuing to promote intelligent design, focused more on public outreach rather than direct legal challenges to established science curricula.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"If it too gets struck down, we can all expect yet another variation in another few years as the anti-evolution forces continue to evolve"**
  - **Outcome**: This prediction proved highly accurate. After the Dover ruling, anti-evolution efforts evolved into new forms including "academic freedom" legislation (appearing in states like Louisiana, Tennessee, and others), attempts to mandate teaching the "strengths and weaknesses" of evolution, and renewed emphasis on climate science skepticism using similar "teach the controversy" tactics. These represented clear evolutionary adaptations of the anti-evolution strategy.

• **Implicit prediction that courts would reject intelligent design**
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. The December 2005 decision was strongly against intelligent design and created substantial legal precedent that has held up against subsequent challenges.

• **Prediction that anti-evolution forces would continue despite legal defeats**
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Anti-evolution efforts have persisted for nearly two decades after Dover, adopting new terminology and legal strategies while maintaining the same underlying religious opposition to evolutionary science. These efforts have had varying success at the state level, particularly in states with "academic freedom" laws, but have consistently failed at the federal level to overturn established precedent.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

While focused on a specific legal case, this brief commentary demonstrated remarkable prescience about the adaptive strategies of anti-science movements, accurately predicting that legal defeats would lead to evolved tactics rather than ending the underlying conflict. The piece captures a broader pattern about how ideological opposition to scientific consensus responds to institutional pressure.
