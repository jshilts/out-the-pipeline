# A Shady Trial? (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article warned that the “young‑blood” craze—based on mouse studies showing that transfusing plasma from young donors can rejuvenate older animals—was being turned into questionable human trials. It highlighted two efforts:  

* **Alkahest**, a Stanford spin‑out, was running a small, industry‑sponsored Phase 1/2 trial of young plasma in Alzheimer’s patients (NCT02256306).  
* **Ambrosia** (later Ambrosia Therapeutics) was recruiting 600 self‑pay participants ≥ 35 years old for a single‑infusion “young plasma” study, charging $8 000 per enrollee, with no control arm and a heterogeneous cohort.  

The author argued that charging participants and the lack of rigorous design made the Ambrosia trial look more like a for‑profit venture than a legitimate clinical investigation, and called for better curation of trial registries.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Alkahest (Stanford spin‑out)**  
* **2016‑2019** – Conducted the announced Phase 1/2 trial in mild‑to‑moderate Alzheimer’s disease (NCT02256306). The study was completed in 2019; results presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC) 2020 showed **no statistically significant cognitive benefit** versus baseline.  
* **2020** – Alkahest announced the trial was “terminated for futility” and shifted focus to plasma‑derived protein therapeutics (e.g., “ALKS 4230”).  
* **2021** – Grifols, a large plasma‑products company, acquired Alkahest for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition gave Grifols access to Alkahest’s plasma‑fractionation platform, but **no FDA‑approved anti‑aging or Alzheimer’s product** has emerged to date.  
* **2022‑2024** – Alkahest (now a Grifols unit) ran a small Phase 2 trial of a plasma‑derived protein (ALKS 4230) in healthy older adults; the study met safety endpoints but did not demonstrate clear efficacy on functional or biomarker outcomes. The program remains in early‑stage development.

**Ambrosia / Ambrosia Therapeutics**  
* **2016‑2018** – Launched the “Young Plasma Infusion Study” (NCT02876123), a single‑arm, open‑label trial of a one‑time plasma infusion in 600 self‑pay volunteers. Recruitment was slow; many participants withdrew after learning the study lacked a placebo group.  
* **2019** – The trial was **terminated early** due to insufficient enrollment and funding shortfalls. No peer‑reviewed efficacy data were published.  
* **2020** – The U.S. FDA issued a warning letter to Ambrosia for marketing “young plasma” as an anti‑aging therapy without an approved IND, emphasizing that the product was an **unapproved biologic**.  
* **2021‑2022** – Ambrosia re‑branded as **Ambrosia Therapeutics**, pivoting away from whole‑plasma infusions toward **plasma‑derived extracellular vesicles (EVs)** and “young‑plasma‑derived secretome” products. Early pre‑clinical work suggested EVs might carry rejuvenating factors, but no human trial results have been released.  
* **2023‑2024** – The company remains privately held, with modest venture funding; it has not announced any IND‑cleared studies, and no product has reached the market.

**Broader field**  
* The original mouse parabiosis findings spurred many “young‑blood” startups, but **replication attempts in rodents have produced mixed results**, and the hypothesized key factor (e.g., GDF11) has been largely discredited.  
* Clinical interest shifted toward **therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE)**, which removes old plasma and replaces it with donor plasma or albumin. Small pilot studies in Alzheimer’s (e.g., the “AMBAR” trial, 2020) reported modest cognitive benefits, but larger confirmatory trials are still pending.  
* As of late 2024, **no FDA‑approved therapy based on whole‑plasma transfusion or “young blood” exists**, and the field is viewed as a cautionary example of hype outpacing data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article or implied) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Ambrosia’s $8 000‑per‑person trial would generate robust data on “young plasma” effects** | The trial never completed; it was halted in 2019 with no published efficacy data. |
| **Charging participants suggests a profit‑driven scam** | The lack of a control arm and the self‑pay model indeed raised ethical concerns; the FDA later warned the company for unapproved marketing, supporting the author’s suspicion. |
| **The field would be littered with “semi‑sorta‑trials” that are hard to interpret** | True. Multiple small, under‑powered studies (including Alkahest’s early Alzheimer’s trial) produced inconclusive results, and many companies pivoted or folded. |
| **Clinicaltrials.gov needs better curation, perhaps a “curated” tier** | The FDA and NIH have since added “Trial Registration Data Elements” and a “Results” posting requirement, but a formal curated tier has not been implemented. |
| **Young‑blood research would lead to approved anti‑aging drugs** | No. As of 2024, no such product has received regulatory approval; the most promising avenue remains plasma exchange, not whole‑plasma infusion. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a prescient critique of a hype‑driven niche that later proved largely unproductive; its concerns about trial design and patient‑funded studies were borne out, making it moderately interesting for historians of biotech and bioethics.
