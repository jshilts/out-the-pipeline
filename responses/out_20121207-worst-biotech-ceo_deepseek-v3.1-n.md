# The Worst Biotech CEO? (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post reports on Adam Feuerstein's "Worst Biotech CEO of 2012" readers' poll at TheStreet.com. The winner was Jim Bianco of Cell Therapeutics, who apparently engineered a 77% drop in his company's stock price that year despite finally securing European approval for their lymphoma drug. The article highlights Bianco's long tenure delivering $1.7 billion in total losses and a 99.99999999% share value decline while he and his executives received tens of millions in compensation.

## 2. HISTORY
Jim Bianco remained CEO of Cell Therapeutics (CTI) until May 2014, when he became Vice Chairman, finally resigning from the board in December 2015 after 22 years. The lymphoma drug referenced, pixantrone (branded as Pixuvri), received conditional EMA approval in 2012 but never gained FDA approval—the FDA rejected it in 2010, requested additional trials, and CTI never successfully completed them.

After Bianco's departure, CTI underwent corporate restructuring in 2016, and its subsequent drugs faced clinical failures. The company's stock value never recovered from the massive losses accumulated during Bianco's leadership.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There were no explicit predictions in the blog post. The article was purely reporting on a current "worst CEO" designation rather than forecasting future outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
**Decile Score: 2**

This is narrow industry-gossip content with limited long-term significance; while entertaining for the biotech sector, it's essentially a blog post about a "worst CEO" list rather than substantive scientific or business analysis.
