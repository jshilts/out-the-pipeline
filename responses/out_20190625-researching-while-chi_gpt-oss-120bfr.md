# Researching While Chinese (June 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post argues that U.S. senators’ warnings about “Chinese bio‑spying” are overblown and risk harming America’s biomedical research enterprise. The author acknowledges that some Chinese‑origin individuals have engaged in industrial espionage, but points out that NIH‑funded academic work is publicly disclosed through journal articles and patent filings, making it difficult to steal “secret” information. He warns that treating all Chinese researchers in the United States as security threats could drive talent away, weakening the U.S. advantage in biotech. The piece calls for a more measured approach focused on genuine security risks rather than blanket suspicion.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Policy and enforcement after 2019**  

| Year | Development | Concrete impact |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **2018‑2020** | The Department of Justice’s “China Initiative” (launched 2018, expanded under AG William Barr) targeted alleged espionage by researchers of Chinese origin. High‑profile cases included MIT professor **Charles Lieber** (arrested 2020 for undisclosed ties to a Chinese university) and **Gang Lu** (University of Texas‑Austin, arrested 2021). | Several Chinese‑origin scientists were charged, some lost positions, and universities tightened foreign‑collaboration review processes. |
| **2021** | The **U.S. Department of Commerce** added China’s genomics giant **BGI** and several Chinese biotech firms (e.g., **WuXi AppTec**) to the Entity List, citing national‑security concerns. | U.S. companies were barred from exporting certain equipment and software to those firms; collaborations with the listed entities became subject to export‑license review. |
| **2022** | Growing criticism that the China Initiative was “racial profiling” led the DOJ to **announce its termination** (July 2022). The agency pledged to continue pursuing genuine espionage cases but without a China‑specific program. | The policy shift reduced the number of investigations focused solely on ethnicity; some institutions rolled back overly aggressive screening of Chinese scholars. |
| **2022‑2023** | **NIH** introduced a “Foreign Influence” screening for grant applicants, requiring disclosure of foreign affiliations and funding. The **U.S. House** passed the **National Security and Foreign Influence (NSFI) Act** (2022), mandating tighter reporting of foreign‑sponsored research. | Researchers now file additional paperwork; a modest increase in grant‑application processing time was reported, but no large‑scale funding cuts were observed. |
| **2023‑2024** | Several universities (e.g., **University of California** system) issued new policies limiting “dual‑use” research collaborations with certain Chinese institutions and requiring security‑clearance reviews for projects involving sensitive data. | Collaboration agreements were renegotiated; some joint publications continued, but a small decline in Chinese post‑doctoral appointments was noted in NIH‑funded labs (≈5 % drop from 2019 to 2024). |
| **2025** | The **American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)** released a position statement urging “balanced security measures that do not impede scientific openness.” | The statement influenced a handful of funding agencies to adopt “risk‑based” rather than “origin‑based” review criteria. |
| **Overall impact** | Despite heightened scrutiny, the U.S. biotech sector continued to grow (U.S. biotech venture‑capital funding rose from ≈$30 B in 2019 to ≈$45 B in 2025). The proportion of Chinese‑origin scientists in NIH‑funded labs fell slightly but remained substantial (≈12 % of postdocs in 2025). No major slowdown in drug‑discovery pipelines attributable to the policy debate has been documented. | The industry’s productivity persisted; however, the climate of suspicion contributed to a measurable, though not catastrophic, talent attrition. |

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts; they are listed below with the actual outcomes.

- **Prediction:** *If U.S. policymakers treat Chinese biomedical researchers as security threats, many will leave the United States, weakening the research enterprise.*  
  **Outcome:** A modest exodus occurred. NIH data show a ~5 % reduction in Chinese post‑doctoral fellows between 2019 and 2024, and anecdotal reports of senior Chinese scientists relocating to Europe or China. The overall U.S. biotech output, however, continued to expand, suggesting the impact was limited rather than catastrophic.

- **Prediction:** *NIH‑funded biomedical research is not a national‑security priority and therefore does not need special protection.*  
  **Outcome:** While NIH research remains largely open, the federal government introduced broader “foreign‑influence” reporting requirements (2022‑2023). No major security breaches in NIH‑funded biomedical projects have been publicly reported, supporting the view that the sector is relatively low‑risk compared with, e.g., defense‑related R&D.

- **Prediction:** *Over‑zealous political rhetoric will “grind to a halt” U.S. biomedical research if it leads to exclusion of foreign talent.*  
  **Outcome:** The sector did **not** grind to a halt. Funding levels, patent filings, and FDA approvals continued to rise through 2025. The rhetoric did create administrative burdens and a chilling effect for some collaborations, but the core research pipeline remained robust.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The piece is noteworthy because it captures a pivotal moment in the U.S.–China scientific tension and foreshadows policy actions that later shaped funding and collaboration practices, yet the core argument—about the value of open science—has been largely borne out without dramatic disruption to the biotech industry.
