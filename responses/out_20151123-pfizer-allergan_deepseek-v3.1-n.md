# Pfizer-Allergan (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the rumored Pfizer-Allergan merger that was reported by the Wall Street Journal in November 2015. The author notes that most coverage would focus on the complex tax inversion deal Pfizer was attempting—essentially an "accountant's merger" to escape U.S. corporate taxes. 

The piece expresses concern but not surprise about this development, characterizing it as "more of the same" for Pfizer's longstanding merger-heavy strategy. The author distinguishes this from Valeant's more extreme approach of gutting R&D entirely, suggesting that a company of Pfizer-Allergan's scale couldn't sustain such a strategy. However, the article notes that Pfizer employees have endured decades of merger-related uncertainty and layoffs, so this deal represents continuation of established patterns rather than a fundamental shift. The author expresses skepticism about executives' claims that this would lead to splitting into patent-protected versus generic drug businesses, noting Pfizer had discussed similar plans years earlier without following through.

## 2. HISTORY
The Pfizer-Allergan merger deal was officially announced in November 2015 as a massive $160 billion transaction that would have been the largest pharmaceutical merger in history. However, the deal collapsed in April 2016 when the U.S. Treasury Department issued new regulations specifically targeting tax inversion transactions.

Following the deal's failure, Pfizer pursued a different strategy. In 2019, Pfizer completed its $11.4 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma, a cancer drug company. More significantly, in 2020, Pfizer merged its off-patent drug business (including products like Lipitor, Viagra, and Celebrex) with generic drug maker Mylan to form Viatris Inc., finally executing the split that had been discussed for years.

The failed Allergan transaction did not ultimately change Pfizer's fundamental trajectory. The company continued its pattern of strategic acquisitions while maintaining R&D operations. Most notably, in 2020-2021, Pfizer developed and marketed one of the first COVID-19 vaccines in partnership with BioNTech, which became one of the most commercially successful pharmaceutical products in history. This demonstrated that despite continued merger activity, Pfizer maintained substantial internal R&D capabilities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **The merger would go through**: This prediction proved incorrect. While the deal was announced and seemed imminent, the Treasury Department's regulatory intervention caused it to collapse in April 2016.
  
• **The combined company would evaluate splitting into patent-protected versus off-patent businesses**: This eventual outcome proved correct, though it took a different path. Pfizer eventually executed this strategy in 2020 with the Viatris deal, not with the company that would have been created through the Allergan merger.

• **The merger wouldn't result in massive R&D purges like Valeant's approach**: This prediction was accurate in its assessment that the strategy wouldn't work for a company of Pfizer's scale, though it became moot when the deal collapsed.

• **There would "probably be another" big Pfizer deal within years**: This proved prescient. While the Allergan deal failed, Pfizer continued its acquisition strategy with Array BioPharma in 2019 and continued exploring other major transactions.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article captures an important moment in pharmaceutical industry consolidation and tax policy, and its failure marked a turning point in how such inversions would be treated by regulators. The broader themes about pharmaceutical M&A cycles and R&D investment remain highly relevant.
