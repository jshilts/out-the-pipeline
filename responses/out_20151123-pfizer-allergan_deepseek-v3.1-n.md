# Analysis of “Pfizer-Allergan” (2015) with the benefit of hindsight

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the impending Pfizer–Allergan merger announced in November 2015, framing it primarily as a tax-driven “accountant’s merger.” The author notes that the deal’s structure appeared designed to help Pfizer reduce its U.S. tax burden through an inversion that would move its tax domicile overseas. 

Regarding R&D implications, the author argues that a combined entity of Pfizer’s scale cannot simply abandon internal R&D and rely wholly on acquiring externally discovered assets, because buying fully de-risked assets is too expensive at such a large scale. After touching on concerns about Allergan’s and Valeant’s approaches to R&D, the piece concludes that the merger is unlikely to trigger a wholesale purging of Pfizer’s laboratories, but also unlikely to improve conditions—instead, it will be “more of the same”: another large Pfizer transaction that creates fear and uncertainty for scientists. The article also references reports that the combined company would consider splitting into a patent-protected (innovative) business and a mature-products (off‑patent) business, suggesting this had been floated before.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article was published, events evolved along four key dimensions: the merger’s collapse; Pfizer’s subsequent split; tangible R&D and drug-development outcomes; and policy changes affecting corporate inversions.

- **Merger collapse (April 2016)**: In early 2016, the U.S. Treasury issued anti-inversion rules that effectively scuttled the deal’s tax benefits. Pfizer and Allergan terminated the $160 billion merger in April 2016. A separate, smaller transaction—Pfizer’s acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals (which brought crisaborole, later launched as Eucrisa)—proceeded in 2016.

- **Pfizer’s split into two businesses (2017–2019)**: Pfizer followed through on the reported plan to separate into patent-protected and mature-product units. In 2018, Pfizer combined its off‑patent branded and generic portfolio with Mylan in the Upjohn segment (later merged with Upjohn to form Viatris in 2020). In 2019, Pfizer announced it would merge Upjohn with Mylan; the transaction closed in November 2020, establishing Viatris as a separate company while Pfizer retained its biopharma (patent‑protected) business. This separation closely matched the “split into two businesses” notion the article cited, though accomplished via phased reorganization rather than a clean two-way split at the time of the Allergan deal.

- **R&D output and pipeline after 2015**: Pfizer did not purge R&D wholesale, but it continued its pattern of overlapping reorganizations that disrupted labs and personnel. Concrete R&D outcomes in subsequent years included key approvals and commercialization highlights:
  - **Ibrance (palbociclib)**, first approved in 2015, became a major blockbuster in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.
  - **Xeljanz (tofacitinib)** expanded into multiple autoimmune indications, though with added safety warnings in later years.
  - **Eliquis (apixaban)**, though partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb, remained a top anticoagulant.
  - **Xtandi (enzalutamide)** rights were held in some regions and contributed revenue in partnership with Astellas.
  - **Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (tafamidis)**, approved in 2019 in the U.S., became a significant therapy for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
  - **Comirnaty (BNT162b2)**, Pfizer’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine developed with BioNTech, was authorized in late 2020 and achieved massive global uptake in 2021–2022.
  - **Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir)**, authorized in late 2021, became a leading oral antiviral for COVID-19.
  
  The article’s worry that Pfizer could not sustain growth purely through external deals proved largely correct: Pfizer continued both internal programs and acquisitions/licensing (e.g., deals for Array BioPharma, acquisitions in rare disease and oncology, and BioNTech collaboration). Its R&D spending remained among the highest in the industry, though punctuated by restructuring (including consolidation of sites).

- **Public policy shifts on inversions**: The 2016 Treasury actions constrained inversion-driven mergers and, along with later legislative changes (including 2017 tax reform that lowered the U.S. corporate rate and tightened anti-inversion rules), reduced the incentive for large U.S. companies to relocate their tax domiciles simply for tax savings. These changes validated the regulatory risk the author hinted at with the “accountant’s merger” framing.

- **Allergan’s trajectory**: Allergan later sold its generic portfolio to Teva and was itself acquired by AbbVie in 2020 for $63 billion. That transaction was largely motivated by blockbuster immunology assets (notably Humira) rather than an “R&D-lite” strategy. Allergan’s own legacy of serial acquisitions and R&D rationalization continued to attract scrutiny in the years after 2015.

- **Valeant’s decline**: The article’s skepticism about Valeant’s buy-and-cut-R&D model proved prescient. Valeant faced accounting and price-gouging controversies, a massive debt crisis, leadership changes, and divestitures; it later rebranded as Bausch Health but did not return to its prior scale or prominence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit forecasts about the merger, R&D policy, and Pfizer’s trajectory.

- **Prediction: The merger would be tax-motivated and would likely face regulatory hurdles.**  
  **Outcome**: The deal was indeed structured as a tax inversion, and it collapsed after the U.S. Treasury intervened. This validated the view that the transaction’s primary rationale was vulnerable to policy changes.

- **Prediction: A combined Pfizer/Allergan would not purge its R&D labs because large-scale companies cannot sustainably rely on buying fully de-risked innovation.**  
  **Outcome**: The merger did not close, so the specific hypothesis wasn’t tested under those terms. However, Pfizer did not abandon internal R&D; instead, it continued a mixed strategy of internal development, partnerships, and bolt-on acquisitions while reorganizing divisions. Its post-2016 pipeline and approvals (including mRNA vaccine and Paxlovid) reflected sustained R&D investment.

- **Prediction: “Wait a few years, and there will probably be another” large Pfizer deal.**  
  **Outcome**: Correct in spirit but with amended targets. After the Allergan deal failed, Pfizer did pursue additional transactions. Major examples include:
  - Acquisition of Array BioPharma in 2019 for $11.4 billion (targeting oncology and targeted therapies).
  - Proposed $14 billion acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) in 2022 (sickle cell disease assets), though later adjusted.
  - Pursuit of Seagen in 2022–2023, which closed in 2023 for $43 billion (strengthening oncology).
  - Continued partnership-driven activity (the BioNTech collaboration on COVID-19 vaccines was pivotal).  
  The pattern of serial, large-scale M&A continued, albeit with greater focus on therapeutic areas and platform technologies rather than broad-based, tax-driven mergers.

- **Prediction: The split into patent-protected and off‑patent businesses was likely to be revisited.**  
  **Outcome**: This occurred. Pfizer reorganized into two main segments and ultimately merged its mature products unit into Viatris (via combination of Upjohn and Mylan), leaving Pfizer focused on innovative biopharma.

## 4. INTEREST

Score: **7/9**

**Rationale**: The article is interesting and historically valuable because it captured a critical moment when large pharmaceutical companies were engaging in tax-inversion mergers while grappling with fundamental questions about R&D productivity and merger-driven growth. It correctly identified the tax rationale as central and fragile, and it articulated a durable insight about the limits of “acquire rather than innovate” strategies at massive scale. Its broader framing of Pfizer’s serial M&A culture as a source of persistent uncertainty for scientists rings true across subsequent years. The piece is focused, skeptical in a constructive way, and mostly supported by ensuing events. It stops short of a 9/9 because its primary prediction was superseded by the deal’s termination, but its insights about inversions, R&D sustainability, and corporate strategy remain relevant and prescient.
