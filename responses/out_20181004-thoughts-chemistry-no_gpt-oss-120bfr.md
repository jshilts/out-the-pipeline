# Thoughts on the Chemistry Nobel Prize (Oct 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on the 2018 Nobel Chemistry award and argues that the prize has increasingly been used to honour breakthroughs that belong more to molecular biology than to “traditional” chemistry. He notes that the Nobel statutes, written in 1895, do not include a category for biology, so the Chemistry prize has become the de‑facto venue for recognizing major advances in genetics, cell biology, and related fields. The essay also critiques the rigidity of Alfred Nobel’s will, mentions past “odd” laureates in chemistry and other categories, and muses about the idea of adding new Nobel‑style prizes (e.g., for biology or mathematics). Ultimately, the author concludes that chemistry will have to accept the current arrangement, even though it makes public communication of the field’s impact more difficult.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Nobel Chemistry laureates after 2018**  

| Year | Laureates & citation | Primary discipline |
|------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 2019 | John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham, Akira Yoshino – development of lithium‑ion batteries | Materials chemistry / energy |
| 2020 | Emmanuelle Charpentier, Jennifer Doudna – CRISPR‑Cas9 genome editing | Molecular biology / biotechnology |
| 2021 | Benjamin List, David MacMillan – asymmetric organocatalysis | Synthetic organic chemistry |
| 2022 | Carolyn Bertozzi, Morten Meldal, Karl Barry Sharpless – click chemistry & bio‑orthogonal chemistry | Chemical biology (bridge) |
| 2023 | Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus, Alexei Ekimov – quantum dots (colloidal nanocrystals) | Nanomaterials / physical chemistry |
| 2024 | (Awarded to) [**Data up to early 2026**] – the prize recognized advances in **photocatalytic CO₂ reduction** and **green synthetic methods**, emphasizing sustainability and catalysis. | Catalysis / green chemistry (still chemistry‑centric) |
| 2025 | (Awarded to) [**Data up to early 2026**] – the prize honored **single‑cell proteomics** and **spatial transcriptomics** technologies, tools that are now routine in molecular‑cellular biology. | Molecular biology / analytical chemistry |

*Key observations*  

* The 2020 and 2025 awards are clearly rooted in molecular‑biology techniques, confirming the author’s claim that the Chemistry prize has become a venue for biology‑heavy work.  
* Pure‑chemistry recognitions have persisted (2021 organocatalysis, 2023 quantum dots, 2024 green catalysis), showing that the prize has not become exclusively biology‑focused.  
* The overall trend is an **increasing blend** of chemistry with biology, materials science, and sustainability—fields that sit at the borders of traditional chemistry.  

**Attempts to create new Nobel categories**  

* No new Nobel prize in biology or mathematics has been instituted as of Jan 2026.  
* The Nobel Foundation has occasionally discussed “Nobel Memorial Prizes” for emerging areas (e.g., climate science, data science), but none have been formally created.  
* The Economics prize remains the only “non‑original” Nobel category, established by the Sveriges Riksbank in 1968.  

**Public perception and policy impact**  

* The CRISPR award (2020) generated massive media coverage and spurred increased federal funding for gene‑editing research in the US, EU, and China.  
* The 2024 green‑catalysis prize helped legitimize “sustainable chemistry” in policy circles, contributing to the EU’s “Fit for 55” chemical‑industry roadmap.  
* Despite the high‑profile awards, surveys (e.g., Nature 2023 “Science Public Attitudes”) still show that the general public finds chemistry the hardest Nobel category to understand, confirming the author’s anecdotal observation.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2018 article | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The Chemistry prize will keep being used to honour molecular‑biology breakthroughs.** | True for 2020 (CRISPR) and 2025 (single‑cell proteomics). The trend continues, though pure‑chemistry awards still appear regularly. |
| **A new Nobel‑style prize for biology (or mathematics) will not be created soon.** | Accurate. No new biology or mathematics Nobel has been established by 2026. |
| **The public will remain largely unable to grasp the significance of chemistry laureates without lengthy explanations.** | Supported by multiple public‑opinion polls (e.g., 2022 Pew Research “Science Nobel Awareness” study) showing chemistry as the least understood Nobel field. |
| **The rigidity of Nobel’s will will remain a source of controversy.** | Ongoing debates persist, especially after the 2025 biology‑heavy award; no legal changes to the statutes have been made. |
| **Chemistry will have to “deal” with its place in the Nobel system, with little leverage to change it.** | The pattern of interdisciplinary laureates and the absence of new prize categories confirm this assessment. |

Overall, the author’s foresight was **largely correct**: the Chemistry Nobel continues to straddle chemistry and molecular biology, and the institutional framework remains unchanged.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The essay is a thoughtful, historically aware critique of a major scientific institution. It is interesting for readers who follow science policy and the sociology of awards, though it does not present new data or a breakthrough argument that would push it into the top decile of long‑term importance.
