# Biogen Cutting Jobs (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This October 2015 article discusses Biogen's quarterly earnings announcement, which occurred during a period when the company's stock—along with the broader biotech sector—had been experiencing significant declines after a remarkable five-year period where the stock had quintupled. While Biogen avoided an earnings miss that investors feared, the author notes that some of the revenue gains came from price increases rather than volume increases, which was viewed as "not the most reassuring news."

The article highlights Biogen's announcement of a major restructuring plan involving laying off 11% of its workforce and completely withdrawing from certain therapeutic areas, including immunology. Although the company raised its earnings estimates, the author points out that most of this improvement was due to cost savings from these cutbacks rather than organic growth, concluding that "you can't do that forever, either."

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2015 announcement, Biogen's trajectory reflects both the challenges identified in the article and some unexpected developments:

**Continued MS franchise performance**: Biogen's multiple sclerosis drugs (Tecfidera, Tysabri, Avonex) remained significant revenue drivers, though the MS market became increasingly competitive with new entrants and generic competition emerging.

**Alzheimer's disease program rollercoaster**: Biogen's most dramatic post-2015 development involved its Alzheimer's drug aducanumab. The company initially discontinued trials in March 2019 after disappointing results, then stunningly reversed course in October 2019, deciding to seek FDA approval. The drug received controversial FDA approval in June 2021 as Aduhelm, despite weak efficacy evidence and strong opposition from FDA advisors. The drug saw extremely limited patient uptake due to efficacy concerns, high cost, and limited insurance coverage.

**Spin-off and restructuring**: In 2022, Biogen spun off its biosimilars business into a separate publicly traded company. The company continued restructuring efforts, including additional job cuts in 2023.

**Recent Alzheimer's success**: In January 2023, Biogen and partner Eisai announced positive Phase 3 results for lecanemab (Leqembi), which received FDA approval in July 2023 and represents a more promising Alzheimer's treatment with clearer efficacy.

**Stock performance**: Biogen's stock experienced significant volatility post-2015, with major swings tied to Alzheimer's trial results and regulatory decisions, ultimately underperforming broader market indices during much of this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"You can't keep doing that [stock quintupling] forever"**: **Accurate**. Biogen's stock did not maintain its previous growth trajectory and experienced significant volatility and underperformance relative to the broader market during much of the 2015-2023 period.

• **"You can't do [saving money through cutbacks] forever, either"**: **Accurate**. Biogen's continued restructuring and layoff announcements in subsequent years (including 2023) confirmed that cost-cutting through workforce reductions remained part of their strategy rather than sustained organic growth, but also that such measures couldn't solve underlying business challenges indefinitely.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3/9**

This article captured a transitional moment for a major biotech company facing growth challenges, but the more historically significant Biogen story post-2015 was the controversial Alzheimer's drug development saga, which this article didn't address and couldn't have predicted. The restructuring discussed was routine cost-cutting rather than strategically transformative.
