# Onward With CETP! (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Merck's decision to continue its CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein) inhibitor program despite a long history of failures in this drug class. Merck's large cardiovascular outcome study involving 30,000 patients was proceeding after a futility review, with completion expected in 2017. At the time, Amgen remained as the only other major competitor in this space, having recently acquired Dezima Pharma for $300 million upfront to obtain their CETP compound. The piece notes that Eli Lilly had recently abandoned their CETP program, joining a graveyard of failed attempts by other pharmaceutical companies. The author also sarcastically critiques a widely-cited $43 million figure for drug development costs, pointing out the absurdity of this claim given the massive expenses involved in Merck's 30,000-patient trial alone.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent history of CETP inhibitors largely validated the article's skeptical tone, though it took longer to play out than expected:

**Merck's Anacetrapib (2017)**: Despite completing the REVEAL trial with 30,000 patients in 2017, Merck announced it would not pursue FDA approval, even though the drug showed a modest 9% reduction in major coronary events. The development costs were simply too high relative to the marginal benefit, and the drug had concerning accumulation in adipose tissue, suggesting long-term safety issues.

**Amgen's Evacetrapib**: The compound acquired from Dezima was discontinued in October 2016 after failing to show cardiovascular benefit in a large Phase III trial, despite raising HDL cholesterol effectively.

**DalCor Pharmaceuticals (2016-2018)**: A smaller company, DalCor, continued development of dalcetrapib, a different CETP inhibitor, but terminated their Phase III trial in 2017 after interim analysis showed lack of efficacy.

The CETP hypothesis ultimately proved biologically flawed - while these drugs successfully raised HDL ("good") cholesterol dramatically, this elevation did not translate into meaningful cardiovascular protection. The research area became a cautionary tale about biomarkers versus clinical endpoints, with billions of dollars in development costs lost across multiple companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made no explicit forward-looking predictions about CETP outcomes, focusing instead on the risky nature of these trials and mocking drug development cost estimates. However, the implicit skepticism about CETP programs proved prescient given the subsequent failures.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article provides valuable real-time insight into a major pharmaceutical development story that became a case study in drug development failure, combining technical commentary with acerbic industry criticism that adds historical richness to understanding the CETP saga.
