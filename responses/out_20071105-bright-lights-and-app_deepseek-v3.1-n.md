# Bright Lights and Applause? (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a short blog post from November 2007 in which the author comments on their performance in the Weblog Awards voting. The author notes that their blog is "getting creamed" in the voting, particularly by popular science blogs like Pharyngula, Bad Astronomy, and Climate Audit, which mirrors the previous year's results. The author expresses reluctance to engage with global warming debates, viewing much of the arguing as "religious as scientific" and preferring not to engage with people whose views are not open to change. The post highlights how contentious topics generate significant blog traffic, while technical scientific discussions about topics like "sulfonamides and logP" fail to generate the same level of passion or engagement. The author concludes with a lighthearted appeal for readers to vote for their site "to keep things from looking too disgraceful."

## 2. HISTORY

The context of this article reflects the state of science blogging in 2007, which was during the peak era of the ScienceBlogs network (launched in 2006 and became influential until declining around 2010-2011). The blogs mentioned were indeed major players in the science communication landscape of that time. Pharyngula, run by biologist PZ Myers, was one of the most popular science blogs, focusing on evolution and atheism, and was known for generating significant controversy and engagement. Bad Astronomy, by astronomer Phil Plait, focused on astronomy and combating pseudoscience. Climate Audit, run by Steve McIntyre, became a focal point for climate change skepticism and generated enormous traffic through contentious debates.

However, the landscape of science communication has dramatically evolved since 2007. ScienceBlogs itself went through significant changes, with many prominent bloggers leaving the network around 2010-2011 due to editorial conflicts and the platform's declining influence. The focus shifted toward new platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and later Substack and various podcasting formats. By the 2020s, the relative importance of standalone science blogs had greatly diminished, with social media platforms and video content (YouTube, TikTok) becoming primary channels for science communication.

The referenced blogs followed different trajectories: Pharyngula remained active but saw reduced influence as Myers focused more on other platforms; Bad Astronomy continued with Phil Plait moving to various platforms including Slate and his own site; Climate Audit maintained its skeptical position on climate science. The Weblog Awards themselves became less relevant over time as the blogging ecosystem evolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction (implicit):** That the established pattern of popular blogs dominating awards through controversial topics would continue.

**Actual outcome:** The broader prediction about the importance of blog-based science communication proved largely incorrect. While controversial topics continued to drive engagement, the entire medium of standalone science blogs declined significantly in importance within just a few years. The rise of social media platforms fundamentally changed how science information was disseminated and consumed. The Weblog Awards themselves became largely irrelevant as blogging evolved from a primary communication channel to one of many tools in a broader digital ecosystem. The specific blogs mentioned maintained some presence but did not remain the dominant voices in science communication that they appeared to be in 2007.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is essentially a personal blog post about blog award voting from 2007, with minimal substantive content about biotechnology or science. While it offers a small glimpse into the science communication ecosystem of that era, it contains no technical insights, research findings, or policy implications relevant to biotechnology. Its main value is limited to historical context about early science blogging culture, which is largely obsolete in the current communication landscape.
