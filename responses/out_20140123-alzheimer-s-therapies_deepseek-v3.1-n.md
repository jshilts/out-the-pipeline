# Alzheimer's Therapies: A Reasonably Gloomy Update (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the disappointing results from Phase III trials of two anti-amyloid antibodies for Alzheimer's disease published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Pfizer/J&J's bapineuzumab and Lilly's solanezumab both failed to meet their primary endpoints. 

While there were hints of biological activity—bapineuzumab showed reduced amyloid accumulation on PET imaging and decreased CSF phospho-tau in APOE4 carriers—these effects were limited by dose-related side effects, particularly brain edema at higher doses. Bapineuzumab appeared to be discontinued, while Lilly continued with solanezumab based on marginal signals in patients with milder Alzheimer's. The author expressed skepticism about the "era of prevention studies," noting that prevention trials were being pursued mainly because treatment trials had failed, and cautioned against overoptimistic media coverage of combination therapies given the lack of any single agent showing robust efficacy.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade after this 2014 article revealed a mixed but largely disappointing trajectory for anti-amyloid therapies:

**Bapineuzumab**: Development was indeed discontinued shortly after these trials, confirming the article's assessment.

**Solanezumab**: Eli Lilly continued development through multiple additional Phase III trials (EXPEDITION 1, 2, and 3). The drug ultimately failed across all major trials and was discontinued in 2016-2017, with no significant clinical benefit demonstrated even in prevention trials.

**Other anti-amyloid antibodies**: Aducanumab (Biogen) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 based on surrogate biomarker endpoints rather than clear cognitive benefits, despite an advisory committee's negative recommendation. It has seen very limited uptake due to efficacy doubts, high cost, and safety concerns. Lecanemab (Biogen/Eisai) received FDA accelerated approval in 2023 based on amyloid reduction, with full approval following based on modest cognitive benefits (0.45 point difference on 18-point CDR-SB scale over 18 months). Donanemab showed similar modest effects and received FDA approval in 2024.

**Clinical impact**: Despite three approved anti-amyloid antibodies, real-world patient uptake remains limited due to modest efficacy, significant side effects (brain swelling and microhemorrhages), high costs, and the requirement for extensive monitoring with frequent MRIs. These drugs show small statistical differences but questionable meaningful clinical impact for patients.

**Scientific understanding**: The amyloid hypothesis remains controversial. While drugs can remove amyloid plaques, the clinical benefits remain marginal at best, suggesting either that amyloid is not the primary driver or that intervention comes too late in the disease process.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"A roll of the dice like this might be their best shot"** - This assessment proved accurate; Lilly's continued investment in solanezumab never paid off, with the drug ultimately failing in all major trials despite hundreds of millions in investment.

• **"Five to ten years before we'll even know enough to say"** - The timeline prediction was reasonably accurate; solanezumab's definitive failure became clear by 2016-2017 (about 3 years), while more broadly it took until 2021-2024 for the field to have any approved anti-amyloid therapies with debatable clinical value.

• **Skepticism about prevention trials** - This skepticism was well-founded; prevention trials with solanezumab and other agents ultimately failed to show benefits even in pre-symptomatic populations, suggesting the field's fundamental understanding remained incomplete.

• **Doubt about combination therapies** - This caution proved justified; no successful combination regimens have emerged, as predicted, because individual components continue to show marginal at best efficacy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about the Alzheimer's field, with its skeptical take on anti-amyloid therapies and prevention trials proving largely accurate over the subsequent decade. The author's caution against overoptimistic narratives and combination therapy hype anticipated exactly the challenges the field has faced, making this a valuable historical perspective on therapeutic development challenges in neurodegenerative disease.
