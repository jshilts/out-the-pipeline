# Manfred Christl Rides Again (Bonus Idiotic Lab Accident, Too) (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses two interconnected stories. The first is Prof. Manfred Christl's academic work debunking incorrect chemical structure assignments in published papers about 12-membered ring compounds. Specifically, Christl exposed that Cheryl Stevenson's 2008 paper on ring structures from 1,5-hexadiyne and base reactions actually described a much simpler isomerization product—a reaction that had been first reported in 1961 and multiple times since, rendering the claimed novel structures incorrect.

The second story is Lowe's personal recollection of his own 1983 summer research experience in Ned Porter's lab at Duke University, where he synthesized 1,5-hexadiyne and attempted—unsuccessfully—to alkylate both terminal alkynes. He realizes in hindsight that he was likely producing the same isomerization product that Christl identified decades later. The article concludes with a dramatic lab accident anecdote where Lowe's hair got caught in an overhead stirrer while preparing sodium amide, nearly pulling his head into the reaction apparatus.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this article's publication, the broader context has evolved significantly:

**Academic Integrity and Retraction Culture**: The early 2010s saw growing awareness of irreproducible research and academic misconduct. Retraction rates increased substantially, with sites like Retraction Watch launching in 2010 and becoming influential in tracking problematic publications. Christl's work represents an earlier example of post-publication peer review that would become more systematic through platforms like PubPeer (launched 2012).

**Literature Accessibility**: The article's reference to "digging through the literature was a good deal more time-consuming back then" highlights how dramatically research practices changed. By the late 2000s and 2010s, digital databases, structure-searchable chemical databases like SciFinder and Reaxys, and improved indexing made literature searches far more efficient than in the pre-digital era Lowe describes from 1983.

**Chemistry Field Evolution**: The types of reactions described—acetylene chemistry, Grignard reactions, sodium amide preparations—represent classical synthetic organic chemistry techniques. While fundamental, these methods became increasingly supplemented by catalytic and asymmetric methodologies in the intervening decades. The emphasis on proper characterization (NMR, etc.) that Christl demanded became even more critical as structural misassignment scandals (like the hexacyclinol controversy mentioned in the article's embedded reference) prompted tighter standards.

**No Major Commercial Developments**: The specific reactions and compounds discussed did not lead to commercial drugs or materials of broad significance. This was primarily an academic discussion about fundamental organic chemistry and proper scientific practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains no explicit predictions about future developments. It is retrospective in nature—analyzing past mistakes and recounting historical experiences. The implicit expectation that proper literature searching and structure verification would remain important did indeed hold true, and these practices became more systematic in subsequent years through improved search tools and quality control mechanisms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article provides entertaining anecdotes and exposes legitimate problems in chemical publishing, its scope is narrow—focusing on specific misassigned structures and personal reminiscences rather than addressing broader scientific or societal questions. The impact was limited to the academic chemistry community, and the subject matter lacks the transformative potential or widespread relevance that would warrant a higher score.
