# Funding People, Not Projects? (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
Tim Harford’s Slate piece (May 2011) uses the story of Mario Capecchi’s 1980 NIH grant to illustrate a broader problem in biomedical funding. Capecchi asked the NIH to support three projects; two were conventional, low‑risk studies, while the third was a speculative attempt to engineer targeted changes in the mouse genome. The NIH rejected the risky proposal, funding only the safe projects. Capecchi ignored the advice, poured most of the awarded money into the high‑risk work, and ultimately succeeded – his gene‑targeting method earned a 2007 Nobel Prize and became the foundation of modern knockout‑mouse technology.  

Harford argues that the NIH’s “results‑based, expert‑led” review system is excellent for steady, incremental science but ill‑suited for “lottery‑ticket” ideas that could produce breakthroughs. He praises the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator program, which funds individual scientists rather than specific projects, and suggests that a shift toward people‑centric, high‑risk funding would better serve innovation. He also warns against simply funneling money to already‑famous investigators (the “Matthew Effect”) and calls for mechanisms that identify and support bold ideas regardless of the researcher’s reputation.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Gene‑targeting and its descendants  
- **Knockout mouse technology** (Capecchi, Evans, Smithies) became a standard tool in the 1990s and early 2000s. By 2020, >20 000 mouse strains had been generated and deposited in public repositories, underpinning most pre‑clinical work in immunology, neuroscience, and cancer.  
- **CRISPR‑Cas9** (first demonstrated in mammalian cells in 2013) built on the concept of precise genome editing that Capecchi pioneered. The rapid adoption of CRISPR accelerated the creation of disease models, gene‑therapy candidates, and a wave of biotech startups.  
- **FDA‑approved gene‑editing therapies**: Luxturna (2017, AAV‑mediated RPE65 correction), Zolgensma (2019, AAV‑SMN1 for spinal‑muscular atrophy), and the first CRISPR‑based in‑vivo therapy (2020, ex vivo edited T‑cells for sickle‑cell disease) all trace methodological lineage to the original mouse‑targeting work.

### Funding reforms and high‑risk programs  
- **NIH Director’s Pioneer and New Innovator Awards** (launched 2004, expanded 2010‑2020) provide multi‑year, flexible funding for high‑risk projects. As of 2023, roughly 1 % of the NIH budget is allocated to these awards; they have supported early‑stage CRISPR work, organ‑oid platforms, and novel vaccine technologies.  
- **NIH Common Fund “High‑Risk, High‑Reward” initiatives** (e.g., the BRAIN Initiative, Human Cell Atlas) have funded large, collaborative, speculative endeavors. Their impact is measurable in new data resources and technology platforms, though they remain a small slice of total NIH spending.  
- **Early‑Stage Investigator (ESI) policies** (strengthened 2012, 2022) aim to protect junior scientists from the “Matthew Effect” by reserving a higher success rate for first‑time R01 applicants. The policies have modestly improved funding rates for newcomers but have not eliminated concentration of funds among senior labs.  
- **HHMI Investigator program** continued to expand, reaching ~1 200 investigators by 2022. The model has been emulated in limited form by the Wellcome Trust (Sir Henry Dale Fellowships) and the European Research Council (ERC Advanced Grants), but most national funding agencies still rely on project‑centric review.  

### Broader ecosystem shifts  
- **Venture‑capital‑driven biotech** exploded after 2010, with the number of U.S. biotech IPOs rising from ~10 per year (2005‑2009) to >30 per year (2015‑2022). Many of these companies are founded by scientists who previously received HHMI or NIH high‑risk awards.  
- **Policy discussions** about “risk‑tolerant” funding have become routine in NIH advisory meetings and congressional hearings, but concrete budget allocations have remained modest relative to the overall NIH appropriation (~$45 billion in FY 2023).  

Overall, the landscape has moved **partially** toward the article’s vision: high‑risk mechanisms exist and have produced notable successes (CRISPR, novel therapeutics), yet the bulk of biomedical funding still follows the traditional, project‑focused model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *The NIH’s conventional, results‑based review system is “the wrong way to fund lottery‑ticket projects.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. The NIH introduced dedicated high‑risk programs (Pioneer, New Innovator, Common Fund) that now support a modest number of speculative projects. However, these programs represent <2 % of total NIH spending, so the system as a whole remains largely risk‑averse.  

- **Prediction:** *The HHMI Investigator model will “catch on” and become a dominant funding paradigm.*  
  **Outcome:** The HHMI model has been **adopted only in limited fashion**. The European Research Council and Wellcome Trust have created investigator‑style grants, but most national agencies (including NIH, NSF, MRC) continue to fund specific research aims. HHMI’s share of U.S. biomedical funding is still <1 % of the total.  

- **Prediction:** *Funding should shift from “Tell us what you’ll discover” to “Fund the people.”*  
  **Outcome:** The shift is evident in the growth of **people‑centric awards** (e.g., HHMI, ERC Advanced, NIH Director’s Awards). These have produced high‑impact outcomes, especially in emerging fields like genome editing and synthetic biology. Yet the majority of grants remain project‑centric, and the “people‑first” approach has not supplanted the traditional model.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *If risky projects like Capecchi’s are supported, they will lead to transformative technologies.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Capecchi’s gene‑targeting work directly enabled CRISPR‑based therapeutics, which have already resulted in FDA approvals and a multi‑billion‑dollar industry.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a clear, historically grounded critique of biomedical funding that anticipated later debates about high‑risk research and the rise of genome‑editing technologies. Its relevance persists, though many of its suggested reforms have only been modestly implemented.
