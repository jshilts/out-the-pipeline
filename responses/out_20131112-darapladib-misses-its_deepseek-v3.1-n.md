# Darapladib Misses Its Endpoint (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses GlaxoSmithKline's Phase III clinical trial failure of darapladib, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor being developed for cardiovascular disease. At the time, analysts had wildly varying predictions about the drug's potential, with some suggesting it could become a $10 billion-a-year blockbuster, while more conservative estimates projected only $605 million in annual sales by 2018. Barclays analysts gave it just a 10% probability of success.

The drug missed its primary composite endpoint in a large 16,000-patient Phase III trial, despite GSK having acquired Human Genome Sciences to obtain the compound. While the company mentioned that some secondary endpoints were met, the author emphasized this was unequivocally bad news given the massive investment and the miss on the primary outcome measure (time to first occurrence of major cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death).

## 2. HISTORY
Following the November 2013 announcement, the second large Phase III trial (SOLID-TIMI 52 with 13,000 patients) also failed to meet its primary endpoint when results were eventually reported. Darapladib development was subsequently discontinued by GSK.

The failure represented a significant setback for the Lp-PLA2 inhibition approach to cardiovascular disease prevention. This mechanism had attracted substantial interest based on epidemiological data linking Lp-PLA2 levels to cardiovascular risk. However, multiple clinical trials demonstrated that reducing Lp-PLA2 activity did not translate into meaningful cardiovascular benefit.

The darapladib failure was part of a broader pattern in cardiovascular drug development where anti-inflammatory approaches targeting specific pathways failed to show clinical efficacy despite promising biomarker data. Other companies pursuing similar mechanisms also faced challenges, leading many to reduce investment in cardiovascular drug development given the high costs and risks.

GSK's acquisition of Human Genome Sciences, largely driven by darapladib's potential, ultimately did not deliver the expected value, with the drug never reaching market approval or generating any revenue.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Blockbuster potential ($10 billion annually)**: This prediction proved entirely incorrect. The drug never reached market and generated zero revenue.

• **Conservative $605 million sales forecast for 2018**: Also incorrect - no sales materialized as the drug failed clinical trials.

• **10% probability of success**: This was accurate. The drug did ultimately fail, validating the low probability assessment.

• **12% boost to GSK's valuation if successful**: While technically this would have occurred if successful, it's impossible to verify as the condition was never met. The failure likely had some negative impact on valuation, though GSK's diversified pipeline limited major consequences.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

The article captures a notable clinical failure that reinforced important lessons about the challenges of cardiovascular drug development and the difficulty of translating biomarker effects into clinical outcomes, though it represents one data point in a broader pattern rather than a paradigm-shifting event.
