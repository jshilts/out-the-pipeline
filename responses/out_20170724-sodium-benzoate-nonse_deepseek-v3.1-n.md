# Sodium Benzoate Nonsense (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Panera Bread's marketing campaign that positioned sodium benzoate as a harmful "chemical" that belongs in fireworks rather than food. The author, a chemist, systematically dismantles this claim by explaining that sodium benzoate is simply the sodium salt of benzoic acid—a naturally occurring compound found in many foods including berries, cinnamon, cheese, and yogurt. In acidic foods, sodium benzoate converts to benzoic acid anyway, which is the active antimicrobial form. The article explains that both compounds are GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) by regulatory bodies, have extremely low toxicity (less toxic than table salt in acute studies), and that the "natural vs. artificial" distinction Panera is drawing is chemically nonsensical since the same molecules exist naturally in many ingredients Panera already uses.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at developments after this 2017 article, several key developments occurred:

**Panera's Marketing Evolution**: Panera continued its "clean food" positioning but gradually moved away from the specific sodium benzoate messaging. By 2021, the company had shifted focus more broadly to "clean ingredients" rather than singling out specific preservatives. The original preservative-focused campaign page referenced in the article appears to have been removed or significantly revised.

**Regulatory Status**: Sodium benzoate and benzoic acid remain GRAS substances with FDA approval. No significant regulatory changes occurred regarding their food additive status between 2017-2024. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg body weight per day set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives remains in place.

**Scientific Understanding**: The scientific consensus on sodium benzoate's safety in food applications remained stable. No major new safety concerns emerged in peer-reviewed literature. The compound continues to be widely used as a preservative in acidic foods, beverages, and other products globally.

**Industry Response**: The "clean label" movement that Panera was capitalizing on continued to grow, but became more nuanced. Rather than vilifying specific chemicals, many companies shifted toward emphasizing positive attributes (organic, non-GMO, etc.) rather than negative claims about specific ingredients.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations:

• **That Panera was using chemically faulty reasoning to make themselves look good**: This proved accurate. The campaign referenced was eventually de-emphasized, suggesting the company moved away from this specific marketing angle, possibly due to criticism or recognition of the scientific inaccuracy.

• **That sodium benzoate would continue to be safely used in foods**: Correct. No major safety incidents or regulatory changes occurred that would contradict the safety profile described in the article.

• **That the compound's natural occurrence in foods undermines Panera's argument**: This remained scientifically valid, though Panera's marketing evolved rather than acknowledging the error.

• **Implicit prediction that educated consumers would see through the campaign**: The author's confidence that "anyone who actually understands chemistry" would find the ads offensive suggests an expectation that scientific literacy would prevail. This is harder to evaluate empirically, but the campaign's eventual disappearance suggests it may not have resonated as hoped.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses a limited-scope marketing campaign that was already scientifically questionable at publication and had minimal broader impact on the biotechnology industry or food science. While chemically accurate and well-argued, it critiques a temporary marketing tactic rather than substantive developments in biotechnology, clinical outcomes, or regulatory policy.
