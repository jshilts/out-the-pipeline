# Does Celebrex Have A Future At All? (Dec 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2005 commentary discusses the controversial context surrounding Pfizer's COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex in the wake of the Vioxx withdrawal. The author relays a correspondent's skeptical analysis that Pfizer's planned four-year cardiovascular outcomes trial was primarily "lawsuit insurance" rather than genuine scientific inquiry. The piece raises ethical concerns about continuing to study a drug when emerging evidence (particularly from researcher Garrett Fitzgerald) suggested COX-2 inhibitors might have mechanism-based cardiovascular risks.

The article notes that two key rationales for COX-2 inhibitors were under threat: first, accumulating evidence questioned the cardiovascular safety profile, and second, their gastrointestinal safety advantage over conventional NSAIDs appeared less robust than initially hoped. This left pain relief as Celebrex's primary remaining justification, forcing difficult questions about the ethics of exposing trial participants to potentially dangerous drugs. The author reflects on the inherent uncertainty in drug development, where risks often only emerge after millions of patients have been exposed.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent years following this 2005 article validated many of these concerns. Celebrex (celecoxib) remained on the market but with significantly enhanced safety warnings and restrictions. The FDA ultimately required a black box warning for all NSAIDs, including Celebrex, highlighting cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks.

Pfizer completed the large PRECISION trial (published 2016), which enrolled over 24,000 patients with arthritis and high cardiovascular risk. The results showed Celebrex was non-inferior to ibuprofen and naproxen regarding cardiovascular safety, but achieved this only under conditions of careful patient monitoring and with mandatory gastroprotective medications.

Market uptake of Celebrex declined substantially post-2005. Many physicians became hesitant to prescribe COX-2 inhibitors, often reserving them for patients with specific contraindications to traditional NSAIDs. The entire COX-2 drug class lost its blockbuster status. Merck's Vioxx withdrawal in 2004 resulted in enormous litigation costs (ultimately settling for $4.85 billion), and similar legal exposure affected Pfizer, though at smaller scale.

Public policy changes included FDA scrutiny of drug safety emerging post-marketing, accelerated development of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), and strengthened post-market surveillance requirements. The episode contributed to passage of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, which enhanced agency authority to mandate post-market safety studies and modify drug labels.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The correspondence articulated several predictions and assessments about Celebrex's trajectory:

• **Lawsuit insurance motivation**: The prediction that Pfizer's trial was primarily defensive legal strategy proved largely accurate. While PRECISION trial produced important scientific information, the primary impetus was addressing cardiovascular safety concerns to maintain market viability amid litigation fears.

• **Ethical concerns about trial design**: Historical hindsight suggests these concerns were substantial and prescient. Running large cardiovascular trials on drugs suspected of having mechanism-based harms raised difficult ethical questions that the field continues to debate.

• **COX-2 mechanism-based cardiovascular risk**: The Fitzgerald hypothesis referenced here proved partially correct. While celecoxib demonstrated some cardiovascular risk, PRECISION trial showed it was comparable to traditional NSAIDs when properly managed, suggesting the mechanism-based risk wasn't catastrophic but was real.

• **GI safety advantage insufficient**: This prediction was validated. The gastrointestinal superiority of COX-2 inhibitors over traditional NSAIDs, when combined with proton pump inhibitors, proved more modest than initially hoped, diminishing one key rationale for preferential COX-2 use.

• **Four-year trial as sufficient lawsuit protection**: This assessment underestimated both scientific and legal complexity. The PRECISION trial ultimately required eight years (published 2016) and FDA regulatory responses extended well beyond initial predictions.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates substantial early insight into the professional and public policy implications of drug safety crises while articulating prescient concerns about COX-2 cardiovascular risks years before definitive trial data emerged, making it historically significant for understanding pharmaceutical risk-benefit assessment evolution.
