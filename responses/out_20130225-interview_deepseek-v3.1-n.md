I notice that the provided URL appears to be incomplete or incorrect. The link `https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/interview/` doesn't lead to a specific interview article, and the DOI reference `10.1016/j.tips.2013.01.003` would need to be accessed through the actual journal.

To properly complete this task, I would need either:
1. The complete URL to the actual interview/article
2. The full text of the interview that you'd like me to analyze
3. Access to the Trends in Pharmacological Sciences article from February 2013

Could you please provide either the full text of the interview or a working link to the complete article? Without the actual content of the interview, I cannot:
- Summarize what the interview said
- Research subsequent developments related to its topics
- Evaluate any predictions that were made
- Assess its interest level

Once you provide the interview content, I'll be happy to apply the structured analysis template you've outlined.
