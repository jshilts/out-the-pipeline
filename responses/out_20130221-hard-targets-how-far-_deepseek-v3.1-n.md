# The Hard Targets: How Far Along Are We? (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article addresses the persistent challenge of "undruggable" targets in drug discovery, particularly protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and transcription factors. The author notes that despite years of industry discussion about the need to tackle these targets as traditional small-molecule binding sites become scarcer, there has been limited progress. The piece highlights fundamental questions about whether the difficulty stems from inadequate compound libraries, insufficient screening techniques, or the intrinsic biological complexity of these targets. A central concern is whether the field is stuck in a cycle of avoidance due to difficulty, and whether concerted effort could overcome these challenges or simply generate more failures.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments since 2013 show significant but measured progress in drugging historically difficult targets:

**Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** Several PPI inhibitors reached clinical development and approval. Venetoclax (ABT-199), a BCL-2 inhibitor approved by FDA in 2016 for certain leukemias, became a breakthrough success, demonstrating that large PPI interfaces could be drugged with small molecules. Other PPI programs advanced through clinical trials, though many faced challenges with selectivity and toxicity profiles. Fragment-based drug discovery and structure-based design became more sophisticated, enabling better targeting of PPI hotspots.

**Transcription Factors:** Progress remained slower for direct transcription factor inhibition, though indirect approaches gained traction. BET bromodomain inhibitors (such as OTX015 and I-BET762) advanced in clinical trials for cancer, representing a structural approach to modulating transcription indirectly. Direct small-molecule targeting of transcription factors like STAT3, MYC, and others continued to face significant challenges, with most programs failing to advance beyond preclinical stages.

**Clinical Outcomes:** The decade saw both successes and failures. While some PPI drugs achieved approval and clinical impact, many programs failed due to insufficient efficacy or unacceptable toxicity. Companies like Novartis, Roche, and AbbVie invested heavily in PPI platforms, but success rates remained lower than for traditional targets.

**Technological Advances:** Cryo-electron microscopy revolutionized structural biology, enabling better characterization of PPI complexes. DNA-encoded libraries and covalent screening technologies emerged as new approaches to finding chemical matter for difficult targets. Computational methods improved, but still struggled to reliably predict PPI inhibitor binding.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was more diagnostic than predictive, raising questions rather than making specific forecasts. However, the underlying concerns can be evaluated:
- **Implicit expectation of progress on undruggable targets**: The field did make progress, particularly with PPIs, though transcription factors largely remained refractory. The progress was slower and more incremental than many hoped.
- **Concerns about staying "stuck" in avoidance**: Investment certainly increased, with major pharma companies dedicating significant resources to PPI drug discovery, suggesting the field moved beyond mere discussion toward active efforts.
- **Questions about compound library suitability**: Advances in fragment-based approaches and DNA-encoded libraries did address some library limitations, though finding quality chemical matter remained challenging.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article accurately identified persistent challenges in drug discovery that remained highly relevant for the subsequent decade. While it prompted important industry reflection, the impact was more confirming existing difficulties rather than catalyzing breakthrough solutions.
