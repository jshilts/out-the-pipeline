# Resveratrol: What's It Do For Mitochondria? (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 blog-style commentary discusses a newly published PLOS Biology paper that challenged the prevailing mechanistic model of resveratrol. At the time, the dominant hypothesis was that resveratrol activated SIRT1, which in turn activated the coactivator PGC1α, leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and enhanced running endurance. The new study reported that it could not reproduce these findings, instead claiming that SIRT1 actually decreased PGC1α activity and downregulated mitochondria.

The commentary also highlighted a peculiar aspect of the publication – the brief appearance and subsequent disappearance of reader comments questioning the quality of Western blot data in the paper, raising concerns about sloppy experimental techniques and confusing control lanes that were never adequately addressed.

## 2. HISTORY

The skepticism expressed in this 2013 article proved prescient, as the resveratrol field underwent significant scrutiny and re-evaluation in the following years. The SIRT1 activation hypothesis, which had generated substantial excitement, faced mounting challenges from failed reproduction studies.

Key developments included:

**Scientific Re-Evaluation**: Multiple subsequent studies confirmed that the original findings about resveratrol's effects on SIRT1 and mitochondrial biogenesis were indeed difficult to reproduce. The mechanistic pathway (resveratrol → SIRT1 → PGC1α → mitochondria) that had driven much of the research enthusiasm was not consistently supported across different laboratories.

**Clinical Trial Outcomes**: Despite early promise, resveratrol failed to deliver meaningful clinical benefits in human studies. The compound showed poor bioavailability when administered orally, with rapid metabolism limiting its effectiveness. Human clinical trials for various conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, produced largely negative or inconclusive results.

**Commercial Disappointments**: Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which had been acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million based largely on resveratrol-related research, faced significant setbacks. The company's lead compounds failed to show consistent efficacy in clinical trials, leading to the eventual shutdown of most Sirtris operations.

**Regulatory Impact**: No resveratrol-based drugs received FDA approval for any major indication, and the compound remains available primarily as a dietary supplement rather than a pharmaceutical intervention.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions, but the implicit skepticism about the reproducibility and mechanistic understanding of resveratrol's effects was well-founded. The concerns raised aligned with what would become major issues in the field:

• **Reproducibility Crisis**: The inability to reproduce key findings became a defining characteristic of resveratrol research, contributing to broader discussions about research quality in biomedical science
• **Mechanistic Uncertainty**: The SIRT1 activation model never achieved scientific consensus, with competing explanations emerging for resveratrol's observed effects
• **Clinical Translation Failure**: The bench-to-bedside pathway that seemed promising in 2013 never materialized into effective therapeutics

The commentary's questioning of experimental quality (via the noted Western blot concerns) also anticipated later revelations about methodological problems in the field, though it didn't explicitly predict the widespread clinical failures that would follow.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment of scientific skepticism about resveratrol research, just before the field's clinical and commercial failures became apparent. While it addressed an important reproducibility issue, the broader implications and clinical significance remained unclear at the time of publication.
