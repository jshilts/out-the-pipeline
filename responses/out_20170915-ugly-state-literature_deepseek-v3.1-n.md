# The Ugly State of the Literature These Days (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights the growing problem of predatory academic journals that publish papers without proper peer review, focusing primarily on payment-based acceptance. These journals charge authors publication fees but skip legitimate editorial and review processes, leading to a flood of low-quality scientific literature. A key study referenced in the article found that even reputable institutions like Harvard and major funding bodies including NIH were represented among authors publishing in these predatory venues, with India and the US being top sources of such publications.

The piece specifically targets the Omics Group, a large predatory publisher accused by the FTC of deceptive practices including sham peer review, falsely claiming editorial board members, and misrepresenting journal metrics. The author expresses concern that pharmaceutical companies are also publishing in these journals and participating in Omics conferences, potentially for marketing purposes. The article concludes by noting that while traditional scientific publishing faces its own challenges (including piracy via Sci-Hub), the rise of predatory publishers represents a serious threat to scientific integrity that needs institutional attention.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article's publication, significant developments occurred in addressing predatory publishing:

**Regulatory and Legal Actions:**
- In **2019**, the FTC won its case against Omics Group, resulting in a **$50.1 million judgment** against the company for deceptive practices. The court found that Omics had indeed engaged in misleading publishing practices as alleged.
- However, enforcement proved challenging, with the FTC still pursuing collection efforts years later, highlighting the difficulty of regulating international publishing operations.

**Industry and Institutional Responses:**
- Major funding agencies and universities began implementing stricter policies regarding publication standards in grant applications and promotion decisions.
- Databases like **Beall's List** (which originally identified predatory journals) became more influential, though the list itself faced controversies and was eventually discontinued, with other watchdog efforts emerging to take its place.
- The legitimate open-access movement worked to distinguish itself more clearly from predatory publishers, with organizations like the **Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)** providing clearer guidelines.

**Persistence of the Problem:**
- Predatory publishing continued to grow, with estimates suggesting hundreds of thousands of papers being published annually in such venues by the early 2020s.
- The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily exacerbated the issue, with predatory publishers quickly launching "special issues" capitalizing on the crisis.
- Traditional publishers faced continued pressure from the Sci-Hub phenomenon, with some adapting their business models toward more open-access options.

**Impact on Pharmaceutical Industry:**
- Several pharmaceutical companies faced scrutiny for publications in predatory journals, leading to internal policy changes regarding publication practices and conference participation.
- The issue became part of broader discussions about research integrity and transparency in clinical trial reporting.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **That institutions would need to stop rewarding predatory publications**: This partially materialized. Many universities and funding agencies did implement policies distinguishing legitimate from predatory venues, though the transition was gradual and implementation varied significantly across institutions.

• **That the problem would continue growing unless institutional incentives changed**: This proved accurate. Predatory publishing continued to expand despite increased awareness, though some evidence suggested the growth rate slowed in certain regions due to policy changes.

• **That the FTC case against Omics would be significant**: This was correct. The FTC victory set an important precedent for regulatory action against deceptive publishing practices, though enforcement remained challenging.

• **That traditional publishers would face irrecoverable threat from Sci-Hub**: This was partially accurate. Traditional publishers did face continued pressure, with some adapting their models toward more open access, but the established publishers largely survived through business model evolution rather than collapsing.

• **Implicit prediction that biopharma companies participating with Omics would face reputation damage**: This materialized to some extent, with increased scrutiny on publication practices in the industry, though the impact varied by company and became part of broader discussions about research transparency.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article successfully identified a growing threat to scientific integrity that became increasingly relevant in subsequent years, particularly as predatory publishing expanded and regulatory actions unfolded. The piece demonstrated good foresight in recognizing both the scale of the problem and the specific challenges that certain publishers like Omics would face legally. However, while the basic phenomenon remains important, many of the specific details and examples have been superseded by broader discussions about research quality and reproducibility that extend beyond just predatory publishing.
