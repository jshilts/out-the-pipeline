# Good News in Hiring, Maybe? (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reported emerging rumors that a large pharmaceutical company was preparing to hire scientists, specifically medicinal chemistry positions—something that had become rare in the industry at the time. The author noted this would represent a reversal from the prevailing trend where pharma companies had been cutting scientific positions rather than expanding them. The piece conveyed cautious optimism about potential positive shifts in pharmaceutical industry hiring practices.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013-2023 period following this article saw significant volatility and transformation in pharmaceutical R&D hiring:

**Initial recovery (2013-2019):** Large pharma companies did gradually increase hiring of medicinal chemists and drug discovery scientists, though growth was uneven across companies. Major players like Pfizer, Novartis, and Merck expanded their R&D operations, particularly in oncology and immunology. The biotech sector showed stronger job growth than traditional big pharma.

**Shift toward specialized roles:** Hiring increasingly focused on computational chemistry, biologics development, and oncology drug discovery rather than traditional small-molecule medicinal chemistry. Many companies reduced internal medicinal chemistry infrastructure while building expertise in antibody-drug conjugates, gene therapies, and immuno-oncology.

**COVID-19 impact (2020-2022):** The pandemic created unprecedented hiring surges in vaccine development and antiviral research, with companies like Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and others rapidly expanding their scientific workforce. mRNA technology platforms became major hiring focal points.

**2023 cooling:** Economic pressures led some companies to scale back hiring again, with layoffs occurring at companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and others as patent cliffs and pricing pressures mounted.

Throughout this period, the industry trend shifted toward external innovation partnerships, biotech acquisitions, and flexible R&D networks rather than solely expanding internal medicinal chemistry departments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction:** Large pharma companies would resume hiring medicinal chemists after a prolonged drought.

**Reality:** This prediction proved partially correct but overly narrow. While some hiring resumed, the nature of pharmaceutical research evolved significantly:
- Traditional medicinal chemistry roles grew modestly and selectively
- Hiring emphasis shifted toward specialized areas: biologics, cell/gene therapy, computational drug design, and oncology-focused platforms
- Much expansion occurred through biotech acquisitions rather than direct hiring
- External partnerships and contract research organizations played larger roles in drug discovery

The broader trend was diversification of pharmaceutical R&D capabilities rather than simple expansion of traditional medicinal chemistry departments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addressed a timely but narrow industry employment trend that had modest long-term importance compared to broader technological and scientific developments in biotechnology during this period.
