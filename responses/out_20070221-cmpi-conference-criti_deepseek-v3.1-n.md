# CMPI Conference: Critical Path (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This conference panel discussed the FDA's Critical Path Initiative and the state of personalized medicine in 2007. The panel included representatives from the FDA, Pfizer, BG Medicine, Genomas, and industry publications. Participants acknowledged that genomics had been overhyped in prior years, leading to media cynicism. Janet Woodcock (FDA) noted that parts of the scientific community were pushing back against personalized medicine approaches, constrained by limited resources for proposal review. John Swen of Pfizer described biomarker development and translational medicine as a "long slog" requiring extended timelines before delivering results. The discussion highlighted early biomarker work for predicting drug side effects, exemplified by companies investigating liver toxicity (BG Medicine) and genetic markers for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (Genomas), while panelists disagreed on whether media or industry bore greater responsibility for past hype cycles.

## 2. HISTORY

The Critical Path Initiative, launched by the FDA in 2004, continued throughout the late 2000s and 2010s with mixed but increasingly concrete outcomes. Following the 2007 conference period, several significant developments unfolded:

**Drug Development and Biomarkers:** By the late 2000s, biomarker adoption accelerated significantly. Genomic biomarkers became established in oncology drug development, exemplified by successful targeted therapies like vemurafenib (BRAF mutation in melanoma, approved 2011) and companion diagnostics for drugs such as trastuzumab (HER2 testing, established practice). BG Medicine continued developing biomarkers, eventually going public in 2011, though it faced financial challenges typical of diagnostic companies in this period.

**Pharmacogenomics Implementation:** FDA labeling increasingly incorporated pharmacogenomic information throughout the 2010s. For instance, warfarin labeling was updated in 2007 and 2010 to include information about CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants affecting dosing. Antipsychotic-induced metabolic effects—the topic Genomas addressed in 2007—led to greater attention to metabolic monitoring guidelines, though prospective genetic testing for weight gain risk did not become standard clinical practice.

**FDA Funding and Regulatory Evolution:** Research funding for the Critical Path Initiative remained constrained in subsequent years, but the FDA established programs like the Biomarker Qualification Program to provide clearer pathways for biomarker validation. By 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act expanded regulatory flexibility for biomarkers and precision medicine. Clinical trial designs did evolve, with adaptive designs gaining broader acceptance, though industry adoption remained gradual rather than revolutionary.

**Pfizer's Bayesian Trial:** Pfizer's Bayesian clinical trial efforts expanded, but Bayesian methods remained a minority approach in pharmaceutical development into the 2010s, with uptake concentrated in specific therapeutic areas and smaller biopharma companies rather than becoming industry standard. Traditional randomized controlled trials continued to dominate regulatory submissions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The panel offered several implicit and explicit predictions about personalized medicine and regulatory science:

• **Janet Woodcock's prediction that personalized medicine would be the "single best use" of Critical Path funding:** This proved largely accurate over the long term, as biomarker-driven drug development became central to oncology and expanded into other therapeutic areas. However, timelines were longer than implied—significant progress required well over a decade, with oncology leading the way while other disease areas lagged.

• **John Swen's "long slog" characterization of biomarker development:** This proved highly accurate. Biomarker implementation took much longer than mid-2000s optimism had suggested, with many challenges in validation, technical standardization, and clinical integration persisting into the 2020s. The complexity of translating genomic discoveries into routine clinical use exceeded initial timelines.

• **Implicit expectations about immediate or near-term delivery of personalized medicine:** These were overly optimistic. The field's trajectory involved much longer development cycles than 2007 discussions implied, with many scientific and regulatory hurdles extending well into the 2010s before substantial clinical implementation.

• **Expectations that success would quickly silence critics:** This partially materialized, as targeted cancer therapies demonstrated clear clinical benefits. However, critics continued questioning the broader economics and accessibility of personalized medicine, with cost-effectiveness debates and disparities in access persisting well beyond 2007.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment when industry and regulators acknowledged early genomics hype while outlining practical obstacles that proved largely accurate over the subsequent decade. It offers valuable historical context about the transition from reductionist genomic approaches to biomarker-integrated drug development.
