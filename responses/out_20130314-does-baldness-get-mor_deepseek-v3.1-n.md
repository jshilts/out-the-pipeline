# Does Baldness Get More Funding Than Malaria? (Mar 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary fact-checks two claims made by Bill Gates at the Royal Academy of Engineering's Global Grand Challenges Summit. First, Gates argued that capitalism leads to skewed research priorities, claiming that male baldness receives "an order of magnitude more research funding" than malaria because marketplace imperatives favor cosmetic treatments over diseases affecting poor populations. Gates presented malaria as an example of market failure in tropical disease research. Second, Gates expressed concern about a critical shortage of students entering STEM education in rich countries, contrasting this with growth in Asia. The author questions both claims—pointing out that scientific literature appears to contain far more publications on malaria drugs than baldness treatments, and arguing that the STEM shortage narrative ignores the reality that well-paying, interesting STEM jobs are less abundant than commonly claimed.

## 2. HISTORY

**On the baldness vs. malaria funding question:**

In the years following 2013, malaria research funding saw substantial growth, particularly through continued support from the Gates Foundation itself, along with increased global health funding mechanisms. Major malaria vaccine development accelerated, culminating in the WHO's recommendation of RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) in 2021 for widespread use in children in sub-Saharan Africa—the first-ever malaria vaccine. Additional vaccine candidates continued through clinical development. Meanwhile, malaria drug development expanded with new combination therapies and continued research into artemisinin-based treatments.

Baldness treatment research has remained active but concentrated in dermatology and cosmetic applications. The field continues to rely heavily on minoxidil (discovered accidentally in cardiovascular research) and finasteride, with newer approaches including PRP treatments, hair transplantation techniques, and some emerging topical formulations. However, breakthrough treatments have been limited, and the research scale appears modest compared to major disease areas.

**On STEM education and job markets:**

The post-2013 period revealed complex dynamics in STEM fields. While technology sectors (particularly software engineering, data science, and AI) experienced strong job growth and high salaries, particularly in the 2010s tech boom, other STEM fields showed more varied outcomes. Concerns emerged about PhD overproduction in certain scientific fields, adjunctification in academia, and the quality of many STEM jobs. The H-1B visa system continued to be a point of contention regarding both demand for and supply of STEM workers.

The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily boosted public appreciation for science but also revealed vulnerabilities in the research workforce. The growth of AI and machine learning created new high-demand areas, while traditional laboratory science positions remained competitive. Asia's STEM education expansion continued, with countries like China and India producing large numbers of graduates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Gates' prediction about marketplace imperatives favoring cosmetic research**: This has been partially borne out in that pharmaceutical companies continue to invest heavily in areas with clear market demand and pricing power. However, the specific baldness vs. malaria comparison doesn't appear accurate—malaria research has received hundreds of millions in funding through global health initiatives, foundations, and pharmaceutical partnerships. Gates' own foundation became one of the largest funders of malaria research, partially addressing the market failure he identified.

• **Implicit prediction about continued underfunding of tropical diseases**: This has not held true for malaria specifically. Substantial funding increases occurred, with multiple vaccines and drug candidates advancing through development. However, many other neglected tropical diseases continue to receive inadequate attention, validating Gates' broader concern about market failures.

• **Gates' concern about STEM shortages in rich countries**: The actual outcome has been sector-specific. While some STEM fields experienced genuine shortages and strong wage growth (software engineering, certain data science roles), other areas saw oversupply and underemployment, particularly in academic research positions. The prediction was overly broad—shortages existed in some areas while surpluses existed in others.

• **Implicit prediction about Asia's STEM advantage**: This has largely proven correct, with Asian countries continuing to expand STEM education and produce large numbers of graduates. However, the relationship between STEM degree production and economic advantage has been complex, with quality and alignment with market needs varying significantly.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article touches on enduring tensions in research funding priorities and workforce development that remain highly relevant today. It raises legitimate questions about both the evidence for Gates' claims and the broader systemic issues in how societies allocate scientific resources and train scientists. The themes continue to influence policy debates about global health funding, pharmaceutical R&D incentives, and STEM education reform. While the specific examples have evolved, the underlying questions about market failures in science funding and the reality of STEM job markets remain important and unresolved.

The critique of Gates' rhetorical examples serves as a useful reminder that even well-intentioned advocacy can benefit from careful fact-checking, and that genuine systemic problems (like neglected diseases) can be obscured by questionable supporting anecdotes.
