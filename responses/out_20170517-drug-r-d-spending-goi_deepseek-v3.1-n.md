# Is Drug R&D Spending Going Up or Down? (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper by Frank David and Richa Dixit analyzing R&D spending trends at the ten largest pharmaceutical companies from 2005-2015. The key findings show that while revenues remained essentially flat (CAGR of -0.01%) and SG&A expenses declined (CAGR of -1.12%), R&D spending actually increased over this period with a CAGR of +1.76%, with all figures adjusted for inflation. Furthermore, when companies experienced revenue declines of 5% or more, they either continued increasing R&D spending or cut it less than SG&A reductions. The author notes this contradicts common perceptions that pharmaceutical companies prioritize other expenses over research, suggesting R&D is being protected as a strategic priority.

## 2. HISTORY

From 2017 onwards, pharmaceutical R&D spending has generally continued its upward trajectory, though with some notable changes in composition and focus:

**Spending Growth Continues:** Major pharmaceutical companies have continued to increase R&D investment through the late 2010s and into the 2020s. The industry has maintained R&D as a higher percentage of revenue compared to earlier decades.

**Focus Shifts:** The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated investment in mRNA technology and vaccine development, with companies like Pfizer, Moderna, and BioNTech significantly expanding their R&D capabilities in these areas. Oncology R&D has also seen substantial growth, with immuno-oncology and CAR-T cell therapies attracting major investment.

**R&D Productivity Concerns:** Despite increased spending, the fundamental challenge of R&D productivity - the cost per new drug approval - has remained a persistent industry concern throughout this period. This has driven continued exploration of new approaches like AI in drug discovery.

**Policy Changes:** Government initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act have changed the economic calculus for drug development, particularly affecting older drugs' revenue potential and potentially influencing future R&D investment strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit prediction in the article:** That R&D spending would continue to be protected as a priority, even in challenging economic times.

- **Assessment:** Largely accurate. Throughout the late 2010s and 2020s, major pharmaceutical companies have maintained or increased R&D investment even during periods of economic uncertainty, including the pandemic. However, the growth hasn't necessarily solved underlying productivity challenges, leading to increasing interest in new technologies and approaches.

**That R&D growth pattern would continue down the company size ladder:**

- **Assessment:** Mixed. While R&D has remained important across the industry, smaller companies and biotech firms have shown more volatility in R&D spending based on financing availability and market conditions.

**That flat revenues wouldn't deter R&D investment:**

- **Assessment:** Correct. Industry data since 2017 shows continued R&D investment growth even when revenue growth has been modest or uncertain.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article provides valuable empirical data about industry spending patterns and usefully corrects some common misperceptions about R&D prioritization, though it focuses on a more operational/economics aspect of biotechnology rather than scientific breakthroughs or clinical impact.
