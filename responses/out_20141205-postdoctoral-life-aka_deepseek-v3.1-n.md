# Postdoctoral Life (AKA What Shortage?) (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the prevailing narrative of a "shortage" of qualified scientists and engineers, arguing that postdoctoral life is difficult partly because there is an oversupply of researchers rather than a shortage. It summarizes a report on the poor conditions facing postdocs: lack of defined training guidelines, temporary mentored positions that function more as cheap labor than training, and intense competition due to too many postdocs chasing too few academic jobs. The piece connects this glut to concerning trends, such as heightened pressure on junior researchers to compromise research integrity. The author also references reporting from Nature and Businessweek to argue that the widely repeated "STEM shortage" is a myth used to suppress wages and working conditions, where employers cannot find talent "at the price they want" rather than due to a lack of qualified candidates.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication in December 2014, the postdoc situation and the debate over STEM shortages evolved but many core issues persisted:

- **Frequent reports and initiatives acknowledged the crisis**: A major 2014 NIH Biomedical Workforce report had already highlighted similar problems. Following years saw sustained discussion, with articles in *Nature* (2015, 2016) and *Science* (2017) confirming the lack of tenure-track jobs, rising numbers of Ph.D. graduates far exceeding available faculty positions, and concerns about research integrity.
- **Some funding agencies made modest reforms**: The NIH created tenure-track-like "Early Independence Awards" and capped the number of years an investigator could be funded as a postdoc on NIH grants. NSF also introduced policies to broaden postdoc career preparation beyond academia.
- **Private sector tech hiring surged**: From 2015–2022, tech sector wages rose sharply, indicating that employers needing talent had to compete on compensation. This observation cut against the "STEM shortage" rhetoric for that segment.
- **Ph.D. and postdoc unionization gained momentum**: In 2016, Columbia University student-workers voted to unionize. Subsequent rulings and organizing efforts reflected a structural shift in academia, with graduate students and postdocs demanding higher pay and better conditions.
- **The post-2020 "great resignation" and pandemic effects** led to further scrutiny of graduate school and postdoc viability, as inflation eroded stagnant stipends. Many institutions responded by raising stipends and offering more benefits and career navigation resources, but the imbalance between Ph.D. supply and academic job availability remained.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and assertions about what would continue to happen:

- **Prediction**: "Next week, and the week after, and the week after that we'll see more people talking about the terrible shortage of tech and science people. Bet on it."
  - **Evaluation**: Correct. The "STEM shortage" narrative has persisted in policy debates and news coverage long after 2014, with industry groups continuing to lobby for more international visas and government investment in STEM education under the premise of a shortage, while critics continued to point to stagnant wages and poor conditions as counter-evidence. The debate remained unresolved and ongoing.

- **Prediction**: The denial of poor academic job prospects "is probably the root of the problem," and senior scientists "can't go on ignoring" postdocs.
  - **Evaluation**: Partially correct regarding awareness, but incorrect that ignoring would stop. Although awareness of the problem grew (e.g., additional reports, university initiatives to improve postdoc training and career guidance), large-scale structural reform did not occur. Tenure-track positions remained scarce relative to Ph.D. production, and exploitation of postdocs as cheap, temporary labor continued in many labs.

- **Prediction**: Extrapolating from the cited survey data, intense competition would push younger scientists toward misconduct or corner-cutting.
  - **Evaluation**: This is difficult to verify empirically. Research on research misconduct tends to focus on high-profile retractions and data fabrication, and it is hard to attribute causes of misconduct to a single systemic factor. While high-pressure environments are often cited as risk factors, concrete evidence directly linking the postdoc glut to a measurable increase in fraud remains limited.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4**

This article addressed a persistent structural problem in academic science but did not offer a new solution or predict a major shift; instead, it synthesized existing complaints and trend pieces that continued to appear in subsequent years. The issue it raised remained relevant but not transformative in terms of policy outcomes or public impact.
