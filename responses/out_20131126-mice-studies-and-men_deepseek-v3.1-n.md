# Of Mice (Studies) and Men (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the widespread problem that therapies curing animals frequently fail to translate to humans, focusing on flaws in mouse studies of disease. It highlights that many animal studies suffer from poor experimental design: inadequate sample sizes, poor randomization, lack of blinding, and insufficient controls. The piece describes NIH efforts beginning in 2012 to improve standards, including workshops with journal editors to establish reporting requirements for animal research. It also touches on differences between industry and academic studies, referencing Lisa Bero's work showing that industry-sponsored research tends to be more rigorous (and paradoxically, less likely to report positive results), likely due to higher stakes and financial incentives.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication, several significant developments occurred:

**Reporting Standards Implementation**: Building on the 2012 NIH workshops mentioned, major journals adopted stricter standards for animal research reporting. The ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines, initially published in 2010, gained broader adoption and became required by many journals by the mid-to-late 2010s. These guidelines require detailed reporting of study design, sample sizes, randomization, blinding, and statistical methods.

**NIH Policy Changes**: NIH implemented stronger requirements for rigor and transparency in grant applications involving animal studies. Since 2015-2016, NIH grant applications must include specific descriptions of how the research will address potential biases, statistical plans, and reproducibility measures.

**Continued Translation Failures**: The fundamental problem highlighted in the article persisted. Analysis by industry groups showed that drug development success rates remained low, with target validation being a major bottleneck, partly driven by poor translatability from animal models.

**Advances in Alternative Models**: The recognition of mouse model limitations accelerated development and adoption of alternative approaches including organoids, induced pluripotent stem cell models, and more sophisticated human-cell-based systems, particularly in pharmaceutical R&D.

**Increased Emphasis on Sex Differences**: Post-2014, NIH and other funding agencies mandated inclusion of both sexes in animal studies unless scientifically justified, addressing a major confounding variable that contributed to poor translatability.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's discussion topics and implicit predictions:
- **That new rules and requirements would be implemented** → **Partially accurate, moderate success**: Standards were indeed adopted, but improving rigor in animal studies proved more complex than suggested
- **That industry would maintain higher standards than academia** → **Continuing trend**: Industry studies generally remained more rigorous, though academic standards improved through requirements
- **That poor animal study design contributes to clinical trial failures** → **Accepted view**: This became widely accepted as a contributing factor
- **That minimum requirements could be usefully applied across fields** → **Divergent outcomes**: While basic standards were adopted, field-specific variations remained necessary, supporting Bass's concerns about blanket requirements

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

This article addresses a persistent, high-cost problem in biomedical research with documented real-world impact on drug development timelines and costs. The transparency and rigor issues it highlights remain relevant in 2025.
