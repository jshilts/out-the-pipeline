# Block That Review (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece describes a short‑selling strategy employed by hedge‑fund manager Martin Shkreli (then of MSMB Capital) against NeoProbe, a small biotech developing the radiopharmaceutical contrast agent **Lymphoseek** (tilmanocept) for sentinel‑lymph‑node mapping. Shkreli doubted the robustness of NeoProbe’s Phase III data because the trial compared Lymphoseek only to an FDA‑approved blue dye, whereas in clinical practice the dye is almost always used together with a radiocolloid tracer. To reinforce his bearish thesis, Shkreli filed a **citizen petition** with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, arguing that the company’s regulatory filings were flawed and urging the agency to deny review. He disclosed his short position alongside the petition, noting that such petitions are rarely filed for altruistic reasons but can be used as a competitive weapon.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome** – The FDA approved Lymphoseek (tilmanocept) on **December 19 2013** for sentinel‑lymph‑node detection in breast cancer and melanoma. The approval was based on the same Phase III data that Shkreli had criticized; the agency concluded that the agent’s specificity and safety justified clearance despite the trial’s comparator design. The citizen petition filed by Shkreli was **denied**; the FDA did not find the arguments sufficient to halt review.

**Commercial trajectory** – After approval, NeoProbe’s stock rallied sharply, peaking around $30 per share in early 2014. In **July 2015**, Cardinal Health acquired NeoProbe for **≈ $1.1 billion** (cash plus stock). The product was marketed under the brand name **Lymphoseek** and generated modest sales (estimated ≈ $30–40 million annually in the first few years). Adoption has been limited; many nuclear medicine departments continue to use the traditional blue‑dye + technetium‑99m sulfur colloid combination because it is cheaper and already entrenched in workflow. Lymphoseek’s market share remains a single‑digit percentage of the overall sentinel‑node‑mapping market.

**Business impact** – Cardinal Health’s acquisition did not become a major revenue driver. By 2020 the company had written down a portion of the purchase price and eventually spun off its radiopharmaceutical business to a private‑equity firm (B. Riley & Co.) in 2021. NeoProbe’s technology continues to be licensed for investigational uses (e.g., in head‑and‑neck cancers), but no additional FDA‑approved indications have been added as of early 2026.

**Shkreli’s later activities** – The short‑selling episode did not profit Shkreli; the stock’s post‑approval surge erased any gains from the short. He later became infamous for acquiring **Turing Pharmaceuticals** in 2015 and raising the price of Daraprim (pyrimethamine) from $13.50 to $750 per tablet, a move that attracted worldwide criticism. In 2017 Shkreli was convicted of securities‑fraud unrelated to the NeoProbe case and sentenced to seven years in federal prison (released in 2022 on parole). His reputation as a “short‑seller‑turned‑pharma‑CEO” remains a cautionary tale about the limits of activist short‑selling in biotech.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction (implicit):** The FDA would reject Lymphoseek because the pivotal trial’s comparator (blue dye alone) did not reflect real‑world standard of care, leading to a regulatory setback.  
  - **Outcome:** **Incorrect.** The FDA approved Lymphoseek in 2013 despite the comparator issue; the citizen petition was denied.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** NeoProbe’s stock would suffer long‑term as the product failed to gain market traction.  
  - **Outcome:** **Partially correct.** While the product achieved regulatory approval, commercial uptake has been modest, and the company was eventually sold at a premium but later written down.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** Shkreli’s short‑selling strategy would be a novel, effective way to profit from regulatory challenges.  
  - **Outcome:** **Incorrect.** The short position was overtaken by the stock’s rally after approval; the strategy did not yield profit.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is notable for documenting an early, high‑profile use of a citizen petition as a short‑seller’s weapon and for foreshadowing the later notoriety of Martin Shkreli; the subsequent regulatory and commercial history of Lymphoseek adds concrete relevance.
