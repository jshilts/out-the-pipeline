# Article Title (1 Nov 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY
This personal reflection describes the biotech/drug discovery work environment in 1989 compared to 2019, written by a medicinal chemist celebrating 30 years in the industry. The article contrasts the technology of both eras: manual column chromatography, no walkup LC/MS, NMR without sample handlers, and—most significantly—no personal computers. Computers were initially seen as distractions from laboratory work, arrived later as shared Mac IIci models, and enabled email and basic data tools. Data management was error-prone, with assay data sometimes trapped on individuals' personal systems. The author also notes the early-1990s transition from tissue-slice assays to cloned GPCR subtypes, which enabled more selective molecular optimization but exposed downstream challenges like poor pharmacokinetics (PK) and the difficulty of CNS diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's). Substance-specific failures included early Alzheimer's projects and beta/gamma-secretase work before the targets were clearly identified.

## 2. HISTORY
- **Computing and data infrastructure**: By the 2000s–2010s, laboratory informatics became standard (LIMS, ELN), cloud backups routine, and networked LC/MS and NMR with sample handlers widely adopted. Automated purification systems and integrated data pipelines are now common, reducing manual errors and improving traceability.
- **Alzheimer's drug development**: Subsequent outcomes largely validated the author's caution. Many BACE (beta-secretase) inhibitors failed in Phase 3 (e.g., Merck's verubecestat, Lilly/阿斯利康's lanabecestat, Novartis/Amgen's CNP520/umibecestat). Criticisms included poor brain penetration, off-target effects, and worsening cognitive/functional outcomes, leading many companies to halt programs. The amyloid hypothesis has had mixed validation in recent years (e.g., Biogen's aducanumab received controversial accelerated approval but was later discontinued and showed limited clinical uptake; lecanemab shows modest cognitive benefit with safety risks). The broader point—that in vitro potency/selectivity does not guarantee in vivo success, especially in CNS—remains well-supported.
- **GPCR drug discovery**: The shift to cloned GPCR subtypes and high-throughput screening matured into a cornerstone of drug discovery, with GPCRs representing a major fraction of approved drugs and an expanded pharmacopeia across cardiovascular, metabolic, and CNS indications. However, PK/PD, tissue exposure, and safety remain key bottlenecks (as the article suggested), and many programs continue to fail in the clinic for reasons beyond receptor affinity/selectivity.
- **Personal context**: The author's career continued into 2019 and beyond, maintaining a widely read industry blog and a critical perspective on drug discovery hype and clinical outcomes, consistent with the themes in this piece.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- None explicitly. The article is retrospective and reflective rather than predictive. Its implicit arguments—that selective assays alone do not solve real-world drug discovery problems, and that technology improvements do not remove the core uncertainties of empirical testing—have been consistently validated by subsequent R&D failures in Alzheimer's and other complex diseases.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 6/10**
A useful historical snapshot for drug discovery practitioners and sensible caution against over-hyping technology, but of niche scope rather than broad long-term importance.
