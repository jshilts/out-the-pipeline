# Shop Up Some Gels For the Paper (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 blog post discusses the emerging problem of image manipulation and gel duplication in biology papers. The article highlights how automated software tools were beginning to replace manual efforts in detecting scientific fraud, specifically mentioning an Italian company that developed technology to search for duplicated images in scientific publications using pattern recognition software. The piece cites a researcher's preliminary analysis estimating that approximately 25% of papers with gel images potentially violated image integrity guidelines, with around 10% showing obvious manipulation like cut-and-paste operations. The author expresses enthusiasm for this technological approach to research integrity and suggests expanding it to other analytical methods like NMR spectra.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade saw significant developments in image integrity and research misconduct detection. The described Italian company appears to have been part of a broader movement toward automated research integrity tools. Major publishers and journals implemented systematic screening processes for image manipulation, with many adopting commercial software solutions.

Concrete impacts include: widespread adoption of image screening by major publishers like Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley; the rise of companies like Proofig and ImageTwin providing commercial detection services; systematic retraction increases for image manipulation from approximately 50 retractions annually in 2013 to over 200 annually by 2018-2020; and development of AI-based detection tools featuring deep learning algorithms for pattern recognition. Research integrity offices at universities and funding agencies established formal image analysis protocols. The technology did expand beyond gels to other analytical methods including NMR spectra, mass spectrometry, and microscopy, though implementation varied by journal and institution. Funding agencies like the NIH and NSF incorporated image screening into their oversight processes, and retraction rates for image-related misconduct increased substantially, indicating both better detection and continued underlying problems.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: The technique could be adapted to published NMR spectra**

- **Outcome**: ✅ Successfully realized. Multiple commercial and academic tools now offer automated screening for various analytical techniques including NMR, mass spectrometry, microscopy, and Western blots. Major publishers routinely screen multiple image types.

**Prediction: The Italian researcher would publish his systematic results on gel analysis**

- **Outcome**: ✅ Realized. Systematic studies of image manipulation prevalence in scientific literature were published by various groups from 2015-2020, with estimates generally confirming or exceeding the 10-25% problematic figures cited in the article.

**Prediction: Widespread adoption of automated detection tools**

- **Outcome**: ✅ Successfully realized. By 2018-2020, most major scientific publishers had implemented some form of automated image screening, and research integrity became a more systematic part of scientific publishing workflows.

## 4. INTEREST

Score: 7/10

This article captured an emerging technological shift in research integrity at its inflection point, accurately foreseeing how automation would transform misconduct detection in ways that proved remarkably prescient.
