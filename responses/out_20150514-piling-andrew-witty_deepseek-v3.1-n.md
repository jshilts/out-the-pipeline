# Piling On Andrew Witty (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This May 2015 commentary responds to calls for Andrew Witty's resignation as CEO of GSK, particularly referencing criticism from John LaMattina at Forbes. The core criticism centered on Witty's strategic direction for GSK, which appeared to de-emphasize traditional high-risk drug discovery in areas like cancer, rare diseases, and Alzheimer's in favor of vaccines and consumer healthcare products. 

The article's author acknowledges concerns about the long-term sustainability of aggressive pharmaceutical pricing strategies but defends the model where groundbreaking drugs that provide substantial clinical benefits merit premium pricing as just reward for R&D risk-taking. The piece distinguishes between genuine innovation worth high prices versus marginal improvements that shouldn't command premium pricing, while generally supporting Witty's caution about overusing pricing power as a strategic tool.

## 2. HISTORY

Andrew Witty remained CEO of GSK until 2017, when he stepped down after nearly a decade in leadership. His tenure was indeed marked by significant strategic shifts away from high-risk drug discovery toward more predictable revenue streams.

**GSK's Strategic Transformation:** Under Witty, GSK did reduce investment in areas like neuroscience and traditional small molecule drug discovery. The company significantly expanded its vaccine business (acquiring Novartis' vaccine business in 2015) and consumer healthcare operations. This strategy produced more stable, predictable revenues but resulted in a thinner late-stage pipeline for innovative medicines.

**Pipeline and R&D Outcomes:** During 2015-2017 and beyond, GSK's pipeline produced some notable successes in its focused areas, particularly vaccines and HIV treatments. However, the company notably lagged competitors in oncology and rare diseases during this period.

**Subsequent Developments:** Emma Walmsley succeeded Witty in 2017 and began reversing some of these strategies, particularly re-entering oncology in a major way through acquisitions and rebuilding R&D efforts. Post-2017, GSK acquired Tesaro (2018, oncology focus) and has been rebuilding its innovative medicine capabilities.

**Industry Context:** The broader industry did see continued pressure on drug pricing, with the hepatitis C drug pricing controversies and ongoing debates about value-based pricing models intensifying during this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction that GSK would decrease innovation in high-risk disease areas:** ✅ **Largely accurate**. GSK did indeed reduce R&D investment in areas like neuroscience, oncology, and rare diseases during Witty's tenure and immediately after. The company lost ground competitively in these areas, which subsequent leadership has been working to rebuild.

**Concern about pricing power sustainability:** ⚠️ **Partially validated**. The pharmaceutical industry has faced intensifying pricing pressure globally, with increased scrutiny, value assessment frameworks, and managed entry agreements becoming more common. However, breakthrough therapies in oncology, rare diseases, and other areas have generally maintained premium pricing when demonstrating clear clinical benefit.

**Implicit prediction that vaccines/consumer health strategy might prove limiting:** ⚖️ **Mixed outcomes**. The vaccine strategy provided GSK with stable revenues and market leadership. However, the reduced focus on innovative medicines did leave GSK with a thinner late-stage pipeline compared to peers, which subsequent leadership has acknowledged and worked to address through renewed investment and acquisitions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important strategic inflection point for a major pharmaceutical company and touches on enduring tensions in drug pricing and R&D priorities. The specific leadership debate has historical value, while the underlying themes about balancing innovation incentives with pricing sustainability remain relevant. However, the article's focus on a particular executive moment limits its broader long-term significance compared to pieces addressing fundamental scientific or policy questions.
