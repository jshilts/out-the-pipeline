# Bapineuzumab Still Does Not Work Against Alzheimer's (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports the failure of the anti‑amyloid monoclonal antibody **bapineuzumab** in a Phase III trial that enrolled patients **without the ApoE4 allele**—the subgroup that had shown the most promise in earlier studies. The trial missed its primary cognitive and functional endpoints, and subgroup analyses offered no hint of a responsive niche.  

Despite the setback, the author notes that Pfizer and J&J were still pursuing a **Phase II sub‑cutaneous dosing study** of the same antibody, and expresses skepticism about the prospects of other immunotherapy candidates, especially Eli Lilly’s competing antibody **solanezumab**. The tone is one of cautious pessimism: the immunological approach to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has repeatedly “delivered little encouragement,” and the author expects more “missed endpoints” and “more money” being poured into failing programs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Bapineuzumab**  
* After the August 2012 failure, Pfizer and J&J halted all further development of bapineuzumab in early 2013. The planned sub‑cutaneous Phase II study was **canceled**; no additional efficacy data were generated.  
* The drug never received regulatory approval and is now regarded as a textbook example of a high‑profile amyloid‑targeting failure.

**Solanezumab**  
* Solanezumab progressed through two large Phase III trials (EXPEDITION 1 & 2) that also missed primary endpoints in 2014. A subsequent trial in milder disease (EXPEDITION 3) in 2016 again failed.  
* A later “prevention” trial, **AHEAD 3‑45** (2022), enrolled cognitively normal participants with amyloid accumulation; it also failed to meet its primary cognitive endpoint.  
* Eli Lilly discontinued the program in 2023; solanezumab never achieved FDA approval.

**Other Amyloid Antibodies**  
* **Aducanumab** (Biogen) received accelerated FDA approval in June 2021 based on a surrogate biomarker (amyloid reduction) despite mixed clinical data. After a contentious CMS coverage decision, Biogen **withdrawn** the drug from the market in 2022.  
* **Lecanemab** (Eisai/Biogen) succeeded in the Phase III CLARITY‑AD trial (2022) and gained full FDA approval in July 2023, showing a modest slowing of cognitive decline in early AD.  
* **Donanemab** (Eli Lilly) achieved its primary endpoint in the TRAILBLAZER‑ALZ 2 trial (2023) and received accelerated FDA approval in July 2023 for early symptomatic AD.  

**Field‑wide Impact**  
* The repeated failures of bapineuzumab and solanezumab contributed to a shift in trial design: later studies focused on **earlier disease stages**, **biomarker‑enriched populations**, and **longer treatment durations**.  
* The FDA’s “accelerated approval” pathway for amyloid‑targeting drugs was invoked for aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, creating a new regulatory precedent but also sparking debate over clinical relevance versus biomarker changes.  
* Commercially, the setbacks led many large pharma companies to **diversify** their AD pipelines, investing more in **tau‑targeted therapies**, **neuroinflammation modulators**, and **non‑protein‑based approaches** (e.g., gene therapy, small‑molecule modulators).  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *Bapineuzumab will continue to be pursued (sub‑cutaneous dosing) despite the failure.*  
  **Outcome:** The sub‑cutaneous study was never completed; development was stopped in early 2013. The prediction was **incorrect**.

- **Prediction:** *Solanezumab has little chance of working; future trials will likely miss endpoints.*  
  **Outcome:** Solanezumab indeed failed multiple Phase III trials and was discontinued in 2023. The prediction was **accurate** regarding solanezumab’s lack of success.

- **Prediction:** *Immunological (antibody) approaches to AD will continue to “miss endpoints” and deliver little encouragement.*  
  **Outcome:** While early antibodies (bapineuzumab, solanezumab, aducanumab) failed or achieved only marginal regulatory success, **later antibodies (lecanemab, donanemab) have demonstrated clinically meaningful slowing of decline and obtained FDA approval**. The blanket pessimism was **partially wrong**; the field eventually produced approved therapies, albeit after many setbacks.

- **Implicit Prediction:** *Continued heavy investment in failing amyloid antibodies would be hard to justify.*  
  **Outcome:** Major pharma continued to invest heavily in amyloid antibodies through 2020‑2023, betting on improved trial designs and earlier intervention. The investment persisted longer than the author seemed to anticipate, though the eventual approvals of lecanemab and donanemab vindicated some of that risk.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in AD drug development, illustrating the early‑stage skepticism that preceded later breakthroughs. Its relevance lies in showing how repeated failures shaped trial design, regulatory policy, and the eventual emergence of approved amyloid antibodies.
