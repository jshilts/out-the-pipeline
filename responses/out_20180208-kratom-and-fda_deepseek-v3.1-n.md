# Kratom and the FDA (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the FDA's February 2018 announcement regarding kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant preparation used both recreationally and by some individuals to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. The FDA's key argument centered on computational modeling studies showing that kratom's main compounds—particularly mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine—exhibited opioid-like pharmacophores and could bind to mu-opioid receptors. The author, writing from an industrial medicinal chemistry perspective, questions why the FDA emphasized computational modeling when experimental evidence already existed demonstrating these compounds as partial agonists at mu-opioid receptors. The piece examines the scientific validity of kratom's classification as an opioid, the reliability of computational modeling versus experimental data, and ultimately supports FDA jurisdiction to regulate kratom as a drug while dismissing conspiracy theories about pharmaceutical industry interference.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the February 2018 FDA announcement, regulatory and scientific developments around kratom evolved significantly:

**Regulatory Actions:**
- The FDA maintained its position that kratom's active compounds (mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) act as opioid receptor agonists, leading to ongoing compliance actions against companies making unproven health claims
- Multiple FDA import alerts were issued to prevent kratom products from entering the U.S. market
- Several states and municipalities implemented their own kratom bans or age restrictions, while others considered or passed "Kratom Consumer Protection Acts" setting quality standards

**Scientific Developments:**
- The experimental data referenced in the article was indeed more definitive than computational modeling; subsequent research has solidified understanding that mitragynine acts as a partial mu-opioid agonist and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a more potent agonist
- Research continued exploring kratom's potential therapeutic applications, particularly for opioid withdrawal management and pain relief, though no FDA-approved medications resulted directly from kratom alkaloids
- Safety concerns intensified with reports to poison control centers and case studies of liver toxicity, addiction, and deaths where kratom was detected (though often with other substances present)
- The DEA considered scheduling kratom under the Controlled Substances Act but faced significant public opposition, ultimately not implementing federal scheduling

**Market and Legal Status:**
- Kratom remained widely available in the U.S. as a botanical supplement, sold primarily in specialty stores and online
- No major pharmaceutical company successfully developed a kratom-derived FDA-approved medication, partly due to the complex pharmacology and regulatory challenges
- The "natural products pharmacology" market continued to operate in a regulatory gray area, with quality control remaining a significant concern

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions made in the article:**
• **That kratom alkaloids would be "perfectly legitimate starting points for a medicinal chemistry program"**
  - **Outcome:** Very limited development occurred. No FDA-approved drugs derived from kratom reached market. Interest in mu-opioid receptor partial agonists continued for pain management, but pharmaceutical development largely focused on synthetic molecules with better IP protection and more predictable pharmacology.
  
• **That FDA would continue regulating kratom within its purview**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. FDA maintained active regulation, issuing warning letters, import alerts, and enforcement actions. No federal scheduling occurred, leaving kratom in a complex regulatory status between controlled substance and unapproved drug.

• **Implied prediction that computational modeling would remain secondary to experimental data**
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed. While computational methods advanced, drug development continued to rely heavily on experimental validation. The FDA's modeling approach proved less persuasive than existing experimental data in scientific communities.

• **That "time and money and effort" could determine kratom's therapeutic potential**
  - **Outcome:** Mixed. Limited systematic clinical trials occurred. The research community remained divided on therapeutic potential versus abuse risk, with insufficient evidence to support FDA-approved indications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article is moderately interesting as an example of how regulatory agencies use scientific evidence (and sometimes emphasize less-definitive computational approaches) when taking controversial positions on natural products. The kratom case study illuminates persistent challenges in botanical supplement regulation and the tension between scientific evidence quality and policy decisions.
