# Allergan Brings the Roof Down On Its Head (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a federal court ruling from Judge William Bryson that invalidated six of Allergan's patents protecting its blockbuster dry-eye drug Restasis. The legal battle centered on whether Allergan's specific 0.05% cyclosporin formulation was non-obvious compared to earlier patent filings, with the judge ultimately siding with generic manufacturers who argued the formulation was obvious from prior art.

More significantly, the article focuses on Allergan's controversial strategy of transferring these patent rights to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in what appeared to be an attempt to shield the patents from inter partes review (IPR) proceedings at the Patent and Trademark Office. The judge strongly criticized this maneuver, calling it an inappropriate commodification of sovereign immunity designed to evade legal responsibilities. The opinion suggested that sovereign immunity "should not be treated as a monetizable commodity" and that Allergan was trying to enjoy the benefits of the patent system without accepting its limitations.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2017 ruling, the legal battle continued its path through the court system. In **April 2018**, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals **upheld Judge Bryson's decision**, maintaining that Allergan's patents were invalid as obvious. This was a critical blow to the sovereign immunity strategy.

The sovereign immunity aspect itself became moot shortly thereafter. In **June 2018**, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled that tribal sovereign immunity could not be used to block IPR proceedings, essentially closing this legal loophole permanently.

Most critically for Allergan's business, **generic versions of Restasis entered the market in late 2018**. This ended the company's monopoly and led to substantial revenue decline. Restasis had been generating approximately **$1.4-1.5 billion annually** for Allergan, representing roughly 10% of the company's total revenue. The generic competition caused these sales to plummet dramatically.

This patent loss came at a particularly difficult time for Allergan, which was already facing significant business challenges including patent cliffs on other major products like Botox. The company's stock performance reflected these pressures throughout 2018-2019.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article predicted an appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, with potential to reach the Supreme Court due to high-level legal issues.**
- Outcome: The case did proceed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the patent invalidity in April 2018. However, the Supreme Court did not take up the case, as the legal questions were largely resolved at the appellate level.

**The article suggested "smooth move, guys" and questioned the legal advice, implying the sovereign immunity strategy would prove futile.**
- Outcome: This proved entirely accurate. The sovereign immunity strategy failed completely, the patents were invalidated, and Allergan spent significant resources on a failed legal maneuver that drew substantial negative attention to the pharmaceutical industry's patent strategies.

**The piece noted this gave the drug industry "another self-inflicted black eye."**
- Outcome: This assessment was prescient. The Allergan-Mohawk deal became a frequently cited example of overly aggressive patent strategies and contributed to ongoing criticism of pharmaceutical patent practices in policy discussions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a significant moment in pharmaceutical patent law that had substantial business implications and demonstrated the risks of aggressive legal strategies. The case influenced both patent law interpretation and corporate decision-making in the biopharmaceutical sector.
