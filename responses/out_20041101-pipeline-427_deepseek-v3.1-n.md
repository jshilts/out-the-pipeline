# With The Great Taste of Fish (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a brief announcement about a website template redesign for what appears to be a blog called "Corantean Heirarchy." The author informs readers about new technical features being implemented, including the ability to adjust text size and subscribe to specific categories of posts via email. The post solicits feedback from readers about the new functionality and any additional features they might want to see, while making a self-deprecating comment about the content being "unfixable."

## 2. HISTORY

This article is unrelated to biotechnology or science. It appears to be a short blog post about website maintenance and user interface updates for a blog platform. The content concerns web design features (text size adjustment, email subscription categories) rather than any biotech industry topics, scientific developments, or pharmaceutical research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There are no predictions in this article relevant to biotechnology. The post consists entirely of website design announcements and does not discuss scientific, medical, or biotechnology topics.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article is completely off-topic and contains no content related to biotechnology, science, or the pharmaceutical industry. It is a blog maintenance announcement about website template changes and has no relevance to the biotechnology industry analysis requested in the prompt template.

**Note:** There appears to be a mismatch between the prompt template requesting analysis of biotechnology industry commentary and the provided article, which is about blog web design changes and contains no biotechnology content.
