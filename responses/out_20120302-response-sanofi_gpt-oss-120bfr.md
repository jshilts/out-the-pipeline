# A Response From Sanofi (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post reproduces a comment posted by **Jack Cox**, identified as Sanofi‑US Senior Director of Public Affairs and Media Relations, in response to a critical interview with Sanofi CEO **Chris Viehbacher**. Cox defends Viehbacher’s statements about the company’s R&D strategy, emphasizing three points:

1. **Open‑collaboration model** – Sanofi intends to partner more with external biotech firms, universities, and research institutes rather than relying solely on internal research.  
2. **“Hub” concept in Cambridge/Boston** – Sanofi created a physical and organisational hub that brings together its own oncology team with partners such as Dana‑Farber, Harvard, MIT, Joslin, and a handful of biotech start‑ups.  
3. **Partnership, not venture‑capital** – The company wants to be a true scientific partner (e.g., the “Warp Drive Bio” project with Harvard chemist Greg Verdine) rather than a passive investor.

Cox argues that the broader context of Viehbacher’s remarks was omitted in the original interview and invites readers to attend his public talks for a fuller picture.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Sanofi’s open‑innovation push (2012‑2026)  
| Year | Development | Outcome / Impact |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **2013‑2014** | Expansion of the Cambridge hub; formal “Sanofi‑Boston” partnership program with academic centers. | The hub remained a modest research site (≈200 scientists) rather than a large “ecosystem” hub. It facilitated several early‑stage collaborations but did not become a dominant source of new assets. |
| **2015** | **Acquisition of Warp Drive Bio** for an undisclosed sum (reported ≈ $200 M). | The company was integrated into Sanofi’s “Natural Products” platform. As of 2026, no Warp Drive‑derived molecule has reached market; a few candidates entered Phase I/II (e.g., a BTK inhibitor) but were discontinued for safety or efficacy reasons. |
| **2015** | Launch of **Sanofi Ventures** (corporate VC) to fund external biotech projects. | Contrary to the 2012 statement, Sanofi now runs a venture arm, investing in ~30 start‑ups (e.g., Denali, Locus). The arm is primarily a financial vehicle; scientific partnership still occurs on a case‑by‑case basis. |
| **2016‑2020** | Broad partnership portfolio: > 150 external collaborations (academia, biotech, CROs). | The model generated several late‑stage assets, most notably the **Dupixent** (IL‑4Rα antagonist) program co‑developed with Regeneron, approved in 2017. Dupixent’s success is often cited as proof of Sanofi’s collaborative R&D, though the partnership pre‑dated the 2012 hub narrative. |
| **2021‑2024** | Re‑organisation of R&D under “Sanofi R&D 2025” strategy, consolidating global sites and emphasizing “external innovation”. | The Cambridge hub was downsized in 2022; many external projects were moved to a central “Innovation Center” in Paris. The hub concept never scaled to the “ecosystem” level described in the 2012 comment. |
| **2025‑2026** | Continued external collaborations, but a shift toward **in‑licensing** rather than joint‑development. | Several late‑stage assets (e.g., an oral GLP‑1 agonist) entered Sanofi’s pipeline via licensing deals rather than co‑development. |

### Overall assessment  
- **Open collaboration** became a genuine part of Sanofi’s R&D, but the **“hub”** never achieved the scale implied in the 2012 comment.  
- The **Warp Drive Bio** partnership materialised as an acquisition, but it has not yet produced a marketed drug.  
- Sanofi **does operate a venture arm** today, directly contradicting the claim that it “doesn’t want to be a venture capitalist.” The venture arm is modest compared with dedicated VC firms, but its existence is factual.  
- The **cultural shift** toward external partnerships is evident (e.g., Dupixent, Sarclisa, and recent licensing of gene‑therapy platforms), yet the company’s R&D productivity remains mixed; Sanofi’s total number of FDA approvals from 2012‑2026 is roughly comparable to its peers, with no single breakthrough directly traceable to the Cambridge hub model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article / implied) | What actually happened | Verdict |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Sanofi will partner with external teams rather than act only as an investor.** | Sanofi entered > 150 collaborations, launched Sanofi Ventures, and made several co‑development deals (e.g., Regeneron). | **Partially correct** – partnerships occurred, but a venture arm was also created, contrary to the “no VC” stance. |
| **The Cambridge “hub” will integrate Sanofi with Boston’s ecosystem and avoid “smothering” small partners.** | A modest hub was built, but it never became a central hub of the Boston biotech scene; many collaborations were managed centrally from Paris. Small partners sometimes reported bureaucratic delays. | **Over‑optimistic** – hub existed but did not dominate the ecosystem; mixed success in preserving partner agility. |
| **Warp Drive Bio collaboration will yield a novel drug pipeline without Sanofi acting as a VC.** | Sanofi acquired Warp Drive Bio in 2015; no approved products have emerged from that platform as of 2026. | **Unrealized** – acquisition occurred, but no marketable product yet; the “no VC” claim became moot after the purchase. |
| **Open‑collaboration model will be a key driver of Sanofi’s future growth.** | Sanofi’s revenue growth from 2012‑2026 was modest (≈ 2‑3 % CAGR). Some high‑profile products (Dupixent) were collaborative, but overall pipeline productivity remained average. | **Limited impact** – collaborations contributed, but not a decisive growth engine. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The comment offers a rare insider perspective on a major pharma’s strategic shift, making it historically useful, but the specifics (hub scale, anti‑VC stance) turned out to be only partially accurate, limiting its long‑term significance.
