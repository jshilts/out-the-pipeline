# More Advice From Andrew Witty (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 blog post responded to an essay in The Economist by Andrew Witty, then-CEO of GSK, addressing fundamental problems in the pharmaceutical industry. Witty described familiar industry challenges: declining success rates in drug discovery, escalating costs, patent expirations, and the need for greater efficiency. His analysis predicted continued industry contraction through mergers, acquisitions, and downsizing across the entire value chain from R&D through sales and marketing. A controversial statement suggested that R&D should rationally consume fewer resources rather than more, puzzling the author who couldn't reconcile this with the reality of drug development costs and regulatory compliance. The piece was criticized for offering generic proposals about innovative business models, dynamic partnerships, and recapturing creative talent without providing concrete solutions, while emphasizing the need for fair reward for innovation—a concept the author noted would face definitional disputes across stakeholders.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2010 saw significant industry consolidation, with major mergers including Pfizer-Wyeth, Actavis-Allergan, and numerous others, validating Witty's contraction prediction. However, R&D spending didn't decrease as his "rational allocation" comment suggested it should—instead, it continued growing to over $200 billion annually, though with restructuring toward external innovation and partnerships. GSK itself undertook major reorganizations, divesting oncology assets to Novartis in 2015 while acquiring vaccines and consumer health businesses, ultimately spinning off its consumer health division as Haleon in 2022. The drug development success crisis persisted, with Phase II success rates remaining around 30% and total R&D costs per approved drug reaching $2-3 billion, making Witty's cost-reduction vision largely unfulfilled. The industry witnessed critical policy shifts including the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) accelerating drug approvals, and significant controversies over drug pricing that led to the Inflation Reduction Act's price negotiation provisions in 2022. Novel drug modalities like CAR-T cell therapy, RNA therapeutics, and gene therapies achieved regulatory approval with transformative clinical impact, demonstrating that breakthrough innovation remained possible but at premium prices. Witty himself transitioned to head the Wellcome Trust in 2017, reflecting broader leadership changes across the industry as companies grappled with the foundational challenges he had identified.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Industry contraction through M&A**: **Accurate**. Major consolidation occurred (Pfizer-Wyeth, Actavis-Allergan, Shire-Baxalta, Takeda-Shire, AbbVie-Allergan, BMS-Celgene)
• **R&D should consume fewer resources**: **Incorrect**. Industry R&D spending continued climbing to over $200B annually, with average drug development costs reaching $2-3B per approval
• **Efficiency drive affecting all value chain components**: **Accurate**. Industry restructuring, offshore manufacturing growth, and R&D site closures/consolidations were widespread
• **Generic solutions without concrete implementation**: **Accurate but bleak**. While partnerships and external innovation grew, fundamental productivity challenges persisted with no transformative solutions emerging
• **"Fair reward for innovation" needing unpacking**: **Prescient**. Drug pricing controversies intensified, leading to the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare price negotiation provisions in 2022

## 4. INTEREST

**5/9** - This article captured the pharma industry's inflection point accurately, though the analysis was more descriptive than predictive, offering limited foresight beyond confirming ongoing trends that persisted for more than a decade. **Reasoning**: The piece correctly identified structural industry challenges and predicted consolidation, but failed to anticipate the continued R&D cost escalation and underestimated policy changes that would reshape the pharmaceutical landscape.
