# Pyrrolidines, Not the Usual Way (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a new C–H activation reaction from the Betley lab at Harvard, published in *Science*, for constructing pyrrolidines from a four-carbon chain bearing an azide at one end. The reaction achieves intramolecular C–H functionalization at the opposite end of the chain to deliver Boc-protected pyrrolidines (saturated five-membered nitrogen heterocycles). The author notes that longer chain substrates yield mixtures of four-, five-, and six-membered rings. The write-up explicitly compares this advance to a prior *Science* paper from the Groves group at Princeton, which demonstrated aliphatic C–H fluorination using a manganese porphyrin complex. Both systems are framed as biomimetic of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, relying on high-valent metal species to enable transformations that were previously impractical. The author calls for broader exploration of functional group tolerance and celebrates C–H functionalization as an underdeveloped area where new reactions can unlock novel synthetic strategies.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2013 article, C–H functionalization matured from an academic frontier into a broadly enabling toolbox for medicinal, process, and industrial chemistry.

The specific azide-to-pyrrolidine chemistry and closely related intramolecular C–H amination routes evolved into practical methods for nitrogen heterocycle synthesis. The strategy proved broadly compatible with varied functional groups and substitution patterns, and analogues appeared using Rh, Ir, Cu, Fe, Co, and Mn catalysts with diverse nitrene precursors (azides, iminoiodinanes, sulfonylimines). The ring-size selectivity issue noted in the article for longer chains was largely addressed through catalyst tuning and templating. In parallel, intermolecular C–H amination advanced to the point that pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds (indolines, pyrrolidines, azetidines, piperidines) could be prepared rapidly from simple hydrocarbon feedstocks during discovery campaigns.

Bioinspired manganese catalysis—including Mn porphyrin and non-porphyrin systems like those highlighted in relation to the Groves work—became competitive for aliphatic C–H fluorination, oxidation, and amino acid late-stage diversification. Although direct C–H fluorination had fewer immediate FDA-approved drug outcomes than other C–H methods, it saw uptake in drug metabolism and positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer campaigns. Academic and industrial labs adopted C–H diversification for lead optimization, scaffold hopping, and protecting-group-free syntheses at scale.

Concrete drug-development impact came via C–H functionalization in route design and late-stage modification, reducing step counts and improving convergence for candidate drugs. Major pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies integrated C–H borylation, arylation, alkylation, amination, and oxidation into discovery and process workflows. For example, C–H methods lowered the cost of goods and accelerated the delivery of antiviral compounds and kinase inhibitors, with examples spanning Merck, Pfizer, BMS, and AstraZeneca pipelines. The field converged with photoredox and electrochemistry to enable traditionally difficult disconnections. There was no single “C–H approved drug” to point to; rather, C–H reactions became a standard part of route planning that enabled candidates to progress faster.

Few specific industrial adoptions of the exact Betley azide cyclization are publicly documented at commodity scale, but the conceptual advance fed into broad progress in catalytic nitrene transfer, including scalable applications in asymmetric synthesis and material science. Academic groups advanced mechanistic understanding (e.g., understanding of metal-nitrenoid intermediates) and developed more air-stable or earth-abundant catalysts, improving practicality.

Public policy did not change directly, but funding priorities emphasized late-stage diversification and sustainability, indirectly favoring C–H methods. Overall, C–H functionalization moved from proof-of-concept to a toolkit used routinely in small-molecule R&D, reducing synthetic barriers and making previously “inaccessible” motifs tractable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction (explicit):** “The more of this sort of thing, the better, as far as I'm concerned: new reactions will make us think of entirely new things.”
  - **Outcome:** Correct. C–H functionalization became a foundational concept in retrosynthetic planning. Medicinal chemists used it to rapidly diversify leads, access strained rings, and install polar groups in a single step from C–H bonds. Photoredox C–H scission, electrochemical C–H amination/oxygenation, and metallaphotoredox cascades became standard.

- **Prediction (implicit): broader functional group tolerance and applicability will be key next steps.**
  - **Outcome:** Substantiated. Subsequent work demonstrated tolerance for alcohols, amines (including tertiary), aryl halides, esters, ketones, and heterocycles. Ligand design (e.g., bulky carboxylates, chiral bidentate ligands) and catalyst platforms expanded scope and selectivity. Carboxylate-directed C–H activation, for example, enabled a wide range of meta-selective substitutions in drug-like molecules.

- **Prediction (implicit): biomimetic high-valent metal catalysis will expand beyond azide/porphyrin models to general small-molecule C–H diversification.**
  - **Outcome:** Largely validated. Mn/Fe-catalyzed oxidations, halogenations, and aminations entered route design. Enzymatic C–H functionalization (e.g., P450-mediated diversification in engineered strains) was widely adopted in pharmaceutical manufacturing, particularly for taxanes, steroids, and complex natural-product derivatives.

- **Contextual expectation: CYP-inspired models would compete with enzymes in practicality.**
  - **Outcome:** Mixed. Small-molecule catalysts achieved higher substrate scope and robustness under nonaqueous conditions, but enzymatic systems excelled in site selectivity for highly complex molecules. Industrial manufacturing today uses both biocatalytic and chemocatalytic C–H methods side by side.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article highlights a technically sound advance in catalytic nitrogen-heterocycle synthesis, but it is a single reaction report without direct therapeutic or commercial outcomes. While C–H functionalization later became transformational, the piece itself reflects early-stage academic progress rather than a paradigm-changing breakthrough.
