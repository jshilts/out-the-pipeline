# You Can't Make Money If You Don't Get Paid (November 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2006 commentary discusses two pharmaceutical products facing reimbursement challenges in European markets. Sanofi-Aventis's Accomplia (rimonabant), an anti-obesity drug, was denied reimbursement coverage by German regulators who classified it as a "lifestyle" drug for cost-cutting reasons. Similarly, Pfizer's Exubera, an inhaled insulin product, was denied reimbursement in Germany following a similar British decision. Both drugs were either not yet launched in the US market or facing FDA approval delays. The author expresses skepticism about the commercial prospects of both products, cautioning against optimistic investment decisions.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's concerns proved prescient, as both drugs experienced significant commercial failures:

**Accomplia (rimonabant):** The drug faced increasing safety concerns after 2006. The FDA never approved rimonabant for the US market due to psychiatric side effects including depression and suicidal ideation. In 2008, the European Medicines Agency recommended suspension of marketing authorization across Europe following reports of serious psychiatric disorders. Sanofi-Aventis withdrew the drug from markets where it had been approved. The CB1 receptor antagonist mechanism was largely abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry due to these safety issues.

**Exubera:** Despite being the first inhaled insulin product approved by the FDA (2006), it failed commercially and was withdrawn in 2007 after generating only $12 million in sales against expectations of $2 billion annually. The product faced multiple challenges including a bulky inhalation device, complex dosing, higher costs than traditional insulin, and concerns about long-term lung safety. Pfizer took a $2.8 billion charge and returned rights to Nektar Therapeutics. The inhaled insulin approach subsequently became viewed as a cautionary tale of pharmaceutical innovation failing to meet practical patient needs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that both drugs would debut in the US in 2007:** Partially accurate - while Exubera was already approved and launched (though failing commercially), Accomplia never received FDA approval.

• **Caution against "big upside investment decision based on these compounds":** Highly accurate. Both compounds became major commercial failures, with Accomplia withdrawn due to safety issues and Exubera abandoned after massive financial losses.

• **Implicit prediction that reimbursement/payment issues would be critical:** Very accurate. The reimbursement concerns highlighted in the article foreshadowed the broader market access challenges that both products faced, though the ultimate reasons for failure were more fundamental (safety for Accomplia, device/practical issues for Exubera).

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates valuable analytical insight into pharmaceutical market realities beyond scientific innovation. It correctly identified that commercial success requires not just regulatory approval but also market acceptance, reimbursement coverage, and practical usability. The cautionary perspective proved more accurate than industry optimism at the time.
