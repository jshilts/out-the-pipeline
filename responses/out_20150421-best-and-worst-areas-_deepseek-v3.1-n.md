# Best And Worst Areas for Drug Discovery (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" column poses two questions to the pharmaceutical research community about the state of small-molecule drug discovery in 2015. The author asks readers to identify which therapeutic areas offer the best opportunities and which present the worst prospects for traditional drug discovery approaches. The evaluation criteria include target availability and quality, suitability for small-molecule intervention, market considerations, and overall feasibility - essentially asking for a strategic assessment of where pharmaceutical companies should focus their research investments and where they should avoid wasting resources.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following 2015 revealed several significant trends in drug discovery that help answer these questions retrospectively:

**Best performing areas that emerged:**
- **Oncology**: Small-molecule targeted therapies flourished, particularly kinase inhibitors (like CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib), BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib), and PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib). Immuno-oncology also drove massive investment.
- **Immunology/autoimmune diseases**: JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib), BTK inhibitors for autoimmune conditions, and continued innovation in biologics with small-molecule adjuncts.
- **Rare diseases**: Many niche indications received attention with small molecules, though often at extremely high prices, creating viable commercial models.
- **Metabolic diseases**: Continued development in diabetes (SGLT2 inhibitors expanded) and emerging work in NASH.

**Worst performing areas:**
- **Neuroscience/CNS disorders**: Multiple high-profile failures in Alzheimer's disease (BACE inhibitors), schizophrenia, and depression highlighted the challenges of CNS drug development, causing several major companies to scale back neuroscience research.
- **Antibiotics**: Despite growing antibiotic resistance, the commercial model remained challenging, leading to bankruptcies (Achaogen, Melinta) and industry exits despite clear medical need.

The period saw a major shift toward targeted therapies and precision medicine, with growing recognition that "druggability" of targets and clear patient stratification were more important than market size alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Since this was a question posed to readers rather than making explicit predictions, I cannot evaluate specific predictions made in the article itself. The questions themselves reflected the industry's ongoing strategic uncertainty about where to deploy resources effectively.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the questions were professionally relevant to pharmaceutical researchers in 2015, the article lacks substantive analysis, making it primarily a discussion prompt rather than an informative piece with lasting value. The author explicitly notes it was written hastily while traveling with "no time to do a full blog post."
