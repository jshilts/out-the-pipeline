# Time For An Election Post (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from November 6, 2012, was published on election day during the Obama-Romney presidential race. The author, drawing parallels between interpreting biological assay data and election polling, noted that precise probability predictions were unrealistic. While acknowledging it would be a close election, he suggested that Nate Silver's widely publicized statistical models had created favorable betting odds for a Romney upset, which he would consider if he were a betting man. The post also shared personal context about his experience growing up with a father who was an election commissioner in Arkansas, teaching his children about election mechanics.

## 2. HISTORY
On November 6, 2012, Barack Obama won re-election with 332 electoral votes to Mitt Romney's 206, carrying the popular vote by approximately 51-47%. This contradicted the post's suggestion of a potential Romney upset. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight model, which had predicted Obama's victory with high confidence (giving him a 90.9% chance of winning as of election day), proved remarkably accurate - correctly forecasting the winner in all 50 states. The election was called relatively early in the evening (around 11:15 PM EST), avoiding the protracted uncertainty the author had mused about. Silver's successful predictions significantly elevated his public profile and cemented the credibility of statistical modeling in political forecasting, demonstrating that probabilistic predictions "to the right of the decimal place" had, in fact, become quite reliable despite the author's skepticism.

**3. PREDICTIONS**
- **Prediction:** The election would be "a close call for whoever wins"
- **Outcome:** The electoral margin was substantial (332-206), not particularly close
- **Prediction:** A Romney upset was possible, offering good betting odds
- **Outcome:** Obama won decisively; no upset occurred
- **Prediction:** Statistical models giving precise probabilities were overly confident
- **Outcome:** Nate Silver's models were highly accurate, validating quantitative forecasting approaches
- **Prediction:** Results might not be known until "tonight, or in the morning, or (God help us all) even later"
- **Outcome:** The election was called relatively early, the same evening

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 1**

While this post has minor historical interest for capturing election day sentiment, it has no connection to biotechnology or science. It was a casual political commentary with incorrect predictions, and its assessment of statistical modeling has been contradicted by subsequent developments.
