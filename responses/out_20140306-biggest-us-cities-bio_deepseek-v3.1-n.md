# Biggest US Cities for Biopharma Funding, Versus Whole Continents (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from March 2014 highlights the dominant position of US cities in biopharmaceutical venture capital funding, compared internationally. San Francisco and Boston were competing for the top spot, raising approximately $1.15 billion and $0.93 billion respectively in 2013. The article notes that when Oakland and the broader east Bay region are included, the entire Bay Area's total exceeds Boston's by a wider margin. The most striking point came from analysis showing the two leading US cities (San Francisco and Boston) raised over $2 billion combined, exceeding the approximately $1.9 billion raised by all of Europe. The article also mentions other US hubs like San Diego, Seattle, NY/NJ/Philadelphia and the Research Triangle.

## 2. HISTORY

The geographic concentration described in 2014 has largely persisted and in some ways intensified in subsequent years. By the mid-to-late 2010s, the Bay Area and Boston/Cambridge continued to dominate US biopharma funding, with both regions showing sustained growth. 

The period from 2014 to 2024 proved exceptional for biopharma overall, featuring an unprecedented boom starting around 2020-2021. The sector saw a historic surge in investment, with biotech experiencing its largest funding wave ever. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly boosted attention and resources flowing to biopharma, validating the sector's long-term prospects. 

However, evidence also points to some shifts in this landscape. While Boston and San Francisco remained dominant, cities like San Diego, New York, and the Research Triangle in North Carolina saw notable growth. Internationally, regions such as China later emerged as major biopharma players, with cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen becoming significant biotech hubs. 

The fundamental pattern of US dominance, especially along the coasts, largely persisted through this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There were no explicit predictions made in this article. The piece is primarily observational, describing the existing funding landscape in 2013 and the comparison between US cities and Europe. The author makes no forward-looking statements or forecasts about future trends.

Based on what actually happened later, if the article had predicted continued US leadership, this would have been accurate. The 2014-2024 decade largely confirmed US biopharma's continued dominance, with both Boston and the Bay Area remaining premier biotech hubs worldwide.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important data point about biopharma's geographic concentration, but offers limited analysis beyond the basic observation. The comparison between specific US cities and entire continents is informative but not deeply analytical.
