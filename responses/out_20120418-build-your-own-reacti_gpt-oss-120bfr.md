# Build Your Own Reactive Reactors (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted a Nature Chemistry paper from Professor Leroy Cronin’s group (University of Glasgow) that introduced “reactionware” – small, custom‑shaped reaction vessels fabricated by stereolithographic (SLA) 3‑D printing of a silicone‑based polymer. Because the geometry is defined digitally, the mixing, residence time, and reagent stoichiometry can be built into the part itself. The authors also demonstrated that the polymer walls could be doped with palladium, turning the vessel into a solid‑supported catalyst for hydrogenations. The piece suggested that such printable reactors might enable rapid prototyping of multistep flow‑chemistry setups, parallel‑scale synthesis, and the use of otherwise incompatible immobilised reagents.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Research and commercial follow‑up (2012‑2024)**  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2013‑2015 | Cronin’s lab published several follow‑up papers showing reactionware for the synthesis of small‑molecule APIs (e.g., ibuprofen, paracetamol) and for multistep sequences such as a three‑step cascade to a heterocycle. | Demonstrated that the concept works for gram‑scale syntheses; the papers were widely cited in the emerging “digital chemistry” literature. |
| 2016 | Launch of the **Reactionware** spin‑out (later renamed **3D‑Chem**). The company offered a design‑‑to‑print service for custom reactors and sold kits for teaching labs. | Adoption remained niche – mainly academic labs and a few biotech start‑ups used the kits for rapid screening. |
| 2017‑2019 | Other groups (e.g., Ley’s team at the University of Strathclyde, and several US microfluidics labs) began printing micro‑reactors from resin or polymer with embedded catalysts or reagents. 3‑D printed flow reactors were used for photochemistry, biocatalysis, and metal‑catalysed C–C couplings. | The broader field of “3‑D printed flow chemistry” grew, but most industrial flow reactors continued to be machined metal or polymeric chips rather than printed parts. |
| 2020‑2022 | COVID‑19 spurred interest in decentralized manufacturing. A few pilot projects (e.g., a UK NHS partnership) printed reactionware for on‑site synthesis of simple antivirals (e.g., favipiravir). The scale was limited to <100 g batches. | Showed feasibility of small‑batch, on‑demand drug synthesis, but regulatory hurdles and material‑compatibility limits prevented large‑scale rollout. |
| 2023‑2024 | Advances in high‑resolution SLA resins (e.g., chemically resistant, low‑leach) allowed printing of reactors that tolerate strong acids/bases and higher pressures (up to ~5 bar). Some pharma R&D groups reported using printed reactors for rapid optimisation of catalytic conditions, especially when the catalyst is immobilised in the wall. | The technology is now a recognized “rapid‑prototype” tool in process development labs, but it is still considered complementary to conventional stainless‑steel or PFA flow reactors. |

**Overall assessment:** The original vision of fully printable, catalyst‑doped reactors has materialised to the extent that they are useful for **research‑scale** synthesis and high‑throughput optimisation. They have **not** become a mainstream platform for commercial scale‑up; traditional flow reactors dominate large‑scale manufacturing because of robustness, pressure rating, and regulatory familiarity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The 2012 article implied several future possibilities. Below is a concise comparison of those expectations with what actually transpired.

- **Prediction:** *“Multistep flow chemistry could be built from arrays of these printed vessels.”*  
  **Outcome:** Demonstrated in academic labs (e.g., three‑step cascade to a heterocycle, 2015‑2018). Commercial scale‑up using arrays of printed reactors has **not** been adopted; scale‑up still relies on continuous‑flow metal or PFA reactors.

- **Prediction:** *“Parallel identical vessels could be used for scale‑up, exploiting their small size.”*  
  **Outcome:** Parallelisation is used for **high‑throughput screening** (e.g., 24‑well reactionware plates) but not for kilogram‑scale production. The approach is limited by the low pressure/temperature tolerance of the silicone polymer.

- **Prediction:** *“Rapid prototyping of doped polymeric materials will enable experimentation with immobilised reagents that are incompatible in solution.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Numerous studies (2014‑2022) reported wall‑bound palladium, copper, and enzyme catalysts that allowed one‑pot reactions impossible in homogeneous solution. The technique is now a standard option in process‑development labs.

- **Prediction:** *“The technology will be a real advantage for industrial flow applications.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While the concept inspired industrial R&D, actual plant‑scale flow reactors are still fabricated by conventional means. The printed reactors remain a **development‑stage** tool rather than a production workhorse.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

*Reasoning:* The article introduced a genuinely novel convergence of additive manufacturing and synthetic chemistry that sparked a decade of research and a modest commercial ecosystem. Its long‑term importance lies in establishing “digital reactionware” as a prototyping paradigm, even though it has not reshaped large‑scale manufacturing.
