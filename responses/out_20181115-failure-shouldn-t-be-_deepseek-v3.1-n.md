# Failure Shouldn't Be Such an Orphan (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes an initiative by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to systematically learn from clinical trial failures in Alzheimer's disease research. The EMA invited seven drug companies to confidentially present detailed data on 14 discontinued or ongoing trials covering over 12,000 participants. The shared information went beyond what was typically published in literature or trial registries, including preclinical and early clinical data that helped clarify which hypotheses were actually falsified. Based on these insights, EMA revised its Alzheimer's trial guidelines in consultation with US, Canadian, and Japanese regulators to create more standardized trial designs and endpoints. The author argues this approach should be extended to other challenging therapeutic areas with high failure rates (pain, obesity, stroke, sepsis), noting that failures are typically underreported except for high-profile trials, while smaller programs often disappear quietly from pipeline presentations without transparency.

## 2. HISTORY
The period following 2018 saw continued challenges in Alzheimer's drug development, with significant failures that underscore the wisdom of the EMA's initiative:

**Continued Clinical Failures:** Multiple high-profile Alzheimer's trials failed between 2018-2024, particularly among amyloid-targeting therapies. The amyloid hypothesis remained controversial, with some trials showing plaque reduction without meaningful cognitive benefits.

**Mixed Regulatory Success:** In 2021, the FDA approved aducanumab (marketed as Biogen's Aduhelm) through an accelerated approval pathway despite controversial evidence of efficacy, leading to significant debate and limited Medicare coverage. In 2023, lecanemab (Leqembi) received traditional FDA approval with more convincing (though modest) clinical benefits demonstrated. Neither achieved widespread patient adoption comparable to common chronic disease medications.

**Industry Trends:** Data transparency initiatives faced ongoing challenges. Clinical trial disclosure requirements improved, but many companies remained reluctant to share detailed failure data publicly. The field continued to struggle with heterogeneous trial designs, making cross-study comparisons difficult despite EMA's standardization efforts.

**Regulatory Evolution:** Regulatory agencies increasingly emphasized the importance of biomarkers and adaptive trial designs in Alzheimer's research. However, fundamental questions about appropriate endpoints, patient selection, and what constitutes meaningful clinical benefit remained unresolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **Prediction:** The EMA's standardization efforts would improve comparability of Alzheimer's trials.  
**Reality:** Partial success. Regulatory guidance evolved, but the field continued to struggle with heterogeneity in trial designs, patient populations, and outcome measures.

• **Prediction:** The confidential data-sharing approach would make sense for other hard-to-treat diseases (pain, obesity, stroke, sepsis).  
**Reality:** Limited implementation. While some progress occurred in specific disease areas, systematic failure-sharing initiatives remained relatively rare, and the pharmaceutical industry's competitive nature continued to limit transparency.

• **Prediction:** Standardized approaches would address problems created by companies developing independent trial designs and different regulatory requirements across regions.  
**Reality:** Mixed outcomes. International regulatory harmonization efforts (ICH guidelines) progressed, but significant differences persisted across regions, particularly in endpoints and statistical requirements.

• **Implicit Prediction:** Alzheimer's research would benefit from learning lessons from failures rather than repeatedly making similar mistakes.  
**Reality:** Evidence suggests continued challenges. Despite numerous failures, many subsequent trials continued targeting similar mechanisms with similar trial designs, suggesting limited systematic learning from past mistakes across the industry.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses fundamental issues in drug development methodology and knowledge management that remain highly relevant today. The proposal to systematically learn from failures represents sound scientific practice that could accelerate progress across multiple challenging therapeutic areas, making it more interesting than typical commentary on single drug successes or failures.
