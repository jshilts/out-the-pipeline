# Stack Ranking in Pharma: Bad Idea (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary critiques forced ranking systems in large organizations, using Microsoft's "stack ranking" as a cautionary tale. The article describes how Microsoft required managers to rank employees along a forced bell curve, where a certain percentage had to be rated as top performers, average, below average, and poor—regardless of actual performance. A team of ten people would always see two get great reviews, seven get mediocre reviews, and one get terrible reviews. This system allegedly promoted toxic behaviors: employees deliberately withheld information from colleagues to avoid helping others advance in rankings, top performers avoided working together for fear of being hurt in relative rankings, and managers systematically misrepresented how evaluations worked to subordinates.

The author draws parallels between Microsoft's practices and similar forced-ranking systems common in large pharmaceutical companies, referencing their own complaints about such systems dating back to 2002 and suggesting these approaches are destructive to research culture and collaboration.

## 2. HISTORY
After September 2013, significant developments occurred across multiple fronts:

**Microsoft's policy change**: Multiple news sources reported that Microsoft eliminated its stack ranking system in November 2013, just two months after this article was published. CEO Steve Ballmer announced his retirement in August 2013, and Satya Nadella, who became CEO in February 2014, implemented cultural changes that moved away from these forced ranking practices.

**Corporate trends**: The period following 2013 saw numerous large companies reassessing or eliminating forced ranking systems. By the mid-2010s, many major corporations moved toward more flexible performance management approaches. However, some organizations continued variations of forced ranking despite widespread criticism.

**Pharmaceutical industry**: No specific evidence suggests that major pharmaceutical companies made systematic changes to their performance management systems in direct response to Microsoft's experience. The pharma industry continued grappling with how to evaluate research productivity, with the fundamental tension between individual accountability and collaborative innovation remaining unresolved.

**Research impact**: The broader discussion around performance management in R&D environments continued, but no clear industry-wide transformation occurred in pharmaceutical research management practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events, instead focusing on describing existing problems with forced ranking systems in corporate and pharmaceutical environments. The piece primarily served as commentary and criticism rather than making forward-looking statements about how these practices would evolve.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses management practices in the pharmaceutical industry but focuses heavily on Microsoft's internal systems rather than providing concrete information about biotechnology developments, drug approvals, scientific breakthroughs, or policy changes in the pharma sector. While the topic has relevance for those interested in research management, it ranks low on objective scientific and biotechnological significance compared to articles about therapeutic advances, regulatory changes, or clinical outcomes.
