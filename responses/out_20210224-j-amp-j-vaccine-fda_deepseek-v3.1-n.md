# The J&J Vaccine at the FDA (February 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the FDA briefing documents released ahead of the February 26, 2021 advisory committee meeting on Johnson & Johnson's single-dose COVID-19 vaccine. The author notes that the vaccine appears to completely prevent deaths from SARS-CoV-2, with zero fatalities in the treatment group, similar to other vaccines. Against severe disease, the vaccine showed strong efficacy that appeared to increase over time: at 14 days post-dose there were 2 hospitalizations in the treatment group versus 29 in placebo, while at 28 days there were zero hospitalizations in vaccinated participants.

The vaccine demonstrated different efficacy across regions—72% in the US, 58% in South Africa (with the B.1.351 variant circulating), with the Brazil data showing the P.2 variant didn't significantly impact effectiveness. On asymptomatic infection, the FDA analysis suggested weak-to-no protection out to day 29, with approximately 60-70% efficacy in post-day-29 data. The author cautions against direct cross-trial comparisons with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, noting differences in trial timing, circulating variants, and platform technologies. The article concludes that despite production challenges, the vaccine appeared certain to receive Emergency Use Authorization and would contribute to controlling the pandemic.

## 2. HISTORY

The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine (JNJ-78436735, Ad26.COV2.S) received FDA Emergency Use Authorization on February 27, 2021, one day after the advisory committee meeting discussed in the article. The vaccine was deployed in the United States and globally, providing logistical advantages due to its single-dose regimen and standard refrigeration storage requirements.

The vaccine faced several significant developments after authorization. In April 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended a temporary pause on its use after reports of rare but serious blood clotting events (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, TTS), primarily in women under 50. Following investigation, use resumed with updated warnings about this risk. This safety signal became an important consideration for regulatory agencies worldwide.

During 2021, real-world effectiveness studies generally confirmed the vaccine's protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, though effectiveness against infection appeared lower than mRNA vaccines, especially as variants emerged. South African data particularly highlighted reduced effectiveness against the Beta variant, as noted in the article. Several countries restricted the vaccine's use to older populations due to the TTS risk profile.

The vaccine faced production challenges throughout 2021, with J&J failing to meet initial delivery targets to the US government and experiencing manufacturing issues at facilities. Globally, the vaccine was used extensively in lower-resource settings due to its easier storage and single-dose advantage, contributing significantly to vaccination efforts in Africa and other regions.

In 2022, as variant evolution continued with Omicron and its subvariants, boosters were recommended, and many countries shifted mRNA vaccines to the primary vaccination strategy while maintaining J&J as an option, particularly for those with contraindications to mRNA platforms or specific clinical situations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **EUA approval and rapid deployment**: The author predicted the vaccine would "certainly get Emergency Use Authorization" and begin making a difference by April 2021. **Outcome**: Correct. The vaccine received EUA on February 27, 2021, and was deployed starting in March 2021, though production delays limited initial impact.

• **Production challenges**: The article noted adenovirus production was "another art form" with potential for "acting up." **Outcome**: Validated. J&J faced significant manufacturing challenges throughout 2021, failing to meet delivery targets due to production difficulties, particularly at the Emergent BioSolutions facility.

• **Variant impacts**: The author identified already that the B.1.351 variant in South Africa reduced efficacy to 58% vs 72% in the US. **Outcome**: This pattern continued and intensified as variants evolved. Real-world effectiveness studies confirmed progressively reduced efficacy against later variants like Delta and substantially lower against Omicron, especially for preventing infection.

• **Superiority comparisons between platforms**: The author cautioned that comparisons between adenovirus and mRNA platforms were problematic due to different trial timing, locations, and circulating variants. **Outcome**: This caution was justified. While mRNA vaccines generally showed higher overall effectiveness, especially against variants, regulatory decisions and public health recommendations evolved to recognize both platforms as valuable, with adenovirus vaccines remaining important globally, particularly where logistical considerations dominated.

• **No evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement**: The article noted no evidence of enhanced disease after vaccination. **Outcome**: Confirmed. No significant evidence emerged of antibody-dependent enhancement causing worse infections in vaccinated individuals.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides a solid technical analysis of the J&J vaccine data at a critical moment in the pandemic, and its cautious approach to cross-trial comparisons reflects appropriate scientific thinking. However, it covers a single vaccine candidate at one point in time, and the broader COVID-19 vaccine story evolved in ways this analysis couldn't capture.
