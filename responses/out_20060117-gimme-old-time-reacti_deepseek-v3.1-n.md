# Gimme That Old Time Reaction (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article argues that professional organic chemists—particularly in drug discovery—rely heavily on classic, decades-old reactions rather than the latest synthetic methods. The author points out that fundamental reactions like Fischer esterification, Knoevenagel condensation, Grignard reactions, sodium borohydride reductions, and Williamson ether synthesis remain daily workhorses in medicinal chemistry labs.

The reasoning provided is threefold: these reactions are reliable and work consistently; they are operationally simple, fast, and inexpensive; and they are grounded in fundamental chemical principles that are unavoidable when forming basic bonds like C-O, C-C, and C-N. The author concludes that chemistry in drug discovery should be viewed as a means to an end rather than an end in itself—the goal is to make drugs efficiently, not to showcase cutting-edge synthetic methodology.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2006, this perspective has been largely validated, though with important nuances:

**Classic reactions maintain dominance**: Traditional reactions like Wittig, Grignard, Suzuki coupling, SN2/SN1, esterification, and reductions remain standard in pharmaceutical process chemistry and medicinal chemistry. When the FDA approves a drug, the manufacturing route typically relies on robust, scalable reactions that minimize safety risks and cost—exactly the criteria that favor established methods.

**Modern methods found selective adoption**: Techniques like C-H activation, photoredox catalysis, and flow chemistry have found niches but haven't displaced classic methods broadly. C-C coupling reactions (Suzuki, Stille, Negishi, Heck) became even more ubiquitous post-2000s as catalysts improved and costs dropped, but these are now themselves "classic" methods entering their fourth decade of use.

**Practical considerations dominate**: The pharmaceutical industry's focus on speed-to-clinic, regulatory compliance, and cost-effective manufacturing amplifies this tendency. New reactions face adoption hurdles around safety assessment, scale-up feasibility, and operator training.

**Emerging technologies show promise**: Methods like enzymatic biocatalysis and electrochemistry gained traction where they offer clear selectivity or green chemistry advantages, but they complement rather than replace traditional chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: "You can be a fine medicinal chemist using nothing but reactions from a sophomore organic textbook."
  
  - **Outcome**: **Largely accurate**. Most daily medicinal chemistry workflows rely on amide coupling, alkylation, deprotection, reductive amination, and basic heterocycle formation—all textbook reactions. However, the toolkit has expanded modestly with C-C coupling becoming standard.
  
  **Prediction**: "We're not here to use the latest hot reaction, unless it can speed up making a drug."
  
  - **Outcome**: **Validated**. The industry remains highly conservative. Even when new reactions prove valuable academically, adoption requires clear ROI in terms of speed, yield, selectivity, or cost. Most innovation occurs in biologics and molecular biology rather than small-molecule synthetic methodology.


## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pragmatic reality that remains broadly true today, though the rise of biologics has shifted some focus away from small-molecule chemistry since 2006.
