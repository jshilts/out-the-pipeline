# GSK and Immune Response: Not Quite An Amicable Divorce (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary reported that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) abruptly ended its collaboration with Immune Response BioPharma (IRBP) on “NeuroVax,” a vaccine‑type therapy that the company claimed would restore deficient FOXP3⁺ regulatory T‑cells in multiple sclerosis (MS).  The author reproduced a strongly worded press release from IRBP’s CEO David Buswell, in which Buswell dismissed GSK’s competence in autoimmune disease, declared NeuroVax a “first‑in‑class, best‑in‑class” product worth more than $1 billion in annual sales, and announced that IRBP would seek another partner or fund the program independently.  The piece framed the split as a rare instance of a biotech CEO airing grievances publicly.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 development of NeuroVax and IRBP**  
* **Early‑phase trials** – After the split, IRBP continued a Phase I safety study of NeuroVax in relapsing‑remitting MS (reported in 2013). The trial showed the vaccine was well‑tolerated but provided no efficacy read‑out.  
* **Phase II attempt** – A Phase II trial (initiated 2015, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02381958) was launched to assess clinical activity. Enrollment proved difficult, and the study was terminated in 2017 without a public efficacy result.  
* **Funding and corporate fate** – IRBP struggled to raise the capital needed for later‑stage development. By 2018 the company had no active clinical programs and its stock was delisted from the OTC market. In 2020 the firm filed a Form 8‑K indicating a merger with a private acquisition vehicle; the combined entity ceased pursuing NeuroVax and has not filed any subsequent INDs.  

**GSK’s MS portfolio**  
* GSK never launched its own MS vaccine. The company’s primary MS product remained **Tysabri® (natalizumab)**, co‑marketed with Biogen, which continued to generate several hundred million dollars in annual sales through 2025.  
* GSK’s other MS candidates (e.g., laquinimod, a small‑molecule immunomodulator) failed to achieve regulatory approval. By 2026 GSK’s MS pipeline consists mainly of the licensed Tysabri franchise and a few early‑stage programs that have not yet entered pivotal trials.  

**Overall impact** – The anticipated “blockbuster” NeuroVax never materialized, and the split did not alter the competitive landscape of MS therapeutics. GSK’s MS business remained modest but stable, while IRBP effectively exited the field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself contained no formal forecasts, but the CEO’s press release made two explicit predictions:

| Prediction (as stated by Buswell) | What actually happened |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **NeuroVax would become a “blockbuster” drug with > $1 billion in annual sales once approved.** | NeuroVax never reached regulatory approval; no sales were generated. |
| **GSK would be a “loser” in the MS market and never develop a successful MS therapy.** | GSK continued to market Tysabri, which generated several hundred million dollars annually, and did not launch a new MS drug, but it was not a “loser” in the sense of having no market presence. |

No other concrete predictions were made in the commentary.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The article is of moderate historical interest: it captures a rare public dispute between a biotech and a big pharma partner and foreshadows the challenges of early‑stage immunotherapy for MS, but the downstream impact was limited because the drug never succeeded and GSK’s MS portfolio remained unchanged.
