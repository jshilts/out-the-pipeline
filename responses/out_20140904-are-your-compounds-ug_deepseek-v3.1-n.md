# Are Your Compounds Ugly? Do You Know? (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques a 2014 research paper that reported small-molecule hits targeting the C2 domain of coagulation factor VIII. The article highlights that the target is challenging because it requires blocking protein-membrane interactions through a binding cavity not naturally suited for small molecules. The screening yielded micromolar-range hits, but many were from problematic chemical classes, including rhodanines and nitroaromatics.

The author raises concerns about false positives and frequent hitters—compounds that show activity across multiple assays for artifactual reasons rather than genuine target binding. The criticism focuses on whether such "ugly" compounds can serve as legitimate tool compounds for understanding biology or as starting points for drug development. The key arguments are that these structures are often promiscuous binders that produce unreliable cellular data, are difficult to optimize into quality leads, and represent the bare minimum of what a target can accommodate rather than genuine druggability.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2014, the awareness of frequent hitters and problematic scaffolds in drug discovery continued to deepen, with several important developments:

- **Rhodanines and frequent hitters**: The scientific community increasingly recognized that rhodanines, quinones, catechols, and similar scaffolds appear as hits across diverse screening campaigns but rarely translate into quality leads or drugs due to promiscuous binding, aggregation, redox activity, and interference with assay readouts.

- **Best practices and guidelines**: The concept of "chemical probes" versus simple screening hits gained prominence. Funding agencies and journals began expecting higher validation standards, including orthogonal assay formats, biophysical confirmations (e.g., SPR, ITC), assessment of aggregation potential, and structural characterization to rule out assay artifacts.

- **Hemophilia A treatments**: While the article discusses targets related to coagulation factor VIII (for hemophilia A), no small-molecule drugs targeting the FVIII C2 domain emerged from this approach. Instead, hemophilia A therapy advanced primarily through recombinant factor replacement, extended half-life factors, and—importantly—the bispecific antibody emicizumab (Hemlibra), approved by the FDA in 2017, which mimics FVIII function through a different mechanism. The shift away from small-molecule oral FVIII mimetics suggests the difficulty in drugging the FVIII machinery with synthetically tractable compounds.

- **Reproducibility and Structure–Activity Relationships (SAR)**: Investigations into frequent hitters showed that removing the problematic features of scaffolds like rhodanines usually abolishes activity, suggesting the "ugly" parts were driving the promiscuous signal. This confirmed that such hits are poor optimization starting points.

- **Virtual screening validation**: The paper's critique of reliance on virtual screening without sufficient experimental validation reflects broader concerns about computational approaches producing biased or over-interpreted hit lists. Subsequent practice emphasized multi-stage validation and careful curation of chemical libraries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Low probability of drugging FVIII C2 with small molecules**: The article predicted that if only frequent hitters emerge, the target is barely druggable for small molecules. This proved largely accurate for the FVIII pathway, where no small-molecule drugs targeting the FVIII C2 domain entered clinical use. Clinical progress focused on biologics, particularly emicizumab.

- **Rhodanines as starting points**: The article suggested that trying to optimize frequent hitters is like making a "silk purse out of a sow's ear," predicting that they rarely lead to quality leads. This has been generally supported by subsequent mechanistic studies and screening data showing that such compounds are poor starting points.

- **Need for rigorous validation and awareness**: The call for authors to acknowledge when their hits include frequent hitters has been reflected in evolving journal guidelines and grant review criteria, though not universally adopted. Best practices increasingly emphasize orthogonal validation, but many papers still report unvalidated hits without discussing promiscuity or assay interference risks.

- **Target difficulty and screening hit rates**: The prediction that low-probability targets mostly yield promiscuous hits aligns with industry experience over the last decade, underscoring the importance of "druggability" assessments and the need for multiparameter hit validation.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**
This article highlights persistent quality issues in early-stage drug screening but focuses on niche validation problems rather than transformative discoveries. The underlying message about rigorous validation has enduring relevance, but the specific FVIII C2 target did not lead to impactful drugs or paradigm shifts.
