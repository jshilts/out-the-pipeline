# More Ligand Efficiency (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a 2014 *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* review on ligand efficiency metrics in drug discovery. The article references Michael Shultz's earlier critical papers on these metrics but notes that the review doesn't directly address Shultz's criticisms. The author highlights the review's extensive data on ligand binding thermodynamics and provides practical guidance by presenting mean LE (Ligand Efficiency) and LLE/LipE (Lipophilic Ligand Efficiency) values for compounds against 329 targets. The piece specifically mentions carbonic anhydrase inhibitors as achieving particularly high LLE values due to sulfonamide-zinc binding interactions, while acknowledging most researchers work on different targets.

## 2. HISTORY

Ligand efficiency metrics have remained important tools in drug discovery over the past decade, though with more nuanced application than initially promoted. The drug discovery field has seen continued use of LE and LLE as **heuristic guides** rather than rigid filters. The period 2014-2024 saw numerous approved drugs that likely benefited from efficiency-aware design, though direct causal links are difficult to establish since drug approval depends on multiple factors beyond binding efficiency.

Clinical pipeline data from this period shows that **molecular complexity and efficiency metrics** became increasingly integrated into lead optimization workflows at major pharmaceutical companies. However, the field also matured in recognizing the limitations Shultz highlighted - specifically that ligand efficiency metrics don't account for protein flexibility, entropy-enthalpy compensation, or the reality that some difficult targets require larger, less "efficient" molecules.

Notably, **carbonic anhydrase inhibitors** (the specific example mentioned) continued to be developed and approved, including therapies for glaucoma and altitude sickness, maintaining their reputation for high binding efficiency due to the zinc-coordinating sulfonamide pharmacophore.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself did not make explicit forward-looking predictions. Rather, it served as commentary on a contemporaneous review and provided practical benchmarking data. The implicit expectation was that ligand efficiency metrics would continue to be valuable tools in drug discovery, which they have been.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This commentary serves a specific technical audience in drug discovery and provides useful benchmarking data, but it addresses a relatively narrow methodological topic rather than broader scientific or societal developments.
