# Fluorination Without Tears. Or Panicked Shouts. (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary discusses a new JACS paper presenting an air-stable fluorinating agent based on arylsulfur trifluorides. The author expresses enthusiasm for this development, contrasting it with existing problematic reagents like DAST (diethylaminosulfur trifluoride) and xenon difluoride, which are known for hazardous runaway reactions and difficult handling. The post anticipates that this new reagent will likely be commercialized soon and could provide a safer, more practical alternative for drug discovery chemists working with fluorinated compounds.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2010 JACS paper by Tang, Wang, and coworkers introduced the use of aryl sulfonimidoyl fluorides and related arylsulfur-based reagents as mild, air-stable fluorinating agents. In the period following this publication, the adoption of these reagents has been substantial. These reagents are now commercially available from major chemical suppliers, validating the author's prediction of commercialization. The chemistry has demonstrated practical utility in medicinal chemistry settings, enabling safer fluorination reactions without the significant explosion risks associated with DAST. While fluorinated drugs continue to be highly important in the pharmaceutical industry, with approximately 20-25% of drugs now containing fluorine, this specific reagent class represents one of several safer fluorination methods that have emerged. The broader trend toward process-safe fluorination methods has continued, benefiting pharmaceutical development workflows, although many established methods (including some hazardous ones like DAST in controlled settings) remain in use for specific transformations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"I'd guess that this stuff will shortly be commercialized"** - This proved accurate. The reagents became commercially available from multiple suppliers following the publication.
• **Implicit prediction of laboratory adoption** - The author's anticipation that chemists would find this "very useful" was largely correct, as these reagents gained use in medicinal chemistry settings, though they did not fully displace alternatives like DAST across all applications.

## 4. INTEREST
**7** - This represents a moderately interesting post that highlighted an important practical development in synthetic chemistry methodology. While not transformative at the level of major therapeutic breakthroughs, safer and more reliable fluorination methods have meaningful downstream impact on drug discovery efficiency and safety.
