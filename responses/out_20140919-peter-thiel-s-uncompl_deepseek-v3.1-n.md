# Peter Thiel's Uncomplimentary Views of Big Pharma (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary responds to Peter Thiel's critique of the pharmaceutical industry as fundamentally "anti-technology." Thiel argued that big pharma companies were primarily focused on extending patents and blocking innovation rather than driving real therapeutic breakthroughs, comparing them to legacy tech companies like Microsoft that profited from technological stagnation. The author acknowledges some validity to Thiel's concerns, noting that drug companies do prioritize line extensions, patent strategies, M&A activity, and share buybacks over internal R&D investment. However, the piece pushes back against Thiel's framing, arguing that the comparison between drug development and computing hardware (with its predictable Moore's Law improvements) represents an "Andy Grove fallacy" – the mistaken expectation that biomedical research should progress at the same exponential rate as silicon-based technology. The author distinguishes between engineering projects (like the Apollo program or interstate highway system) where the fundamental principles are understood, versus discovery research (like Alzheimer's drug development) where basic mechanisms remain unknown and breakthroughs require fundamental scientific discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade revealed a complex reality that partially validated both Thiel's concerns and the author's nuanced defense of pharmaceutical R&D.

**Alzheimer's Research Trajectory:** The central example of Eli Lilly's aggressive Alzheimer's investment proved tragically prescient. Solanezumab, the amyloid-beta antibody mentioned in the article, ultimately failed in multiple Phase 3 trials between 2016-2021, as did similar programs from other companies targeting the amyloid hypothesis. The field's struggles underscored how little was fundamentally understood about disease mechanisms – exactly the point the 2014 author made about discovery research versus engineering. Biogen's aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 but faced widespread physician skepticism and minimal patient uptake due to questionable efficacy, while lecanemab showed modest cognitive benefits in 2022-2023 with significant safety concerns. The promise of "cures for Alzheimer's" remained largely unfulfilled, validating concerns about the difficulty of fundamental biomedical breakthroughs.

**Industry Consolidation and R&D Strategy:** The trend toward M&A and share buybacks that both Thiel and the author discussed continued and intensified. Major deals included Pfizer's $160B acquisition of Allergan (2016, later abandoned due to tax inversion rules), Bristol-Myers Squibb's $74B purchase of Celgene (2019), and AbbVie's $63B acquisition of Allergan (2020). These transactions were often followed by significant share repurchase programs, with Pfizer alone buying back over $10B in shares in 2016-2017. The proportion of industry R&D spending relative to market capitalization remained flat or declined at many large pharma companies, while external innovation through licensing and acquisition became increasingly central to pipelines.

**Biotechnology Investment:** Thiel's broader point about internet/tech billionaires redirecting capital to biotechnology accelerated substantially. The 2010s saw explosive growth in venture funding for biotech, with sector-specific funds from Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund (Thiel's firm), and others. Biotech IPOs surged, particularly in 2018-2021, with many companies going public at billion-dollar valuations based on early-stage science. However, the boom showed signs of strain by 2022-2023 as higher interest rates and regulatory scrutiny tempered investor enthusiasm.

**Regulatory and Policy Evolution:** The FDA maintained increasingly flexible approval pathways, including accelerated approval mechanisms and orphan drug designations that benefited smaller biotechnology companies. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) streamlined regulatory requirements, while real-world evidence gained acceptance for regulatory decision-making. These changes partially addressed the innovation barriers Thiel identified, though larger questions about patent strategies and generic competition remained contentious.

**Scientific and Technological Advances:** The decade saw genuine breakthroughs in areas like gene therapy (Luxturna approved 2017, Zolgensma 2019), CAR-T cell therapy (Kymriah and Yescarta 2017), and mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines 2020-2021). CRISPR-based therapies entered clinical trials, with the first approval (Casgevy for sickle cell disease) in 2023. These innovations often originated from smaller companies and academic institutions before being acquired or partnered with larger pharma, consistent with the author's framing of external innovation as important but not necessarily "anti-technology."

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction:** Thiel predicted that pharmaceutical companies would continue functioning as "bets against innovation" by focusing on patent extensions, blocking small companies, and avoiding fundamental therapeutic breakthroughs.

*Reality:* **Mixed.** Large pharma companies did continue extensive patent litigation and lifecycle management strategies, and many blockbuster drugs faced "patent cliffs" with biosimilar/generic competition rather than true next-generation innovations. However, the industry also pursued genuinely novel therapies through M&A and partnerships with smaller biotechs, with breakthrough approvals in oncology, rare diseases, and gene therapies. The 2020-2021 COVID-19 vaccine development represented unprecedented industry collaboration and rapid innovation, though critics noted this occurred under extraordinary circumstances rather than routine R&D processes.

**Prediction:** The author suggested that comparing biomedical research to computing hardware represented an "Andy Grove fallacy," arguing that disease research involves fundamental discovery of unknown mechanisms rather than predictable engineering of known principles.

*Reality:* **Accurate.** The subsequent decade repeatedly demonstrated that success rates in drug development remained stubbornly low (roughly 10-15% from Phase 1 to approval), with high-profile failures in Alzheimer's, cancer immunotherapies, and other areas. The amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer's consumed tens of billions in R&D investment with minimal patient benefit, illustrating how fundamental mechanistic uncertainty distinguishes biomedical research from technology engineering. Even successful breakthrough therapies often required 15-20 years from initial discovery to patient availability, far longer than typical technology development cycles.

**Prediction:** The author argued that Alzheimer's represented the kind of fundamental discovery challenge where "we don't even know what causes it" and questioned whether it could be cured.

*Reality:* **Prescient.** Despite massive investment, no disease-modifying Alzheimer's therapy achieved broad clinical success in the subsequent decade. Multiple high-profile Phase 3 failures (including Lilly's solanezumab, Merck's verubecestat, and Roche's gantenerumab) confirmed the field's incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms. The amyloid hypothesis remained controversial, with some approved treatments showing marginal benefits at best and significant safety concerns. By contrast, Huntington's disease research – where genetic causation was well-established – saw promising therapeutic candidates emerge, supporting the author's distinction between engineering problems and discovery challenges.

**Prediction:** Implicit in the discussion was the idea that internet/technology billionaires investing in life sciences could "jump-start" innovation.

*Reality:* **Mixed.** Venture capital and tech-founder investment significantly increased biotech funding, leading to more companies, IPOs, and novel therapeutic approaches. However, fundamental constraints around clinical trial duration, regulatory approval timelines, and scientific uncertainty remained. Many highly-funded companies still failed in Phase 2-3 trials, and the biotech market experienced significant volatility with many companies trading below IPO prices by 2022-2023. Tech investment accelerated the number of "shots on goal" but didn't fundamentally change the underlying probability of success.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article has proven quite prescient about the structural challenges facing pharmaceutical innovation, correctly identifying the distinction between engineering optimization and fundamental discovery while anticipating the continued difficulties in Alzheimer's research. The piece captures an important tension between legitimate critique of industry business practices and realistic assessment of biomedical research constraints, making it more nuanced and enduringly relevant than many contemporary pharma analyses.
