# Celgene Expanding (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the history of a pharmaceutical research campus in Summit, New Jersey, which had changed hands multiple times: originally Ciba-Geigy, then Novartis, then Schering-Plough (2000), and finally closed by Merck in 2013 after their acquisition of Schering-Plough. The piece notes that Celgene had just purchased the abandoned campus in 2015, signaling expansion and a positive development for New Jersey's pharmaceutical industry, which had been in decline. The author expresses relief that a research campus would be used for its intended purpose rather than demolished or left vacant.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the July 2015 article, Celgene continued to expand significantly over the next several years, becoming one of the world's largest biotechnology companies. The company's key blockbuster drugs like Revlimid (lenalidomide) experienced substantial growth, with revenues exceeding several billion dollars annually for multiple myeloma treatment.

However, major changes occurred in 2019 when Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) acquired Celgene for approximately $74 billion in one of the largest pharmaceutical mergers in history. The acquisition faced regulatory scrutiny but ultimately closed in November 2019. Post-acquisition, BMS integrated Celgene's operations and portfolio into their existing structure.

The Summit, New Jersey campus likely continued as a research facility under BMS ownership, contributing to the company's expanded research capabilities in oncology and immunology. The merger resulted in BMS becoming one of the top global pharmaceutical companies, particularly strong in cancer therapeutics.

New Jersey's pharmaceutical landscape has remained an important hub, though the industry has continued evolving with numerous mergers, acquisitions, and shifts in research focus over the years since 2015.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events or specific outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This is a relatively minor industry real estate and business development story rather than a major scientific or clinical breakthrough article. While it touches on important trends in pharmaceutical industry consolidation and New Jersey's role as a pharma hub, it lacks the broader scientific or medical implications that would give it higher interest value.
