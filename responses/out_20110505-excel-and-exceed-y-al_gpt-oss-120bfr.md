# Excel and Exceed, Y'all (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary revisits a previous piece on “corporate anthems” and focuses on Pfizer’s internal motivational song titled **“Excel and Exceed.”** The author notes that the video of the anthem had been removed from YouTube—presumably because Pfizer found it embarrassing—but was later re‑uploaded by a disgruntled former employee. The post links to the YouTube video and adds a tongue‑in‑cheek jab at Pfizer’s failed inhaled insulin product, Exubera, by referencing earlier jokes about the device (e.g., “bird feeder” humor). The tone is light‑hearted and mildly critical, warning readers that the anthem is “uplifting” in a way that may be uncomfortable to hear.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Pfizer’s corporate anthem** – The “Excel and Exceed” video remained online after the 2011 repost and has not been officially promoted by Pfizer. There is no public record of the company re‑issuing the anthem or using it in later internal communications. Pfizer’s branding and employee‑engagement materials have since shifted toward more conventional corporate messaging (e.g., the “We are Pfizer” tagline used in the 2020‑2022 COVID‑19 vaccine campaign).  

**Exubera** – The inhaled insulin product referenced in the jokes had already been withdrawn from the market in 2007 after poor sales and physician uptake. No further development of inhaled insulin by Pfizer occurred after that point; the company redirected its diabetes portfolio toward other modalities (e.g., GLP‑1 agonists through partnerships).  

**Pfizer’s broader trajectory** – The most consequential events after 2011 have been unrelated to the anthem or Exubera:  

* **COVID‑19 vaccine (2020‑2021).** Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, marketed as Comirnaty) received Emergency Use Authorization in December 2020 and full FDA approval in August 2021. It became one of the world’s best‑selling drugs, generating > $37 billion in 2021 revenue.  
* **Strategic acquisitions.** Pfizer acquired **Seagen** (2023) for $43 billion to bolster oncology, and **Arena Pharmaceuticals** (2022) for $6.7 billion, expanding its pipeline in inflammation and immunology.  
* **Corporate culture.** In the wake of the 2020‑2021 vaccine rollout, Pfizer publicly emphasized a “science‑first” culture and increased transparency, but internal employee‑engagement tools (e.g., internal videos, town halls) have remained low‑profile; no new corporate anthem has been reported.  

Overall, the specific items highlighted in the 2011 article (the anthem and Exubera jokes) did not lead to any lasting industry impact. The anthem remains a curiosity for those who track corporate branding oddities, while Exubera is remembered as a cautionary case of a technically viable but commercially unsuccessful drug‑delivery platform.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forward‑looking predictions. Implicitly, it suggests that:

- **Corporate anthems can become embarrassing embarrassments and may be pulled.**  
  *Outcome:* The video was indeed removed (by Pfizer or YouTube) and later resurfaced via an employee upload. Pfizer has not revived the anthem, so the implication held true.

- **The Exubera inhaler would be a source of jokes because of its failure.**  
  *Outcome:* Exubera was withdrawn in 2007, well before the article, and has remained a punch‑line in biotech commentary. The prediction about its continued notoriety proved accurate.

No other specific forecasts were made, so there is nothing further to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **3/10**  
The piece is a niche, humorous snapshot of corporate culture that offers little lasting scientific or industry insight; its relevance is mainly archival.
