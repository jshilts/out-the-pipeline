# A New Look At Clinical Attrition (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a landmark 2014 *Nature Biotechnology* study by BIO/BioMedTracker that provided the most comprehensive data on clinical trial failure rates at the time, examining 7,300+ drug development paths across 835 companies from 2003-2011. The study found that approximately 10% of Phase I drug candidates eventually received FDA approval, with Phase II showing the highest attrition rate at around 60%. Small molecules faced particularly brutal odds at 92% failure, while oncology drugs showed the worst therapeutic area outcomes at 93% failure, with over 50% still failing in Phase III. The authors attributed the gloomier results compared to earlier studies to the inclusion of smaller biotech companies, increasing regulatory hurdles, rising trial complexity, and improved standard of care making new drugs harder to prove superior.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2014 analysis became a foundational reference point for understanding clinical development realities. In the decade that followed, several notable trends emerged:

**Continued High Attrition**: Subsequent analyses confirmed these patterns persisted. A 2018 BIO/BioMedTracker update covering 2006-2015 found overall success rates remained similar at 9.6%, with oncology worsening slightly to 3.4% success (96.6% failure) and rare diseases showing modest improvement. The "valley of death" in Phase II remained the primary bottleneck.

**Oncology's Evolving Landscape**: While oncology maintained high failure rates, the 2014-2024 period saw significant successes with checkpoint inhibitors (Keytruda, Opdivo), CAR-T therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta), and targeted therapies. However, these were offset by numerous failures in other oncology approaches, maintaining overall high attrition.

**FDA Regulatory Changes**: The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and accelerated approval pathways did slightly improve some metrics for targeted areas, but overall success rates didn't dramatically improve industry-wide. Oncology actually saw increased regulatory scrutiny over surrogate endpoints post-2014.

**Platform Technologies**: Novel modalities like gene therapy faced similar or worse odds initially, with several high-profile failures (Glybera withdrawal, numerous gene therapy trial halts) demonstrating that new technologies didn't automatically solve attrition problems.

**Business Impact**: The data reinforced trends toward licensing/partnering models, with smaller biotechs increasingly partnering rather than attempting full development independently. Pharmaceutical company R&D restructuring continued, but few solved the fundamental productivity crisis identified in 2014.

**COVID-19 Exception**: 2020-2022 saw unprecedented vaccine and therapeutic success rates due to emergency use pathways and massive government funding, but this proved temporary, with return to baseline trends expected post-pandemic.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"How sustainable is a business with these kinds of failure rates?"**: The prediction was that these failure rates would pressure business models. **Reality**: It led to increased M&A activity (2014-2024 saw major acquisitions), greater risk-sharing through partnerships, and pricing strategies maintaining high drug costs to compensate for failures. The business model proved sustainable but controversial due to drug pricing debates.

• **"How feasible are the pricing strategies that can accommodate them?"**: The implicit prediction was that accommodating high failure rates would require steep prices. **Reality**: Drug prices continued rising significantly post-2014, with cancer drugs often exceeding $100,000-$300,000 annually, generating intense public and political backlash and proposed legislative reforms.

• **"What will break us out of this system, anyway?"**: The prediction suggested the need for systemic change. **Reality**: While precision medicine, AI drug discovery, and biomarkers showed promise, no silver bullet emerged. Most improvements were incremental rather than revolutionary, with fundamental scientific challenges and regulatory complexity remaining.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article provided empirically-grounded data that became the gold standard reference for clinical development reality, helping ground discussions about drug costs and industry challenges in actual evidence rather than anecdotes or selective data. Its findings remained remarkably durable over the subsequent decade.
