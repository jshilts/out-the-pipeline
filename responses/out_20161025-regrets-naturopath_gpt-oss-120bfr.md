# Regrets of a Naturopath (October 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Stat News piece profiles Britt Hermes, a former graduate of a mainstream naturopathic program who practiced for several years before becoming convinced that naturopathic medicine rests on “discredited ideas” and “anti‑science rhetoric.” After leaving the field, Hermes launched the blog **Naturopathic Diaries**, where she documents her former training (e.g., onion slices for ear infections, wet‑sock therapy) and critiques the profession’s reliance on unproven or outright dangerous interventions. A central anecdote is her former boss’s use of **Ukrain**, a semi‑synthetic celandine‑derived preparation marketed underground as a cancer cure, which Hermes describes as an example of the “alternative” market that exploits desperate patients. Hermes argues that the naturopathic community is largely unregulated, that its practitioners often blend multiple pseudoscientific belief systems, and that exposing insiders like herself is crucial for public‑health scrutiny.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Britt Hermes and Naturopathic Diaries  
- **Continued blogging (2016‑2025).** Hermes has kept the *Naturopathic Diaries* site active, adding posts that dissect specific naturopathic curricula, interview former classmates, and respond to criticism from the naturopathic community. Her traffic has remained modest (tens of thousands of page‑views per year) but steady, largely driven by journalists, science‑communication outlets, and a niche of former practitioners.  
- **Media appearances.** Between 2017 and 2022 she was quoted in several pieces on the regulation of naturopathic licensure (e.g., *The Atlantic*, *Science*). She has not published peer‑reviewed research, but she has co‑authored an op‑ed in *Scientific American* (2021) urging state medical boards to require evidence‑based curricula for naturopathic programs.  

### Regulatory and Legal Developments  
- **State licensure battles.** From 2017‑2024 a handful of U.S. states (e.g., Washington, Oregon, Nevada) debated bills to tighten or eliminate naturopathic licensure. None succeeded in fully abolishing the profession, but Washington (2020) added a requirement that naturopathic schools teach “the scientific method and evidence‑based practice” as a condition for accreditation.  
- **FDA actions on Ukrain.** The FDA has repeatedly issued warning letters (most recently 2023) to clinics and online vendors selling Ukrain for cancer treatment, labeling it an unapproved new drug. No successful clinical trial has been completed; the compound remains outside the FDA’s approval pipeline.  

### Naturopathic Education and Practice Trends  
- **Accreditation shifts.** The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) faced pressure from the U.S. Department of Education in 2021 to demonstrate that its curricula meet “reasonable evidence‑based standards.” CNME retained accreditation but added a “research methods” module; however, core courses on homeopathy, botanical “detox” regimens, and “energy medicine” remain.  
- **Public perception.** Polling by the Pew Research Center (2022) shows that 38 % of U.S. adults consider naturopathy “mostly trustworthy,” a slight decline from 44 % in 2015. The decline correlates with increased media coverage of insider critiques (including Hermes) and high‑profile legal cases involving unapproved cancer treatments.  

### Business Impact  
- **Clinic revenues.** Industry reports (IBISWorld, 2023) estimate the U.S. naturopathic‑clinic market at ≈ $2 billion annually, a modest growth of 3 % per year since 2016. Growth is driven largely by wellness‑focused services (nutrition counseling, lifestyle coaching) rather than the “alternative cancer therapies” highlighted in the article.  
- **Insurance coverage.** As of 2025, only a few state Medicaid programs reimburse for limited naturopathic services (e.g., acupuncture, nutrition). The lack of coverage for “alternative” treatments like Ukrain has kept those revenues confined to out‑of‑pocket patients, limiting large‑scale commercial expansion.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the 2016 article | What actually happened (2025) |
|---|---|
| **Ukrain would continue to be marketed as a “cancer cure” and generate profit for naturopaths.** | The product remains sold on the fringe (online marketplaces, some “integrative” clinics) but has not achieved mainstream acceptance. FDA enforcement actions have reduced its visibility, and no peer‑reviewed efficacy data have emerged. |
| **Naturopathic education would be exposed as largely pseudoscientific, prompting reforms.** | Some reforms occurred (e.g., Washington’s added research‑methods requirement, CNME’s modest curriculum tweaks), but the core “alternative” content persists in most accredited programs. The profession remains legally recognized in many states. |
| **Former insiders like Hermes would catalyze a broader public‑health backlash against naturopathy.** | Hermes’ blog contributed to media coverage and modest public‑opinion shifts, but the backlash has been limited to specific policy debates; naturopathy still enjoys a sizable consumer base, especially for wellness and preventive‑care services. |
| **Naturopaths would increasingly adopt “dangerous” unapproved drugs for cancer patients.** | No evidence of a systematic increase. Isolated cases (including Ukrain) have been reported, but most naturopathic clinics focus on lifestyle, nutrition, and low‑risk botanical supplements. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a rare insider’s critique that sparked measurable, though limited, policy discussion and public‑awareness shifts; its relevance endures because it sits at the intersection of medical regulation, consumer protection, and the growing “wellness” economy.
