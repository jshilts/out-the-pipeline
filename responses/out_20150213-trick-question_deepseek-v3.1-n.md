# A Trick Question (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2015 commentary discusses a FierceBiotech story reporting on Pfizer CEO Ian Read's statements about the pharmaceutical industry. Read acknowledged that Pfizer found it "difficult to pick winners" when considering acquisitions of smaller biotech companies. He also noted that "small biotechs don't rate Pfizer very highly," speculating that this might be because "we don't pay enough."

The author (Derek Lowe) suggests an alternative explanation: that biotech companies and their investors dislike seeing their companies "filleted like fish" - with marketable components extracted while everything else gets discarded. The article captures a moment when Pfizer's acquisition strategy was under discussion, reflecting tensions between large pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotech firms regarding M&A practices and valuation.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2015 article, Pfizer's strategy and the broader biotech M&A landscape evolved significantly:

**Pfizer's Major Acquisitions Post-2015:**
- **2016**: Failed attempt to acquire Allergan for $160 billion (deal collapsed due to US Treasury tax inversion rules)
- **2016**: Acquired Medivation for $14 billion (adding prostate cancer drug Xtandi)
- **2019**: Acquired Array BioPharma for $11.4 billion (expanding oncology portfolio)
- **2020**: Acquired Arixa Pharmaceuticals (antibiotics portfolio)
- **2022**: Acquired Biohaven Pharmaceuticals for $11.6 billion (adding migraine drugs including Nurtec)

**Strategic Transformation:**
The period saw Pfizer pivot toward more targeted, strategic acquisitions rather than the massive consolidation Read referenced. The company focused on therapeutic areas where it could leverage existing strengths, particularly oncology, rare diseases, and vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered Pfizer's trajectory, with their mRNA vaccine partnership with BioNTech generating unprecedented revenue and accelerating their position in vaccine technology.

**Biotech M&A Trends:**
The biotech M&A market grew increasingly sophisticated, with large pharma companies developing specialized acquisition strategies rather than indiscriminate consolidation. Premiums for quality biotech assets increased substantially, validating Read's comment about payment levels. The rise of SPACs and increased venture capital funding in biotech created more competition for attractive targets.

**Read's Tenure and Succession:**
Ian Read remained Pfizer CEO until January 2019, when Albert Bourla took over. Under Read's leadership, Pfizer completed several major acquisitions and divestitures, though the company avoided the mega-mergers that characterized earlier periods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself doesn't contain explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather commentary on the dynamics between large pharma and small biotech. The underlying implications:

- **Pfizer's acquisition approach**: The suggestion that Pfizer might struggle to acquire attractive biotechs due to cultural/financial mismatch was partially validated - while Pfizer did make successful acquisitions, it avoided the massive consolidation wave some expected and instead pursued more targeted, strategic deals.

- **Biotech valuation dynamics**: The tension around "paying enough" proved prescient, as biotech valuations and acquisition premiums rose significantly post-2015, particularly for assets with clear clinical validation.

- **"Filleted like fish" concern**: This reflected ongoing tensions in biotech M&A, where acquired companies often saw their pipeline projects deprioritized or discontinued post-acquisition - a pattern that continued throughout the period.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article captures real tensions in pharma-biotech M&A dynamics but is relatively brief and dated. It has moderate historical value for understanding corporate strategy debates of that era, but lacks the technical depth or long-term prescience that would warrant higher interest today.
