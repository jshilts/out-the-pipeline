# New Drugs for HIV (February 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses new HIV treatments targeting the CCR5 receptor, highlighted by Schering-Plough's experimental compound. CCR5 is a cell membrane receptor that HIV uses to enter blood cells and infect them, discovered through studies of patients naturally resistant to HIV who had mutated CCR5 forms. The drug development approach involves blocking the CCR5 receptor with small molecules to prevent HIV binding.

The author notes that while the compound has passed animal toxicity testing and shown human efficacy, it faces ongoing clinical trials to prove safety and effectiveness to the FDA. The central questions raised are whether this approach will achieve market approval and whether it will truly have fewer side effects than existing protease inhibitor cocktails. The article emphasizes that all drugs have side effects and that mechanism-based toxicity or unexpected off-target effects could emerge during longer, larger trials.

## 2. HISTORY

The CCR5 antagonist approach described in the article faced a complex development and approval trajectory. Schering-Plough's compound referenced in the 2002 article (SCH 351125) ultimately **did not reach market approval** due to toxicity concerns and inadequate efficacy.

However, the CCR5 strategy **eventually succeeded** with Pfizer's **maraviroc (Celsentri/Selzentry)**, which received FDA approval in August 2007. This marked the first CCR5 antagonist and represented a new class of antiretroviral therapy.

**Clinical Impact**: Maraviroc demonstrated real-world utility particularly for treatment-experienced HIV patients with CCR5-tropic virus, showing viral load suppression when combined with optimized background therapy. The drug required a tropism test (Trofile assay) to identify patients with CCR5-using virus, as it's ineffective against CXCR4-tropic or dual-tropic HIV.

**Adoption Limitations**: While approved, maraviroc did **not** achieve widespread first-line use, primarily serving as a salvage therapy option rather than transforming the standard of care. Its utility was constrained by the need for tropism testing and the fact that only about 60-80% of treatment-naïve patients and fewer treatment-experienced patients harbor CCR5-tropic virus.

**Scientific Understanding**: The CCR5-Δ32 mutation mentioned in the article proved highly predictive - individuals homozygous for this mutation show near-complete resistance to HIV infection, while heterozygotes may experience slower disease progression.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several key predictions and questions:

- **"Will this lead to a marketed HIV drug?"** → **Partially correct**. While Schering-Plough's specific compound failed, the CCR5 approach ultimately succeeded with maraviroc's 2007 approval, validating the target.

- **"Will it have fewer side effects than protease inhibitor cocktails?"** → **Generally accurate**. Maraviroc did avoid protease inhibitor-specific side effects like body-fat remodeling and metabolic complications. However, it introduced its own safety profile including hepatotoxicity concerns and increased cardiovascular risk that emerged post-marketing.

- **"The more routes of attack we have, the better"** → **Correct direction but limited impact**. The CCR5 pathway became one additional mechanism, but did not replace existing antiretroviral classes, instead serving as a specialized option for specific patient populations.

- **Concerns about unexpected side effects from blocking CCR5 chronically** → **Prescient**. Post-marketing surveillance revealed that long-term CCR5 blockade could increase susceptibility to certain infections (particularly West Nile virus) and raised questions about immune function regulation, though maraviroc ultimately proved adequately safe for approved indications.

- **Concerns about market approval pathway** → **Partly validated**. The development pathway was indeed challenging, with toxicity issues derailing Schering-Plough's compound, requiring pharmaceutical companies to develop more selective CCR5 antagonists with better safety margins.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article demonstrates substantial foresight about drug development challenges and realistic assessment of therapeutic potential, accurately anticipating both the promise and pitfalls of CCR5 as an HIV target while providing accessible scientific education about receptor pharmacology.
