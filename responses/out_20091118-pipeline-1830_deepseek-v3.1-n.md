# Article Title (Month Year)
More For the Blogroll (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
Give a short summary of 1-2 paragraphs for what the article said. Provide enough context that the article can be understood just from reading the summary.

**The article is a brief blog post announcing the addition of two blogs to the author's blogroll: "Pharma Conduct" and "Chemical Space." It also notes the return of the "Pharmalot" blog in an update. No specific claims, predictions, or substantive content about the biotechnology industry are made. The post is purely administrative in nature, simply sharing blog recommendations with readers.**

## 2. HISTORY
Research what happened subsequent to the article being published and summarize those later developments. Focus on concrete impact and the real-world implications that evolved, and avoid repeating hype or buzzwords. For examples, Did it lead to approved drugs (or lead to clinical failures) ; Is the method widely adopted among scientists or drugs in the pipeline ; If a drug was FDA-approved, did it actually have wide uptake on patients ; Did public policy change in concrete ways ; What growth or failures happened to the businesses mentioned.

**This blog post had no direct tangible impact on the biotechnology industry, as it was simply a blogroll update. The mentioned blogs ("Pharma Conduct," "Chemical Space," and "Pharmalot") were all separate entities, and their subsequent histories (including "Pharmalot's" eventual shuttering and later revival) were independent of this specific post.**

## 3. PREDICTIONS
Sometimes an article will have included predictions about the future. These may have been predictions by the author, or by others described in the article. If you find predictions, then in bullet points describe those predictions and how they compared to what actually later happened. When evaluating predictions, stay focused on empirical facts and avoid generic statements. Answer boths the specifics and bigger picture - for example, if a drug is mentioned, give its outcomes and whether the drug target or mechanism overall has found success.

**The article contains no predictions about the future of biotechnology. It is a non-substantive, administrative blog post.**

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 1/10**
This is a purely administrative blog post with no substantive content or analysis of the biotechnology industry, fitting within the bottom 10% of interest.
