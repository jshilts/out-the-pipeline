# GLP-1 and Obesity (February 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reviews the long and disappointing history of anti-obesity drug development, which the author characterizes as mostly "a bottomless pit into which people shove money and time." Historical failures included dangerous compounds (dinitrophenol, amphetamines, fen-phen leading to cardiac valve problems) and numerous failed targets (leptin, NPY5, galanin, CB-1, D1 dopamine receptor). The piece focuses on a February 2021 New England Journal of Medicine paper showing promising results for semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) in nearly 2,000 non-diabetic obese patients. After 68 weeks, the treatment group lost 14.9% body weight versus 2.4% for placebo, with manageable side effects (nausea, GI symptoms, increased gallstones). The author notes that while GLP-1 analogs had already shown weight loss effects in diabetes trials, and liraglutide had been approved for obesity in 2014, the semaglutide results appeared particularly impressive. He also mentions the potential of Rybelsus, an oral formulation of semaglutide, for future obesity applications.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the GLP-1 obesity field achieved remarkable real-world validation and market success:

**Regulatory approvals:** Semaglutide received FDA approval for chronic weight management as **Wegovy** (2.4 mg injection) in June 2021, just months after the article. The oral version (Rybelsus) has remained approved for type 2 diabetes but not for obesity indications.

**Clinical validation expanded:** Additional trials demonstrated semaglutide's efficacy across diverse populations, including adolescents, and showed sustained weight loss over two years. The STEP trial program provided robust long-term safety and efficacy data.

**Market adoption:** Wegovy achieved substantial patient uptake despite supply constraints and high costs. By 2023-2024, it had become one of the most prescribed obesity medications, generating billions in revenue for Novo Nordisk and creating unprecedented demand that strained manufacturing capacity.

**Tirzepatide emergence:** Eli Lilly's dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro for diabetes, Zepbound for obesity) demonstrated even greater weight loss (15-22% in trials) and received obesity approval in late 2023, establishing a second major competitor in the GLP-1-based obesity market.

**Healthcare system impact:** These drugs have shifted obesity treatment paradigms, with increased physician prescribing and broader insurance coverage discussions. However, high costs (~$1,000-1,500/month) have limited access for many patients.

**Expanding indications:** GLP-1 agonists have shown cardiovascular benefits, leading to additional approved indications for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with established heart disease.

**Supply challenges:** The massive demand created intermittent shortages, affecting both obesity and diabetes patients, and highlighting manufacturing scalability issues.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Novo Nordisk is pressing ahead in the clinic with an eye to getting this approved for obesity, and given the record of liraglutide, they would seem to have a good case"**: ✅ **Accurate**. Wegovy received FDA approval in June 2021, validating this prediction completely.

• **"It wouldn't surprise me if this [oral] route is in the company's long-terms plans as well"**: ⚠️ **Partially accurate but incomplete**. While interest in oral formulations continued, the oral version (Rybelsus) remains approved only for type 2 diabetes, not obesity, and injectable formulations became the dominant obesity treatment due to demonstrated superior efficacy at higher doses.

• **"Overall the GLP-1 field, for all its complications, looks like a serious contender"**: ✅ **Extremely accurate**. This understated prediction proved completely correct, with GLP-1 agonists becoming the most successful obesity drug class in pharmaceutical history, revolutionizing both treatment paradigms and the commercial landscape.

• **"Long-term safety (and long-term efficacy) will have to be watched"**: ✅ **Prudent and correct**. Continued monitoring has shown generally favorable safety profiles, though questions about rare side effects and long-term adherence remain areas of ongoing study.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional prescience by identifying semaglutide as a breakthrough moment in obesity therapeutics just before it achieved regulatory approval and market transformation, making it both historically significant and scientifically insightful.
