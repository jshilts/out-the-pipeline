# Head Counts and Profits (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses pharmaceutical industry staffing trends and productivity from 2011 to 2015, referencing a piece by Frank David at Endpoints that challenged the narrative of "leaner and meaner" pharma companies. Contrary to popular perception of widespread job cuts, the data showed that six of the ten most R&D-intensive global pharma companies actually increased employee numbers during this period, while three others saw reductions of less than 10%. Only Merck made significant cuts, reducing staff by 21%.

The analysis also examined inflation-adjusted profit per employee, revealing a mixed picture. J&J saw a 40% increase and GlaxoSmithKline a 33% increase, but other companies experienced declines. The most dramatic drops were AstraZeneca (down 78% per capita) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (down 68% per capita despite reducing headcount by 7.4%). The author notes that these figures likely reflect overall earnings volatility driven by patent expirations, irregular drug discovery timelines, and the inherent unpredictability of pharmaceutical R&D cycles.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in the 2017 article continued and intensified through the late 2010s and 2020s. Major pharmaceutical companies pursued significant M&A activity that dramatically reshaped headcounts and profitability profiles.

**Pfizer** exemplifies these transformations. The company completed its $14 billion acquisition of Medivation in 2016, the $63 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma in 2019, and most significantly, the $160 billion acquisition of Allergan (ultimately abandoned due to tax inversion rules, but demonstrating the scale of strategy). Pfizer then acquired Biohaven Pharmaceuticals for $11.6 billion in 2022. These moves, along with the massive success of their COVID-19 vaccine and oral antiviral, fundamentally altered their employment and profitability dynamics.

**Bristol-Myers Squibb** executed one of the largest transactions in industry history with their $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019, which significantly increased their headcount while adding blockbuster drugs like Revlimid. However, they later faced patent cliffs on key revenue drivers, impacting the profit-per-employee metrics highlighted in the original analysis.

**Merck**, despite being the "leaner" outlier in the 2011-2015 period with 21% staff reductions, continued strategic acquisitions including the $1.85 billion purchase of Pandion Therapeutics in 2021 and various smaller biotech acquisitions, showing that even "lean" companies pursued growth through external innovation.

The period also saw dramatic R&D productivity changes driven by new therapeutic modalities. The rise of immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors (Merck's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers' Opdivo), CAR-T cell therapies, and the breakthrough success of COVID-19 vaccines created massive profitability swings that dwarfed the staffing-related metrics discussed in 2017. The industry's shift toward biologics, oncology, and rare diseases created different human capital requirements than traditional small-molecule drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Headcount trends would continue showing mixed patterns (partially accurate)**
- **What happened:** The mixed pattern of headcount changes did continue, but driven by M&A rather than organic hiring. Companies like Pfizer actually increased headcount substantially through acquisitions, while others maintained varied approaches. However, the "leaner" narrative largely disappeared as companies recognized the need for diverse expertise in biologics, digital health, and complex manufacturing.

**Prediction: Profit volatility would remain inherent to pharma business model (highly accurate)**
- **What happened:** This prediction proved remarkably prescient. The 2020-2022 COVID period created unprecedented profit volatility - Pfizer's revenues jumped from $41.7B in 2019 to $81.3B in 2021, then declined to $58.5B in 2023 as pandemic demand waned. Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil continued growth, while Bristol-Myers faced Revlimid patent expiration reducing revenues by billions. These swings made the 2011-2015 fluctuations seem modest.

**Prediction: R&D productivity challenges would continue affecting profit metrics (accurate but incomplete)**
- **What happened:** R&D productivity did remain challenging, but new breakthrough modalities (CAR-T, gene therapy, mRNA vaccines) created different, more positive volatility. The time lag between R&D investment and profit realization (which the original author noted) remained relevant - investments made during the lean period helped drive later successes like CAR-T therapies (Bristol-Myers' Breyanzi, approved 2021) and oncology drugs that boosted subsequent profitability.

**Prediction: Patent expirations would continue creating irregular earnings patterns (highly accurate)**
- **What happened:** The patent cliff phenomenon intensified, with blockbuster drugs like Humira (peak sales $21B), Revlimid (peak $12.8B), and Keytruda (approaching patent expiration mid-2020s) creating enormous earnings volatility that staffing levels couldn't buffer. Companies responded by diversifying portfolios and pursuing strategic acquisitions to smooth these cycles.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article has aged into an interesting case study of pharmaceutical industry dynamics, particularly regarding how profit volatility and headcount metrics reflect underlying business model challenges. While the specific numbers from 2011-2015 are not particularly relevant today, the broader themes about pharma earnings unpredictability, the disconnect between R&D hiring and profit timing, and M&A's impact on workforce metrics proved quite prescient.
