# Approvals (and Otherwise) in Oncology (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2015 commentary discusses several major regulatory developments in oncology drug development occurring within days of each other. The article highlights three significant events: Johnson & Johnson received unexpectedly early FDA approval for Darzalex (daratumumab), an anti-CD38 antibody for multiple myeloma treatment originally developed by Genmab. Simultaneously, AstraZeneca gained early approval for Tagrisso (osimertinib), a kinase inhibitor targeting a specific EGFR mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. In contrast, Clovis Biotechnology faced major regulatory setbacks with their similar lung cancer drug rociletinib, as the FDA requested additional data due to preliminary clinical results that failed to hold up, causing Clovis's stock to plummet approximately 75% on the news.

## 2. HISTORY

**Darzalex (daratumumab)**: Following its 2015 approval, daratumumab became a cornerstone of multiple myeloma treatment. It received numerous additional FDA approvals across multiple lines of therapy, including combination regimens. The drug achieved blockbuster status with peak sales exceeding $4 billion annually, demonstrating significant real-world patient uptake. Sanofi's competing anti-CD38 antibody SAR650984 (isatuximab) eventually received FDA approval in 2020, validating the target's importance. Multiple myeloma treatment landscape did indeed transform as predicted, with CD38-targeting antibodies becoming standard of care.

**Tagrisso (osimertinib)**: Osimertinib proved highly successful post-approval, becoming first-line treatment for EGFR-mutant NSCLC and achieving over $5 billion in annual sales. It significantly improved progression-free survival compared to earlier EGFR inhibitors and demonstrated efficacy in preventing brain metastases. The drug's success validated the precision medicine approach in lung cancer and became a standard treatment globally.

**Rociletinib**: Clovis's drug never recovered from the 2015 setback. The FDA ultimately declined approval, and the company discontinued its development in 2016. This failure highlighted the risks of accelerated development strategies and the importance of robust clinical data before regulatory submission. The contrasting outcomes between Tagrisso and rociletinib became a case study in oncology drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"The myeloma landscape is changing dramatically"**: This proved accurate. Daratumumab and elotuzumab (approved in 2015) fundamentally altered multiple myeloma treatment paradigms, with CD38-targeting becoming standard of care across multiple treatment lines.
- **Implicit prediction that the race between competing drugs would determine success**: Partially accurate. While the race dynamics were real, the outcomes diverged - daratumumab succeeded beyond expectations while rociletinib failed completely, suggesting that target selection and clinical data quality were more important than timing alone.
- **Implicit expectation that early regulatory success would translate to market success**: Validated for daratumumab and osimertinib, both of which became multi-billion dollar drugs with widespread clinical adoption.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article captured a pivotal moment in oncology drug development, correctly identifying three major regulatory decisions that would significantly influence treatment paradigms and market dynamics. The contrasting outcomes provided valuable lessons about drug development strategy and regulatory risk.
