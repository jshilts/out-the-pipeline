# Chemical Illiteracy, Again (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post criticizes the BBC's science TV series "Wonders of Life" for displaying a laughably incorrect "peptide structure" in their graphics. The author (Derek Lowe) points out that the depicted molecular structure violates fundamental chemical principles—oxygen atoms shown as neutral trivalent species, inconsistent bond lengths, and representing something that could never exist. He compares this error to showing a world map where Italy is relabeled Argentina, but considers the chemical error even more egregious since atomic elements cannot change their fundamental bonding behavior. Lowe expresses frustration that such easily avoidable mistakes keep occurring in prominent science communication, attributing them to graphic designers using chemical drawing software without proper chemical knowledge. He argues that accurate structures would have been just as visually interesting and questions why someone would deliberately "mess things up" when correctness was so easily achievable.

## 2. HISTORY

**Impact on Science Communication Practices:**
Following this and similar critiques, there was growing awareness in science communication circles about chemical accuracy in visual representations. However, such errors continued to occur periodically in mainstream media and even scientific publications.

**Documented Pattern of Chemical Visualization Errors:**
- This was not an isolated incident; Lowe had previously highlighted similar issues, including a 2012 example from GSK's anti-doping advertisement
- Professor David Smith's YouTube response at University of York exemplified academic efforts to call attention to these issues

**Limited Systemic Change:**
Unlike regulatory or policy changes that might follow from drug development failures, this type of graphical error primarily remained in the domain of professional critique and public shaming. No concrete regulatory or institutional policy changes resulted specifically from this incident, though it contributed to ongoing discussions about scientific accuracy in science communication.

**Broader Context:**
This occurred during a period of increasing scrutiny of how science is communicated to the public, particularly as digital media made scientific visualizations more accessible but also more prone to errors by non-specialist graphic designers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"I'm sure it won't be the last" [example of ridiculous errors]** - **ACCURATE**: Similar chemical visualization errors continued to appear in media and advertising after 2015, confirming Lowe's expectation that the problem would persist despite criticism.

• **"I just wish they were less frequent, and less prominent"** - **PARTIALLY REALIZED**: While prominent errors still occurred, increased awareness and critiques like this one may have contributed to somewhat better scrutiny in some high-profile science communication venues over time.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
This represents a moderately interesting historical example of science communication critique focused on chemical accuracy in media. While the specific incident is fairly narrow and technical, it illuminates persistent challenges in translating scientific concepts to public audiences and the role of expert oversight in science communication.
