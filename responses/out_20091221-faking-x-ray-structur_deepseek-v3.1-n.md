# Faking X-Ray Structures. . .For Fun? Or Profit? Or What? (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary about research misconduct at the University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) involving a former researcher, H. M. Krishna Murthy. He was accused of falsifying multiple X-ray crystal structures of medically relevant proteins—including dengue virus protease, taq polymerase, and complement proteins. These structures were published and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

UAB's investigation concluded that 11 published structures had been falsified, with the university requesting retractions. This was not Murthy's first controversy; questions about his work had surfaced years earlier in *Nature*. The article describes the technical methods by which X-ray structures could have been faked, such as using structurally similar proteins as templates, then adding water molecules and noise to generate seemingly authentic data. Dr. Murthy had already left UAB by the time the allegations became widely known, and his whereabouts were unknown.

## 2. HISTORY

The H. M. Krishna Murthy case became a significant example of research misconduct in structural biology, with lasting impacts on scientific oversight and data validation.

**Investigation and Retractions:** Following UAB's internal investigation, multiple papers were retracted from journals, and the falsified structures were removed from the Protein Data Bank. This process involved collaboration between the university, journal editors, and the PDB to ensure data integrity.

**Technical Response:** The crystallographic community developed and implemented more sophisticated validation tools and procedures. The PDB enhanced its structure validation pipeline to better detect anomalous or suspicious structural data. Software and reporting standards evolved to make faking structures more difficult by requiring more comprehensive experimental data (electron density maps, refinement statistics) alongside deposited coordinates.

**Career and Legal Outcomes:** The scientific misconduct effectively ended Murthy's research career. Such cases often lead to debarment from federal research funding and exclusion from academic positions. It is likely that funding agencies such as the NIH and NSF took administrative action, which commonly includes a period of ineligibility to apply for or receive grants.

**Broader Impact on Structural Biology:** The case contributed to ongoing discussions about research ethics, quality control in structural biology, and the importance of independent replication of key findings. While the fraudulent structures did not directly cause clinical drug failures (they were early-stage research tools), their removal prevented wasted research effort and resources by other scientists who might have relied on them.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events. It was a commentary focused on the immediate revelations of scientific misconduct. Therefore, there are no specific predictions to evaluate for accuracy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article is moderately interesting as a case study of research misconduct in structural biology. While it highlights serious integrity issues at the time, its long-term importance and relevance have diminished as the specific incidents have been largely resolved and addressed through improved institutional oversight and validation processes.
