# Way Out Here (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2007 commentary reflects on Pfizer's recent facility closures and research site decisions, noting that earlier predictions about which locations would survive were accurate in outline but wrong in detail. The author expresses particular sympathy for Pfizer's Michigan facility (formerly Warner-Lambert), which discovered and developed Lipitor—Pfizer's blockbuster cholesterol drug that had been crucial to the company's financial health—but was nonetheless slated for closure. The article discusses the strategic importance of geographic location for pharmaceutical research, identifying key biotech/pharma hubs (Boston/Cambridge, SF/Bay Area, San Diego/La Jolla, and the New Jersey corridor) versus companies that thrive in less traditional locations like Eli Lilly in Indianapolis. The author also highlights the career risks for scientists working at isolated single-employer locations and invites nominations for the "Most Isolated Company Award," suggesting Albany Molecular as an example.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2007 article, pharmaceutical industry consolidation and site rationalization continued aggressively, particularly during late 2000s-2010s mergers. Pfizer made several major moves: the company acquired Wyeth in 2009 for $68 billion, leading to additional facility closures and consolidations. The company also acquired Hospira in 2015 and attempted the $160 billion Allergan merger in 2016 (later abandoned due to tax inversion rule changes). Most significantly, Pfizer spun off its established products business as Upjohn in 2019, which then merged with Mylan to form Viatris in 2020—a major restructuring of Pfizer's legacy portfolio.

Lipitor (atorvastatin), the drug highlighted in the article as Pfizer's savior, remained a blockbuster but faced patent expiration in November 2011. Generic competition dramatically reduced revenue, though the drug had generated over $125 billion in cumulative sales by that point.

Pfizer's geographic footprint continued evolving: the company maintained significant presence in key hubs while closing older facilities. Michigan's pharma employment did face continued challenges, though the state has since developed some biotech presence through universities and smaller companies.

The broader industry trend toward biotech hubs accelerated. Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco Bay Area, and San Diego continued expanding as major life sciences clusters, while traditional pharma centers in New Jersey and elsewhere saw ongoing consolidation.

Eli Lilly remained headquartered in Indianapolis and continued successful drug development, including diabetes treatments like Trulicity (approved 2014) and cancer drugs. The company's location strategy largely worked due to strong talent retention and cost advantages.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about geographic consolidation**: The article suggests that drug companies in isolated locations face greater risks. This proved partly true—while consolidation hit many companies, Lilly's continued success in Indianapolis showed that strong company culture and financial incentives can overcome geographic isolation. The broader trend did favor hub locations, particularly for smaller biotech companies dependent on talent mobility.

• **Implicit prediction about career risks**: The concern about Michigan scientists facing limited options proved warranted for some traditional pharma roles, but the industry overall saw growth in biotech startups and contract research organizations that created alternative opportunities, sometimes in different geographic regions.

• **Prediction about Pfizer's direction**: The article suggests Pfizer's cuts followed a logical pattern. This continued—Pfizer engaged in nearly two decades of restructuring, acquisitions, and portfolio optimization, constantly adjusting its R&D footprint and site strategy to maximize efficiency and refocus on growth areas.

• **Biotech hub concentration**: The article identifies key clusters correctly, and these locations continued dominating biotech innovation and investment through the 2010s and beyond, with Boston and San Francisco becoming even more dominant as venture capital and talent concentrated there.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article provides useful contemporaneous insight into pharmaceutical industry geography and consolidation strategies of the mid-2000s, capturing genuine concerns about research site rationalization and career impacts. However, its narrow focus on facility closures and location strategy, while practical for industry insiders then, offers limited broader scientific or medical advancement insights. The piece has moderate historical value for understanding pharma business strategy evolution but lacks lasting significance for biotechnology innovation or drug discovery science.
