# MacArthur Awards in Chemistry (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This short article from September 2013 congratulates Phil Baran of Scripps Research for receiving a MacArthur Foundation "genius grant." The piece notes that such awards are relatively rare in chemistry and references three previous chemistry recipients: Carolyn Bertozzi at Berkeley, Laura Kiessling at Wisconsin, and Melanie Sanford at Michigan. The article presents these as noteworthy recognition of excellence in the chemistry field.

## 2. HISTORY
The MacArthur Fellowships awarded in 2013 proved to be remarkably prescient in identifying impactful scientific careers:

**Phil Baran** continued his pioneering work in synthetic organic chemistry at Scripps, developing innovative methods for complex molecule synthesis that have been widely adopted in pharmaceutical and industrial chemistry. His contributions to streamlining synthetic routes have had practical applications in drug discovery.

**Carolyn Bertozzi** went on to achieve even greater recognition, winning the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her development of bioorthogonal chemistry and click chemistry applications. Her work fundamentally transformed how scientists study biological systems and has been extensively adopted in drug development, particularly for targeted therapies.

**Laura Kiessling** continued her influential research in chemical biology at Wisconsin and MIT, with her work on carbohydrate recognition having implications for understanding diseases and developing therapeutics.

**Melanie Sanford** maintained her position as a leading figure in organometallic chemistry at Michigan, with her methodology developments continuing to influence synthetic approaches.

The recognition of these chemists by the MacArthur Foundation proved to have strong predictive value for long-term scientific impact.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this brief congratulatory article, which primarily served to acknowledge accomplishments rather than forecast future developments. The article's implicit suggestion was that MacArthur recognition indicates exceptional potential, which the subsequent scientific achievements of these researchers validated.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

This is a short news item of limited scope, noteworthy mainly as a historical marker of recognition for scientists who later achieved greater acclaim. Its interest lies primarily in documenting early recognition of what became highly impactful careers.
