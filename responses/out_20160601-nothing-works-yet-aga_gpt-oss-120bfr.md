# Nothing Works (Yet) Against Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article argued that, as of mid‑2016, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) still had no proven therapy. It recounted the recent failures of two exon‑skipping approaches: **drisapersen** (Prosensa/BioMarin) – abandoned after missing primary endpoints in its pivotal trial and after BioMarin’s costly acquisition – and **ataluren** (PTC Therapeutics) – approved in the European Union for nonsense‑mutation DMD but rejected by the U.S. FDA. The author focused on **eteplirsen** (Sarepta), which was then under FDA review, and expressed strong skepticism that the drug demonstrated any meaningful efficacy. The piece warned against a regulatory shift that would lower the efficacy bar, suggesting such a move would open the door to “grape‑juice‑type” supplements being marketed without proof of benefit.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Drisapersen** – After the 2015 FDA advisory committee voted against approval, BioMarin halted development in late 2015 and formally discontinued the program in 2016. No further clinical work has been pursued.

**Ataluren (Translarna)** – Gained conditional marketing authorization in the EU (2014) for nonsense‑mutation DMD and remains available in several European countries. The FDA has repeatedly declined to approve it (most recently in 2022), citing insufficient evidence of clinical benefit. The drug is now being explored for cystic fibrosis and other rare diseases, but it has not become a standard DMD therapy in the United States.

**Eteplirsen** – Received accelerated approval from the FDA in September 2016 based on a surrogate endpoint (increased dystrophin expression) despite the controversy highlighted in the article. In 2020 the FDA’s advisory committee reaffirmed the approval after a confirmatory trial (the “Phase III” study) showed a modest slowing of decline in the 6‑minute walk test, though the data remain debated. The drug is now marketed in the U.S. as **Exondys 51** and is covered by many insurers for patients amenable to exon 51 skipping (≈13 % of DMD cases).

**Other exon‑skipping agents** – Since 2016, Sarepta has added **viltolarsen** (exon 53, approved 2020 in the U.S.) and **golodirsen** (exon 53, approved 2021). **Casimersen** (exon 45) received accelerated approval in 2021. These drugs broaden the proportion of patients who can receive an exon‑skipping therapy to roughly 30 % of the DMD population.

**Gene‑therapy breakthrough** – In June 2023 the FDA approved **Elevidys** (delandistrogene moxeparvovec, an AAV9‑delivered micro‑dystrophin construct) for patients aged 4 years and older with a confirmed DMD mutation. This marked the first gene‑replacement therapy for DMD and the first FDA approval of an AAV‑based micro‑dystrophin product. Early post‑marketing data show durable expression of micro‑dystrophin and a slowing of functional decline, though long‑term safety (e.g., immune reactions, liver toxicity) continues to be monitored.

**CRISPR‑based approaches** – Early‑phase trials using CRISPR‑Cas9 to excise exon 51 (Editas) and base‑editing strategies (Scribe) have entered human testing (2022‑2024). Results are still pending; no CRISPR therapy has yet received regulatory approval.

**Regulatory stance** – The FDA has **not** moved to a “safety‑only” approval paradigm. The agency continues to require at least some evidence of clinical benefit (or a validated surrogate) for accelerated approvals, and it maintains post‑marketing confirmatory requirements.

**Industry impact** – The exon‑skipping market has grown to > $1 billion in annual sales worldwide (Exondys 51, Vyondys 53, Amondys 45). Gene‑therapy pricing (Elevidys ≈ $3.2 million per patient) sparked debate but also attracted substantial investment in AAV platforms for muscular diseases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *Drisapersen would ultimately fail and be written off.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. Development stopped in 2016 after FDA rejection; BioMarin wrote off the investment.

- **Prediction:** *Ataluren would not be approved in the U.S.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The FDA has consistently denied approval through 2024.

- **Prediction:** *Eteplirsen would be denied because of insufficient efficacy.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. The FDA granted **accelerated** approval in 2016 despite the author’s concerns, but the decision remained controversial and required confirmatory data. The drug stays on the market, but its efficacy is still debated.

- **Prediction:** *If the FDA lowered the efficacy bar, “grape‑juice‑type” supplements would flood the market.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. The FDA has maintained efficacy requirements; no regulatory shift toward safety‑only approvals has occurred.

- **Implicit prediction:** *No truly disease‑modifying therapy would be available in the near term.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely false. By 2023 a gene‑replacement therapy (Elevidys) received full approval, representing the first disease‑modifying treatment that restores dystrophin expression at a clinically meaningful level.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment of regulatory and scientific tension in DMD therapy development; its critique of efficacy standards remains relevant, especially in light of later approvals that both validated and challenged those standards.
