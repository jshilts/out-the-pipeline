# The Case of Marathon Pharmaceuticals (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article criticizes Marathon Pharmaceuticals for obtaining FDA approval for deflazacort, a corticosteroid for treating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The author argues this was a cynical exploitation of regulatory incentives. Marathon did not invent deflazacort, which had been available internationally since the 1990s and used off-label by U.S. patients who imported it from Canada. The company conducted a small clinical trial in 29 patients and received significant rewards: a Priority Review Voucher (valuable and transferable), seven years of market exclusivity, and the ability to charge U.S. patients 50 to 100 times the previous price for the imported generic. The piece links this strategy to other "non-research" companies like Catalyst Pharmaceuticals and calls for Congress to revise FDA incentives—such as market exclusivity and priority review vouchers for old, repurposed compounds—to prevent such regulatory arbitrage.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication, events validated many of the author's concerns and led to concrete outcomes:

**Marathon's withdrawal and transfer of deflazacort:**
- Following intense public and political backlash over the proposed list price (around \$89,000/year), Marathon announced in February 2017—just days after FDA approval—that it would pause the U.S. launch and ultimately sold the drug to PTC Therapeutics in August 2017.
- PTC Therapeutics relaunched deflazacort as Emflaza in 2017 at a revised list price of approximately \$35,000/year (still far above historical import prices but significantly lower than Marathon's initial proposal).

**Clinical acceptance:**
- Emflaza (deflazacort) did become an FDA-approved standard of care for DMD in the U.S. and is widely prescribed. The approval supported insurance coverage for a steroid option alongside prednisone, with some clinicians and patient groups recognizing the value of an approved, reimbursed therapy.
- However, the drug remains a corticosteroid providing modest functional benefits rather than disease modification; it does not alter the underlying pathology and carries typical steroid side effects (weight gain, behavioral effects, growth suppression). Other mechanism-based therapies (e.g., exon-skipping agents, gene therapies) have since also gained approvals and uptake where applicable.

**Outcome for the Priority Review Voucher:**
- The Priority Review Voucher was **reportedly sold by Marathon for \$125 million** (or a similar high-value amount), confirming the article's assessment of these vouchers as highly valuable, liquid assets that incentivize regulatory arbitrage.

**Regulatory and policy responses:**
- In 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decided *Catalyst Pharmaceuticals v. FDA*. Catalyst had obtained orphan exclusivity for its own drug (Firdapse, amifampridine) for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and sued when the FDA approved a competing amifampridine product (Ruzurgi) for pediatric LEMS patients. The court ruling effectively narrowed the FDA's discretion to approve competing products during exclusivity periods.
- While this ruling does not directly address deflazacort, it heightened scrutiny of FDA's market exclusivity policies for older, repurposed drugs and sparked debate about balancing incentives with accessibility and generic entry.
- More broadly, high-profile instances of price increases on older, unpatented drugs (e.g., Turing's Daraprim, catalyzed by Martin Shkreli) and cases like Marathon contributed to sustained policy discussions around drug pricing, rebate reform, and anticompetitive practices, though comprehensive federal pricing legislation has remained elusive.

**Business trajectory of the firms cited:**
- Marathon Pharmaceuticals effectively exited the deflazacort space after the sale to PTC. PTC Therapeutics has continued to market Emflaza; its patient-access programs helped moderate uptake, but the episode underscored how orphan incentives can be used to reprice long-available medicines.
- Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (now part of Avadel Pharmaceuticals) continued to face criticism for exclusivity strategies around Firdapse versus compounded 3,4-DAP, with ongoing disputes over pricing and access for LEMS patients.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **Prediction that Marathon would make a large profit from these legal maneuvers.**
  - **Outcome:** Partially realized, then redirected. Marathon did not retain the drug but profited significantly by selling it and likely monetizing the Priority Review Voucher for hundreds of millions of dollars (e.g., the voucher alone reportedly fetched \$125 million). PTC Therapeutics acquired the asset and generated revenue, indicating the underlying business model remained viable at a lower price.

- **Prediction that the FDA's loose handling of old generic compounds would draw criticism and make the rest of the drug industry look greedy.**
  - **Outcome:** Realized. The Marathon case became a high-profile example of regulatory arbitrage, triggering intense media coverage, congressional scrutiny, and public anger. It was frequently cited alongside Turing's Daraprim and Mylan's EpiPen controversies as emblematic of pharmaceutical pricing excesses.

- **Prediction that the Priority Review Voucher program could be exploited and that Congress might need to reform incentives.**
  - **Outcome:** Partially realized. While the voucher program was not eliminated, its existence and value continued to be criticized as incentivizing "shenanigan" approvals. Legislative proposals and policy discussions aimed at limiting vouchers or changing eligibility criteria gained traction, and later guidance clarified clinical data requirements to curb purely paper-based approvals. However, no major overhaul occurred, and vouchers remain valuable assets.

- **Prediction that Marathon and similar firms were not real R&D companies and existed primarily to game legal systems.**
  - **Outcome:** Largely validated. Marathon divested and ceased independent operations in this area. The broader phenomenon of "portfolio companies" specializing in acquiring old drugs and exploiting orphan or voucher incentives persisted, leading to ongoing policy debates reflected in FDA guidance and proposed legislation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

Reasoning: This article correctly identifies a recurring pathology in the biopharma regulatory landscape—exploiting orphan drug incentives and Priority Review Vouchers to reprice long-available medicines—with specific, high-impact examples and a clear policy critique. The subsequent events (Marathon's withdrawal, the \$125M voucher sale, PTC's relaunch, ongoing political fallout) validate its analysis in concrete ways. Its focus is narrow (a single case), but the Marathon episode became emblematic of a broader pricing and regulatory failure.
