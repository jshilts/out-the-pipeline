# Rogue Biologics Production (And Bonus Ignorance) (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 blog post from Science Magazine's "Pipeline" column discusses the discovery by the UK's MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) of an unlicensed biologics manufacturing operation in a Cambridgeshire warehouse. The facility was producing gcMAF (Gc protein-derived macrophage activating factor), an unapproved blood factor being marketed as a cancer and HIV cure. Investigators found the operation used blood plasma labeled "Not to be administered to humans," failed to meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards, and raised sterility concerns. Over 10,000 vials were seized. The author compares this to the contemporaneous boom in unregulated HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) sales in the US, promoted as a weight-loss aid despite lacking evidence of efficacy. The article connects these examples to broader public misunderstanding of science, particularly how terms like "homeopathic" and "herbal" are misconstrued as meaning "natural and safe" rather than understanding what homeopathy actually claims to be. The author argues this scientific illiteracy enables fraudulent marketing of unproven treatments.

## 2. HISTORY
**GcMAF developments after 2015:**
- The Milton, Cambridgeshire facility was run by David Noakes, who fled to France after the raid. In 2016, French authorities arrested him, and he was eventually extradited back to the UK in 2018.
- In November 2018, Noakes pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court to charges including manufacturing and supplying an unlicensed medicine, money laundering, and concealing criminal property. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison.
- Noakes had operated through multiple companies, including Immuno Biotech Ltd, which sold gcMAF products claiming to treat cancer, autism, and HIV/AIDS. The scale of operation was substantial—investigators found approximately $2.3 million in bank accounts and evidence of sales to over 10,000 customers in more than 50 countries between 2009-2015.
- The MHRA continued warnings about gcMAF in subsequent years. In 2017, they warned against gcMAF products from a Greek company called IOI-EU GmbH.
- Subsequent legitimate research on macrophage activation therapies has not resulted in FDA-approved gcMAF drugs. While macrophage biology remains an active research area in immunology, gcMAF itself has not demonstrated clinical efficacy in rigorous trials.
- The criminal case became a prominent example used by regulators internationally to illustrate the dangers of unlicensed biologics.

**HCG diet industry developments:**
- In December 2016, the FDA issued warning letters to companies marketing HCG weight-loss products, stating: "These products are not FDA-approved, and there is no substantial evidence that they are effective for weight loss."
- Multiple companies were forced to remove HCG products from the market or rebrand them without HCG claims.
- The FTC has brought enforcement actions against HCG marketers for false advertising.
- HCG as a weight-loss aid remains scientifically unsubstantiated. Clinical studies consistently show no benefit beyond placebo, and the weight loss achieved on HCG diets is attributable solely to the very low-calorie diet component (typically 500 calories/day).
- While HCG is FDA-approved for specific medical uses (fertility treatments, certain hormone deficiencies), it is not approved for weight management.

**Regulatory outcomes:**
- The case contributed to increased scrutiny of online sales of unlicensed medicines, particularly biologics.
- International cooperation between regulatory agencies improved for tracking cross-border sales of unapproved treatments.
- Public education campaigns by regulatory agencies have continued to warn consumers about unproven cancer "cures" and weight-loss supplements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about specific future outcomes, but rather commentary on the broader phenomenon of scientific illiteracy enabling fraudulent medical products. The implicit expectation was that such problems would continue without better public education.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article proved prescient in highlighting the growing problem of unregulated biologics and the challenge of scientific misinformation, with the gcMAF case becoming a significant international criminal prosecution that underscored the real dangers of unlicensed medical products. The broader themes about scientific illiteracy enabling health fraud remain highly relevant today.
