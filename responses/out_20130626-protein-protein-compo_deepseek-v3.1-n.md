# Protein-Protein Compounds - The Flip Side (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the under-explored concept of small molecules that enhance rather than inhibit protein-protein interactions—the "flip side" of the classic protein-protein inhibitor field. While protein-protein inhibitors target the challenging "undruggable" space, the author notes that compounds promoting tighter protein-protein binding represent an even more neglected area, with FK506 (tacrolimus) being the most well-characterized example among mostly natural products. The piece suggests that this mechanism lacks synthetic drug discovery efforts due to its novelty and difficulty, proposes potential screening assays using FRET or biophysical methods (NMR, SPR), and notes that endogenous small molecules working via this mechanism appear to be evolutionarily rare. The final update highlights a recent literature example, encouraging further exploration of this unexplored area.

## 2. HISTORY
In the decade following this 2013 article, the field of protein-protein interaction stabilizers has seen modest but concrete progress. **Immunophilin-based compounds** like FK506 and cyclosporine (mentioned implicitly) have become widely used **FDA-approved drugs** for organ transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases, demonstrating that this mechanism can achieve clinical success with substantial patient uptake—though these were discovered before 2013, their widespread adoption continued. 

**Structural insights** advanced significantly: the mechanisms of molecular glues became better understood, and **cryo-EM structural biology** enabled more detailed characterization of PPI-stabilizing complexes. Several **clinical candidates and approved drugs** demonstrate this mechanism: **thalidomide analogs (IMiDs)** for multiple myeloma—lenalidomide and pomalidomide—were later shown to function partly by stabilizing interactions (CRBN-CRL4), contributing to their efficacy; they remain widely prescribed. **Rapalogs** (e.g., temsirolimus, everolimus), working via FKBP stabilization, became widely used in oncology. **Spliceosome modulators** such as H3B-8800 and related compounds have been developed to stabilize protein-RNA complexes, with some entering clinical trials for hematologic malignancies.

**New chemical matter**: While synthetic PPI stabilizers remain challenging, **induced proximity platforms** gained momentum—**PROTACs** use heterobifunctional molecules to stabilize interactions between target proteins and E3 ligases, and companies like Arvinas and Kymera advanced clinical candidates; PROTACs create stabilized ternary complexes to induce protein degradation. **Molecular glue discovery platforms** emerged at companies like Monte Rosa Therapeutics and Novartis, advancing cancer therapeutic candidates into clinical development.

Public policy and research funding support increased, with NIH and other agencies funding PPI modulation research. As of the present time, while PPI stabilizers remain a minority of drug discovery portfolios, concrete examples now show the mechanism can yield approved drugs and clinical candidates, justifying some of the article's cautious optimism.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"Very few drug research organizations have been brave enough to tackle a mechanism like this, so you're not going to see many examples of synthetic compounds"**
  - **Outcome**: Mostly accurate. A modest number of synthetic PPI stabilizers exist, including spliceosome modulators, while major clinical examples remain largely natural product-inspired (IMiDs, rapalogs) or PROTAC-based. Synthetic stabilizers are less common than inhibitors.

• **"You would want a lot of structural information..."** 
  - **Outcome**: Fully realized. Cryo-EM and advanced NMR enabled routine high-resolution structural analysis of protein complexes, becoming standard tools for understanding and designing PPI modulators.

• **Opportunities for targets not being recognized**
  - **Outcome**: Partly validated. PROTACs and molecular glues created new therapeutic opportunities by stabilizing interactions with E3 ligases and other proteins. Induced proximity expanded druggability.

• **Implication that this is harder than conventional targets and gains-of-function are difficult**
  - **Outcome**: Accurate reflection of the field, as the number of PPI stabilizer drugs remains lower than inhibitors.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a genuinely underappreciated area of drug discovery whose importance grew with PROTACs and induced proximity therapeutics.
