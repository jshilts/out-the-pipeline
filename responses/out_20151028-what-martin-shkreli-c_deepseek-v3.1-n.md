# What Martin Shkreli Is Counting On (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary examines Martin Shkreli's business model of dramatically increasing prices on old drugs like Daraprim by drawing parallels to the similar case of Makena, a progesterone formulation for preterm labor prevention. The author describes the FDA's market exclusivity program that grants companies several years of monopoly protection if they bring old, unregulated drugs into the modern regulatory framework through proper trials. In the case of Makena, KV Pharmaceuticals obtained exclusivity and raised the price by approximately 100-fold compared to the previously available compounded versions.

Despite FDA intervention allowing compounding pharmacies to continue offering cheaper alternatives, and despite public outrage at the price increase, Makena continued to generate approximately \$250 million in annual sales at over 40 times the price of compounded versions, while compounded alternatives captured only two-thirds of the market. The author analyzes this through Milton Friedman's framework of spending decisions, arguing that when insurance companies spend "someone else's money on someone else," they lack the incentive to choose cost-effective options, creating a broken market. The commentary suggests Shkreli anticipates similar dynamics will protect his Daraprim pricing strategy.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication in October 2015, subsequent developments largely validated the author's analysis while also bringing significant complications:

**Shkreli's Daraprim and Legal Outcome:**
Martin Shkreli's company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, did raise Daraprim from \$13.50 to \$750 per pill (approximately a 5000% increase). Despite widespread public outrage, Shkreli initially maintained the pricing strategy. However, the situation diverged from the Makena precedent in several ways: Shkreli was arrested in December 2015 on securities fraud charges unrelated to pharmaceutical pricing, and was convicted in 2017. He was sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to forfeit \$7.4 million. (He died in prison in 2022.)

The drug itself remained expensive. The FDA approved a generic version of pyrimethamine (the active ingredient in Daraprim) in 2020 from another manufacturer, creating competition that lowered prices. However, the generic entered the market more than four years after Shkreli's price hike, during which time the drug remained expensive.

**Makena's Continued Trajectory:**
The Makena story continued as the article predicted financially but eventually faced regulatory reckoning. AMAG Pharmaceuticals (which had acquired the drug) continued to generate significant revenue from Makena well into the late 2010s, maintaining the price premium over compounded alternatives. However, in 2019-2020, a large confirmatory trial (PROLONG study) failed to demonstrate that Makena provided benefits for preventing recurrent preterm birth compared to placebo. In response, the FDA began proceedings to withdraw approval for the drug, culminating in the agency officially removing Makena from the market in April 2023.

This demonstrates that while the economic model of relying on regulatory exclusivity and insurance payment inertia worked initially, the underlying scientific evidence ultimately determined long-term market viability when post-approval confirmatory studies failed to verify effectiveness.

**Market and Policy Developments:**
The public outrage generated by these cases contributed to broader scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. Several policy measures have been implemented or proposed, though comprehensive reform remains elusive. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included provisions allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for certain medications, representing the most significant federal intervention into drug pricing to date, though this remains limited in scope.

Increased FDA attention to compounded medications and efforts to balance patient access with regulatory oversight have continued, alongside ongoing discussions about reforming the exclusivity framework to prevent such extreme pricing scenarios while maintaining incentives for bringing older drugs into modern regulatory compliance.

**Insurance Behavior Confirmed:**
The article's analysis of third-party payment dynamics was largely validated. Insurance companies often default to approving the FDA-approved brand rather than compounded alternatives, and the psychological and administrative cost of challenging individual high-priced medications leads to "rolling their eyes and just paying up." This continues to represent a structural issue in pharmaceutical markets where bulk purchasing agreements and formulary negotiations don't address outlier drugs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"Some insurance payers and health systems will just shrug and pay up"** ✓ **Largely accurate**. Subsequent research and market behavior confirmed that many payers continued to cover expensive drugs rather than navigate administrative and legal challenges to steer patients toward compounded alternatives.

• **Shkreli's business model would succeed due to insurance inertia** ✓ **Partially accurate in the short term**. The model did hold through Shkreli's legal troubles, with the drug remaining expensive for years. However, **the prediction didn't account for** the criminal indictment for securities fraud that removed him from the picture, nor the eventual FDA approval of a true generic competitor in 2020.

• **The system creating these incentives would remain broken** ⚠️ **Mixed outcome**. While the fundamental dynamics persist, some policy changes occurred (IRA negotiation provisions), and the Makena withdrawal demonstrates that inadequate evidence can ultimately end a product's market viability even when pricing strategies work financially.

• **Makena would continue to do "just great"** ✓ **Accurate for the medium term**. The drug generated significant revenue for several more years, but ⚖️ **the prediction didn't extend far enough** to capture the 2019 trial failure and 2023 market withdrawal, showing that regulatory exclusivity can't permanently protect products with insufficient scientific evidence.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

This article demonstrated strong analytical insight by correctly identifying the structural market failure in pharmaceutical pricing—specifically the disconnect between who pays and who benefits creating distorted incentives. The comparison was prescient and the framework of economic decision-making accurately predicted subsequent behavior patterns. While some specific outcomes (like Shkreli's imprisonment) couldn't have been predicted, the core thesis about insurance payment inertia and broken market incentives was validated by real-world developments. The piece successfully identified a recurring pattern in pharmaceutical markets with long-term relevance.
