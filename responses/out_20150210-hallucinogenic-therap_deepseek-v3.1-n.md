# Hallucinogenic Therapy (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a New Yorker article on the revival of psychiatric treatment using psychedelic drugs. The piece notes that this field was active in the 1950s and 1960s but became dormant due to legal, cultural, and funding difficulties, exacerbated by overselling and Timothy Leary's departure from rigorous scientific methodology. Current studies are investigating psychedelics like psilocybin for treating patients with major depression, severe cancer-related distress, and addiction. The author acknowledges that participants describe these experiences as life-changing, while maintaining a naturalistic view that the effects stem from altered neural firing rather than supernatural phenomena. The commentary argues that since existing psychiatric medications work by altering neurotransmitter systems, psilocybin represents merely a more dramatic intervention on the same pathways, and should be investigated systematically given the significant unmet need in mental health treatment.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2015, the field has experienced substantial growth and regulatory progress. **FDA recognition**: In 2018, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression, and later to MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. **Clinical trial results**: Multiple Phase 2 trials have demonstrated efficacy. Compass Pathways' phase 2b trial (2021) showed psilocybin produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression. MAPS completed successful Phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD (2021), showing 67% of participants no longer met PTSD criteria after treatment. **Regulatory pathways**: Both psilocybin and MDMA-assisted therapies are progressing toward FDA approval, with projections for potential approval by 2024-2025. **Legal changes**: Oregon legalized psilocybin therapy in supervised settings (Measure 109, 2020), becoming the first state to do so. Colorado followed with similar legislation (2022). **Institutional investment**: Major research centers like Johns Hopkins and Imperial College London have established dedicated psychedelic research centers. **Commercial development**: Companies like Compass Pathways, Atai Life Sciences, and MindMed have gone public, attracting significant investment. **Psychiatric integration**: Several countries and jurisdictions have begun developing regulatory frameworks for therapeutic use, though widespread clinical adoption remains limited pending full FDA approval.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was largely observational and historical rather than predictive, so it contained few explicit forward-looking statements to evaluate against subsequent developments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This commentary captured the beginning of a significant paradigm shift in psychiatric treatment. The field has evolved from niche research to approaching mainstream medical acceptance, with multiple therapies advancing through FDA regulatory pathways and early legalization efforts. The article's balanced perspective on scientific investigation versus remaining grounded in neuroscience principles has proven prescient as the field has maintained mostly rigorous scientific standards while achieving remarkable clinical results. The ongoing tension between therapeutic potential and regulatory/social barriers remains highly relevant to current developments.
