# Reality, Here In This Little Dish (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the gap between early-stage cancer research announcements and realistic drug development outcomes. The author—writing from experience in cancer drug discovery—warns that many compounds show impressive activity against cancer cells in petri dishes but fail to translate to effective human therapies. The piece highlights that drug candidates often fail at two critical junctures: when tested in live animal models (mice) and, more significantly, when evaluated in human clinical trials. The author uses AstraZeneca's Iressa as a cautionary example—a drug that performed well in cell assays and animal models but showed limited efficacy in most actual patients. The central argument is that in vitro cell culture results are poor predictors of clinical success, and media coverage prematurely using terms like "cure" creates unrealistic public expectations about research findings.

## 2. HISTORY

The fundamental challenges identified in this 2007 article remain largely unchanged in oncology drug development. The "valley of death" between promising preclinical results and clinical success continues to plague the field, with approximately 90-95% of cancer drugs that enter human trials still failing to gain FDA approval.

AstraZeneca's Iressa (gefitinib), mentioned as a cautionary example, illustrates the article's thesis well. Approved by the FDA in 2003 for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Iressa showed modest overall response rates (around 10%) in unselected patients. Post-2007 developments revealed that Iressa's efficacy was concentrated in patients with specific EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations), representing about 10-15% of Western and 30-50% of Asian NSCLC patients. While this validated the importance of biomarker-based patient selection—as the article alluded to with "some of whom we can screen for"—it also confirmed the author's warning about unpredictable clinical translation.

The broader issue of poor predictivity has driven significant changes in drug development approaches since 2007. The rise of precision medicine, molecularly targeted therapies, and companion diagnostics has become central to oncology development. However, high failure rates persist: a 2018 analysis of cancer drug development from 2006-2015 showed that 3.4% of agents entering Phase I ultimately achieved FDA approval.

The cell culture research mentioned in the article (vanilloid agonists like capsaicin) did not lead to approved cancer therapies, though some research in this area continued. The gap between promising in vitro results and clinical reality remains a defining challenge in oncology drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The author warned that compounds showing efficacy in cell cultures and mouse models would continue to fail at high rates in human trials.
  ***Outcome**: **Accurate**. Failure rates remain extremely high. Studies from 2006-2015 show only 3.4% of cancer drugs entering Phase I ultimately achieve FDA approval, validating the author's caution about the gap between preclinical promise and clinical reality.

- **Prediction**: The problem of poor predictivity from cell cultures would persist despite "crazy expenditures of time, money, and brainpower."
  ***Outcome**: **Accurate**. While advances have been made in cell culture techniques (organoids, 3D cultures, patient-derived cells), the fundamental challenge remains. The industry has shifted toward better preclinical models but has not solved the core predictivity problem.

- **Prediction**: Iressa would remain a cautionary example of a drug that worked in assays and animals but failed in most patients.
  ***Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. Iressa did prove effective in biomarker-selected patients with EGFR mutations, leading to its continued use in this subset. However, the broader principle—that promising preclinical results don't guarantee broad clinical success—was validated, and Iressa's limited efficacy in unselected populations made it emblematic of the predictivity challenge.

- **Prediction**: Researchers and companies would continue needing to "be careful even then" when human trials data come back.
  ***Outcome**: **Accurate**. Post-marketing surveillance has revealed unexpected toxicities and limited real-world effectiveness for many approved cancer drugs. Even FDA-approved oncology drugs often show smaller real-world benefits than suggested by registration trials.

- **Prediction**: Media would continue hyping early-stage results with "cure" language.
  ***Outcome**: **Accurate**. This pattern has continued, with press releases and media coverage frequently overstating preliminary findings. The phenomenon has even been studied systematically, showing persistent gaps between scientific findings and media representations.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article remains relevant as a clear-eyed critique of the persistent gap between cancer research hype and clinical reality, written by someone with direct drug discovery experience. While the specific examples are dated (Iressa is no longer central to NSCLC treatment), the core problem continues to define oncology drug development today.
