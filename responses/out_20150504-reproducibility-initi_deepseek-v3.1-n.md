# The Reproducibility Initiative Weighs In (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the results from the Reproducibility Initiative's first major project examining 100 experimental psychology studies. The key finding was that 61 of the 100 papers did not replicate under the Initiative's preselected criteria, though 24 of those produced "broadly similar" results to the original findings. This suggested that somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of recent experimental psychology literature did not hold up to replication.

The author contextualizes this by mentioning the well-known "Amgen paper" on irreproducibility in oncology literature and notes that the Reproducibility Initiative was also undertaking a similar replication effort for cancer biology. The author speculates that organic chemistry would likely show better reproducibility rates than either psychology or cancer biology, estimating rates "solidly over fifty per cent" for top-tier chemistry journals, but acknowledges that reproducibility would likely be worse for lower-tier chemistry publications.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this May 2015 article, several significant developments occurred in reproducibility research:

**Cancer Biology Replication Project**: The cancer biology reproducibility study that the author mentioned was indeed completed. Published in 2017 in *eLife*, this project attempted to replicate 50 high-impact preclinical cancer studies. The results showed a similarly concerning picture to what was seen in psychology - only about 46% of the key findings could be replicated, and even when studies did replicate, the effect sizes were on average about 85% smaller than originally reported. This demonstrated that the reproducibility crisis was not confined to psychology but extended across biomedical research.

**Institutional and Policy Responses**: These replication failures catalyzed significant changes in research practices and publication policies. Many journals, including *Nature* and *Science*, began requiring data availability statements and more detailed methodology sections. The NIH implemented new rigor and reproducibility requirements for grant applications. Organizations like the Center for Open Science promoted preregistration of studies to prevent questionable research practices.

**Continued Replication Efforts**: The Reproducibility Initiative evolved and continued its work, with additional studies examining reproducibility in fields like economics and social sciences. Meta-research (research on research) became an established field, with dedicated journals and conferences examining the systemic causes of irreproducibility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author predicted that "we're eventually going to get a more in-depth look" at cancer biology reproducibility through the Reproducibility Initiative.
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Correct**. The cancer biology replication project was completed and published in 2017, providing exactly the "solid data" the author anticipated.

• **Prediction**: The author speculated that organic chemistry would show "solidly over fifty per cent" reproducibility, and would fare better than experimental psychology or cancer biology due to "fewer variables."
  - **Outcome**: **Not directly tested**. No systematic large-scale replication study of organic chemistry has been published to date. However, preliminary evidence from smaller studies suggests chemistry may indeed have higher reproducibility rates, though the field is not immune to the problem.

• **Prediction**: The author "feel sure" that reproducing papers from lower-tier chemistry journals (Organic Letters, Tetrahedron Letters, Synthetic Communications) would go "not as well" as from top-tier journals.
  - **Outcome**: **Plausible but unverified**. While intuitive and consistent with findings in other fields, no systematic study has specifically tested this hierarchy hypothesis in chemistry.

• **Prediction**: The author thought that comparable lower-tier journals in psychology or biology "would fare even worse."
  - **Outcome**: **Partially supported**. Later research generally confirmed that lower-tier journals in most fields tend to have higher rates of irreproducible findings, though the specific comparative claim wasn't systematically tested.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured the early phase of a major paradigm shift in how science understands its own reliability. The reproducibility crisis fundamentally changed research practices across multiple disciplines and led to lasting policy reforms in major funding agencies and journals.
