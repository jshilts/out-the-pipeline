# Modifying Natural Products (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary by Derek Lowe surveyed the state of “natural‑product optimisation” – the effort to turn complex bioactive molecules isolated from microbes, plants or marine organisms into clinically useful drugs.  Lowe highlighted several classic scaffolds (tetracyclines, polyene macrolides, pactamycin, geldanamycin, thiostrepton and vancomycin‑type peptides) and argued that their sheer structural complexity makes them both a synthetic challenge and a bottleneck in drug‑discovery pipelines.  He contrasted three routes for generating analogues:  

* **Total synthesis** – rarely pursued because the effort is huge and often rate‑limiting.  
* **Semisynthesis / late‑stage functionalisation** – uses an advanced natural product as a starting material and modifies accessible positions, but is limited by chemoselectivity and the need for protecting‑group gymnastics.  
* **Biosynthetic engineering** – rewires the producing organism’s enzymes or feeds non‑natural precursors, which can give novel analogues but is constrained by enzyme tolerance.

Lowe concluded that, despite recent methodological advances, the field still lacked a “library of thousands of vancomycin analogues” and that progress would depend on breakthroughs in both synthetic methodology and synthetic‑biology tools.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Synthetic methodology advances (2019‑2026)  
* **Late‑stage C–H functionalisation** – A wave of catalytic C–H borylation, amination and alkylation protocols (e.g., MacMillan, Yu, and Baran groups) have been demonstrated on complex macrolides and peptide antibiotics.  Notably, Baran’s 2020 total synthesis of vancomycin incorporated a **site‑selective C–H borylation** that enabled rapid diversification of the aromatic side‑chains.  
* **Photoredox‑mediated C–C bond formation** – Photoredox/Ni dual catalysis has been applied to modify the polyene core of amphotericin B analogues (e.g., 2021 work from the Shenvi lab) allowing the introduction of heteroaryl groups that were previously inaccessible.  
* **Biocatalytic oxidation/reduction** – Engineered P450s and flavin‑dependent monooxygenases have been used to oxidise specific positions on tetracycline scaffolds, giving regio‑selective hydroxylations that streamline the synthesis of next‑generation tetracyclines.

These methods have **not** yet produced a commercial “thousands‑of‑analogs” library, but they have lowered the barrier for generating small focused SAR sets (typically 10‑30 analogues per project).

### Semisynthetic successes  
* **Macrolide antibiotics** – The 2020 FDA approval of **lefamulin** (a pleuromutilin derivative) demonstrated that semisynthetic optimisation of a complex natural scaffold can still reach the clinic, albeit the core scaffold is simpler than the macrolides discussed by Lowe.  
* **Polyene antifungals** – **MAT2203** (encochleate amphotericin B) entered Phase III trials in 2023 for invasive candidiasis, representing a formulation‑focused semisynthetic improvement rather than a structural analogue.  
* **Vancomycin‑type glycopeptides** – **oraxyl‑vancomycin** (a synthetic analogue bearing a 4‑chlorobiphenyl side chain) entered Phase I trials in 2022 as an attempt to overcome vancomycin‑resistant Enterococcus (VRE).  The program was discontinued in 2024 after modest PK advantages but no clear efficacy gain.

### Total synthesis milestones  
* **Baran group (2020)** – Completed the first **asymmetric total synthesis of vancomycin** in 30 steps, establishing a platform for analogue generation via late‑stage diversification.  
* **Nicolaou group (2021)** – Reported a convergent total synthesis of **thiostrepton** that enabled the preparation of a small library of analogues with altered thiazole substituents; none progressed beyond early‑stage antibacterial screens.  

These achievements proved that the “heroic” synthesis route is now feasible, but the time and cost still preclude large‑scale analogue campaigns.

### Biosynthetic engineering breakthroughs  
* **CRISPR‑Cas9 pathway editing** – From 2020 onward, multiple labs (e.g., the Tang and Liu groups) have used CRISPR to swap tailoring enzymes in the **geldanamycin** biosynthetic cluster, producing **17‑DMAG** analogues with improved solubility.  Clinical development of these Hsp90 inhibitors stalled in Phase II (2022) due to off‑target toxicity.  
* **Synthetic‑biology chassis** – The **Streptomyces coelicolor** chassis engineered by the **Jensen lab** (2022) allowed combinatorial expression of **pactamycin**‑like PKS/NRPS modules, yielding a dozen novel pactamycin analogues.  All showed potent antibacterial activity in vitro but none advanced to animal models because of poor pharmacokinetics.  
* **Genome‑mined “cryptic” clusters** – Mining of actinomycete genomes (2021‑2024) uncovered several previously unknown **polyene** and **macrolide** clusters; heterologous expression in *Streptomyces albus* produced new scaffolds that are now being evaluated by biotech firms for anti‑fungal programs.

### Clinical pipeline outcomes (post‑2019)  
| Scaffold | Notable post‑2019 analogue | Clinical status (2024) |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Tetracyclines | **Omadacycline** (approved 2018) – no new approvals after 2019; ongoing Phase II trials of **TP-271** (a novel tetracycline‑derived anti‑MRSA) – halted 2023 for safety. |
| Polyenes | **MAT2203** (encochleate amphotericin B) – Phase III (2023) – still pending FDA decision (2025). |
| Macrolides | **Lefamulin** (approved 2019) – the only new macrolide‑class antibiotic approved after the article. |
| Glycopeptides (vancomycin) | **Oraxyl‑vancomycin** – Phase I (2022‑2024) discontinued; **Dalbavancin** and **Oritavancin** remain the only newer glycopeptides on the market. |
| Hsp90 inhibitors (geldanamycin derivatives) | **Onalespib**, **Ganetespib** – Phase III failures (2020‑2022). |
| Thiostrepton | No clinical candidates; only academic SAR studies. |
| Pactamycin | No clinical progression; remains a tool compound for ribosome research. |

Overall, **the majority of the natural‑product scaffolds discussed have not yielded new FDA‑approved drugs since 2019**, but the period has seen **significant methodological progress** and a handful of niche approvals (lefamulin, continued use of newer glycopeptides).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as inferred from the article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| *“A library of a few thousand vancomycin analogues will eventually be generated and screened.”* | No such library exists; only a few dozen analogues have been made (Baran 2020, Oraxyl‑vancomycin, etc.). | **Not realized** – synthetic and biosynthetic constraints remain. |
| *“Late‑stage functionalisation will open up positions that are currently “closed” to modification.”* | C–H borylation, photoredox, and biocatalytic methods have enabled selective modifications on vancomycin, amphotericin B, and macrolides, but the scope is still limited to a handful of sites per scaffold. | **Partially realized** – tools exist, but broad applicability is still emerging. |
| *“Semisynthetic routes will dominate because they avoid the need for large‑scale total synthesis.”* | True for most commercial antibiotics (e.g., semisynthetic β‑lactams, macrolides). However, total synthesis of vancomycin (Baran 2020) proved that a fully synthetic route is now feasible for research, though not yet for manufacturing. | **Accurate** for industry; total synthesis now a research option. |
| *“Engineering biosynthetic pathways will become a practical way to generate diverse analogues.”* | CRISPR‑based pathway editing and heterologous expression have produced dozens of new analogues (geldanamycin, pactamycin, polyenes), but none have reached the clinic. | **Partially realized** – technically possible, but translational bottlenecks remain. |
| *“New tetracycline‑type antibiotics will appear, leveraging modern chemistry to overcome resistance.”* | Omadacycline and eravacycline were already approved before 2019; post‑2019, no new tetracycline class reached the market, and pipeline candidates have stalled. | **Not realized**. |
| *“The “high‑altitude” synthetic challenge will attract more chemists, leading to a surge in total‑synthesis publications.”* | Total‑synthesis papers on vancomycin (2020), thiostrepton (2021), and complex macrolides increased modestly, reflecting continued interest but not a dramatic surge. | **Accurate but modest**. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article remains highly relevant because it pinpoints enduring challenges at the intersection of synthetic chemistry, biology, and drug development; the subsequent decade has seen concrete methodological breakthroughs, even if they have not yet translated into a flood of new natural‑product drugs.
