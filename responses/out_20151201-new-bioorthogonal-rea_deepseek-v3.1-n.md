# A New Bioorthogonal Reaction (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes a new bioorthogonal reaction reported by the Bertozzi lab at Stanford, involving the reduction of N-oxides to amines using diboron compounds. The key innovation was leveraging this reaction to create "turn-on" fluorescence: many fluorophores contain N,N-dialkylamine groups, and their N-oxide versions are nonfluorescent until the N-O bond is cleaved. The reaction proved to work cleanly in mammalian cells, with both the N-oxide pro-fluorophore and dipinacol diborane crossing cell membranes effectively. The system was successfully paired with HaloTag fusion proteins for targeted fluorescence activation and demonstrated to be orthogonal to other major intracellular labeling reactions (azide/cyclooctyne, tetrazine/cyclopropene, aminooxy-aldehyde), expanding the toolkit for multiplexed biological imaging.

## 2. HISTORY
This N-oxide/diboron bioorthogonal reaction represented an addition to the growing toolkit of biocompatible chemical reactions, but it has seen relatively modest adoption compared to more established bioorthogonal pairs like azide-cyclooctyne (SPAAC) or tetrazine-trans-cyclooctene (TCO) reactions. Subsequent developments in bioorthogonal chemistry have largely focused on improving kinetics, biocompatibility, and cellular delivery of reaction partners rather than adopting this N-oxide reduction approach broadly. The Bertozzi lab and field have continued advancing other bioorthogonal methodologies, particularly copper-free click chemistry variants and tetrazine ligations, which have achieved wider practical application in drug delivery, imaging, and chemical biology. While the N-oxide reaction demonstrated proof-of-concept, it has not become a widely adopted standard technique or led to significant commercial applications. The broader bioorthogonal chemistry field, however, has continued expanding with additional reaction pairs and finding applications in targeted therapies, with several clinical-stage programs incorporating bioorthogonal strategies, though not primarily relying on this specific N-oxide chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about the technology's future development or applications. The author characterized the research as "good stuff" and noted the potential for imaging work, but did not venture specific forecasts about adoption rates, commercial development, or clinical translation of this particular bioorthogonal reaction system.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4/9**

This article represents moderate scientific interest—it describes a legitimate technical advance in bioorthogonal chemistry from a leading lab, but the specific N-oxide reaction has had limited lasting impact compared to other bioorthogonal methodologies that became more widely adopted and translated into practical applications.
