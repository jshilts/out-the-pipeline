# A Cold-Weather Recipe, By Request: Onion Soup (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is not about biotechnology or pharmaceuticals at all - it's a recipe for French onion soup. The author begins by noting the lack of pharmaceutical news and decides to share cooking content instead. The recipe uses standard French onion soup preparation techniques: slowly caramelizing 3+ pounds of onions for at least 30 minutes, combining beef and chicken broth (recommending a 1:3 ratio), adding red wine and seasonings, and finishing with toasted bread and Swiss-type cheese under a broiler. The author provides detailed measurements, timing, and cooking tips based on Cooks Illustrated methodology.

## 2. HISTORY

This blog post was published as filler content during a holiday period when the author had no pharmaceutical industry news to report. The article had no subsequent scientific, medical, or biotech implications because it was purely culinary content. There were no approved drugs, clinical trials, regulatory changes, or business developments related to this content. The recipe did not lead to any pharmaceutical innovations, FDA approvals, or changes in public policy. The author continued their "In the Pipeline" blog, which maintained its focus on pharmaceutical industry coverage, while this particular post remained a lighthearted recipe diversion.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
