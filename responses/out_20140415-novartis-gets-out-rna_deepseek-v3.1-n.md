# Novartis Gets Out of RNAi (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reported Novartis's decision in April 2014 to exit RNA interference (RNAi) research, citing development difficulties and the limited number of disease areas where the technique appeared viable. The piece referenced similar exits by other major pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, suggesting that RNAi was proving better suited to smaller, specialized companies like Alnylam rather than large pharmaceutical firms requiring broad therapeutic pipelines. The author noted that while technological breakthroughs could change the landscape, Novartis had apparently been hoping for such advances without success.

## 2. HISTORY

Following Novartis's 2014 exit, the RNAi field experienced significant developments. **Alnylam achieved major milestones** with the FDA approval of ONPATTRO (patisiran) in 2018 for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis - the first-ever approved RNAi therapeutic. This was followed by GIVLAARI (givosiran) in 2019 for acute hepatic porphyria and OXLUMO (lumasiran) in 2020 for primary hyperoxaluria type 1. **Clinical implementation expanded** beyond rare diseases, with several RNAi drugs entering clinical trials for cardiovascular conditions, including inclisiran for hypercholesterolemia.

The **business landscape shifted dramatically**. Novartis's exit strategy partially reversed when the company later partnered with Alnylam, and pharmaceutical companies increasingly pursued partnerships rather than in-house development. The RNAi market grew substantially, with multiple approved therapies demonstrating actual patient uptake, particularly for rare genetic diseases where RNAi offered mechanism-based intervention previously unavailable. The **component analysis** remained true that RNAi initially found success in niche applications, though the range of treatable diseases did broaden beyond the limited scope mentioned in 2014.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: RNAi would remain better suited for smaller companies like Alnylam rather than large pharmaceutical firms
  - **Outcome**: Largely accurate initially. Alnylam did achieve the first approved RNAi drugs while large companies struggled. However, this proved temporary - pharmaceutical companies later pursued RNAi through partnerships and acquisitions, suggesting the field's maturity eventually accommodated multiple company sizes

• **Prediction**: The limited disease areas would constrain RNAi's broad application
  - **Outcome**: Partially inaccurate. While RNAi found initial success in rare genetic diseases (consistent with limited scope), the field expanded into cardiovascular, hepatic, and metabolic conditions, with inclisiran demonstrating broader therapeutic potential and commercial success

• **Prediction**: Technology breakthroughs would be needed for broader adoption
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Advances in delivery systems, stabilization chemistries, and targeted delivery mechanisms were crucial for moving beyond initial limitations and expanding the therapeutic window

• **Prediction**: Merck and Novartis exits indicated fundamental limitations
  - **Outcome**: Both companies later re-engaged with RNAi through partnerships and licensing deals, suggesting their initial exits reflected timing and pipeline strategy rather than fundamental technology limitations

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article captured a pivotal moment when major pharmaceutical companies were exiting RNAi research, yet this proved to be near the bottom of the field's trajectory. The subsequent approval of multiple RNAi therapies and the dramatic turnaround in industry engagement makes this a fascinating case study in therapeutic technology development cycles and the risks of strategic pivot timing.
