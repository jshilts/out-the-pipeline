# Novartis Loses the Glivec Patent Fight in India (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article analyzes the Indian Supreme Court's rejection of Novartis' patent application for the beta-crystalline form of imatinib mesylate (sold as Glivec/Gleevec). The central issue was India's Section 3(d) patent provision, which was enacted to prevent "evergreening"—the practice of extending patent protection through minor modifications of existing drugs. Section 3(d) requires that new forms of known compounds demonstrate enhanced therapeutic efficacy to be patentable, a higher bar than most international patent regimes.

Novartis had never held a patent for the original imatinib compound in India because Indian drug patents didn't exist when the drug was initially developed. When India joined the WTO and adopted intellectual property frameworks, Novartis sought a patent for the beta-crystalline polymorph, claiming it had superior flow properties, thermodynamic stability, and lower hygroscopicity. The Indian Supreme Court rejected this argument, noting that Novartis failed to provide data showing these chemical properties translated into actual therapeutic efficacy improvements. The court also observed that Novartis had been marketing "imatinib mesylate" in India since 2003 without specifying the beta-crystalline form on packaging, suggesting the therapeutic equivalence of different forms.

The article emphasizes this isn't the end of drug patents in India but rather establishes India as having one of the strictest patent regimes globally. The pricing of Glivec (reportedly $2,600/month versus $200/month for generics) was not supposed to factor into the legal decision, though public access concerns added context to the case.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 Supreme Court decision, several important developments occurred:

**Generic Competition and Access**: Indian generic manufacturers (notably Cipla, Natco, and others) rapidly expanded production of generic imatinib. Within months, prices dropped by over 90% in India, making treatment accessible to hundreds of thousands more patients. The decision was widely credited with maintaining India's role as "the pharmacy of the developing world."

**Legal Precedent and Section 3(d) Application**: The ruling established a firm precedent for Section 3(d) interpretation. Subsequent cases have consistently applied the enhanced efficacy standard, affecting other pharmaceutical companies seeking patents for incremental modifications. For instance, similar scrutiny was applied to patents for modified forms of other cancer drugs, HIV medications, and hepatitis treatments.

**International Trade Tensions**: The decision heightened tensions between India and pharmaceutical trade groups, particularly PhRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America). The U.S. Trade Representative placed India on its "Priority Watch List" for intellectual property concerns in multiple annual Special 301 Reports following the ruling. However, no major trade sanctions resulted, and diplomatic pressure didn't force changes to Section 3(d).

**Novartis' Response**: Novartis continued marketing Glivec in India despite the patent rejection, but at significantly reduced prices to compete with generics. The company also shifted its India strategy toward newer patented drugs and increased investment in clinical research in India while accepting the generics competition for imatinib.

**Broader R&D Impact**: The ruling didn't deter multinational pharmaceutical investment in India as some predicted. Instead, companies focused on developing truly novel drugs that would meet India's strict patent standards or pursued voluntary licensing agreements with generic manufacturers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction identified in article**: The author stated "We'll have to see how this works out in practice. India has a right, of course, to set its patent laws out in this way, but will it always work out like this when a section 3(d) issue comes up again?"

**Outcome**: Section 3(d) has been consistently applied in subsequent cases over the past decade, affecting multiple pharmaceutical companies. The standard has held firm and become a defining feature of India's intellectual property landscape.

**Prediction identified in article**: The author questioned whether this would "only be when it's a multinational company selling an expensive drug?"

**Outcome**: Section 3(d) has been applied uniformly across cases involving both multinational and Indian companies, including domestic pharmaceutical firms seeking patents for incremental innovations. The standard has proven to be substance-neutral rather than company-targeted.

**Bigger picture outcome**: The ruling didn't destroy pharmaceutical innovation in India as some feared. Instead, it created a distinct pathway where genuine innovation (new molecular entities with proven efficacy) receives patent protection, while encouraging generic competition for older drugs. This balance has arguably served public health interests while maintaining pharmaceutical industry presence in India.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This case represents a landmark intersection of intellectual property law, global health access, and pharmaceutical innovation policy. The ruling's influence extended far beyond this single drug, establishing India as a crucial test case for balancing patent protection with public health needs in developing countries, with ongoing implications for how the world approaches access to medicines.
