# A New Chemotherapy Idea (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2016 commentary discusses a Science Translational Medicine study from Moffitt Cancer Center and USF that proposed a radically different approach to chemotherapy dosing. Instead of the standard "hit it hard" paradigm, the researchers tested an evolutionary-based "adaptive therapy" strategy in mouse breast cancer models.

The key innovation was to start with high-dose paclitaxel but then titrate doses downward to maintain a stable tumor population where drug-sensitive cancer cells persist and compete with resistant cells. This approach exploited tumor heterogeneity and the concept that resistant cells often pay a metabolic penalty, making them less fit in competition with sensitive cells. In mouse xenograft models, this adaptive dosing led to long-term tumor control, with up to 80% of animals requiring only infrequent dosing every few weeks while maintaining stable disease. The method relied on monitoring via NMR imaging to guide dose adjustments.

The article noted this could have broader implications for drug discovery, potentially validating the development of "medium-efficacy" cancer drugs that might not pass traditional efficacy bars but could work well in adaptive therapy maintenance protocols.

## 2. HISTORY

The adaptive therapy concept described in this 2016 article has seen significant scientific interest and some clinical development, though translation to widespread clinical practice has been cautious and measured.

**Research Evolution and Clinical Trials:**
- The Moffitt team, led by Robert Gatenby and others, continued developing this approach, publishing follow-up studies on evolutionary-inspired therapy across various cancer types including ovarian cancer and prostate cancer
- Clinical trials have been initiated, particularly in prostate cancer (such as NCT02415621) testing intermittent/adaptive hormone therapy to exploit competition between sensitive and resistant cells
- The approach gained attention in the oncology community, with multiple research groups exploring evolutionary therapy principles
- The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on clinical trial timelines likely affected the pace of adaptive therapy trial completion

**Current Clinical Status:**
- As of 2024, widespread clinical adoption has not occurred yet - these concepts remain experimental rather than standard of care
- Adaptive therapy approaches have primarily stayed within the research setting, with most oncologists continuing to use conventional high-dose protocols
- No FDA approvals specifically for adaptive therapy protocols for breast cancer (the focus of the original study)
- The diagnostic monitoring requirements (such as the NMR imaging mentioned) remain technically challenging for routine clinical implementation

**Drug Discovery Impact:**
- The pharmaceutical industry has not substantially shifted toward developing "moderate efficacy" cancer drugs as suggested in the article
- Drug discovery remains focused on maximum efficacy, though combination therapies and maintenance regimens have evolved
- The adaptive therapy concept has influenced thinking about resistance management but hasn't fundamentally changed drug development paradigms

**Business/Commercial Outcomes:**
- No major therapeutic breakthroughs or blockbuster drugs emerged directly from this specific approach
- Most cancer drug approvals in the intervening years have followed traditional high-efficacy pathways
- Companies pursuing evolutionary therapy concepts remain relatively small or within academic contexts

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1:** *"I hope that this paper creates as much of a stir in the oncology community as it seems ready to"*
- **Outcome:** The paper did generate substantial discussion and follow-up research in the oncology community, with several research groups exploring evolutionary therapy concepts
- **Reality:** While scientifically influential, it did not "create a stir" in terms of immediate clinical practice changes or widespread adoption

**Prediction 2:** *"Doing a human trial like this is going to take some serve, but the potential benefits are large"*
- **Outcome:** Human trials were indeed initiated, but faced challenges including standard oncology resistance to departing from established protocols
- **Reality:** Initial trials proceeded but broad clinical adoption has been slow; the huge promised benefits remain theoretical rather than demonstrated at scale

**Prediction 3:** *"This evolutionary approach might be more translatable from the model as well (wouldn't that be nice), since some of the disconnects might be due to that regrowth-of-the-resistant problem"*
- **Outcome:** The approach has proven somewhat translatable, with ongoing human trials, but hasn't solved the fundamental mouse-to-human translation problem
- **Reality:** Current clinical data remain limited, and the evolutionary hypothesis, while interesting, hasn't proven clinical superiority over standard approaches yet

**Prediction 4:** Implicit prediction that this could lead to development of "medium-effective chemotherapy drugs"
- **Outcome:** Pharmaceutical industry has not shifted toward developing drugs specifically for adaptive therapy protocols
- **Reality:** Cancer drug discovery remains focused on maximum efficacy and traditional development pathways

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article ranks as highly interesting because it identified a scientifically compelling alternative paradigm for cancer treatment that challenged decades of established practice - even though the approach has remained experimentally rather than clinically significant. The adaptive therapy concept continues to influence oncology research and ethics discussions about treatment strategies.
