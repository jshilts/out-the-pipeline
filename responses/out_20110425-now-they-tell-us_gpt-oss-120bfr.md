# Now They Tell Us (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Xconomy interview with Peter Corr—who had been Pfizer’s executive vice‑president of global R&D in 2003— argues that the traditional “big‑pharma” R&D model was broken.  At the time Pfizer was spending roughly **$8 billion a year on R&D** but delivering only **four new products annually**, a cost of about **$2 billion per approved drug**.  Corr says the solution is to **license in promising candidates, shrink internal R&D sites, and let those sites operate semi‑independently with their own funding and decision‑making**.  In his view, the massive, centrally‑managed structure was “pretending we knew what was actually going on” and needed to be replaced by a more agile, partnership‑focused approach.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Pfizer’s post‑2011 restructuring**  
- **R&D footprint** – Between 2011 and 2020 Pfizer closed or consolidated several large R&D sites (e.g., Groton, CT; Sandwich, UK) and reduced headcount by ~15 %.  The company emphasized “core” therapeutic areas (oncology, immunology, vaccines) and moved many early‑stage projects to external collaborators.  
- **External licensing & collaborations** – Pfizer’s “license‑and‑partner” model expanded dramatically.  From 2011‑2020 the firm entered **>150 licensing or co‑development deals** covering modalities such as RNA‑based therapeutics, gene therapy, and antibody‑drug conjugates.  Notable examples include the **RNA‑interference partnership with Alnylam (2014)**, the **CAR‑T collaboration with Celgene (2015)**, and the **mRNA vaccine partnership with BioNTech (2020)**.  
- **Pipeline output** – The number of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved by the FDA from Pfizer fell to **1–2 per year** in the 2010s, well below the four‑per‑year rate cited in 2003.  However, the **commercial impact** of a few high‑profile products grew: the **Eliquis** anticoagulant (approved 2012) became a blockbuster, and the **COVID‑19 vaccine (Comirnaty)** generated >$30 billion in sales in its first year.  
- **Financial performance** – R&D spend stayed roughly flat in nominal terms (≈$9–10 billion annually) while the **cost per approved drug** fell modestly to about **$1.5 billion** by 2020, reflecting both higher success rates on a smaller portfolio and the outsized revenue of a few blockbusters.  
- **Industry‑wide trends** – Corr’s call for “smaller” R&D resonated.  Companies such as **Novartis, GSK, and Roche** launched “venture‑building” units, spun off or sold non‑core assets, and increased external licensing.  Yet the **big‑pharma model persisted**: the top five companies still each maintain >10 000 R&D employees and run multiple global discovery sites.  

**Key outcomes for Pfizer**  
- **Successes tied to external partnerships** – The BioNTech mRNA vaccine (2020) and the **Seagen acquisition (2023)**, which added a pipeline of antibody‑drug conjugates, illustrate that leveraging external innovation can produce blockbuster products.  
- **Mixed productivity** – While licensing increased, the overall **pipeline attrition rate remained high**; several high‑profile candidates (e.g., the **PF‑06438179 oncology asset**) failed in Phase III.  
- **Strategic pivots** – In 2020 Pfizer spun off its consumer‑health division (now a joint venture with GSK) and announced a **$12 billion R&D reduction plan (2022)**, further emphasizing a leaner, partnership‑centric approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article / implied) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“License more drug candidates and let smaller R&D sites operate independently.”** | Pfizer dramatically increased external licensing (150+ deals 2011‑2020) and closed several large sites.  The “independent site” idea was partially realized through smaller, focused labs (e.g., the “Discovery Chemistry” hub in Cambridge, MA) but most R&D decisions remained centrally coordinated. |
| **“Cost per new drug will drop from $2 billion.”** | By 2020 the average cost per FDA‑approved NME fell to roughly **$1.5 billion**, a modest reduction, largely due to fewer approvals and higher revenue per hit rather than a wholesale efficiency gain. |
| **“Productivity will increase (more than four drugs per year).**” | The opposite occurred: **1–2 NMEs per year** were approved in the 2010s.  The later surge in blockbuster sales (Eliquis, Ibrance, COVID‑19 vaccine) came from a **smaller number of high‑impact products**, not a higher launch count. |
| **“Big pharma’s size is unsustainable; they must shrink.”** | Industry-wide, many firms trimmed R&D headcount and spun off non‑core units, but the **largest companies remain massive** (Pfizer >80 000 employees in 2023).  The “big‑pharma” label persists, though the internal structure is leaner and more partnership‑oriented. |
| **“Acquired companies would have been more productive if left alone.”** | Some acquired assets (e.g., **Wyeth’s vaccine platform**) performed well under Pfizer’s umbrella, while others (e.g., **Medivation’s oncology pipeline**) were integrated and later sold.  The evidence is mixed; no clear pattern shows that leaving acquisitions independent would have uniformly improved output. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in pharma strategy and foreshadows the partnership‑driven model that later powered Pfizer’s biggest successes (e.g., the COVID‑19 vaccine), making it highly relevant for understanding current industry dynamics.
