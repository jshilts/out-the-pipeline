# Nature Doesn't Abhor a Vacuum As Much As You'd Think (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the phenomenon of completely empty binding pockets in proteins—cavities that contain not even water molecules. The author references a new study on the enzyme thermolysin, which has a hydrophobic binding pocket near its active site. Using careful X-ray crystallography, researchers found that this cavity showed no electron density for water molecules, creating what amounts to a tiny vacuum zone within the protein structure.

The key finding was that such empty pockets represent enormous opportunities for binding affinity. By placing hydrophobic groups like isobutyl into these cavities, researchers could achieve up to 40,000-fold increases in binding affinity. Isothermal calorimetry revealed this was purely enthalpic gain with zero entropic penalty, since there was no water to displace—the desolvation cost had already been paid during protein folding. The article concludes that medicinal chemists' conventional understanding of solvation needs refinement, and that computational models should not automatically assume water molecules fill such pockets.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2017 article highlighted a fundamental principle in protein-ligand binding that has gained broader recognition in drug discovery. While thermolysin itself did not become a major drug target, the principles discussed influenced approaches to structure-based drug design.

In subsequent years, the concept of cryptic pockets and empty binding sites has been explored in drug discovery contexts. Notably, the principle of targeting hydrophobic cavities contributed to design strategies for various therapeutic targets, including kinase inhibitors and protein-protein interaction inhibitors where traditional approaches struggled. However, I cannot provide specific examples of FDA-approved drugs that explicitly leveraged this exact phenomenon, as this would require current access to detailed medicinal chemistry literature that I do not have.

Research into protein hydration and binding thermodynamics has continued to refine our understanding of these phenomena. Computational chemistry approaches have evolved to better handle cases of unusual hydration patterns, though the central challenge of accurately predicting water structure in binding sites remains. The fundamental insight—that some protein cavities prefer complete emptiness over water occupancy—has been incorporated into more sophisticated models of molecular recognition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about the field:

• **Empty pockets represent huge binding opportunities**: While the general principle has been validated and incorporated into drug design thinking, the specific 40,000-fold affinity gains mentioned for thermolysin represent an exceptional case rather than a routinely achievable standard across drug targets.

• **Medicinal chemists need to revise solvation explanations**: This has occurred to some extent, with increased recognition of the complexity of water in binding sites. However, simplified models remain widely used due to practical constraints in drug discovery timelines.

• **Computational approaches should avoid forcing water into empty spots**: Modern computational chemistry has become more sophisticated in handling unusual hydration patterns, with some methods specifically designed to detect and account for cryptic pockets. However, the challenge of accurately predicting water structure remains ongoing, and many standard protocols still make assumptions about water occupancy.

• **Proteins can maintain vacuum zones**: This physical principle has been generally validated and incorporated into protein biophysics understanding.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

While the article describes a fascinating biophysical phenomenon with practical implications for drug design, its niche focus on a specific enzyme system and the incremental nature of the impact on drug discovery practices places it in the middle range of long-term importance. The core insight influenced thinking about protein binding but did not transform drug discovery methodology fundamentally.
