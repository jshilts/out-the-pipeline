# Article Title (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article announces that Jerrold Meinwald, an emeritus professor at Cornell, has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Science in chemistry. It highlights that his work—in collaboration with Thomas Eisner—on natural product pheromones and signaling systems revolutionized the understanding of insect behavior and laid the foundation for the entire field of chemical ecology. The author also points out the oddity that Meinwald did not have a Wikipedia entry at the time, while his late collaborator Eisner did. The article closes with an update noting that a Wikipedia page for Meinwald had since been created and was being expanded.

## 2. HISTORY
After the article's publication, Jerrold Meinwald's Wikipedia entry was established and has been maintained, reflecting his continued recognition. Meinwald and Eisner's foundational contributions to chemical ecology—spanning chemistry, biology, agricultural science, and ecology—have remained influential in guiding research into natural product chemistry, insect communication, and ecological signaling. However, despite their broad scientific impact, chemical ecology has not produced FDA-approved drugs on the scale of major therapeutic breakthroughs; its influence is more evident in agricultural pest control, conservation, and fundamental ecological research rather than in pharmaceutical commercialization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There were no specific predictions in this article—its focus was on celebrating an honor and correcting a biographical oversight. The expectation that a Wikipedia page would be created was immediately fulfilled, as noted in the update. The article expressed confidence that the field of chemical ecology would continue to be foundational, a sentiment that has held true in its continued relevance across scientific disciplines.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
This is a brief, straightforward announcement of a major scientific award, with a minor community note about Wikipedia coverage. It contains no deep analysis or broader predictions relevant to biotechnology industry developments.
