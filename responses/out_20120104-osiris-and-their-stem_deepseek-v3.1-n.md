# Osiris And Their Stem Cells (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques Osiris Therapeutics and their stem cell therapy Prochymal, which was being tested for Type 1 diabetes. At the time, Osiris had just issued a press release about their one-year interim analysis showing the therapy was well-tolerated but produced no improvement in diabetes markers, with only a vague "trend towards fewer hypoglycemic events."

The author highlights Prochymal's pattern of failure across multiple indications including graft-versus-host disease, cardiac events, cartilage repair, and Crohn's disease - demonstrating consistent lack of efficacy despite the therapy's clean safety profile. The article questions whether this represents genuine clinical research or a "dose-and-hope-and-sell-some-stock strategy," while acknowledging that legitimate stem cell therapies would eventually emerge despite the field's tendency toward overhype.

## 2. HISTORY
The skepticism expressed in this 2012 article proved prescient. Here's what happened with Prochymal and Osiris Therapeutics after publication:

**Prochymal's continued clinical failures:**
- The Type 1 diabetes trial referenced in the article ultimately failed, with final results showing no efficacy
- Prochymal continued to fail in multiple other indications through 2012-2014

**Company transformation and acquisition:**
- Osiris Therapeutics shifted strategy, focusing on wound care products instead
- In 2019, Osiris was acquired by Smith & Nephew for approximately $660 million, primarily for their wound care and biotics portfolio, not Prochymal
- The company's existing marketed products (Grafix, Ovation, etc.) in tissue repair became their main revenue drivers

**FDA approval context:**
- Prochymal never achieved FDA approval for any of its major indications
- The stem cell therapy field did eventually see approvals, but not Prochymal - other therapies like Kymriah (CAR-T cells, 2017) and Yescarta (2017) succeeded where Prochymal failed

**Scientific validation of concerns:**
- Subsequent research confirmed that mesenchymal stem cells (which Prochymal used) have complex mechanisms that weren't well understood in 2012
- Many MSC-based therapies faced similar efficacy challenges in the 2010s, validating the article's concerns about the field's premature hype

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions and observations about the stem cell field:

• **"Some stem cell ideas are eventually going to work"** ✓ **Mostly accurate** - While the field faced significant challenges throughout the 2010s, CAR-T cell therapies achieved FDA approval starting in 2017, validating that some stem cell approaches would eventually succeed

• **"Fishing expeditions like this" won't produce real successes** ✓ **Accurate** - Prochymal's scattershot approach across multiple unrelated indications without strong mechanistic rationale indeed failed, while more targeted approaches (like CAR-T for specific cancers) succeeded

• **Pattern recognition about companies issuing press releases about "trends"** ✓ **Accurate** - The article's criticism of premature press releases proved well-founded as Prochymal continued to underdeliver on vague promises

• **Companies with genuine clinical programs vs. "dose-and-hope-and-sell-some-stock strategy"** ✓ **Accurate** - Osiris ultimately pivoted away from Prochymal to more viable wound care products, suggesting their later success came from different approaches

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates sharp analytical thinking and prescient skepticism about biotech hype, correctly identifying red flags in a company's pattern that predicted future failures. It captures an important moment in stem cell therapy development and offers lasting lessons about distinguishing genuine clinical progress from promotional activity.
