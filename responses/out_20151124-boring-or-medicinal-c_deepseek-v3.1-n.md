# Boring! Or: The Medicinal Chemist's Toolkit (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2015 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry paper that analyzed the synthetic reactions used in medicinal chemistry from 1984 to 2014. The key finding was that among the most frequently used synthetic reactions, none were discovered within the last twenty years, with only two reactions from the 1980s and 1990s making the list: palladium-catalyzed couplings (Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig). The author notes that power-law distribution is expected in any such analysis, with a small number of reactions dominating the field. While acknowledging that reactions like Suzuki couplings became popular because they are experimentally easy and produce pharmacologically favorable structures (particularly for kinase inhibitors), the article questions whether this focus on aryl-aryl coupling leads to over-representation of flat, aromatic compounds. The article compares medicinal chemistry's limited reaction toolkit to natural products, suggesting that evolution has explored broader chemical space, and calls for developing more robust reactions to access natural-product-like structures.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in this 2015 article have become even more salient in the intervening years, with developments moving in multiple directions:

**Continued dominance of traditional reactions**: Analysis of medicinal chemistry literature through 2020-2023 shows that the reaction toolkit has remained remarkably stable. The most recent comprehensive studies indicate that amide couplings, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig animations continue to dominate, accounting for 30-40% of all reactions used in drug discovery programs at major pharmaceutical companies.

**Rise of new modalities**: The most significant post-2015 development has been the explosive growth of new therapeutic modalities that rely on different synthetic strategies. mRNA vaccines, siRNA therapeutics, PROTACs, and antibody-drug conjugates have created entirely new chemical spaces that don't follow traditional small-molecule synthesis patterns. PROTACs in particular require linker chemistry that wasn't common in 2015, creating demand for diverse C-C bond forming reactions, click chemistry, and novel bioconjugation techniques.

**Advancements in sp3 C-C coupling**: Research into "zambodium-catalyzed" type reactions (efficient sp3-sp3 carbon coupling) has progressed, though not as dramatically as hoped. Photoredox catalysis and metallaphotoredox reactions have emerged as important tools for C(sp3) functionalization. Nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling has expanded to include alkyl-alkyl couplings, though these reactions haven't achieved the widespread adoption of Suzuki couplings. However, these methods remain experimentally more challenging and require more optimization than their aryl-coupling counterparts.

**Increased focus on stereochemistry**: The industry has increasingly prioritized three-dimensional molecular shapes over flat aromatic structures. This has driven adoption of asymmetric catalysis methods (though still representing a small fraction of reactions used) and renewed interest in using natural product scaffolds as starting points. Drugs approved since 2016 show higher fractions of sp3-hybridized carbons compared to those in the early 2010s.

**DNA-encoded library (DEL) impact**: DEL technology has matured significantly since 2015, with companies like Novo Nordisk, Amgen, and smaller biotechs building billion-compound libraries. However, the chemistry in DELs has largely followed traditional paths, resulting in library bias toward molecules accessible via robust, high-yielding reactions - reinforcing the exact pattern the article described.

The central tension identified in 2015 persists: while medicinal chemistry has expanded into new modalities and target classes, the synthetic reactions remain conservative due to reliability and throughput requirements in drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about sp3 coupling demand**: The article suggested that if efficient C-C bond formation between plain sp3 carbons became available, it would "shoot to the top of the charts." While significant research progress has occurred (asymmetric catalysis, photoredox methods, nickel catalysis), these reactions have *not* achieved top-20 popularity status. They remain specialized tools used by advanced practitioners rather than standard toolkit reactions.

• **Concern about aryl-aryl linkage limitations**: The article questioned whether continuously "stringing aryl groups together like links of sausages" would provide access to needed target space. This has proven partially prescient. While kinase inhibitors and traditional GPCR drugs continue to benefit from aromatic architectures, newer target classes (protein-protein interactions, intrinsically disordered proteins) have proven difficult to address with flat molecules, driving demand for more complex, three-dimensional structures.

• **Natural product inspiration**: The recommendation to explore natural product-like space has seen moderate uptake. Several companies founded since 2015 focus on natural product-inspired drug discovery (e.g., Nested Therapeutics, Dragonfly Therapeutics), and approved drugs derived from or inspired by natural products continue to represent a significant fraction of new approvals. However, this remains a niche approach rather than mainstream medicinal chemistry practice.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article identified a fundamental constraint in drug discovery that has proven remarkably durable. The reaction toolkit conservatism it described has persisted and even strengthened as the industry prioritizes reliability for larger-scale synthesis campaigns. The piece's insights about the interplay between synthetic accessibility and molecular architecture have become even more relevant with the rise of "undruggable" targets and the need for structurally complex molecules.
