# A Man, A Book, and a Plan. Several Plans. (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2005 commentary article focuses on Kevin Trudeau's "Natural Cures" book marketing operation and fraudulent business practices. The author details how Trudeau was selling massive quantities of his book despite containing no actual cures, with the New York State Consumer Protection Board having already declared it a fraud "from cover to cover." The article describes complaints about customers being involuntarily signed up for expensive newsletters ($71 initial fee plus $14.95/month) and recurring charges, with customer service being inaccessible for cancellations. The commentary also notes Trudeau was reselling his mailing list to other scam operations, including groups like "Nouveau Tech Society" and Neo-Tech/Zonpower, described as "crazed scamsters." The article harshly criticizes Trudeau for urging seriously ill patients to abandon medical treatment and conventional drugs in favor of his products.

## 2. HISTORY

Kevin Trudeau's legal and criminal troubles escalated significantly following this 2005 article. In **2013**, Trudeau was held in contempt of court for violating the terms of a 2004 FTC settlement by making false claims about his weight-loss book on infomercials. He was ordered to post a $2 million bond and faced mounting legal penalties, which he repeatedly failed to pay. In **2014**, Trudeau was sentenced to **10 years in federal prison** after being convicted of criminal contempt for continually violating court orders and FTC agreements related to his deceptive marketing practices. The judge cited his history of non-compliance and deliberate flouting of the legal system. Trudeau was incarcerated and lost numerous appeals attempting to overturn his conviction and reduce his sentence. Most of the organizations and businesses mentioned (the newsletter operations, Nouveau Tech Society, Neo-Tech/Zonpower) have largely faded from public prominence. Trudeau's infomercial empire collapsed, though his books remain available through various channels. The medical claims made in "Natural Cures" have shown no validation in legitimate scientific literature in the years since—none of the purported treatments have been substantiated or adopted in evidence-based medicine. Many of the alternative health regimens promoted through his marketing ecosystem have been consistently debunked by regulatory agencies and healthcare organizations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction about Trudeau facing accountability**: The article ends with the author exercising First Amendment rights to call Trudeau "a fraud, a con man" but does not specifically predict legal consequences. **Outcome**: Trudeau was in fact prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in federal prison by 2014, far exceeding any accountability suggested in the article.
- **Explicit concern about "next phase" involving "lifetime membership" for $499**: While not strictly a prediction, it highlighted escalating fraudulent schemes. **Outcome**: Trudeau continued expanding his fraudulent operations, leading to the FTC actions and criminal contempt charges that ultimately resulted in his imprisonment.
- **Implicit concern about continuing harm to seriously ill patients**: **Outcome**: There is no organized documentation of patients abandoning medication based specifically on Trudeau's advice, but multiple health agencies have issued warnings about unsubstantiated alternative cures promoted by similar figures, with no evidence these methods improved health outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article is moderately interesting as a contemporaneous account exposing fraudulent health claims and marketing practices. However, the piece primarily chronicles regulatory warnings and complaints already occurring at the time, with limited predictive success or broader importance for biotechnology beyond consumer protection issues.
