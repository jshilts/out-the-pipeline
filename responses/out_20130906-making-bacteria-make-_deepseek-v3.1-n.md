# Making the Bacteria Make Your Fluorinated Compounds (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Science paper from Michelle Chang's lab at Berkeley about using synthetic biology to produce fluorinated natural products. The researchers explored hijacking natural acetate metabolic pathways by feeding engineered bacteria fluoroacetate or fluoromalonate, aiming to create fluorinated compounds that don't exist in nature. A significant complication noted is that fluoroacetate is highly toxic to cells, as it's metabolized to fluorocitrate, which inhibits aconitase and stops the citric acid cycle. While some Streptomyces species show limited tolerance to fluoroacetate, organofluorine biology was described as extremely limited at the time.

The paper details extensive work identifying and engineering enzymes capable of handling fluorinated intermediates, eventually targeting 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) due to its established track record in bioengineering. The researchers successfully demonstrated production of fluorinated compounds both ex vivo and in living engineered bacteria by feeding fluoromalonate instead of fluoroacetate. The author speculates about extending this approach to other natural product classes like terpenoids.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 publication, the field of fluorinated natural product biosynthesis has seen gradual but meaningful progress. The foundational work demonstrated by Michelle Chang's lab pioneered what became an active research area exploring biological fluorination strategies. 

The use of fluorinated building blocks in metabolic engineering has expanded beyond the initial erythromycin pathway work. Researchers have developed more sophisticated methods for incorporating fluorine into complex natural products, though practical applications for drug development remain limited. The fundamental challenge of fluoroacetate toxicity has remained a significant hurdle, with subsequent work focusing on developing more selective fluorination systems and alternative fluorinated precursors.

DEBS engineering, which was already an established field in 2013, has continued to be a valuable platform for polyketide biosynthesis, including attempts at fluorinated derivatives. However, no fluorinated natural product antibiotics produced through these methods have reached clinical approval or widespread pharmaceutical use. The field largely evolved toward more targeted applications where biological fluorination offered advantages over chemical synthesis, though it remains a specialized research area rather than a mainstream drug development approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Explicit predictions mentioned in the article:**
• **Expansion to terpenoid systems**: The author wondered about trying fluorinated starting materials in the mevalonate pathway for terpenoid production
• **"Tip of a larger fluorinated iceberg"**: The hope that the compounds shown were just the beginning of broader fluorinated natural product development

**What actually happened:**
• While some research explored fluorinated terpenoids and other natural product classes, biological fluorination did not become a major route for pharmaceutical development
• The field remained relatively specialized and research-focused rather than achieving the broader impact suggested by the "iceberg" metaphor
• Fluorinated drug development continued to rely primarily on synthetic chemistry rather than biosynthetic approaches
• The method has not led to FDA-approved drugs or widespread industrial adoption

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While innovative for its time and scientifically interesting, this work did not achieve the broader transformative impact suggested in the article, remaining a specialized research area rather than revolutionizing drug development as implied.
