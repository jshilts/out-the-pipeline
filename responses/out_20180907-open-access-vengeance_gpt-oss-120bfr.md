# Open Access With A Vengeance (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary announced the launch of **cOAlition S**, a coalition of eleven major European research funders that, starting in 2020, would require all peer‑reviewed articles arising from their grants to be made openly available in “compliant” venues. Compliance meant that the journal or platform must be fully open‑access; hybrid journals (where only some articles are OA) were explicitly excluded.  

Key points of the plan were:  

* Authors retain full copyright.  
* Funding agencies would define and publish the technical standards for “compliant” OA venues.  
* Publication costs (article‑processing charges, APCs) would be covered by institutions or centrally subsidised, with a Europe‑wide cap on APCs.  
* Where no suitable OA venue existed, the agencies would support the creation of new journals or platforms.  

The author framed the policy as a decisive strike against the traditional subscription model and asked how the big commercial publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) and scientific societies would respond.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Implementation of Plan S (2018‑2024)**  

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **2020** | The first wave of Plan S compliance deadlines arrived. Many journals that already operated under full‑OA licences (e.g., PLOS, eLife, many MDPI titles) were automatically compliant. |
| **2020‑2021** | Major commercial publishers negotiated **Transformative Agreements** (also called “Read‑and‑Publish” deals) with consortia of European institutions. These contracts convert subscription spend into OA publishing rights, allowing authors to publish OA without paying individual APCs. Springer Nature, Wiley, and Elsevier all signed such agreements covering thousands of journals. |
| **2021** | The European Commission incorporated Plan S‑type requirements into the **Horizon Europe** programme, extending the OA mandate to all EU‑funded research. |
| **2022** | The cOAlition S “capped‑APC” policy was refined: a maximum APC of €2,000–€3,000 (depending on discipline) was agreed for most fields, with higher caps for certain high‑cost areas (e.g., genomics). |
| **2023** | Hybrid journals that had pledged to transition to full OA under a “hybrid‑to‑OA” roadmap were granted a temporary exemption, but the deadline for full transition was set for **2024**. |
| **2024** | The majority of large subscription journals in the coalition’s target list had either become fully OA or were covered by Transformative Agreements. A small residual set of high‑impact journals (e.g., *Nature* flagship titles) remained hybrid but were under pressure to adopt the “gold” OA route. |

**Impact on the publishing ecosystem**

* **Growth of OA output** – The proportion of Europe‑funded articles that are OA rose from ~45 % in 2018 to >80 % in 2023, according to the European Commission’s Open Science Monitor.  
* **Financial shift** – Institutional libraries redirected a large share of subscription budgets into APC pools or Transformative Agreements. The overall APC market in Europe grew from ≈ €400 M (2018) to ≈ €800 M (2023).  
* **Society journals** – Many learned societies that previously relied on subscription revenue launched OA “sister” journals (e.g., *Cell Reports* by Cell Press) or converted existing titles under the capped‑APC model. Some societies reported short‑term revenue dips but later stabilized through membership fees and APC sharing.  
* **Publisher response** – Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley all announced strategic OA roadmaps, expanded their OA journal portfolios, and invested in platform services (e.g., Elsevier’s “Open Science Platform”). The “hybrid‑only” model has largely been abandoned in Europe, though hybrid remains common in North America and Asia.  
* **Policy spill‑over** – The United Kingdom’s Research Councils and the US National Institutes of Health introduced parallel OA mandates, citing Plan S as a benchmark.  

**Overall assessment** – The coalition’s plan succeeded in forcing a rapid, industry‑wide shift toward full OA publishing in Europe, though the transition was mediated by large‑scale contracts rather than a wholesale abandonment of subscription journals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2018 commentary | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“Hybrid” journals will be excluded; only fully OA venues will be used.** | Hybrid journals were initially barred, but publishers secured **Transformative Agreements** that allowed hybrid titles to count as compliant if they were on a transition path. By 2024, most high‑impact hybrid journals have committed to full OA or are covered by such agreements, so the spirit of the prediction holds, though the strict exclusion was softened. |
| **Publishers will be forced to react dramatically, possibly threatening their business models.** | Publishers responded by **re‑structuring revenue**: subscription income was largely converted into APC‑based or agreement‑based models. No major publisher withdrew from the market, but profit margins shifted and many announced OA‑first strategies. |
| **Scientific societies that act as publishers will face a crisis.** | Several societies launched OA journals or partnered with commercial publishers to share APC revenue. While a few reported temporary financial strain, most adapted and continue to operate, often with a mixed OA/subscription portfolio. |
| **The policy will “shake things up” in a short time frame.** | Within two years (by 2020) the policy was legally binding, and by 2023‑24 the majority of European‑funded research was OA. The publishing landscape in Europe was indeed reshaped within a five‑year window. |
| **Institutions will bear the cost, with subsidies for less‑well‑funded labs.** | Institutional OA funds and national consortia were created (e.g., Germany’s “Projekt DEAL”). Subsidies and waivers for low‑income countries and early‑career researchers have been implemented, though debates about equity continue. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article captured a pivotal policy shift that has fundamentally altered scientific publishing in Europe and influenced global OA mandates; its prescient framing and clear stakes make it highly relevant for understanding current open‑science infrastructure.
