# Ten Years After: The Genomics Frenzy (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on the genomics craze that peaked around 1999, a decade after the frenzy subsided. In the late 1990s, numerous genomics companies generated massive hype by filing patent applications on what they claimed were huge swaths of the human genome, often accompanied by breathless press releases suggesting these firms would soon control all valuable drug targets. Major pharmaceutical companies reacted with alarm, striking large deals out of fear that competitors would lock up all the therapeutic genes. The author notes that at the time, few were willing to publicly question the hype, though some adopted the cautious stance that they had to be ready in case the revolution materialized.

Two major cold showers ultimately tempered the frenzy. First, when the Human Genome Project reported the total number of human genes, the figure came in around ten times lower than many had estimated. This led to the embarrassing realization that companies had filed patents on more genes than actually existed. Second, the biological reality was far more complex than "one gene, one protein." Post-translational modifications meant that a single gene could generate many proteins, and companies had little idea what most genes actually did, what pathways they belonged to, or whether they were druggable. Most early genomics programs failed because targets lacked clear disease associations or proved difficult to hit with small molecules. The article closes by noting that most genomics companies either went out of business or were forced to completely retool, their patent portfolios largely worthless.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following 2009 brought substantial validation of the article's skeptical assessment, with genomics moving from speculative gold rush to mature—but slower and more difficult—integration into drug discovery. Several key developments shaped the post-2009 landscape:

**Clinical Translation and Approved Therapies**
By the late 2010s, genomics had produced genuine therapeutic successes, though far more slowly than the 1999 hype predicted. Notable examples include:
- PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab), approved in 2015, which came from human genetic studies of familial hypercholesterolemia
- CFTR modulators for cystic fibrosis (ivacaftor, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, tezacaftor/ivacaftor, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor), which became a multi-billion dollar franchise
- CAR-T cell therapies (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel) approved in 2017, rooted in understanding of T-cell biology and target identification
- Gene therapies like Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec, 2017) and Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec, 2019)

However, these successes represent a small fraction of the thousands of targets pursued. The failure rate remained extremely high, and most genomic associations did not translate into druggable targets.

**Genomics Company Outcomes**
Many high-profile genomics companies from the 1990s boom either collapsed or transformed:
- Human Genome Sciences was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in 2012 for $3.6 billion, after decades of struggling to commercialize its genomic discoveries
- Millennium Pharmaceuticals, after its high-profile acquisition by Takeda, gradually shifted focus away from pure genomics toward more traditional drug development approaches
- Celera Genomics eventually transitioned away from genomics data and was acquired by Quest Diagnostics in 2011
- Myriad Genetics succeeded with BRACAnalysis (a genetic test), showing that diagnostics represented a more immediate application than therapeutics

The business model of patenting raw genomic sequences largely failed, as predicted in the article.

**Patent Law Evolution**
The article's mention of tightening patent requirements proved prescient. Critical developments include:
- _Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc._ (2013): The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that isolated DNA sequences themselves cannot be patented, though cDNA and diagnostic methods could still receive protection
- Patent offices worldwide raised the bar for utility requirements, making it much harder to patent genes without clear functional data

These legal changes made the massive patent portfolios from the genomics boom largely worthless.

**Scientific Reality**
By the 2010s, it became clear that:
- Most diseases involve complex interactions among many genes, not single-gene defects
- The vast majority of genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits were in non-coding regions, suggesting regulatory rather than protein-coding mechanisms
- Epigenetics, RNA splicing, post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions proved as important as the raw DNA sequence
- Validating targets remained the primary bottleneck in drug discovery, with genomics providing candidates but not solutions

**Adoption and Maturation**
Rather than replacing traditional drug discovery, genomics evolved into a valuable but supplementary tool. By the 2020s:
- Pharmaceutical companies routinely used genomics in target identification and validation, but as one tool among many
- Large-scale population genomics initiatives (UK Biobank, All of Us, etc.) generated unprecedented datasets, though with slower translation than hoped
- Gene therapy, rare disease genetics, and cancer genomics became the areas where genomics had the biggest impact
- Costs of sequencing dropped dramatically (from billions to hundreds of dollars), enabling widespread adoption

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't explicitly make forward-looking predictions about specific technologies or products in the genomics space, and it primarily reported on the aftermath of the 1990s genomics boom. However, the author's general assessment has largely held true, and the following general expectations can be evaluated based on later events:

- **Rarity and difficulty of translating genomic discoveries into drugs**: The article correctly anticipated that most of the genomics patents and programs would not yield approved medicines. By the 2020s, only a small fraction of the thousands of potential targets identified through genomics had yielded FDA-approved therapies, confirming the high failure rate and slow translation.

- **Patent challenges**: The article noted that patent offices were tightening requirements and that court decisions were questioning DNA sequence patents. This proved highly accurate, with the landmark 2013 _Myriad_ Supreme Court decision effectively invalidating most gene patents and making raw genomic sequence claims largely unenforceable, rendering the genomics boom patent portfolios valueless.

- **Business model viability**: The skepticism about genomics companies' ability to generate revenue from genomic data alone was validated. Most companies either failed, pivoted to diagnostics or other fields, or were acquired at much lower valuations than their peak hype. The anticipated gold rush never materialized in the way predicted in the late 1990s.

- **Slow progress and delayed impact**: The author's view that realizing the value of the genome would take much longer than 1999 predictions proved accurate. Even by the late 2010s and early 2020s, genomics remains one tool among many in drug discovery, with limited translation of large-scale genomic findings into clinical therapies.

- **Complexity of biology**: The article's emphasis on post-translational modifications and the failure of the "one gene, one protein" paradigm has been widely confirmed. Systems biology, epigenetics, and the realization that most GWAS hits are regulatory rather than coding variants have reinforced that genomic information alone is insufficient for drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article provides valuable historical perspective on the genomics boom and bust, and its insights about the slow, difficult translation of genomic discoveries into therapies remain relevant as genomics increasingly integrates into mainstream drug discovery. The piece captures both the irrational exuberance of the era and the underlying scientific and commercial realities that ultimately constrained the revolution's scope and pace.
