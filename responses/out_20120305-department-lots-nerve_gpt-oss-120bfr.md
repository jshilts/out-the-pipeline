# Department of Lots of Nerve (Patent Applications Desk) (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary notes that U.S. patent applicants must disclose “prior art” – earlier patents, journal articles, or any public disclosure that is relevant to the invention.  The author points out that two major scientific publishers, Wiley and the American Institute of Physics (AIP), had filed lawsuits against several patent‑law firms.  The suits alleged that the firms had copied and submitted copyrighted journal articles to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) without permission, thereby infringing the publishers’ copyrights.  The writer doubts the lawsuits will succeed, arguing that the submissions likely qualify as fair‑use and that the suits merely reflect the publishing industry’s desperation amid a deteriorating business model.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Legal outcome** – The Wiley and AIP lawsuits (filed March 2012) were largely resolved without creating a binding precedent.  Both cases were either dismissed by the courts or settled out of court within a few years; no appellate decisions established a new rule on the copyright status of prior‑art copies.  Consequently, the USPTO continued to accept copies of published articles as part of prior‑art submissions without requiring a license from the copyright holder.

**USPTO policy** – In 2013 the USPTO issued a formal guidance (USPTO Rule 1.97 and accompanying “Copyright and Patent” FAQ) clarifying that submitting copies of publicly available articles for prior‑art purposes is permissible under the fair‑use doctrine, provided the copies are used solely for examination and are not distributed beyond the USPTO.  The agency also introduced an electronic “Prior Art Search” portal that encourages applicants to upload PDFs of articles, further normalizing the practice.

**Industry response** – The lawsuits did not trigger a shift toward open‑access publishing or a major change in how publishers protect their content.  Subscription‑based journals continued to dominate, although the overall growth of open‑access models accelerated independently (e.g., Plan S in Europe, NIH public‑access mandates).  Patent‑law firms and in‑house counsel still routinely submit PDFs of journal articles as part of the “information disclosure statement” (IDS) without seeking publisher permission.

**Broader impact** – The episode highlighted a tension between copyright law and the patent system, but it did not result in new legislation or USPTO rule changes beyond the existing fair‑use clarification.  The practice of submitting prior‑art copies remains standard, and no significant policy or market disruption can be traced directly to the 2012 lawsuits.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *The lawsuits will not succeed because the submissions are fair use.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely correct.  Both cases were dismissed or settled without a ruling that the submissions infringed copyright; USPTO guidance now treats such use as fair use.

- **Prediction:** *The suits signal a “desperate” publishing industry on the brink of collapse.*  
  **Outcome:** Overstated.  While the publishing business continued to face pressure from open‑access movements, the lawsuits did not precipitate any major structural change; subscription publishers remain financially viable.

- **Implicit prediction:** *Patent applicants will have to change how they provide prior art.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized.  The standard practice of attaching PDFs of articles to IDS filings persists, and the USPTO even encourages electronic uploads.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  
The article is moderately interesting because it captures a niche legal clash that sparked brief discussion but ultimately had limited lasting effect on either patent practice or publishing economics.
