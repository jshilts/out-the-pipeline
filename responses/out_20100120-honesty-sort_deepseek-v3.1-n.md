# Honesty, Of A Sort (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article quotes Sanofi-Aventis CEO Chris Viehbacher speaking at the January 2010 J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, where he characterized the previous decade as a "lost decade" for the pharmaceutical industry. The key quote that caught attention was Viehbacher's admission that "people have zero expectations of Sanofi-Aventis research and development," followed by his rationale that the company had "cleared out a lot of bad news" so that "if anything comes along it should be good news." The article frames this as an unusual strategy of managing expectations downward while questioning how this approach translated to internal performance reviews and goal-setting.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2010-2020) proved transformative for Sanofi, marked by significant strategic shifts and mixed outcomes:

**Business Transformation:** Under Viehbacher's leadership (2008-2014), Sanofi pursued an aggressive diversification strategy, most notably acquiring Genzyme for $20.1 billion in 2011 to gain footholds in rare diseases and multiple sclerosis. The company also expanded into vaccines (Sanofi Pasteur) and consumer healthcare. However, Viehbacher was abruptly ousted in 2014 following clashes with the board over strategy and governance.

**R&D Pipeline Performance:** The low-expectations approach appeared partially justified. Sanofi's R&D productivity showed uneven results. The company faced major setbacks including the 2013 FDA rejection of lixisenatide (a GLP-1 diabetes drug), though it later gained approval. Conversely, Sanofi achieved significant successes: Dupixent (dupilumab), developed with Regeneron, became a blockbuster immunology drug approved in 2017 for atopic dermatitis and later expanded to asthma and other conditions, generating billions in annual revenue. The diabetes franchise (Lantus insulin) maintained strong performance but faced increasing competition and pricing pressure.

**Market Performance:** Sanofi's stock underperformed relative to peers during parts of this period, reflecting ongoing R&D productivity concerns and patent cliffs affecting key drugs. Post-Viehbacher leadership focused on reorganizing R&D operations and rebuilding pipeline credibility, with some measurable improvements in FDA approvals and clinical success rates by the late 2010s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Viehbacher's expectation-setting strategy**: The CEO's "zero expectations" positioning was not a formal prediction but rather strategic expectation management. In reality, Sanofi's R&D delivered both notable failures and significant successes over the following decade, suggesting this was accurate self-assessment of existing capabilities.

• **Implicit forecast of clearing "bad news" leading to upside**: While the company did resolve some pipeline issues, the transformation proved more complex than simply removing negative expectations, requiring substantial portfolio restructuring, major acquisitions, and multiple leadership changes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While offering insight into pharmaceutical industry expectation management, this article primarily documents a CEO's unorthodox communication strategy rather than substantive developments in biotechnology. Though it presaged Sanofi's challenging subsequent decade, the piece lacks deeper technological or scientific content that would warrant higher rating.
