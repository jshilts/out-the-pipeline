# What Really Makes a Biopharma Hub? (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Luke Timmerman's critique of a biotech research hub ranking that placed San Diego at #2, ahead of the San Francisco Bay Area. The author agrees with Timmerman's assessment that this ranking is flawed and that the Bay Area clearly outranks San Diego as a biopharma hub. The piece highlights Timmerman's call for better ranking criteria that would more accurately reflect the realities of biotech ecosystems. The author warns against the danger of such inflated rankings, suggesting they could foster complacency in cities like San Diego that actually need to address weaknesses in areas like venture capital availability and infrastructure such as airport connectivity.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, the biopharma hub landscape has largely reinforced the author's underlying argument. The **San Francisco Bay Area** (including South San Francisco and the Peninsula) has maintained its position as the premier biopharma hub, with companies like Genentech, Gilead, Roche, and numerous emerging players driving continued growth. Major FDA approvals and clinical successes have originated from this region.

**San Diego** has continued to be a significant biotech hub but has faced challenges in venture capital availability compared to the Bay Area. While San Diego maintained strengths in research institutions and startup formation, it has struggled with scaling companies and retaining them as they grow larger.

The **Boston/Cambridge** area has solidified its position as the other top-tier biopharma hub alongside the Bay Area, with Cambridge's Kendall Square becoming arguably the densest biotech research zone globally. Major companies like Moderna, Biogen, and Novartis have maintained significant presence, and the area has seen substantial continued investment.

The importance of robust local venture capital ecosystems and strong infrastructure connections has become even more apparent, validating the article's concerns about ranking criteria. Cities that have focused on addressing these gaps have seen more sustained biotech success than those that have not.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The implicit prediction** that San Diego's #2 ranking in the surveyed list was inflated and that the San Francisco Bay Area would prove superior as a biopharma hub has been largely validated. Subsequent developments have consistently shown the Bay Area maintaining clear advantages in venture capital, infrastructure, and company scale.

• **The underlying concern** that cities celebrating inflated rankings might become complacent about real deficiencies appears prescient. The decade-plus since publication has highlighted how critical venture capital ecosystems and infrastructure are for sustained biopharma success.

• **The call for better ranking criteria** reflected recognition that simplistic assessments could mislead policymakers and stakeholders. This has proven important, as more sophisticated analyses have emerged that better capture ecosystem strength.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article touches on an important structural issue in biotech ecosystems, it addresses a relatively narrow debate about city rankings from a specific time period, with most insights being commonly understood in the biotech community rather than novel revelations.
