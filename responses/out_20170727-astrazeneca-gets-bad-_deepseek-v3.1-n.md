# AstraZeneca Gets the Bad News (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reports on AstraZeneca's announcement that its pivotal MYSTIC trial for lung cancer immunotherapy failed to meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. The trial evaluated a combination of two immunotherapies—Imfinzi (durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor) and tremelimumab (a CTLA-4 inhibitor)—in patients with lung cancer. 

The news caused AstraZeneca's stock to drop 15% in a single day, wiping out $12 billion in market capitalization, while competitors Merck (developing Keytruda) saw their stock rise and Bristol-Myers Squibb declined amid market uncertainty. The company indicated it would wait for overall survival data the following year, though the author noted that failure on progression-free survival (generally considered an easier endpoint) made recovery on overall survival unlikely. The article frames this as part of the inherent uncertainty and role of luck in immuno-oncology drug development.

## 2. HISTORY

**Trial Outcomes:**
The MYSTIC trial did indeed fail on its co-primary endpoint of overall survival when results were reported. In 2019, AstraZeneca announced that the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab did not show statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

**Drug Approvals and Clinical Impact:**
Despite the MYSTIC trial failure, durvalumab (Imfinzi) went on to receive FDA approval in 2018 for unresectable Stage III NSCLC patients whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation—a different patient population and treatment setting than the failed MYSTIC trial. This indication has become clinically important, with durvalumab becoming a standard of care in this specific setting.

Tremelimumab, the CTLA-4 inhibitor component, did not gain approval as part of the lung cancer combination. However, the general CTLA-4/PD-(L)1 combination approach found commercial success elsewhere—specifically with Bristol-Myers Squibb's combination of nivolumab (PD-1) and ipilimumab (CTLA-4), which received approvals in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and other cancer types.

**Industry Landscape:**
Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) indeed became the dominant immunotherapy in lung cancer and across multiple indications. The immuno-oncology market evolved with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors becoming backbone therapies, while CTLA-4 combinations found specific niches rather than broad first-line utility.

By 2024, durvalumab had generated approximately $3.5 billion in annual revenue for AstraZeneca, demonstrating value and patient uptake despite the MYSTIC setback. However, the original vision of a first-line lung cancer immunotherapy combination for AstraZeneca did not materialize as planned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** The author predicted that the overall survival data would likely also fail given the progression-free survival failure.
  **Outcome:** ✓ Accurate. The overall survival data did not show statistically significant benefit.

• **Prediction:** The author noted that the Merck deal for PARP and MEK compounds couldn't make up for Imfinzi's failure.
  **Outcome:** ✓ Partially accurate in that the lung cancer combination approach failed, though durvalumab found success in other indications.

• **Prediction:** The article described the broader industry uncertainty in immuno-oncology and that similar failures would happen to other companies.
  **Outcome:** ✓ Accurate. Subsequent years saw multiple immunotherapy trial failures across companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, and others as combination strategies proved harder to optimize than expected.

• **Prediction:** Merck's success trajectory and competitive position were highlighted.
  **Outcome:** ✓ Highly accurate. Merck's Keytruda became the dominant immunotherapy globally with multiple approvals and substantial market share.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates strong predictive accuracy about both imminent trial outcomes and the broader competitive landscape, while capturing a crucial moment when the immuno-oncology field's complexity became apparent beyond initial enthusiasm.
