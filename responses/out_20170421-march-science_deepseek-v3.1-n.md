# Article Title (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article explains the author's decision not to participate in the March for Science taking place in April 2017. The author identifies as "relentlessly pro-science" but expresses skepticism about the march's effectiveness and focus. Key concerns include: uncertainty about the size and nature of the "anti-science" constituency (suggesting most critics aren't truly anti-science but rather believe they have better scientific information); the march's likely evolution into multiple separate causes under one banner; and doubts that street protests are the most effective way to influence policy.

The author argues that if the goal is protecting science funding, direct engagement with House representatives—particularly those on the Budget Committee—would be more impactful than marching. The piece references the 2010 Jon Stewart/Stephen Colbert rally, which drew over 200,000 people but was followed by significant Republican electoral gains, suggesting limited real-world impact of such events. The author concludes by emphasizing that the Trump administration would be unmoved by protest rallies and that science advocacy requires sustained political engagement rather than symbolic demonstrations.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following the article's publication, several developments occurred related to the March for Science movement and its broader context:

**March for Science Evolution**: The inaugural March for Science took place on April 22, 2017, with hundreds of satellite marches globally. The movement transformed into a nonprofit organization that continued advocacy work beyond the initial event, focusing on science policy, civic engagement, and grassroots organizing. However, attendance declined significantly in subsequent years (2018-2019), and the organization eventually scaled back activities.

**Science Funding Trends**: Federal science funding did not experience the catastrophic cuts proposed in the 2017 budget, but the trajectory remained concerning for many advocates. The NIH budget saw modest increases in some years but faced ongoing threats and periodic government shutdowns that disrupted research. The relationship between the scientific community and the Trump administration remained strained throughout the term, with controversies over climate science, COVID-19 research, and scientific integrity.

**Political Context**: The 2018 midterm elections saw Democratic gains (40 House seats), but Republican control of the Senate strengthened. Science policy continued to be highly polarized, with climate change denial remaining entrenched in parts of the Republican party and scientific issues increasingly caught in political polarization.

**Broader Science Advocacy**: The period saw growth in alternative science advocacy approaches, including enhanced scientist engagement with policymakers, improved science communication efforts, and increased participation by scientists in political campaigns and local government. Organizations like 314 Action and similar groups successfully recruited scientists to run for office, achieving some electoral success.

**COVID-19 Impact**: The 2020 pandemic created new challenges and opportunities for science advocacy, with mixed results in terms of public trust in scientific institutions and the politicization of public health measures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

While the article contains more analysis than explicit predictions, several arguments can be evaluated against subsequent developments:

• **Prediction about March Effectiveness**: The author argued that marches wouldn't meaningfully influence the White House or change minds. → **Partially Accurate**: The March for Science did not significantly shift Trump administration policies on science, and the administration remained largely unmoved by protests. However, the march did help galvanize the scientific community's political engagement and contributed to broader advocacy efforts.

• **Prediction about Science Funding**: The author noted that presidential budget proposals are typically non-starters and that real influence comes from congressional engagement. → **Mostly Accurate**: The proposed science cuts did not materialize as severely as feared, and congressional action (influenced by sustained advocacy) proved more determinative than executive proposals.

• **Prediction about Avenue Effectiveness**: The author suggested direct constituent pressure on House representatives would be more effective than marching. → **Mixed Accuracy**: While direct political engagement proved important, the March for Science and similar events did raise public awareness and contributed to a broader culture of scientific advocacy that included increased political participation by scientists.

• **Implicit Prediction about Anti-Science Constituency**: The author questioned how large the truly "anti-science" constituency is. → **Complicated Reality**: The following years saw increased polarization around scientific issues, particularly climate change and later pandemic-related science, but the author's distinction between "anti-science" and "I have better science" remained relevant in analyzing opposition to scientific consensus.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article offers thoughtful analysis of the limitations of protest-based advocacy and provides practical alternatives for science policy engagement. While the subject matter is time-bound to the 2017 political moment, the broader questions about effective science advocacy and the nature of anti-science sentiment remain relevant and prescient in their concerns about political polarization of scientific issues.
