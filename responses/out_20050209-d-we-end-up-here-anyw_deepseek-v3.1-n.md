# How'd We End Up Here, Anyway? (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article addresses the pharmaceutical industry's fundamental R&D crisis, using Pfizer director Enoch Huang's assessment that the industry faced a staggering 96% failure rate for clinical candidates (1 in 25 success odds). The author notes that this represents even worse attrition than historical figures, with toxicity rather than lack of efficacy becoming the primary cause of failure. The article critiques the industry's heavy investment in new technologies (genomics and other "-omics") that had failed to meaningfully reduce these failure rates despite vast expenditures.

The central argument is that the reductionist approach to drug discovery—focusing on well-defined molecular targets screened in isolated in vitro systems—may have "gone too far" despite past successes. The article explores the need to shift toward more holistic systems, including better animal models that more closely resemble real living systems, with the goal of getting compounds into animals and humans more quickly. However, the author acknowledges this would require major investments in toxicology understanding to avoid unacceptable clinical trial risks or prohibitively expensive animal testing.

## 2. HISTORY

The 96% clinical attrition rate cited in 2005 proved remarkably persistent. Over the subsequent two decades, industry-wide success rates remained stubbornly low, with multiple analyses confirming that only 10-12% of drugs entering clinical trials ultimately gained FDA approval. The specific figure of 1 in 25 (4% success) remained broadly representative for many therapeutic areas well into the 2010s.

Contrary to the article's suggestion that a paradigm shift away from reductionism was imminent, the pharmaceutical industry largely doubled down on the reductionist approach throughout the 2000s and 2010s. Target-based drug discovery remained the dominant model, though it became increasingly supplemented with phenotypic screening approaches. However, the genomics revolution took much longer to translate into drug discovery productivity than anticipated in 2005. While next-generation sequencing and CRISPR technologies eventually enabled more sophisticated target identification and validation, the impact on overall attrition rates was gradual rather than transformative.

Several major developments shaped the post-2005 landscape:

**Rise of biologics**: Monoclonal antibodies and other biologics significantly improved success rates in certain therapeutic areas (particularly oncology and immunology) compared to small molecules, though they didn't fundamentally solve the broader attrition problem.

**Regulatory evolution**: The FDA introduced breakthrough therapy designation in 2012 and other expedited pathways, which helped accelerate some approvals but didn't address the underlying scientific challenge of predicting clinical success.

**Business model responses**: The "unsustainable" model Huang described did force major restructuring. Pfizer and other large pharma companies increasingly relied on acquisitions rather than internal R&D, purchasing smaller companies with clinical-stage assets to bypass early-stage attrition risks. This trend accelerated throughout the late 2000s and 2010s.

**Technology investments fell short**: Massive investments in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology produced valuable scientific insights but didn't deliver the dramatic productivity improvements hoped for in 2005. High-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry, which were expected to transform drug discovery, instead produced libraries of compounds that often failed for unexpected toxicology reasons—precisely the problem Huang identified.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Genomics and other "-omics" would throw "new logs on the reductionist fire" and enable better drug target identification.
  - **Outcome**: Genomics did revolutionize biological understanding, especially after the Human Genome Project's completion and the advent of next-generation sequencing. However, the translation to reduced attrition rates was modest. While new validated drug targets emerged from genomics research, the fundamental challenge of predicting clinical efficacy and safety persisted. The reductionist approach remained dominant.

• **Prediction**: The industry would need to "switch to a different sort of system entirely" away from pure reductionism toward models closer to real living systems.
  - **Outcome**: While there was increased interest in phenotypic screening and complex cell-based assays, the wholesale shift to non-reductionist approaches never materialized. Pharmaceutical companies adopted hybrid models but continued to rely heavily on target-based approaches. Animal models improved but remained imperfect predictors of human outcomes.

• **Prediction**: Better animal models and faster progression to human trials would be necessary, requiring improved toxicology understanding.
  - **Outcome**: Progress in animal models was incremental rather than revolutionary. The industry did move toward earlier human testing through microdosing and Phase 0 trials, but these approaches had limited uptake. Toxicology prediction remained a major challenge, with unexpected safety issues continuing to cause late-stage failures.

• **Prediction**: The "unsustainable" business model would force fundamental changes.
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate but not in the way the author anticipated. Rather than scientific transformation, companies adapted through business model changes: increased outsourcing, greater reliance on biotech acquisitions, portfolio optimization, and partnerships with academic institutions. R&D productivity remained stubbornly low despite these adaptations.

• **Prediction**: "Sheer brute force" testing might become necessary if scientific approaches didn't improve.
  - **Outcome**: The industry did increasingly rely on larger trial sizes and broader screening approaches, but the cost constraints limited truly brute-force approaches. The fundamental economics of drug development meant that even with brute force, late-stage failures remained devastatingly expensive.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article was prescient in identifying the fundamental sustainability crisis facing pharmaceutical R&D, and Huang's 96% attrition statistic accurately captured a problem that persisted for decades. The piece correctly anticipated that existing approaches wouldn't solve the attrition challenge quickly, though it may have been overly optimistic about how soon alternative paradigms would emerge. The themes remain highly relevant to ongoing debates about drug development productivity and innovation models.
