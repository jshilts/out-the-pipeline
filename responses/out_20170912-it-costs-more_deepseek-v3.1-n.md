# It Costs More Than This (Sep 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article critiques a JAMA Internal Medicine study that calculated the cost to develop a new cancer drug at $648 million (unadjusted) or $757 million (with 7% annual cost-of-capital adjustment), based on R&D spending by ten oncology companies that achieved their first drug approval between 2006-2015. The raw spending ranged from $157 million to $1.9 billion. 

The author, Derek Lowe, argues this estimate is misleadingly low for four reasons: (1) it includes only successful first approvals, ignoring that 90% of drugs fail in clinical trials; (2) it ignores the opportunity cost of capital; (3) the average is inflated when companies without second approvals continue spending R&D; and (4) some "cheap" approvals were reformulations or built on government-funded research, not truly novel drugs. Lowe prefers Matthew Herper's analysis showing costs approaching $2.7 billion (the Tufts estimate) or higher, and considers the JAMA figure a lower bound rather than a representative estimate. The piece emphasizes that drug development costs include both direct spending and the costs of failed trials.

## 2. HISTORY
After the article's publication, the debate over drug development costs continued, but with evolving nuance and several key developments:

First, the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development eventually updated its estimate. In 2019, the cost-of-capital–inclusive figure reached approximately $2.8 billion per approved drug. This upwards trend partly vindicated Lowe's and Herper's caution against underestimates.

Second, during the 2020–2022 COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory pathways accelerated (e.g., Emergency Use Authorizations), and novel mRNA vaccines and antivirals were developed and approved unusually quickly with substantial public funding. While these programs did not follow the traditional R&D playbook, they refocused attention on hurdles such as manufacturing scale-up, safety surveillance, and global access rather than just upfront R&D cost. Subsequent analyses of COVID-era spending (including public grants and advance purchase agreements) showed that out-of-pocket private R&D remains only part of the total cost.

Third, the biopharma industry experienced a period of rapid growth from 2017 to 2021, followed by increased scrutiny. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced Medicare drug price negotiation and inflation rebates, partly due to public concern over high launch prices despite lower FDA approval counts in some years. Policy discussions increasingly framed cost-of-capital, failure risk, and shareholder returns as factors influencing both R&D investment and drug pricing.

Fourth, oncology R&D remains one of the most expensive areas, with ongoing high failure rates in Phase II/III across many tumor types. Recent estimates still widely differ: some analyses place costs around $1–1.5 billion for single, internally developed oncology assets, while others that include trial failures, diagnostics, and combination therapy studies place them higher than $3 billion. The field has also moved toward biomarkers, personalized medicine, and real-world evidence, adding complexity and cost rather than reducing it.

Finally, the JAMA authors' focus on oncology-focused companies with first approvals between 2006–2015 reflects a specific cohort. Several of those companies later merged, struggled to achieve second approvals, or became profitable through acquisitions rather than sustained portfolio success. In that sense, Lowe's critique about future productivity proved prescient.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **The authors of the JAMA study implied that the $648–757 million average might be more representative than the Tufts $2.7 billion figure.** In reality, subsequent estimates (e.g., later Tufts updates, regulatory-impact assessments) generally stayed above $2.5–$3 billion when including capitalized costs and failures. Oncology drug costs continued to rise, particularly for precision medicines and complex trials requiring companion diagnostics. The JAMA estimate remained a frequently cited lower bound rather than a new consensus.
- **Implicit in Lowe's critique is that companies with first approvals often would not achieve a second approval easily.** This largely proved true; many small and mid-sized oncology-focused biotechs face long gaps between approvals, and some of the companies cited in the JAMA cohort were later acquired or shifted focus after struggling with their pipeline. The industry's high failure rate persisted, reinforcing that single-approval cohorts are not representative of typical R&D productivity.
- **Lowe suggested that counting R&D spending up to the present would increase the cost-per-drug.** This aligns with how many biotechs evolved after 2017; several firms continued spending for years without new approvals, effectively inflating their own per-drug cost. Conversely, companies with multiple approvals tend to have higher total R&D expenditures and, sometimes, a lower average cost-per-drug due to shared infrastructure and learning effects.
- **The underlying premise that the debate would never end.** This has held true: publications and policy discussions through 2024 still present widely different cost figures depending on methodology and scope (e.g., including diagnostics, post-marketing studies, rare disease vs. oncology, public vs. private funding). New modeling approaches have emerged, but no single number has become universally accepted.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article addresses a persistent, high-stakes issue in drug pricing and R&D policy, dissecting methodology that has practical implications for industry funding and public perception. The arguments remain relevant today, though the discussion has expanded to include pandemic-era dynamics and policy changes like the IRA.
