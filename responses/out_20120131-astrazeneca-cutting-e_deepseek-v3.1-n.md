# AstraZeneca Cutting Even More? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief January 2012 blog post reported that British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca was preparing to announce thousands of additional job cuts, citing British press coverage. The article mentioned that approximately 3,000 more jobs were at risk, with the company's official statement emphasizing a "clear focus on cash and value creation." The piece characterized this as "less-than-cheerful" news while acknowledging that concrete details were still emerging, with promises to provide updates as the situation developed.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2012 job cuts were part of a broader restructuring trend at AstraZeneca that continued throughout the early 2010s. Following this period:

**Business Performance & Restructuring:**
- AstraZeneca did implement significant workforce reductions between 2012-2016, ultimately cutting over 20,000 jobs globally as part of cost-saving initiatives
- The company faced patent cliffs on major drugs including Crestor, Seroquel, and Nexium, which caused substantial revenue declines
- CEO Pascal Soriot took over in 2012 and implemented a major turnaround strategy focused on R&D productivity

**Drug Pipeline & FDA Approvals:**
- Significant later successes included cancer drugs Tagrisso (osimertinib, approved 2015) and Imfinzi (durvalumab, approved 2017) for lung cancer
- The company had multiple FDA approvals in the years following 2012, though many came several years later
- Some pipeline candidates failed in clinical trials during this period

**Business Impact:**
- The job cuts were real and substantial, affecting primarily R&D and manufacturing positions
- Investors generally supported the efficiency measures, with stock performance improving after 2012
- The company shifted focus toward specialty care areas like oncology, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases
