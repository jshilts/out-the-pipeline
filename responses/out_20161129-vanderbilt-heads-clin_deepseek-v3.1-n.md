# Vanderbilt Heads Into the Clinic for Alzheimer's (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
In late 2016, Vanderbilt University's Center for Neuroscience Drug Discovery was preparing to take an Alzheimer's drug candidate into Phase I clinical trials independently, without pharmaceutical industry collaboration—a rare move in academic medicine. This came after previous collaborations with AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb on M4 and M1 muscarinic receptor programs were discontinued when those companies exited neuroscience research.

The compound was a selective positive allosteric modulator of the M1 muscarinic receptor, designed to address the side effect problems that plagued previous muscarinic agonists like xanomeline. The goal was to "de-risk" the compound through Phase I safety and pharmacokinetic studies, then license it to a larger pharmaceutical company for subsequent development. Vanderbilt had no intention of taking the drug through the expensive later-stage trials required for Alzheimer's treatments.

## 2. HISTORY
**Vanderbilt's M1 PAM Program (2016-present):**
The compound discussed was VU319, a selective M1 muscarinic positive allosteric modulator. Vanderbilt did successfully complete Phase I trials demonstrating safety and acceptable pharmacokinetics. In 2019, the university licensed the M1 PAM program to **Neuren Pharmaceuticals** (Australia). Neuren subsequently formed a joint venture called **AN2 Therapeutics** with Vanderbilt to develop the compounds.

**Clinical Trial Results:**
- **Phase 1b/2a study (NCT04192967):** Initiated for cognitive impairment and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, but **terminated in 2022** due to formulation challenges (not safety concerns)
- The program faced significant manufacturing and formulation development issues that proved more challenging than anticipated

**Related M1 Muscarinic Developments:**
Both Karuna Therapeutics (founded 2009) achieved major success with its M1 preferring muscarinic agonist **KarXT (xanomeline-trospium)**:
- 2023: Positive Phase 3 results for schizophrenia treatment
- September 2024: **FDA approved KarXT** for schizophrenia
- KarXT is in Phase 3 trials for Alzheimer's disease psychosis
- Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Karuna for $14 billion in December 2023

**Scientific Validation:**
The allosteric modulator approach Vanderbilt pursued has continued to generate interest. Cadent Therapeutics (acquired by Novartis in 2020) and other companies have advanced M1 PAM programs, though no FDA-approved drugs using this mechanism have reached market for Alzheimer's disease yet.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"First academic center to go into Phase I completely without industry collaboration"** ✓ **Partially accurate** - While rare, other academic institutions had previously conducted IND-enabling studies independently, though Vanderbilt's comprehensive approach was indeed pioneering
• **"Will need to license to larger company after Phase I"** ✓ **Correct** - Vanderbilt successfully licensed the program to Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2019 exactly as envisioned
• **"Too expensive for university to go all the way alone"** ✓ **Correct** - The program did require industry partnership for further development
• **implied prediction that M1 allosteric modulators could avoid toxicity problems** ✓ **Mixed/Too early** - Phase 1 safety was achieved, but subsequent development encountered formulation rather than toxicity issues
• **"Even successful Phase I might not guarantee industry partnership"** ✓ **Incorrect** - Despite challenges, industry did step in (Neuren partnership)

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This captures a genuine inflection point in academic drug development, predating the success of related M1-targeting approaches.
