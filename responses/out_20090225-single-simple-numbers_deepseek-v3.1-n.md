# Single, Simple Numbers: Use At Your Own Risk (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on a Wired article by Felix Salmon that critiqued the mathematical formula (likely referring to the Gaussian copula function) used by Wall Street to price correlated risks in debt securities. The author extends this cautionary tale to drug discovery and development, noting how similar temptations exist to reduce complex uncertainties—such as pipeline compound failure risks, mechanism-related correlations, or patent exposure—into "single, simple numbers." The key distinction highlighted is that the biopharma industry had not (at that time) convinced itself it had everything figured out, nor had it layered billions in derivative securities onto drug development programs. The piece serves as a warning against over-reliance on formulas that claim to quantify complex systems into one easy-to-use metric.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication in 2009, the broader lessons about modeling complex risks gained traction in biopharma in several concrete ways:

- **Clinical Development Realism**: By the mid-2010s, industry-wide clinical success rates remained low and variable, reinforcing the difficulty of reducing pipeline risk to simple numbers. Oncology drugs in Phase I had success rates around 5-10%, while metabolic and cardiovascular programs fared better but still faced high attrition. Real-world data consistently showed high single-digit to low double-digit overall success rates from Phase I to approval, underscoring that "single number" forecasts remained hazardous.

- **Portfolio and Pipeline Valuation**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted probabilistic models and scenario analyses for pipeline valuation rather than single-point estimates. Methods such as risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV) incorporating stage-specific success probabilities became standard, yet these were often applied with explicit uncertainty ranges rather than collapsed into one "magic number."

- **Regulatory and Political Shocks**: The article hinted at risks like Supreme Court decisions altering patent law. After 2009, the America Invents Act (2011) and key court rulings (e.g., Mayo v. Prometheus, 2012; Myriad, 2013; Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank, 2014) materially changed patent eligibility for diagnostics, personalized medicine, and software-related inventions. These shifts were difficult to quantify in advance and affected company valuations and R&D strategies in ways that single-number patent "odds" could not capture.

- **Mechanism- and Target-Based Correlations**: Correlation risks became evident in practice. For example: 
  - **BACE inhibitors for Alzheimer's**: Development programs targeting BACE (β-secretase) saw multiple late-stage failures and toxicity signals despite early promise, impacting numerous companies (e.g., Merck's verubecestat halted in Phase III around 2017; Eli Lilly's lanabecestat halted in 2018; Johnson & Johnson halted atabecestat in 2018).
  - **CETP inhibitors for cardiovascular disease**: Multiple programs (e.g., Pfizer's torcetrapib, Roche's dalcetrapib, Eli Lilly's evacetrapib) failed in Phase III, challenging the "one mechanism, many backups" assumption.
  
- **Capital Allocation and R&D Spending**: Pharmaceutical companies generally avoided issuing complex derivatives tied directly to pipeline assets. Instead, they focused on in-licensing, portfolio pruning, and milestone-driven deal structures that recognized irreducible uncertainty. R&D productivity debates continued through the 2010s, with recognition that spending more did not guarantee better outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction**: The author hinted that biopharma could follow Wall Street's path by building financial derivatives on drug development programs or adopting oversimplified risk formulas.  
  - **Outcome**: This did not materialize in a major way. There were no widespread derivatives or structured products backed by drug pipeline risk. Venture capital, biotech funding, and pharma partnerships continued to rely on milestone-based financing and risk-sharing, rather than "single number" trading of pipeline risk. Some firms developed quantitative R&D models, but these generally incorporated uncertainty ranges and sensitivity analyses, avoiding the "one easy-to-use number" trap Salmon described.

- **Implicit note on correlation risks**: The article suggested that correlated failures by mechanism or target could undermine simple portfolio diversification.  
  - **Outcome**: This was borne out repeatedly. BACE and CETP inhibitor examples showed that common mechanisms could lead to shared failures across companies. Conversely, technologies such as checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1/PD-L1) demonstrated correlation in success, benefiting multiple firms (Merck's Keytruda, Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo, Roche's Tecentriq).

- **Patent and policy risks**: The article noted that legal rulings could shift patent exposure across the industry.  
  - **Outcome**: Post-2009 rulings (as noted above) fundamentally altered patent strategies, especially for diagnostics, biomarkers, and personalized therapies. This led companies to rely more on trade secrets, regulatory exclusivity, and complex patent claim strategies rather than simple "patent risk scores."

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This commentary intelligently connects financial modeling risks to drug development, and its warning against reducing complex systems to single metrics remains relevant. However, it focuses more on analogy than concrete developments in biotech.
