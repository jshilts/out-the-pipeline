# Advertising in the Supplementary Information? (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a conflict between scientific transparency and publication ethics. A researcher reported that an ACS (American Chemical Society) journal asked authors to remove vendor and manufacturer names from their Supporting Information, fearing these mentions could be construed as advertising or that authors might have received academic discounts influencing their reagent selections.

The author argues strongly against this policy, noting that many chemical reagents and equipment (such as palladium catalysts and HPLC columns) show significant variation between suppliers, making vendor specification essential for experimental reproducibility. The correspondent suggested a compromise: listing all brands while disclosing any discounts received.

## 2. HISTORY

The concern described in this 2013 article reflects emerging discussions about transparency and reproducibility in scientific publishing. In the subsequent decade, several developments occurred:

**Reproducibility Crisis Recognition**: The mid-2010s saw increased awareness of reproducibility problems in scientific research. Major initiatives emerged, including the NIH's focus on rigor and reproducibility starting around 2014-2015, and various journal policies emphasizing detailed methods reporting.

**Materials Transparency Policies**: Most major scientific journals, including ACS publications, now actively encourage or require detailed materials specification. Rather than suppressing vendor information, policies evolved toward requiring it. Nature journals, for example, implemented detailed reporting standards for biological research around 2013-2015.

**Open Science Movement**: The push for transparency intensified through the 2010s. Efforts like the Materials Design Analysis Reporting (MDAR) framework, developed collaboratively by journals including ACS publications, now promote comprehensive materials and reagents documentation.

The specific concern about "advertising" appears to have been an isolated or short-lived issue. Current practice strongly favors full vendor disclosure for reproducibility purposes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in this article. The piece was descriptive rather than predictive, documenting a policy concern and advocating for transparency in materials reporting. The author's preference for full vendor disclosure aligns with what ultimately became standard scientific practice.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article addresses a narrow publication policy concern from over a decade ago that appears to have been resolved in favor of the author's advocated position. While vendor disclosure and materials transparency remain important issues, this specific ACS policy concern seems like a temporary problem that didn't have broad or lasting impact.
