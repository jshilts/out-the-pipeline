# Unacceptable (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on a resurgence of animal rights activism targeting pharmaceutical companies in Connecticut, drawing parallels to earlier harassment campaigns in New Jersey during the early 1990s. The author notes that these activists are engaging in street protests and distributing threatening materials to intimidate employees, particularly as part of an ongoing campaign against Huntingdon Life Sciences.

The author expresses willingness to engage in rational debate about animal testing but dismisses these activists as uninterested in reasoned discussion. The piece serves primarily as a warning to researchers working with animal assays, advising them to maintain security awareness given the unpredictable nature of such campaigns. The author defends animal testing as currently irreplaceable in medical research, stating that mice and rats bear most testing burden, and characterizes those who would shut down such research as "ethically deranged."

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2007 article saw significant developments in both animal rights activism and alternatives to animal testing:

**Activism Escalation:** The late 2000s through early 2010s marked a peak period for animal rights extremism in the United States and Europe. High-profile cases included the 2009 indictment of four animal rights activists under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act for campaigns against Huntingdon Life Sciences, which resulted in prison sentences. The FBI continued to classify some animal rights groups as domestic terrorism threats through this period.

**Regulatory and Policy Changes:** The FDA Modernization Act 2.0, passed in December 2022, eliminated the federal requirement for animal testing in drug development, allowing drugmakers to use alternative methods when appropriate. This represented the most significant policy shift, though the FDA still maintains that animal studies may be necessary for certain applications. The EU had already banned animal testing for cosmetics in 2013.

**Scientific Alternatives Development:** Between 2007-2024, substantial progress occurred in developing alternatives including organ-on-a-chip technology, advanced computer modeling, human cell-based assays, and AI-powered drug discovery platforms. However, animal testing remains widespread—over 90% of drugs that pass animal testing still fail in human clinical trials, highlighting both the limitations of animal models and the continued reliance on them.

**Industry Impact:** Pharmaceutical companies generally enhanced security measures for research facilities and employee protection. Huntingdon Life Sciences continued operations despite sustained activist pressure, being acquired by Envigo in 2015, which later faced its own animal welfare controversies and facility closures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions about the future, but contained several implicit assumptions worth evaluating:

• **Implicit assumption that animal testing would remain irreplaceable "for the foreseeable future"**: This has proven partially accurate—animal testing remains widely used today, however the 2022 FDA Modernization Act removing the mandatory requirement represents a significant policy shift the author did not anticipate. Alternative methods have gained substantial ground but haven't eliminated animal testing as predicted.

• **No apparent anticipation of major policy changes**: The categorical statement about no other way to do medical research didn't account for potential regulatory evolution. The FDA policy change demonstrates that institutional frameworks can adapt more quickly than the underlying science.

• **Continuation of activist tactics**: This proved accurate—activist campaigns continued and even intensified in the years immediately following 2007, though the most extreme tactics eventually led to federal prosecutions that may have had some deterrent effect on illegal activities.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captures an important cultural moment in the tension between animal rights activism and pharmaceutical research, and it correctly anticipated ongoing conflicts. However, it missed the significant policy evolution that would eventually occur regarding alternatives to animal testing.
