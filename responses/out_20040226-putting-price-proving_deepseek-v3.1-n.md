# Putting A Price on Proving It (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2004 commentary addresses the pharmaceutical industry's resistance to comparative effectiveness research, using erythropoietin drugs as a case study. At the time, Medicare planned to compare Amgen's and Johnson & Johnson's versions of the protein therapy, with J&J's product priced at one-third of Amgen's. However, Medicare legislation included a provision preventing the program from using comparative effectiveness evidence in payment decisions, leading Amgen to argue such studies were pointless.

The author acknowledges that while drug companies blocking comparative studies appears self-serving, other industries aren't required to prove their products outperform competitors through head-to-head trials. The piece highlights that comparative drug trials are complex, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring multiple studies to answer key questions. The author proposes requiring "me-too" drugs to demonstrate evidence for whatever differentiating factor they claim, facilitating comparison against existing treatments rather than just placebos. This would necessitate significant FDA regulatory changes and would increase costs passed on to patients.

## 2. HISTORY  

In the years following this article, comparative effectiveness research became more prominent rather than less. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research, leading to the creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in 2010 through the Affordable Care Act. These developments institutionalized the very type of comparative effectiveness research the article discussed.

Regarding erythropoietin specifically, the market evolved with significant safety concerns emerging years later. The FDA added black box warnings in 2007 for increased cardiovascular risks, mortality, tumor progression, and severe side effects at higher doses for both drugs. By 2007-2008, studies showed erythropoietin-stimulating agents actually increased mortality in cancer patients when used to achieve higher hemoglobin targets, leading to major safety restrictions and reduced usage.

The broader pharmaceutical regulatory environment did shift somewhat toward comparative effectiveness considerations, though not as dramatically as the author's proposal would have required. The FDA typically continued to accept placebo-controlled trials for approval, while payers increasingly demanded comparative evidence for coverage and reimbursement decisions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Companies would pass on increased regulatory costs to patients** - This proved largely accurate. Drug development costs have continued rising, although determining exact cost attribution remains complex. List prices for many drugs have increased substantially since 2004.

• **Prediction: Comparative effectiveness research would face industry resistance** - Correct, though the political landscape evolved. The creation of PCORI faced pharmaceutical industry opposition initially, but comparative effectiveness research became more institutionalized despite continued industry concerns about its application.

• **Prediction: Medicare provision preventing comparative evidence use was problematic** - This barrier was reduced over time. The 2010 healthcare reform began shifting toward value-based approaches, though Medicare drug pricing negotiations remained limited until much later legislation.

• **Broader prediction for erythropoietin class**: The author's general discussion suggested these expensive bioengineered proteins were reasonable targets for comparison. In reality, the entire class faced major safety crises within 3-4 years that dramatically changed the risk-benefit calculation beyond simple comparative effectiveness between the two specific drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article showed reasonable prescience about emerging tensions in pharmaceutical regulation and cost effectiveness, and highlighted a case study that indeed proved important when major safety issues emerged years later.
