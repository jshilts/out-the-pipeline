# Making New Building Blocks, For Fun and Profit (November 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a significant shift in medicinal chemistry where researchers increasingly rely on large catalogs of readily available chemical building blocks and intermediates rather than pursuing complex synthesis. The author references a Janssen (J&J) paper on "Unorderable But Readily Synthesizable" building blocks, which demonstrates computational approaches to identify new synthetic targets.

The Janssen team used the ASKCOS software suite to analyze simple bicyclic amino alcohols and hydroxy compounds, filtering a database of 223,163 potential alcohols down to 338 candidates using computational predictions. They prioritized 12 compounds for actual synthesis. The practical results were mixed - some reactions worked with minor optimization, but several failed due to either chemistry difficulties or vendor supply chain issues. The article emphasizes that while computational tools are rapidly improving, they need skilled chemists to validate and optimize predictions.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this article was published, several major developments have shaped the building blocks and computational chemistry landscape:

**Computational Tools Advancements:** ASKCOS and similar retrosynthesis platforms have shown continued improvement, though challenges remain. The difficulty highlighted in the article - distinguishing between C-methylation and N-methylation feasibility - reflects ongoing work in reaction condition prediction and selectivity modeling.

**Building Block Market Evolution:** While specific sales figures aren't available, the commercial building block market has generally expanded, with companies like Enamine, WuXi AppTec, and Sigma-Aldrich maintaining large catalogs. However, the fundamental challenge of "unorderable but synthesizable" compounds persists - vendors cannot stock everything.

**Synthetic Feasibility Focus:** The core insight from 2021 - that computational prediction needs experimental validation - has been reinforced. Many pharmaceutical companies now employ hybrid approaches where AI suggests synthons and human chemists validate. The "last mile" problem of reaction optimization remains significant.

**No Major Policy Changes:** There have been no significant regulatory shifts around building block availability or computational chemistry standards in drug discovery since 2021.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained these key predictions and subsequent outcomes:

- **Prediction: Software will continue improving faster than human chemists in retrosynthesis planning**  
  **Outcome:** Computational tools have improved, particularly in reaction condition suggestions and route scoring. However, the scenario they described - only 8 of 12 top candidates being synthesizable - remains typical. The human-element need for reaction optimization is still crucial.

- **Prediction: Only 4 of the 12 specifically listed compounds could not be synthesized, in part due to vendor supply issues**  
  **Outcome:** This represents a broader pattern that remains true. Supply chains for specialized building blocks remain a bottleneck.

- **Prediction: The field would see value in systematically attacking the supposed 124,000 easy-to-make building blocks**  
  **Outcome:Unknown.** Only pharmacos can release internal data on such systematic campaigns. The fact that a systematic public catalog of these doesn't dominate the literature weighs against broad success.

- **Prediction: Medicinal chemistry would increasingly rely on knowledge-based filtering to create privileged collections**  
  **Outcome:** While true, this was already a trend by 2021. The emergence of fragment-based drug discovery further intensified interest in broad screening libraries.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article demonstrates moderate interest as it captures a nuanced shift in medicinal chemistry practice - the integration of computational tools while acknowledging their limitations. However, it focuses more on methodology and vendor challenges than on actual drug development impact or clinical breakthroughs.
