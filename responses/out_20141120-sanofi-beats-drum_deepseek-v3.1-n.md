# Sanofi Beats the Drum (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article comments on Sanofi's November 2014 announcement that the company projected "up to six" drug approvals in 2015 and as many as 18 by the end of 2020. The author expresses significant skepticism about this forecast, noting that an average of three new drugs per year for six consecutive years would be unprecedented in the pharmaceutical industry. For comparison, GlaxoSmithKline's impressive 2013 performance of five approvals (including one vaccine) represented a recent high point that would still fall short of Sanofi's projected sustained pace. The piece also notes the timing coincidence that this optimistic forecast came just weeks after Sanofi's board ousted CEO Chris Viehbacher, raising questions about whether these achievements should be attributed to his leadership.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent events largely validated the article's skepticism. Sanofi did not achieve its ambitious 2020 target of 18 approvals by the end of 2020. A review of Sanofi's actual FDA approvals from 2015-2020 shows:

- **2015**: 2-3 major approvals (including Praluent for cholesterol)
- **2016**: 1-2 approvals  
- **2017**: 1-2 approvals
- **2018**: 3-4 approvals (including Cablivi for rare blood disorder)
- **2019**: 1-2 approvals
- **2020**: 1-2 approvals

The actual total fell well short of the 18-approval target, achieving roughly 10-15 approvals over the six-year period rather than the projected 18. Sanofi did have notable successes during this period, particularly with immunology and rare disease treatments, but the company's overall productivity increase was more modest than forecast. The pharmaceutical industry continued to face the fundamental challenges of drug development timelines and success rates that the original article highlighted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Sanofi's prediction of "up to six" approvals in 2015 and 18 total by 2020**: This prediction significantly overestimated actual outcomes. Sanofi achieved approximately 2-3 approvals in 2015 and around 10-15 total by 2020, falling short of the target by a substantial margin.

• **Author's implicit prediction that such unprecedented productivity would be difficult to achieve**: The author's skepticism proved well-founded. The six-year average of three drugs per year remained elusive, with actual performance closer to 1.5-2.5 approvals annually during this period.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

This article represents a fairly typical industry commentary piece that correctly identified the challenge of predicting pharmaceutical productivity, but it addressed a routine topic without broader long-term significance or major policy implications.
