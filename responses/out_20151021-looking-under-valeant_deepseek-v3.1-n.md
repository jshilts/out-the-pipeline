# Looking Under the Valeant Pharmaceuticals Rock (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes emerging revelations about Valeant Pharmaceuticals' controversial business practices, building on the author's previous criticism of the company's strategy of acquiring drugs and drastically raising prices rather than investing in R&D. The piece highlights investigative work by short-selling firms and journalists uncovering Valeant's secret financial connections to Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy operation that Valeant was planning to purchase.

Key findings include evidence that Valeant created a network of seemingly independent pharmacies to stuff distribution channels and potentially book phantom sales, with Philidor and R&O Pharmacy in California sharing the same ownership and management despite appearing separate. The article also notes that Valeant's head of audit committee had undisclosed ties to someone convicted of stock fraud, and that the company had reversed its long-standing position by suddenly promising to increase R&D spending after years of criticism.

## 2. HISTORY

The revelations detailed in this October 2015 article marked the beginning of Valeant's spectacular collapse. In the months that followed, the company became embroiled in multiple scandals that destroyed billions in shareholder value and led to major corporate governance overhauls:

**Immediate Impact**: Valeant's stock price plummeted from over $260 per share in August 2015 to under $30 by March 2016, wiping out approximately $80 billion in market capitalization. The company cut ties with Philidor and took charges of over $250 million related to sales through the pharmacy.

**Congressional and Regulatory Investigations**: In 2016, Valeant faced multiple congressional investigations into drug pricing practices, with CEO Michael Pearson testifying before the Senate Aging Committee. The company's relationship with Philidor became a focal point, leading to SEC and Department of Justice investigations.

**Management Overhaul**: Pearson was forced out as CEO in 2016 and replaced by Joseph Papa from Perrigo Company. The board underwent significant changes, with activist investor Bill Ackman joining in 2016 before selling his entire stake at a massive loss in 2017.

**Financial Restatements and Debt Crisis**: Valeant was forced to restate earnings in 2016 after admitting to improperly recognizing revenue from Philidor. The company struggled under $30 billion in debt accumulated during its acquisition spree, leading to asset sales including the divestiture of Dendreon's prostate cancer drug Provenge and various skincare brands.

**Corporate Transformation**: The company rebranded to Bausch Health Companies in 2018, shifting focus to its Bausch + Lomb eye health division and Salix gastrointestinal business. Under new leadership, it began investing modestly in R&D programs.

**Public Policy Changes**: The Valeant scandal, along with other drug pricing controversies, contributed to increased public scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and helped spur state-level drug price transparency legislation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions and concerns proved remarkably prescient:

• **Financial wrongdoing concerns were validated**: The suspicions about inappropriate accounting and channel stuffing through Philidor were confirmed when Valeant restated earnings and severed the relationship, validating the investigative work cited in the article.

• **The company's credibility collapse**: The author's skepticism about Valeant's sudden R&D pivot proved justified, as the company's credibility was destroyed by the scandal, leading to executive departures and leadership changes.

• **Stock value destruction foreshadowed**: The article noted Valeant's stock falling $34 per share on the day of publication; this was just the beginning of a catastrophic decline from over $260 to eventually under $10 per share.

• **Quality of corporate governance concerns confirmed**: The article's mention of problematic audit committee oversight was borne out when the company admitted to accounting irregularities and replaced much of its leadership and board.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 8**

This article represents a watershed moment in business journalism, where investigative work by short-sellers and bloggers exposed massive corporate malfeasance before mainstream outlets. It demonstrates the critical importance of financial journalism in an era of complex corporate structures designed to obscure wrongdoing, with real-world policy and regulatory consequences that still echo in pharmaceutical industry practices today.
