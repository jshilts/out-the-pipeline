# Suing A Generic Drug Maker: When And How? (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an upcoming Supreme Court case, *Mutual Pharmaceutical v. Bartlett*, concerning a New Hampshire woman, Karen Bartlett, who developed severe toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) after taking generic sulindac, an NSAID, and won a $21 million judgment against the generic manufacturer. The central legal question is whether a generic drug maker can be held liable for injuries caused by a drug it did not discover, develop, or originally test. This contrasts with a 2010 case, *Pliva v. Mensing*, which focused on label warnings and limited generic makers' liability because they have little control over the drug's label. The article highlights the tension between holding generic manufacturers accountable and the fact that they are merely duplicating an already FDA-approved, long-standing drug. The author speculates the Supreme Court may lean on federal regulatory pre-emption, noting the Obama administration's reversal to support this view, while former FDA commissioners argue against it, warning that removing the threat of lawsuits could weaken manufacturer vigilance.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the article's publication, the Supreme Court ruled on the case, **Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett, 570 U.S. 472 (2013)**. In a 5-4 decision, the Court sided with the generic drug manufacturer, Mutual Pharmaceutical, effectively overturning the $21 million judgment awarded to Karen Bartlett. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Alito, held that federal law pre-empted state-law design-defect claims against generic drug manufacturers. The reasoning was that a generic drug must be identical to the brand-name drug in active ingredient, safety, and labeling. Since a generic manufacturer cannot independently alter the drug's composition or its federally approved label, it cannot comply with a state-law judgment that would effectively declare the drug "defective." This decision significantly expanded the scope of pre-emption established in *Pliva v. Mensing* to include design-defect claims, not just failure-to-warn claims.

This ruling had several major real-world implications. It further solidified a legal shield for generic drug manufacturers, enhancing what has been called "generic pre-emption." For patients injured by generic drugs, the decision effectively closed the door on design-defect lawsuits at the state level. With both failure-to-warn and design-defect claims pre-empted, injured patients have very limited, if any, legal recourse against generic manufacturers, creating a significant disparity in liability between brand-name and generic drug makers. This disparity persists today as a major feature of pharmaceutical tort law in the United States. The FDA has not changed its regulations to alter this fundamental framework for generic drugs in response to this ruling. While the issue has been raised in subsequent legislative proposals and legal scholarship, the core holding of *Mutual v. Bartlett* remains a significant precedent that shapes the legal risks and liabilities within the generic drug market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions, primarily regarding the Supreme Court's likely ruling and its basis:

*   **Prediction:** The Supreme Court would likely find a way to rule in favor of generic drug company Mutual Pharmaceutical, making it a federal regulatory pre-emption case while distinguishing it from *Wyeth v. Levine*.
    *   **Outcome:** This prediction was accurate. The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision did indeed find in favor of Mutual Pharmaceutical, based on the principle of federal pre-emption, agreeing that generic drug manufacturers are shielded from state-level design-defect lawsuits under federal law.
*   **Prediction:** If pre-emption were upheld, Karen Bartlett would be left with "no recourse" for the severe injuries she suffered.
    *   **Outcome:** This prediction was also correct. The Supreme Court's ruling effectively eliminated her $21 million judgment and left her without a viable state-law tort claim against the generic manufacturer, affirming the "cold" reality that no legal remedy was available to her under the pre-emption doctrine.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article discusses a landmark Supreme Court case that directly shaped the legal landscape for generic drug manufacturers. The Court's ruling established a stark liability shield, creating a profound legal asymmetry for injured patients and profoundly impacting the balance between federal regulation and state tort law in the pharmaceutical industry.
