# Drug Discovery on Radio 4 (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece references a BBC Radio 4 documentary titled **“The End of Drug Discovery”** (aired May 2012).  The programme presented a lay‑person’s overview of why bringing a new medicine to market had become increasingly difficult.  It highlighted the high cost of research, the low success rate of candidate molecules, the shift from “big‑screen” chemistry‑driven screens to target‑centric approaches, and the growing reliance of pharmaceutical companies on large‑scale collaborations and external innovation.  Interviews with academic scientists, industry executives, and policy analysts underscored a sense that traditional small‑molecule pipelines were stalling and that the industry might need to reinvent its discovery model.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Productivity trends (2012‑2024)** – The “productivity gap” noted in 2012 persisted for several years.  Between 2010 and 2020, the number of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved by the FDA hovered around 20‑30 per year, while R&D spending rose from ≈ $120 bn to > $200 bn.  However, the composition of the pipeline shifted dramatically:

* **Biologics and cell‑based therapies** – From 2012 to 2024, biologics grew from ~ 30 % to > 50 % of all FDA approvals.  CAR‑T cell products (e.g., *Kymriah* 2017, *Yescarta* 2017) and gene‑therapy approvals (*Luxturna* 2017, *Zolgensma* 2019) demonstrated that the industry was indeed moving beyond classic small‑molecule chemistry.  

* **mRNA platforms** – The rapid development of COVID‑19 vaccines (Pfizer‑BioNTech, Moderna) in 2020‑21 proved that nucleic‑acid‑based drug platforms could move from concept to market in under a year, a stark contrast to the decade‑long timelines discussed in the 2012 programme.

* **AI‑driven discovery** – The first AI‑designed drug to enter human trials, **DSP‑1181** (Insilico Medicine, 2020), and later **BenevolentAI’s** ALS‑targeting small molecule (2022) showed that computational methods could generate viable candidates, though the overall impact on approval rates remains modest.

* **Phenotypic resurgence** – After the 2010s focus on target‑centric screens, several companies (e.g., Janssen, Merck) re‑invested in phenotypic assays, leading to the discovery of **pafolacianine** (Cytalux, 2021) and **selinexor** (Xpovio, 2019).  The balance between phenotypic and target‑based approaches is now more nuanced rather than a wholesale abandonment of either.

* **Regulatory and policy shifts** – The FDA’s **Breakthrough Therapy** designation (launched 2012) and **Accelerated Approval** pathways have been used increasingly (≈ 30 % of approvals in 2023), helping faster market entry for drugs addressing unmet needs.  The European Medicines Agency introduced similar adaptive pathways, but no major legislative overhaul directly addressed the “end of discovery” narrative.

* **Industry consolidation** – Large pharma continued to acquire biotech firms to replenish pipelines (e.g., Roche‑Genentech, Pfizer‑Array BioPharma).  This trend aligns with the 2012 observation that external innovation was becoming essential.

Overall, the dire prediction that drug discovery would “end” did not materialise.  The field diversified: small‑molecule chemistry remains important, but biologics, nucleic‑acid therapeutics, and AI‑assisted design now occupy a substantial share of R&D effort.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (as inferred from the 2012 programme) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Traditional small‑molecule pipelines would dry up, leading to a collapse in new drug approvals.** | Small‑molecule NMEs continued to be approved (≈ 15‑20 yr⁻¹), but their share fell from ~ 70 % (pre‑2012) to ~ 30 % by 2024.  The overall number of approvals remained stable because biologics and other modalities filled the gap. |
| **Biologics would dominate the market within a decade.** | By 2024, biologics accounted for > 50 % of FDA approvals, confirming the trend, though small molecules still contributed a sizable fraction. |
| **AI and big‑data approaches would revolutionise lead identification within a few years.** | AI‑generated candidates entered early‑phase trials (first in 2020) and a handful progressed to later stages, but they have not yet produced a blockbuster.  The technology is now a valuable tool rather than a wholesale replacement for medicinal chemistry. |
| **The industry would shift heavily toward external collaborations and outsourcing.** | The “open‑innovation” model expanded: > 70 % of large‑pharma R&D budgets are now spent on external assets (licensing, acquisitions, CROs).  This matches the 2012 forecast. |
| **Regulatory reforms would dramatically accelerate approvals.** | New pathways (Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track) have shortened development times for certain drugs, but the average time from IND to approval remains ~ 8‑10 years for most programs.  The impact is significant but not a wholesale acceleration. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when the industry was confronting a productivity crisis; its themes remain relevant as the sector continues to evolve across multiple therapeutic modalities.  The discussion is historically informative but not groundbreaking, hence a solid above‑average interest score.
