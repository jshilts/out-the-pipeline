# Pick Your Stench (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a lighthearted commentary on two concurrent odor-related incidents in Europe in January 2013. The first was an industrial-scale spill of butyl mercaptan in Rouen, France, whose smell had reached London. The second was 27 tons of burning goat cheese in Norway. The author jests about choosing between these two stenches, ultimately preferring the "devil I know" (mercaptan) over the unknown olfactory horror of a goat cheese inferno, and provides technical details about natural gas odorant compositions.

## 2. HISTORY
**The Rouen mercaptan spill**: On January 21, 2013, approximately 7,500 liters of butyl mercaptan spilled from a specialty chemicals company in Rouen, France. The incident was reported as one of the largest mercaptan spills in recent European history. Cleanup operations were conducted, and regulatory authorities investigated the incident. No significant policy changes or long-term regulatory reforms resulted from this specific event.

**The Norway goat cheese fire**: The 27-ton goat cheese fire occurred at a Norwegian dairy facility. The incident was contained and extinguished by local fire services. It remained a minor industrial incident with limited broader implications.

After the article's publication: Both incidents were resolved within days. Mercaptan spills continue to occur periodically at industrial facilities worldwide, typically managed through existing safety protocols. No major policy changes, FDA approvals, pharmaceutical developments, or significant business impacts resulted from these specific events.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained no significant predictions about the future of biotechnology, industrial chemicals, or public policy. It was purely a humorous commentary on two coincidental odor-related news events.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **0/10**
This article is entirely off-topic for biotechnology industry analysis and has no scientific or business significance beyond being a humorous blog post about odor incidents.

## 5. COMMENTS
This article has no relevance to biotechnology industry commentary, science analysis, or any substantive developments in the field. It appears to have been included in error, as it's simply a casual blog post about two unrelated odor incidents rather than meaningful biotechnology coverage.
