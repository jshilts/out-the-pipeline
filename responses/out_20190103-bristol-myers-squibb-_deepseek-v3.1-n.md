# Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene (January 3, 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the announced $74 billion acquisition of Celgene by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), noting that this was the largest pharmaceutical M&A deal since the merger wave of 1999-2009. The author observes that Celgene shareholders were getting a favorable deal given the company's stock decline from nearly $150/share in fall 2017 to $66 at announcement, following what the author characterizes as "oddly painful and quite possibly avoidable failures." The strategic rationale centers on creating a large oncology portfolio to compete with Merck in the immuno-oncology space.

The author expresses skepticism about pharmaceutical mergers generally, arguing they inevitably slow down research and development. The deal included $2.5 billion in projected "synergies," with 35% coming from R&D cuts. The piece draws parallels to Merck's 2009 acquisition of Schering-Plough, where Schering-Plough's R&D organization faced multiple rounds of cuts in roughly 80/20 ratios favoring Merck personnel retention, and notes that the Keytruda program (pembrolizumab) was barely mentioned during that acquisition despite later becoming a blockbuster. The article predicts disruption for scientists at both companies and suggests the deal would harm the broader biopharma ecosystem by removing Celgene as an active dealmaker that had been "showering money" on smaller companies.

## 2. HISTORY

The acquisition closed in November 2019 after receiving regulatory approvals, creating one of the largest pharmaceutical companies by revenue. Bristol-Myers Squibb began integrating Celgene's extensive oncology portfolio, which included Revlimid (lenalidomide), Pomalyst, and Otezla. Notably, BMS was required to divest Otezla (apremilast) to Amgen for $13.4 billion to satisfy antitrust concerns, as both companies had competing assets in the inflammation space.

In terms of R&D impact, evidence generally supported the article's concerns about integration disruption. BMS undertook restructuring that reduced the combined R&D footprint, though the company maintained focus on key therapeutic areas including oncology, cardiovascular disease, and immunology. The merger significantly strengthened BMS's position in multiple myeloma and hematological malignancies, where Celgene had established franchise drugs.

The immuno-oncology competition with Merck continued evolving after the acquisition. Both Opdivo (nivolumab) and Keytruda remained top-selling checkpoint inhibitors, with expanding indications across various cancer types. However, the broader oncology portfolio from Celgene provided BMS with complementary mechanisms beyond PD-1 inhibition.

From a shareholder perspective, BMS stock performance following the acquisition was mixed. The company faced patent cliff concerns as key drugs like Revlimid approached loss of exclusivity. Celgene's CAR-T cell therapy assets, including brexucabtagene autoleucel (later approved as Breyanzi), became part of BMS's cell therapy portfolio.

The small biopharma ecosystem adaptation proved real - with Celgene's aggressive dealmaking removed, other companies including large pharma and specialized acquirers continued to fill portions of that role, though consolidation in the sector continued through the early 2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions:

- **Celgene shareholders would benefit**: ✓ **Accurate**
  The acquisition provided exit liquidity at premium valuations for Celgene investors who had seen significant stock price decline.

- **R&D cuts would disproportionately affect Celgene scientists**: ✓ **Accurate in direction**
  Post-merger restructuring did result in R&D workforce reductions, consistent with typical integration patterns where acquired organizations face higher proportional cuts.

- **Merger would slow down research activities**: ✓ **Accurate**
  Integration of two large R&D organizations inevitably created disruption periods and reallocation of resources, though BMS maintained pipeline progression.

- **Deal would create disruptions and turmoil for scientists**: ✓ **Accurate**
  Standard M&A integration challenges occurred, including organizational restructuring, site consolidations, and portfolio prioritization decisions requiring adjustment periods.

- **Small biotech companies would miss Celgene as an active dealmaker**: ✓ **Accurate but not catastrophic**
  Celgene's acquisition appetite had indeed been notable in the ecosystem. While other companies continued M&A activity, the loss of one major acquirer did affect the competitive landscape for biotech assets.

- **BMS shareholders' outcome "remains to be seen"**: ✓ **Accurate uncertainty**
  The acquisition's long-term value creation remained debated, particularly as patent cliffs loomed for key legacy assets from both companies.

- **No problems expected with deal approval**: ✓ **Accurate**
  The transaction proceeded with standard regulatory approval, though requiring the Otezla divestiture.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides sharp insight into pharmaceutical M&A patterns and their real-world consequences, accurately predicting major outcomes while offering broader commentary on industry dynamics that remained relevant beyond this specific transaction.
