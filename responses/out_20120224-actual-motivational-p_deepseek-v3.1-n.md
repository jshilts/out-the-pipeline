# An Actual Motivational Poster (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short blog post from Science magazine references a motivational poster with the phrase "Keep Calm and Synthesize On" featuring beaker imagery, available on Etsy for $15. The author expresses uncertainty about whether such a poster would be "enough to do the job, the way the drug industry is these days," while appreciating the sentiment behind it. The post captures a moment of industry pessimism or fatigue in early 2012, implicitly suggesting that drug discovery and synthesis work had become particularly challenging or discouraging within the pharmaceutical sector at that time.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical industry landscape in 2012 was indeed facing significant challenges that contextualize the blog's weary tone. The period from roughly 2010-2015 represented what became known as the "patent cliff," where many blockbuster drugs were losing patent protection, leading to massive revenue declines. Major companies like Pfizer (Lipitor lost patent in 2011), Bristol-Myers Squibb, and AstraZeneca faced substantial pipeline gaps. Industry R&D productivity had been declining, with the cost to develop a new drug estimated at over $1 billion and approval rates remaining low.

Following 2012, several developments reshaped the industry:

**Clinical and Regulatory Trends**: The FDA approved 39 new drugs in 2012, which was near the historical average at the time. However, by 2014-2015, approvals increased notably (41 in 2014, 45 in 2015), with breakthrough therapy designations accelerating some reviews. The industry gradually recovered from the patent cliff through new launches, though R&D productivity metrics remained debated.

**Scientific Shifts**: The post-2012 period saw significant advancement in targeted therapies, particularly in oncology (immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda gained approval in 2014) and rare diseases. Gene therapy began transitioning from experimental to approved treatments (Glybera approved in Europe 2012, though later withdrawn; Luxturna approved in US 2017). CAR-T cell therapy achieved its first FDA approvals in 2017.

**Business Consolidation**: Major mergers and acquisitions continued, including Actavis acquiring Forest Labs (2014) and Allergan (2014), Pfizer's attempted acquisition of AstraZeneca (2014, failed) and successful acquisition of Hospira (2015). Cost-cutting and pipeline refocusing remained common strategies.

**Drug Development Evolution**: The industry increasingly relied on outsourcing synthesis and early-stage research to contract research organizations (CROs), with companies like WuXi AppTec and Catalent expanding significantly during this period. The "synthesize on" imperative shifted toward more targeted, rational drug design and biologics rather than purely small-molecule synthesis.

No specific policy changes directly trace to this blog post (which was essentially a cultural commentary), but it reflected broader industry sentiment that gradually improved as new therapeutic modalities and business models gained traction through the mid-2010s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains no explicit predictions about future events. It's a brief cultural observation rather than a forward-looking analysis. The implied sentiment—that drug industry conditions made motivational posters potentially insufficient—reflected contemporary challenges rather than forecasting specific outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the post captures a slice of industry sentiment from 2012, its brevity and lack of substantive analysis limit broader historical importance. It serves more as ephemeral cultural commentary than meaningful scientific or industry insight.
