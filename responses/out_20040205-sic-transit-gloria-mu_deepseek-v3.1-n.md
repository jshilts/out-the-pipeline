# Sic Transit Gloria Mundi (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reflects on Entremed's decision to discontinue development of its peptide drug candidates angiostatin and endostatin—compounds that had generated enormous hype following a 1998 New York Times article featuring a quote from James Watson suggesting cancer could be cured within two years. The author argues that while angiogenesis inhibition was a legitimate therapeutic approach (largely thanks to Judah Folkman's pioneering work), the specific focus on angiostatin and endostatin was problematic from the start due to fundamental pharmacological challenges.

The core issue identified was that these peptide-based drugs faced severe technical hurdles: difficult production and purification, poor stability, rapid enzymatic degradation in circulation, and impossibility of oral dosing. Additionally, the author notes that anti-angiogenesis therapy turned out to be more complex than initially hoped, with multiple potential targets, poor selectivity issues, and tumor-type variability. The piece criticizes the New York Times for irresponsible reporting that drove Entremed's stock to nearly $100/share while raising false hopes among cancer patients.

## 2. HISTORY

**Development of Anti-Angiogenesis Therapies (2004-2010+):** Contrary to the author's somewhat pessimistic framing, angiogenesis inhibition did eventually achieve major clinical success, though primarily through different mechanisms than Entremed's peptide approach.

**FDA-Approved Drugs and Clinical Success:**
- **Bevacizumab (Avastin)**: Approved by FDA in February 2004 (coincidentally, the same month as this article) for metastatic colorectal cancer. This monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A became a blockbuster drug, generating billions in annual revenue and gaining approval for multiple cancer types including lung, kidney, brain (glioblastoma), and ovarian cancers.
- **Sunitinib (Sutent)**: Approved in 2006 for renal cell carcinoma and GIST; this tyrosine kinase inhibitor targets multiple receptors including VEGF receptors.
- **Sorafenib (Nexavar)**: Approved in 2005 for renal and hepatocellular carcinoma.
- **Pazopanib, Axitinib, and others**: Multiple additional anti-angiogenic agents reached market success.

**The Actual Clinical Impact:**
While these approved drugs validated the angiogenesis hypothesis, the outcomes were more modest than the 1998 hype suggested. Anti-angiogenic therapies proved effective at extending survival by several months rather than "curing" cancer. Bevacizumab, for example, typically extends overall survival by 4-5 months in colorectal cancer. These drugs became standard of care in multiple tumor types but came with significant side effects including hypertension, bleeding, and impaired wound healing.

**What Happened to the Specific Compounds:**
- **Angiostatin and Endostatin**: As predicted in this article, these peptides indeed failed to reach clinical approval due to the pharmacological challenges outlined. Subsequent research showed that while they had anti-angiogenic activity, the practical drug development hurdles were insurmountable with the technology available.
- **Entremed**: The company struggled for years before eventually being acquired in 2011 by CNS Pharmaceuticals for approximately $9 million—a far cry from its 1998 peak valuation.

**Scientific Understanding Evolved:**
Research post-2004 revealed that angiogenesis involves complex interactions between multiple pro- and anti-angiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF, PDGF, angiopoietins, etc.), making single-target approaches less effective than hoped. Resistance mechanisms also emerged as a major clinical problem, with tumors developing alternative vascularization strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions Made in the Article:**
- Angiostatin and endostatin were "doomed" and "long shots" that would fail
- Anti-angiogenesis therapy would prove "more complicated than anyone thought" with uncertain target selection
- Peptide drugs would continue to face insurmountable delivery and stability challenges

**How Predictions Compared to Reality:**

✓ **Correct predictions:**
- Entremed's specific peptide candidates (angiostatin/endostatin) indeed failed to reach approval, validating the author's skepticism about peptide stability and delivery challenges
- Anti-angiogenesis did prove more complex than initially hoped, with resistance mechanisms and tumor heterogeneity limiting efficacy
- Single-target approaches showed only modest benefits rather than cures

✗ **Underestimated developments:**
- The author's generally pessimistic tone about angiogenesis inhibition overall missed that FDA approval of bevacizumab would occur within weeks of this article's publication
- Anti-angiogenic therapies, while not curative, became a standard component of cancer treatment across multiple tumor types
- The field generated multiple approved drugs (not just bevacizumab) with significant clinical uptake
- Scientific understanding of angiogenesis biology deepened substantially, leading to better drug design

⚠ **Partial accuracy:**
- While angiogenesis inhibitors proved viable, the author's caution about hype was appropriate—these drugs extended life by months rather than providing cures
- The complexity prediction was correct, but solutions emerged through combination therapies and multi-target approaches

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article represents an important case study in science journalism ethics and therapeutic development timelines, made particularly interesting by its publication timing—mere weeks before angiogenesis inhibition achieved its first major clinical validation with bevacizumab's approval, which ironically contradicted the article's pessimistic tone while validating its specific criticisms of peptide-based approaches.
