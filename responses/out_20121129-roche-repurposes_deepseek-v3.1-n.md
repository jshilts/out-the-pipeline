# Roche Repurposes (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a drug repurposing collaboration between Roche and the Broad Institute, where Roche provided 300 failed clinical candidates for screening through new assays to find alternative therapeutic applications. The author notes the potential advantages of these compounds: they've completed toxicity testing, have established formulations, known scale-up routes, and many reached Phase II, meaning they have human pharmacokinetics data. However, the piece raises skeptical counterarguments: these are essentially just 300 more compounds for screening, and successful hits would come with selectivity concerns since they already bind to other targets. The author suggests the best-case scenario involves finding that the compounds' original targets are actually good for unanticipated indications. The analysis is cautious, emphasizing that while such efforts are worth pursuing if costs remain low, they could become more complicated than initially apparent.

## 2. HISTORY
The Roche-Broad Institute collaboration reflected a broader trend in pharmaceutical R&D where companies increasingly turned to drug repurposing as a strategy. In the subsequent decade, drug repurposing gained significant momentum across the industry. Major pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sanofi, established similar initiatives to screen failed compounds for new indications.

Notably, the approach yielded both successes and limitations. Successful repurposing cases included sildenafil (Viagra), originally developed for angina but repurposed for erectile dysfunction, and thalidomide, repurposed for leprosy and multiple myeloma after its notorious history with birth defects. However, the systematic screening of failed candidates has shown mixed results. The NIH launched its own repurposing program, which has identified some promising candidates but has not produced widespread breakthroughs on the scale initially hoped.

The reality proved more challenging than anticipated. While the strategy offered potential cost and time savings compared to developing new drugs from scratch, successful repurposing candidates still faced significant regulatory hurdles. Companies discovered that even with established safety profiles, repurposed drugs needed full clinical trials for new indications, which remained expensive and time-consuming.

Industry adoption of systematic repurposing has been moderate. Many companies incorporated elements of the strategy into their R&D workflows, using computational approaches and phenotypic screening to identify new opportunities. However, the systematic screening of large compound libraries through institutional partnerships, as pioneered by Roche-Broad, has not become standard practice across the industry due to resource constraints and variable success rates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original article did not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes of the drug repurposing initiative, focusing instead on a cautious analysis of the strategy's potential benefits and limitations. The piece maintained a balanced perspective, presenting both optimistic scenarios (successful repurposing with development advantages) and pessimistic outcomes (complications and selectivity problems), without making definitive forecasts about either success or failure.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 4**

The article addresses an important trend in pharmaceutical R&D that has maintained relevance over the subsequent decade, reflecting realistic industry challenges and opportunities. However, it primarily analyzes one specific collaboration rather than capturing broader transformative developments in drug discovery.
