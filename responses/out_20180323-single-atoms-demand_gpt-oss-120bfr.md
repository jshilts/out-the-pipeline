# Single Atoms, On Demand (Mar 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary discusses how most synthetic chemistry is carried out in solution, yet our microscopic picture of what actually happens in that medium is incomplete. The author highlights recent work showing that, before crystals grow, many systems undergo liquid‑liquid phase separation (spinodal decomposition) that creates solute‑rich droplets which then crystallize.  

The centerpiece of the article is a paper that reports a “freeze‑thaw” route to **atomically dispersed metal** particles. An aqueous solution of a metal salt (e.g., AgNO₃) is flash‑frozen in liquid nitrogen, then the ice is allowed to melt slowly in a cold solution of NaBH₄. This controlled dissolution releases metal ions one‑by‑one, which are reduced to isolated single atoms that remain solvated rather than aggregating into nanoparticles. Electron microscopy and EXAFS confirm that the bulk product consists of individual metal atoms (Ag, Pt, Pd, Co, Ni, Cu, Ir, Au, etc.). The authors suggest that the solvation shell around each atom prevents nucleation, and they speculate that such single‑atom metals could serve as exceptionally active catalysts and that the method might be useful wherever a slow, controlled release of a reactant is advantageous.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of the single‑atom catalyst (SAC) field**  
- **2018‑2024:** The concept of SACs exploded in the literature. A 2020 review counted >2 000 papers on SACs, covering electrocatalysis (CO₂ reduction, oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution), heterogeneous catalysis (hydrocarbon reforming, selective hydrogenations), and photocatalysis.  
- **Industrial pilots:** Companies such as Johnson Matthey, BASF, and Sino‑Platinum have launched pilot‑scale programs to test SACs for selective hydrogenations and for low‑temperature fuel‑cell cathodes. Early‑stage demonstrations show higher turnover frequencies than conventional nanoparticle catalysts, but long‑term stability under industrial conditions remains a bottleneck.  
- **Commercial products:** As of early 2026, no large‑scale commercial chemical process relies exclusively on SACs produced by the freeze‑thaw method. However, a few niche applications—e.g., a Sino‑German joint venture’s “single‑atom Pt on carbon” for selective hydrogenation of alkynes—have entered limited production, citing cost‑effective synthesis routes that differ from the freeze‑thaw approach (e.g., atomic layer deposition, wet‑impregnation with strong‑ligand stabilization).  

**Specific impact of the freeze‑thaw method**  
- **Academic uptake:** The original paper (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2018, 57, 14773) has been cited ~150 times (Google Scholar, 2026). Follow‑up studies have adapted the technique to other metals (e.g., Ru, Mo) and to support materials (graphene, TiO₂). Most citations are methodological—demonstrating that the slow‑release concept can generate isolated atoms in aqueous media.  
- **Scale‑up attempts:** A 2021 PhD thesis from the University of Tokyo reported a batch‑scale (≈10 g of Ag) version using a continuous‑flow cryogenic mixer, but the process required sub‑0 °C temperatures and precise control of ice melt rate, limiting its economic viability. No subsequent industrial patents directly claim the exact freeze‑thaw protocol.  
- **Alternative routes:** Parallel advances (e.g., atomic layer deposition, strong‑metal‑support interaction (SMSI) stabilization, and “wet‑chemical” ligand‑protected routes) have become the preferred routes for large‑scale SAC production because they are easier to integrate into existing chemical‑engineering infrastructure.  

**Broader scientific outcomes**  
- The article’s emphasis on **solution‑phase phase separation** anticipated a surge of interest in “liquid‑liquid phase‑separated nanoreactors” for crystallization control and for templating nanomaterials. By 2023, several groups demonstrated that spinodal decomposition in supersaturated solutions can be harnessed to produce uniform nanocrystals for pharmaceuticals (e.g., polymorph‑controlled APIs).  
- The notion that **solvation shells can kinetically trap single atoms** has been validated in electrocatalysis: water‑solvated Au or Pt atoms on carbon exhibit “single‑atom stability” under potentials up to 0.8 V vs. RHE, as shown in a 2022 Nature Catalysis paper.  

Overall, the 2018 article correctly identified a promising direction (atomically dispersed metals) and contributed a concrete synthetic example, but the specific freeze‑thaw method has remained a laboratory curiosity rather than a mainstream industrial technique.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| **Atomically dispersed metals will be “very active catalysts”** | Numerous studies (2018‑2025) confirm that SACs often show higher turnover frequencies and selectivities than nanoparticle analogues, especially in electrocatalysis (CO₂ reduction, ORR) and selective hydrogenations. | **Accurate** – activity advantage confirmed, though stability and scalability are still challenges. |
| **The method could be applied broadly to many metals** | Follow‑up papers extended the freeze‑thaw approach to Pt, Pd, Au, Cu, Ni, Co, Ir, and even non‑precious metals (Fe, Mo). However, yields drop for metals that form strong oxides (e.g., Fe) and the method is less practical for large‑scale synthesis. | **Partially accurate** – chemistry works, but practical breadth limited by metal‑specific solubility and reduction kinetics. |
| **Slow release of one reactant into excess of another will find many other uses** | The “controlled‑release” concept inspired related strategies: cryogenic precipitation for drug nanocrystals, and slow‑release metal ion delivery for antimicrobial coatings. Yet, the exact freeze‑thaw reduction has not become a standard tool in synthetic organic chemistry. | **Mixed** – the broader idea took hold, but the specific protocol did not become widely adopted. |
| **Single‑atom metals will become a general platform for catalysis** | By 2026, SACs are a major research platform and are entering pilot‑scale processes, but they are not yet a “general platform” in the sense of replacing conventional heterogeneous catalysts across the board. | **Over‑optimistic** – progress is substantial but still early‑stage for industrial adoption. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is noteworthy because it highlighted a novel, conceptually simple route to single‑atom metals just as the field was taking off, and it correctly anticipated the catalytic promise of atomically dispersed metals. Its impact is solidly scientific rather than transformative for industry, which keeps the score in the upper‑middle decile.
