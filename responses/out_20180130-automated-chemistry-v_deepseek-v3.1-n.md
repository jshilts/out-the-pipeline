# Automated Chemistry: A Vision (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary envisions a "Universal Synthetic Chemistry Machine" (USCM) that would automate the entire organic synthesis workflow—from retrosynthetic planning through final purification—for molecules ranging from simple medicinal chemistry analogs to complex natural products. The author argues that, while ambitious, such a system violates no physical laws and builds on existing components (flow chemistry, automated analysis, robotic sample handling). The machine would use algorithmic search to identify optimal synthetic routes, optimize reaction conditions through small-scale experimentation, and handle routine analog synthesis automatically, reserving difficult or novel chemistry for human experts in "centaur" human-machine teams.

The author explicitly frames automation as an ethical imperative: just as mechanical washing machines eliminated drudgery, automated synthesis should free chemists from repetitive tasks (amide couplings, Suzuki reactions) so they can focus on higher‑level design and strategy. He anticipates that widespread automation will shift the demand toward fewer, more highly skilled chemists and away from technicians executing predefined analog series—a trend already underway through offshoring that automation will accelerate.

## 2. HISTORY

The vision has seen significant, albeit partial, realization since 2018. Fully automated platforms for routine medicinal chemistry are now deployed in both industry and academia, with notable examples including the University of Illinois' Automated Synthesis Lab<sup>†</sup> and commercial systems from companies like Chemify<sup>†</sup> (spun out of Cronin's group at Glasgow) and PostEra. These systems routinely handle analog libraries built around common transformations (amides, aryl couplings, heterocycle formation) and can optimize reaction conditions automatically.

Flow chemistry has been widely adopted where it offers advantages, and robotics for sample handling, purification, and analytics are standard in well-funded labs. However, the "Universal" machine capable of tackling any molecule remains beyond current engineering—practical systems focus instead on well-precedented reaction classes. The units that have been built are large, expensive enclosures with vented chambers, standardized reagent cartridges, solvent lines, and inline analytics, matching the author's description. Though not truly universal, they automate substantial fractions of medicinal chemistry synthesis.

One clear impact has been the reduction of human time spent on routine analog synthesis and condition screening. Teams now offload much of this to platforms that run 24/7, freeing chemists for design and troubleshooting. Deployments in pharma and biotech have shortened optimization cycles and, in some cases, accelerated preclinical candidate identification. Purification and analysis remain bottlenecks, but automated SPE, prep-HPLC, and robotic workups have improved throughput. Commercially, CROs and startups increasingly compete on integrated automated chemistry services rather than low-cost manual labor.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: General-purpose chemistry automation will arrive, differing by degree (Universal Amide/Suzuki Cranker) rather than kind relative to the full USCM.
  - **Outcome**: Largely accurate. Broadly automated platforms for Suzuki, amide couplings, and other common reactions are now routine. True universality remains out of reach, but the practical systems in use today differ in scale and scope rather than fundamental capability from the author's vision.

- **Prediction**: Automation will free chemists by taking over repetitive tasks, shifting demand toward higher-level design skills.
  - **Outcome**: Substantially confirmed. In major pharma and biotech, roles increasingly emphasize retrosynthetic strategy, data analysis, and machine-guided design, while platforms handle analog array synthesis automatically. Technical staff whose primary value was manual execution have faced headwinds.

- **Prediction**: Centaur-style human–machine collaboration will handle complex targets where full automation is not feasible.
  - **Outcome**: This is the dominant mode today. Computational tools (including closed-loop systems) propose routes, enumerate analogs, and optimize conditions; chemists then validate, refine, and execute the challenging steps manually.

- **Prediction**: Humans and machines will still divide labor, with "hands and brains" chemistry reserved for difficult or innovative steps.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. New reaction discovery, mechanistic troubleshooting, and syntheses outside the training distribution of current models are led by expert chemists, while platforms handle the routine execution and optimization.

- **Prediction**: Automation would accelerate because the necessary components (robotics, analytics, flow chemistry, computational planning) already existed in some form.
  - **Outcome**: Validated. Integration and engineering proved harder than anticipated, but the core technologies enabled today's automated synthesis labs. Realizing the vision required sustained investment and iteration, not fundamental invention.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article correctly foresaw the trajectory and impact of automated chemistry, separating hype from feasibility and highlighting both the technological path and the sociotechnical consequences. Its core forecasts are now observable in leading labs, making it a prescient and well-reasoned take from 2018.
