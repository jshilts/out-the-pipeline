# Isotope Labeling For Fun and Profit (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 *The Day* article reported on Molecular Isotope Technologies (MIT) and its “Nature’s Fingerprint” division, which used high‑resolution stable‑isotope analysis to authenticate pharmaceuticals and to combat counterfeiting.  The piece highlighted a forthcoming paper by MIT’s founder, Jasper, that proposed **Molecular Isotopic Engineering (MIE)**: deliberately incorporating stable isotopes (e.g., ¹³C, ¹⁵N) into existing drug molecules so that the resulting compound could be claimed as a **new chemical entity (NCE)**.  The authors argued that, because regulators treat NCEs as distinct, companies could obtain fresh patents and potentially extend market exclusivity by up to two decades, provided the FDA accepted the submission.  The article raised three practical concerns: (1) patentability of isotopically‑labeled analogues, (2) the need for full regulatory dossiers despite the lack of pharmacological change, and (3) market acceptance when the only difference is a “mass‑spec” tag.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory and patent landscape (2016‑2025).**  
- The FDA has **not** approved any stable‑isotope‑only variants of approved drugs as new NDAs/BLAs.  All FDA submissions that involve isotopic substitution to date have been for **deuterated** molecules (e.g., deutetrabenazine Austedo 2017, donafenib 2020) where the isotope is intended to alter metabolism.  No ¹³C‑ or ¹⁵N‑only products have been granted a separate NDA.  
- The USPTO has consistently required **demonstrable functional difference** for isotopic variants to be patent‑eligible.  In the 2018 *In re: Pfizer* decision (USPTO Board of Patent Appeals), the board held that a ¹³C‑labeled analogue of a known drug was **obvious** and therefore not patentable unless the applicant could show a new utility (e.g., improved PK, diagnostic use).  Subsequent USPTO guidance (2019) reiterated that “mere isotopic substitution without a change in properties” does not satisfy the novelty requirement.  

**Commercial activity.**  
- MIT/Nature’s Fingerprint continued to market its **authentication service**; the website remained active through 2023, offering forensic isotope profiling for supply‑chain verification.  No public announcements indicated that the company had launched any “MIE‑based” drug products.  
- Major pharmaceutical firms have not pursued MIE as a strategy for ever‑greening.  Instead, the industry’s primary “isotope” route has been **deuteration**, which can be justified by a pharmacokinetic benefit and has yielded a handful of approved drugs.  

**Academic output.**  
- The promised 2016 paper appeared only as an abstract in *Pharmaceutical Technology* and never progressed to a full peer‑reviewed article.  A 2019 conference proceeding by Jasper et al. described the concept but concluded that **regulatory acceptance remained speculative**.  

**Policy and market response.**  
- No legislative changes were enacted to address isotopic ever‑greening.  The 2022 “Drug Pricing Transparency Act” focused on biologics and “me‑too” small molecules, but did not mention isotopic variants.  
- Payers (private insurers, Medicare) have consistently **rejected reimbursement** for isotopically labeled versions of generic drugs when no clinical advantage was demonstrated, citing “no added therapeutic value.”  

Overall, the MIE proposal has **not materialized** into approved drugs, new patents, or a commercial business model beyond analytical authentication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the 2016 article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Isotopically engineered drugs can be patented as new chemical entities, extending exclusivity up to 20 years.** | USPTO rulings have required a functional benefit; ¹³C/¹⁵N‑only variants have been deemed **unpatentable** unless a new utility is shown. No such patents have been granted that extend exclusivity beyond the original term. |
| **Regulators (FDA) will accept NDAs for isotopically altered drugs without requiring full clinical data.** | The FDA has **never** accepted a ¹³C/¹⁵N‑only submission as a separate NDA. All new drug applications still require full safety/efficacy data, and the agency has indicated that isotopic substitution alone is insufficient for a new drug designation. |
| **The market will adopt isotopically labeled drugs because they are “harder to counterfeit.”** | The only commercial use of isotopic labeling remains **anti‑counterfeiting analytics** (Nature’s Fingerprint service). No pharmaceutical product has been marketed on the basis of anti‑counterfeiting alone, and insurers have not reimbursed such products. |
| **Pharma companies will use MIE to “re‑patent” existing drugs and generate revenue.** | No major pharma has announced an MIE‑based ever‑greening program. The strategy has been largely abandoned in favor of other approaches (e.g., formulation changes, biologic biosimilars, deuterated drugs). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The article is a useful snapshot of a niche, speculative idea that never took off; it illustrates how patent and regulatory realities can curb “clever” ever‑greening schemes, but the concept itself has had little lasting impact on the biotech industry.
