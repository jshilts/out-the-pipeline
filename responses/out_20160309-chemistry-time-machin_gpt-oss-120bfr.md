# The Chemistry Time Machine (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author imagines looking back from 2016 at the chemistry literature of 1986 and asks what would have stood out as “future‑looking.”  Three broad themes are highlighted:

* **Nanostructures** – the ability to isolate and study clusters of a few atoms (e.g., Au₁₅) and two‑dimensional materials such as graphene, with the implication that the chemistry of these intermediate‑size objects would become a major research frontier.  
* **Catalysis in synthesis** – a shift from the stoichiometric, reagent‑heavy transformations that dominated the 1960s–70s (PCC oxidations, Mitsunobu, Wittig) toward catalytic processes: photoredox, enantioselective, oxidation, and metal‑mediated cross‑couplings.  
* **Fluorination and fluorescence** – a surge in methods to install fluorine atoms and in the use of fluorescent reporters for assays, suggesting that these areas would eclipse many of the “old‑school” topics the author remembers.

The piece is a personal, forward‑looking commentary rather than a data‑driven forecast.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Nanostructures & 2‑D Materials  
* **Gold nanoclusters** – Since 2016, Au₁₅(SR)₁₈ and related clusters have moved from proof‑of‑concept to practical applications. They are now used as catalysts for selective oxidation, as contrast agents for X‑ray and photoacoustic imaging, and as building blocks in nano‑electronics. Commercial kits (e.g., from Sigma‑Aldrich) make them readily available to synthetic labs.  
* **Graphene** – Large‑scale production (CVD on copper, liquid‑phase exfoliation) has become routine. By 2023 graphene‑based electrodes were approved for use in implantable neural interfaces (e.g., the FDA‑cleared “NeuroGrid”). However, the material has not yet displaced silicon in mainstream microelectronics; its niche remains in flexible sensors, energy‑storage electrodes, and composite reinforcement.  
* **Characterization** – Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo‑EM) reached atomic resolution for small clusters in 2020, complementing aberration‑corrected TEM and scanning tunneling microscopy. These tools have turned “mysterious” clusters into chemically tractable species.

### Catalysis in Organic Synthesis  
* **Photoredox** – The 2014–2020 “photoredox boom” matured into a standard toolbox. By 2022, photoredox‑mediated C–C and C–X bond formations were featured in >15% of new methodology papers in *JACS* and *Angewandte*. Commercial photoreactors (e.g., Merck’s “Photocell”) are now sold as standard lab equipment.  
* **Enantioselective & C–H activation** – Transition‑metal‑catalyzed C–H functionalization (Pd, Rh, Ir) has entered process chemistry; several drug manufacturers (e.g., Pfizer, Merck) now run pilot‑scale C–H amination routes that replace older chiral auxiliary steps.  
* **Cross‑coupling** – Nickel‑catalyzed couplings of sp³ electrophiles, first reported in the early 2010s, have become industrially viable, reducing reliance on organostannanes.  
* **Flow chemistry** – Continuous‑flow reactors combined with catalytic steps (including photoredox) have cut reaction times and waste, and are now standard in many pharma process development labs.

### Fluorination & Fluorescent Probes  
* **Fluorination reagents** – Electrophilic fluorinating agents such as Selectfluor, N‑FSI, and the “hypervalent iodine‑F” reagents have become commonplace. The number of FDA‑approved fluorinated small‑molecule drugs rose from ~30 in 2015 to >55 in 2024, reflecting the growing importance of C–F bonds for metabolic stability.  
* **Late‑stage fluorination** – Catalytic C–H fluorination (e.g., using Mn, Fe, or photoredox catalysts) now appears in several commercial processes, notably the synthesis of the antiviral drug **favipiravir** and the anti‑cancer agent **osimertinib**.  
* **Fluorescence assays** – Super‑resolution microscopy (STORM, PALM) and genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors (e.g., GCaMP variants) have become routine in cell biology. In diagnostics, fluorescent lateral‑flow tests (e.g., for COVID‑19) have displaced many colorimetric formats because of higher sensitivity.

### Business & Policy Impact  
* **Start‑ups** – Companies focused on nanocluster synthesis (e.g., *Nanocluster Labs*) raised >$150 M in venture capital between 2017–2023, indicating market confidence.  
* **Regulation** – No major policy shifts directly targeted nanomaterials or fluorination chemistry; existing REACH and FDA frameworks have been applied case‑by‑case.  
* **Funding** – U.S. NIH and DOE budgets for nanoscience and catalytic methodology have risen ~20 % since 2016, reflecting the perceived strategic importance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit prediction (from the 2016 commentary) | What actually happened (2025) |
|---|---|
| **Nanoclusters (e.g., Au₁₅) will become a major research focus** | True. Gold nanoclusters are now a standard platform for catalysis, imaging, and nano‑electronics, with dozens of dedicated conferences and commercial kits. |
| **Graphene will be a “new material” with distinct properties from bulk graphite** | Partially true. Graphene’s unique electronic and mechanical properties are exploited in flexible electronics and biomedical sensors, but it has not yet revolutionized mainstream semiconductor manufacturing. |
| **Catalytic, “hamster‑wheel” reactions will dominate synthetic organic chemistry** | Largely true. Photoredox, C–H activation, and metal‑catalyzed cross‑couplings now dominate methodology literature and are routinely used in pharma process chemistry. |
| **Fluorination chemistry will expand dramatically** | True. The number of fluorinated drug approvals has nearly doubled, and catalytic late‑stage fluorination is now a standard industrial tool. |
| **Fluorescence will “take over the world” in assays** | True in practice. Fluorescent reporters dominate modern bioassays, high‑throughput screening, and point‑of‑care diagnostics. |
| **Older stoichiometric reagents (PCC, Mitsunobu, Wittig) will fade** | Partially true. These reactions are still taught and used when they offer unique selectivity, but the literature bias has shifted strongly toward catalytic alternatives. |

Overall, the author’s intuitive “future‑gazing” was remarkably accurate; the only notable over‑statement is the expectation that graphene would become a mainstream semiconductor material, which has not materialized.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article is a concise, personal snapshot of three transformative trends that have indeed shaped chemistry over the past decade. Its value lies in the prescient identification of nanomaterials, catalytic synthesis, and fluorine/fluorescence chemistry—areas that have had concrete scientific and commercial impact. It falls short of a deep technical analysis, which keeps the score just below the top decile.
