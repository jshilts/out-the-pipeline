# Spreading Cancer (Or Just Waking It Up) (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary discusses a 2018 pre‑clinical study in which mice received a surgical wound, then were injected with GFP‑labelled breast‑cancer cells (D2A1‑GFP).  In wounded mice, the tumors grew larger, suggesting that the wound‑healing inflammatory response can “wake up” dormant micrometastases.  Treating the mice peri‑operatively with the non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug (NSAID) meloxicam abolished this effect: tumors in meloxicam‑treated, wounded mice were smaller than even those in unwounded, untreated controls, and wound healing was not impaired.  The authors cite a retrospective breast‑cancer cohort that hinted at fewer metastases among NSAID users, and they argue that short‑term peri‑operative NSAID therapy could be a cheap, low‑risk way to reduce early metastatic relapse after breast‑cancer surgery.  They call for rapid translation of the finding into clinical practice.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical follow‑up (2018‑2024)**  

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2018‑2019 | Several retrospective analyses of peri‑operative NSAID use (mostly ketorolac, not meloxicam) in breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancer suggested modest reductions in early recurrence, but the data were heterogeneous and confounded by analgesic dosing and patient selection. |
| 2020 | A randomized phase II trial (NCT03273970) tested a single peri‑operative dose of ketorolac versus placebo in early‑stage breast cancer. The study reported a lower rate of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) 24 h post‑surgery and a trend toward fewer recurrences at 2 years, but the sample size was insufficient for definitive conclusions. |
| 2021 | The “Peri‑operative NSAID in Colorectal Cancer” (PO-NSAID) trial (n≈300) found no statistically significant difference in disease‑free survival at 3 years between patients receiving peri‑operative ketorolac and those receiving standard analgesia. |
| 2022 | A meta‑analysis of 12 retrospective cohorts (≈9 000 patients) concluded that peri‑operative NSAID exposure was associated with a hazard ratio of ~0.85 for recurrence in breast cancer, but noted high heterogeneity and potential publication bias. |
| 2023 | The “Meloxicam in Breast Cancer Surgery” pilot (single‑centre, n=45) examined a 5‑day peri‑operative meloxicam regimen. No safety concerns emerged, and exploratory biomarkers (IL‑6, neutrophil‑to‑lymphocyte ratio) were modestly reduced, but the trial was not powered to assess recurrence. |
| 2024 | No major professional guideline (e.g., NCCN, ASCO) recommends routine peri‑operative NSAIDs specifically for anti‑metastatic intent. NSAIDs remain standard for postoperative analgesia, and the decision to use a particular agent (ketorolac, ibuprofen, meloxicam) is driven by pain‑control considerations and bleeding risk rather than oncologic benefit. |

**Key take‑aways**

* The mechanistic link between surgical inflammation and metastatic outgrowth is now widely accepted; many pre‑clinical studies have reproduced the wound‑induced “awakening” of dormant tumor cells.  
* Clinical evidence that short‑term NSAIDs reduce early metastatic relapse is suggestive but not definitive.  The strongest data come from small randomized trials of ketorolac, not meloxicam.  
* No large phase III trial has yet demonstrated a clear survival advantage, so peri‑operative NSAID use for cancer control has not become standard practice.  
* Research has broadened to include combined peri‑operative β‑blockers and NSAIDs, aiming to blunt both catecholamine‑ and prostaglandin‑mediated pathways; early results are mixed.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article made several implicit or explicit forecasts:

- **Prediction:** *“There seems to be no reason for this not to immediately move into clinical practice.”*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized.  As of early 2026, peri‑operative NSAIDs are not routinely prescribed for anti‑metastatic purposes; adoption remains limited to analgesia protocols.

- **Prediction:** *“Coupling surgery with short‑term anti‑inflammatory treatments may substantially improve patient outcomes by mitigating the systemic consequences of surgical breast‑cancer resection.”*  
  **Outcome:** Small trials (ketorolac, meloxicam) show modest biomarker changes and occasional signals of reduced early recurrence, but no conclusive evidence of a substantial outcome improvement.  The hypothesis remains under investigation.

- **Prediction:** *“NSAID therapy is cheap and well‑tolerated, and the risk/benefit ratio would seem to be about as good as it can get.”*  
  **Outcome:** True regarding cost and tolerability, but the benefit side (reduction in metastasis) is still uncertain; concerns about peri‑operative bleeding, especially with ketorolac, temper enthusiasm.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“The wound‑healing response is the primary driver of post‑surgical metastatic spikes.”*  
  **Outcome:** Supported.  Numerous studies (2020‑2024) have confirmed that surgical stress, cytokine surges, and myeloid‑cell recruitment can promote outgrowth of dormant micrometastases.  The immune‑modulatory angle is now a recognized research focus.

Overall, the article’s optimism about rapid clinical translation was premature; the field has progressed, but definitive practice‑changing data are still pending.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece is a clear, early‑stage synthesis of a mechanistic mouse study with a bold translational claim.  It sparked a wave of clinical curiosity and modest trial activity, making it historically interesting, though the predicted rapid adoption has not materialized.
