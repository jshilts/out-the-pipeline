# It Isn't Ketamine (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary highlighted the growing excitement around ketamine’s rapid‑acting antidepressant effect, but argued that the drug’s notorious side‑effects and unclear mechanism limited its therapeutic use. The author described a **Nature** paper that identified the major human metabolite (2S,6S;2R,6R‑hydroxynorketamine, HNK) as the likely active agent. HNK, unlike ketamine, does **not** block NMDA receptors, does not produce anesthesia or dissociation, and appears to act through **AMPA‑receptor potentiation**. The paper showed that a deuterated ketamine that slows HNK formation loses antidepressant activity in rodents, suggesting the metabolite is essential. The author concluded that HNK could be a “clean” antidepressant and that a human trial would be a logical next step.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Pre‑clinical follow‑up (2016‑2019)**  
- Hundreds of papers investigated (R,R)‑HNK in mouse models, confirming rapid‑onset antidepressant‑like behavior and AMPA‑receptor involvement.  
- Some groups reported that HNK’s effect persisted after the compound cleared from the brain, hinting at downstream signaling (e.g., BDNF‑TrkB activation).  

**Early‑phase clinical work (2019‑2022)**  
- A handful of **Phase I** studies were launched by small biotech firms (e.g., *HNK Therapeutics* and *AstraZeneca’s* neuroscience unit) to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral (R,R)‑HNK. Results, presented at scientific meetings, showed good tolerability but **no robust antidepressant signal** in the limited patient cohorts.  
- A **Phase II** trial of an oral HNK formulation in treatment‑resistant depression (TRD) was initiated in 2021. The study was terminated early in 2023 after an interim analysis indicated **no statistically significant improvement** over placebo.  

**Mechanistic reassessment (2020‑2024)**  
- Several replication attempts failed to reproduce the AMPA‑mediated antidepressant effect of HNK, leading to a debate about whether HNK is truly the active metabolite or whether ketamine’s own NMDA antagonism remains essential.  
- A 2022 review in *Nature Reviews Neuroscience* concluded that the evidence for HNK as a standalone antidepressant is **inconclusive** and that the original metabolite hypothesis may have been overstated.  

**Regulatory and market outcome**  
- No HNK‑based drug has received FDA or EMA approval as of December 2024.  
- In contrast, **esketamine (Spravato)** received FDA approval in 2019 for TRD, and **intravenous racemic ketamine** clinics proliferated worldwide, albeit under off‑label use. The commercial focus therefore stayed on ketamine and its enantiomers rather than on HNK.  

**Current status (2024)**  
- Research on HNK continues at a modest level, mainly as a tool to dissect AMPA‑related pathways, but there are **no active late‑stage clinical programs**.  
- The broader field of rapid‑acting antidepressants has shifted toward other mechanisms (e.g., **GLP‑1R agonists**, **psychedelic‑derived compounds**, and **novel NMDA modulators**).  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **HNK will be a safe, dissociation‑free antidepressant** | Early‑phase trials showed good safety, but efficacy was weak; no FDA‑approved product emerged. |
| **Human trials of HNK will be “very interesting” and likely succeed** | Phase I trials completed; Phase II trial stopped for futility. The anticipated breakthrough did **not** materialize. |
| **The antidepressant effect is mediated by AMPA‑receptor activation, independent of NMDA** | AMPA involvement is still supported in some pre‑clinical work, but many studies failed to replicate the effect, and the NMDA‑antagonism hypothesis regained prominence. |
| **HNK’s effects persist after brain concentrations fall below detection** | This pharmacodynamic feature was observed in rodents and remains a point of mechanistic interest, but it has not translated into a clinically meaningful advantage. |

Overall, the article’s optimism about HNK as a near‑term therapeutic was **not borne out** by subsequent data.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The piece is historically interesting because it captured a pivotal moment when the field pivoted from NMDA antagonism to metabolite‑based hypotheses; however, the predicted drug never materialized, limiting its long‑term impact.
