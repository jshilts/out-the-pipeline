# Exelixis Fights City Hall, and City Hall Looks Like Winning (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Exelixis's stock dropping 40% after the FDA rejected the company's proposed clinical trial design for their prostate cancer drug candidate cabozantinib. Exelixis had planned to use pain reduction as the primary endpoint for accelerated approval, hoping to follow up later with overall survival data. The FDA insisted on survival benefits as the endpoint, consistent with requirements for other prostate cancer drugs. The author expresses skepticism about Exelixis's strategy to continue with their approach and potentially persuade the FDA with dramatic data.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2011 setback, Exelixis ultimately had to redesign their clinical program for cabozantinib (brand name Cabometyx). The drug eventually gained FDA approval, but not for prostate cancer as originally intended - it was approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) in 2016, and later for hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in 2019. For prostate cancer specifically, cabozantinib did eventually show promise in later trials and was granted FDA approval in 2022 for certain prostate cancer patients, but this came over a decade after the original dispute. The regulatory path proved much longer and more difficult than Exelixis had anticipated in 2011. The company's experience validated the article's skepticism about their initial strategy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **The article predicted the FDA would not reverse course on requiring survival data**: This proved accurate - Exelixis was eventually forced to conduct trials using survival endpoints rather than pain reduction
• **Implicit prediction that Exelixis's strategy was unrealistic**: The market's negative reaction and the author's skepticism were validated by the long delay (11 years) before cabozantinib gained any prostate cancer approval and the fact that it required different trial designs than originally proposed
• **Implied prediction that pain reduction wouldn't be sufficient as a primary endpoint**: Confirmed - no prostate cancer drug has gained FDA approval based primarily on pain reduction without survival data

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article captured a significant moment in drug development regulatory dynamics, correctly identifying the FDA's adherence to rigorous efficacy standards and the challenges of endpoint selection in oncology. The decade-long journey to approval illustrates broader themes about clinical development timelines and regulatory science.
