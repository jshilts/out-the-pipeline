# A Brain Apparently Made of Grain (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines Dr. Robert David Perlmutter, author of "Grain Brain," placing him in the same category as other celebrity doctors like Dr. Oz and Dr. Mercola who promote alternative health claims. The author highlights the familiar pattern of such figures claiming miraculous cures that are supposedly suppressed by establishment forces yet hiding in plain sight. The piece specifically points out the inconsistency that Perlmutter was advocating completely different "wonderful cures" in the 1990s compared to his current grain-focused recommendations. The author acknowledges the entertaining nature of critiquing such claims but expresses skepticism that any factual analysis would sway devoted followers of these health gurus.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Dr. Perlmutter continued to promote his "Grain Brain" philosophy through multiple bestselling books and extensive media presence. His core claims focused on grains and carbohydrates causing dementia, Alzheimer's, depression, ADHD, and other neurological conditions, while advocating high-fat, low-carb diets as therapeutic interventions.

The scientific and medical communities largely rejected Perlmutter's specific claims about grain causation of brain diseases. Large-scale epidemiological studies continued to show no evidence supporting his central thesis. The broader low-carb/high-fat movement he represented did gain cultural traction, with keto and paleo diets becoming more mainstream, but his neurological disease claims specifically remained scientifically unsubstantiated.

Perlmutter faced criticism from nutrition scientists and neurologists who pointed out the lack of rigorous evidence for his specific brain-disease claims. However, his commercial success continued through book sales, supplements, and speaking engagements rather than through clinical validation or FDA approval of his dietary approaches for treating neurological conditions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The article's implicit prediction about true believers**: The author suggested that "nothing will" convince devoted followers of such health gurus. This proved largely accurate - despite continued scientific criticism and lack of evidence, Perlmutter maintained a substantial following and commercial success in the years following the article.

• **The underlying assumption about scientific validation**: While not explicitly stated as a prediction, the article's skeptical tone implied that Perlmutter's claims would not receive scientific validation. This proved correct - no subsequent rigorous clinical trials supported his specific neurological disease treatment claims through grain elimination.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

The article addresses an important pattern in health misinformation but focuses on a specific figure whose claims remained relatively contained within alternative health circles without major impact on mainstream medical practice or public policy.
