# China's Biopharma Rise (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the emergence of China's biotechnology industry as a potential competitor rather than just a contract services provider to Western pharmaceutical companies. The author highlights the catalyst moment at the 2017 ASCO meeting, where Nanjing Legend Biotech presented impressive CAR-T therapy data for multiple myeloma, surprising many industry observers who wondered "Who?" when hearing about this previously unknown Chinese company.

The piece notes that China's biotech transformation was driven significantly by the government's Thousand Talents program launched in 2008, which incentivized Chinese-born scientists and professionals trained overseas to return home with grants and tax breaks. While the author doesn't expect a Chinese equivalent of major Western pharma companies like Merck or Novartis to emerge immediately, they anticipate growing Chinese presence in research-driven biopharma as a logical move up the value chain.

Key constraints identified include China's stock market requirements—companies must show profitability before listing, unlike the NASDAQ which accommodates pre-profit biotech firms. The author also raises concerns about potential government dirigiste interference and the possibility that regulatory shortcuts on clinical trials might be taken to accelerate industry development, citing existing problems with corner-cutting in drug regulation.

## 2. HISTORY

Several major developments occurred following this article's publication:

**Nanjing Legend's Success**: Legend Biotech's CAR-T therapy (Carvykti/ciltacabtagene autoleucel) achieved significant milestone when it received FDA approval in February 2022 for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Partnered with Janssen, it became one of the first Chinese-developed cell therapies to gain major market approval. By 2024, Carvykti generated substantial revenue and established itself alongside other CAR-T therapies in competitive multiple myeloma market.

**Regulatory Evolution**: China's regulatory environment underwent dramatic changes post-2017. The NMPA (formerly CFDA) implemented major reforms, establishing priority review channels and expedited pathways for innovative drugs. While concerns about quality and oversight persisted, the agency moved toward more streamlined and international standards, though instances of regulatory issues continued to emerge.

**Capital Market Developments**: China launched the STAR Market (Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board) in 2019, specifically designed to allow pre-profit biotech companies to go public, directly addressing the listing barrier mentioned in the article. This created significant funding opportunities for Chinese biotech startups.

**Industry Growth and Setbacks**: Chinese biopharma saw explosive growth in venture capital investment, with numerous companies advancing programs to clinical stages. However, many faced challenges including clinical trial failures, regulatory hurdles in Western markets, and increasing competition. Some high-profile companies like BeiGene expanded globally, while others struggled with execution.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I don't expect a Chinese Merck, Novartis, or Biogen any time soon"** → **Mostly accurate**. While Chinese companies like BeiGene have achieved significant global presence, none have yet reached the scale and across-the-board R&D breadth of major Western pharma companies by 2024. However, several Chinese companies developed substantial late-stage pipelines and commercial operations.

• **"Chinese companies to have a growing presence in research-driven biopharma"** → **Highly accurate**. This prediction proved correct, with substantial increase in Chinese biopharma innovation. Chinese companies advanced numerous novel drug candidates, particularly in immuno-oncology, cell therapy, and biologics, with several achieving international partnerships and approvals.

• **Stock market listing barriers** → **Largely resolved**. China's STAR Market launch directly addressed this issue, enabling pre-profit biotech IPOs and dramatically expanding funding access.

• **Government dirigiste interference concerns** → **Mixed outcome**. While government policies generally supported biotech growth through targeted funding and regulatory modernization, concerns about quality control and uneven standards persisted, with some high-profile failures and regulatory actions.

• **Different attitude toward clinical trials/approvals** → **Invalidated**. Rather than loosening standards, China actually strengthened drug regulation and aligned more closely with international standards, though earlier quality issues did continue to emerge periodically.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

Reasoning: The article demonstrates strong prescience about China's biotech emergence and identifies key dynamics that shaped subsequent developments, though some specific concerns about regulatory relaxation didn't materialize as feared.
