# Sulfur, Sulfur, Sulfur (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 blog-style commentary discusses a Yale research paper on discovering inhibitors for STEP (STriatal-Enriched tyrosine Phosphatase), a brain-specific enzyme implicated in memory and CNS processes. Phosphatase inhibition had historically been challenging in drug discovery. The Yale team initially screened compounds and found hits that lost activity upon resynthesis, ultimately discovering the active impurity was elemental sulfur (S8) with an IC50 of 17 nM. The team then developed TC-2153, a benzopentathiepin polysulfide compound that showed activity in cells and mice. The author notes that this class was only detectable because dithiothreitol (DTT) was not included in assay conditions, which would have masked the activity, and that the mechanism appears to be covalent modification of a catalytic cysteine residue. The commentary suggests pursuing covalent inhibitors more deliberately as a strategy.

## 2. HISTORY
After the publication, the field of STEP inhibition progressed slowly:
- **No approved drugs**: To date, no STEP inhibitor has reached FDA approval or clinical trials. This remains a niche research area.
- **Academic progression**: The STEP pathway continued to be investigated as a potential target in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and Fragile X syndrome, with numerous publications throughout the late 2010s.
- **Compound TC-2153**: The compound itself did not advance to clinical development, remaining primarily an experimental research tool. 
- **Covalent inhibitor strategy**: The proposed covalent targeting strategy has, more broadly, become an accepted approach in kinase inhibitor development (e.g., for EGFR, BTK), but phosphatase-specific covalent inhibitors remain challenging.
- **Phosphatase inhibitor landscape**: The broader goal of drugging phosphatases largely remains unfulfilled, with few success stories in drug development pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Given these results, I'd suggest going full-on covalent for the discovery of further STEP inhibitors"**: ✓ Accurate – this strategy was pursued and remains a valid approach for targeting STEP's active-site cysteine.
- **"The tolerance for such mechanisms has increased over the years in med-chem"**: ✓ Correct – covalent inhibitors gained broader acceptance, with FDA approvals for kinase inhibitors like osimertinib and ibrutinib occurring after this article.
- **The suggestion that "sufficiently diverse compounds should be able to target them selectively"**: ⚠️ Mixed – while selective covalent inhibitors have been developed for some enzymes (kinases), achieving high selectivity among phosphatases remains challenging; the field generally still lacks success stories.
- **No prediction explicitly made whether STEP inhibitors would become medicines**: § Not stated – however, the field's slow progress (no approved drugs) indicates the high difficulty of this target class.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
The article identifies a genuine historical problem in drug discovery (phosphatase inhibitors) and highlights the unusual sulfur-based discovery. While STEP inhibition has not led to approved therapeutics, the piece captures challenges and strategic thinking relevant to targeted covalent inhibitor development.
