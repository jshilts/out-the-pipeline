# PI3K Inhibitors: You're Doing It Wrong (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2018 article discusses a Weill Cornell study revealing why PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) inhibitors have shown disappointing clinical results despite extensive development. The key finding was that PI3K inhibitors, while causing hyperglycemia in normal tissues by disrupting insulin signaling through the p110-alpha subtype, paradoxically **stimulate tumor growth** through compensatory hyperinsulinemia.

The mechanism works as follows: PI3K inhibitors block insulin signaling in normal cells, triggering the pancreas to secrete excess insulin. The elevated insulin levels then override the inhibitor's effects on tumor cells, providing the cancer with both increased glucose and augmented growth pathway signaling. The research demonstrated that combining PI3K inhibitors with interventions that reduce insulin spikes—specifically SGLT2 inhibitors (diabetes drugs) or ketogenic diets—improved therapeutic outcomes in animal models. The article emphasized that this is a mechanistic insight about drug combination strategy, not a claim that ketogenic diets treat cancer independently.

## 2. HISTORY
The insights from this 2018 paper proved prescient and influenced subsequent clinical development, though progress has been gradual and complex.

**PI3K Inhibitor Approvals and Clinical Failures:**
Several of the mentioned compounds faced significant setbacks. **Alpelisib (BYL719)** achieved FDA approval in 2019 for PIK3CA-mutated HR+/HER2- breast cancer, but with significant hyperglycemia warnings—exactly the toxicity the 2018 paper explained. **Taselisib (GDC-0032)** was discontinued after failing to meet endpoints in breast cancer trials. **Copanlisib (Aliqopa)** received accelerated approval for follicular lymphoma in 2017 but faced confirmatory trial challenges. **Buparlisib (BKM-120)** failed multiple Phase III trials and was largely abandoned.

**Clinical Implementation of Metabolic Interventions:**
The paper's recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors or ketogenic diets as combination therapy has seen **limited but real adoption**. Several clinical trials have incorporated these metabolic interventions, though results remain preliminary. The fundamental insight about avoiding glucose/insulin spikes during PI3K therapy has influenced supportive care guidelines in some institutions.

**Regulatory and Clinical Practice Evolution:**
FDA labeling for alpelisib explicitly warns about hyperglycemia, recommending glucose monitoring and metformin use if needed. However, the more sophisticated approach of combining with SGLT2 inhibitors or specific dietary protocols remains investigational rather than standard of care. The broader challenge—that PI3K inhibitors still struggle with patient selection and predicting response—persists, validating the article's core concern about the field's approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions, both explicit and implicit:

**✓ Accurate Predictions:**
- **PI3K inhibitor toxicity profile**: The prediction that hyperglycemia-related issues would remain a clinical challenge proved correct. Alpelisib's approval came with mandatory hyperglycemia management requirements.
- **Need for metabolic intervention**: The suggestion that SGLT2 inhibitors or ketogenic diets could improve PI3K inhibitor efficacy has been validated by subsequent research, with several clinical trials adopting these combinations.
- **Avoidance of glucose supplementation**: The warning against glucose-laden IV drips has been incorporated into some institutional guidelines for patients receiving PI3K inhibitors.

**○ Partially Accurate/Still Evolving Predictions:**
- **Immediate change in clinical practice**: While the metabolic insights influenced research and some supportive care practices, they did not trigger the immediate, widespread adoption in standard oncology practice that the article suggested would be warranted.
- **Drug development implications**: The mechanistic understanding has informed subsequent clinical trial design, but the fundamental challenge of patient selection for PI3K inhibitors remains largely unsolved.

**Larger Picture**: The core biological insight—that tumor metabolic plasticity can hijack therapeutic metabolic perturbations—has become a major theme in cancer research and drug development, extending far beyond PI3K inhibitors alone.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article identified a crucial mechanistic gap between preclinical promise and clinical reality for a major drug class. The insight has demonstrated lasting relevance in oncology practice, research, and regulatory considerations.
