# Idiocy On Drug Research Costs (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a critique by Derek Lowe of a Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) piece that claimed drug research is "incredibly inefficient" based on cost comparisons. CEPR compared the Tufts Center for Drug Development's estimate of pharmaceutical industry drug development costs (around $2.6 billion per drug) with much lower costs reported by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDI). For example, DNDI developed malaria treatment ASAQ for $17 million and fexinidazole for sleeping sickness for $38 million.

Lowe argues the comparison is fundamentally flawed because the DNDI examples involve repurposing or reformulating existing drugs discovered decades earlier by pharmaceutical companies. ASAQ combines artesunate (discovered in 1987) with amodiaquine (1940s, Parke-Davis); fexinidazole was originally discovered and partially developed by Hoechst in the early 1980s; SSG&PM combines sodium stibogluconate (1945) with paromomycin (1960, Parke-Davis). He emphasizes these projects benefit from prior industry research and partnerships with companies like Sanofi, which handled major clinical trials and regulatory filings. The central argument is that comparing reformulations to novel drug discovery is "disingenuous at best."

## 2. HISTORY

After this article was published, the debate over drug development costs intensified:

**Continued Debate on Cost Methodology**: The Tufts cost study methodology continued to face scrutiny. Other analyses emerged with varying estimates - some lower, some comparable. The $2.6 billion figure remained controversial and was frequently cited in policy debates about drug pricing.

**Fexinidazole's Regulatory Journey**: The drug fexinidazole, mentioned in the article as a DNDI "new drug candidate," received regulatory approval. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved fexinidazole for treating sleeping sickness, and the FDA granted approval in 2021. This represented a significant success for DNDI and Sanofi's partnership approach in neglected tropical diseases. The approval supported Lowe's point that this was resurrection of an existing compound rather than entirely novel discovery.

**Continued Industry Structure**: The pharma industry continued operating with high R&D expenditures. From 2015-2024, major companies consistently reported substantial research investments (typically 15-25% of revenues), and the fundamental challenge of high drug development costs remained a central feature of pharmaceutical economics. Drug pricing controversies intensified, particularly around specialty drugs and treatments for rare diseases.

**DNDI's Continued Operations**: DNDI maintained its successful model of repurposing and reformulating existing compounds for neglected diseases. The organization continued demonstrating that this strategy works effectively for specific disease areas where the science is well-established.

**No Major Policy Changes**: Despite ongoing debates, no fundamental policy changes occurred in drug development incentives or patent systems that would substantively alter the cost structure Lowe described. Congressional hearings, academic debates, and advocacy efforts continued through 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes one clear prediction by implication:

- **Prediction**: That Alzheimer's, cancer, and drug-resistant infections would require genuine new drug discovery rather than reformulation of existing compounds.
- **Outcome**: This proved correct. Alzheimer's drug development has seen numerous expensive failures, with only modest recent advances. Cancer treatment has shifted toward targeted therapies and immunotherapies requiring extensive new research. Antibiotic-resistant infections remain a major challenge requiring novel drug discovery. These areas have largely confirmed Lowe's assessment that significant therapeutic advances require investing in genuinely novel research rather than repurposing existing compounds.

The implied prediction that organizations releasing flawed analysis (like CEPR) would not be taken seriously on drug research also proved partially true - these cost comparisons continued to be debated but gained less mainstream credibility in scientific circles.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article is highly interesting because it clearly articulates a technical flaw in drug pricing arguments that became increasingly relevant as pharmaceutical costs remained a persistent public policy concern. It demonstrates how comparing fundamentally different types of drug development projects can lead to misleading conclusions, a problem that persisted in public discourse about healthcare costs.
