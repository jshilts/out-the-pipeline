# More on KV and Makena's Pricing (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary traced the revival of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (HPC), a progesterone‑ester originally marketed as **Delalutin** in the 1950s, and its re‑branding as **Makena** after KV Pharmaceuticals obtained orphan‑drug exclusivity.  The piece outlined a convoluted regulatory history—early FDA approval without efficacy data, subsequent safety concerns, revocation of the NDA in 2000, and a NICHD‑funded trial that finally showed a modest reduction in pre‑term birth.  KV bought the rights through a chain of acquisitions, paid roughly $200 M for the program, and announced a list price of about **$1 500 per injection** (≈ $19 500 for a full 13‑dose course).  The author expressed unease that KV was profiting from a drug it did not discover, develop, or manufacture, and warned that political and payer backlash could jeopardize the pricing strategy.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory & commercial developments (2011‑2026)**  

* **FDA approval (Feb 2011).** Makena received accelerated approval for preventing recurrent pre‑term birth based on the NICHD trial.  
* **Pricing controversy.** The $1 500‑per‑injection price sparked criticism from clinicians, advocacy groups (e.g., March of Dimes), and U.S. senators.  
* **Acquisition by Pfizer (Oct 2012).** KV sold Makena to Pfizer for **≈ $225 M**.  Pfizer immediately **reduced the list price** to **$1 500 for the entire 13‑dose course**, a 90 % cut, in an effort to quell the backlash.  
* **Post‑acquisition uptake.** Despite the price cut, utilization remained modest; many obstetricians were hesitant because the evidence base was still limited.  
* **PROLONG trial (2019‑2020).** A large, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study (the PROLONG trial) enrolled > 4 000 women and found **no statistically significant reduction in pre‑term birth or neonatal mortality**.  
* **FDA withdrawal (Oct 2020).** In light of the PROLONG results, the FDA **removed Makena’s indication** for pre‑term birth prevention and the product was taken off the market.  
* **Guideline changes.** The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) **retracted its 2008 recommendation** for routine HPC use in 2020, stating that the drug should be considered only in the context of a clinical trial.  
* **Policy impact.** The Makena episode became a frequently cited case study in discussions of **orphan‑drug pricing** and **“price‑gouging”**.  It contributed to bipartisan proposals (e.g., the 2022 “Orphan Drug Reform Act”) that sought to tighten exclusivity incentives, but as of early 2026 no major legislation has been enacted.  
* **KV Pharmaceuticals.** After the Pfizer sale, KV’s remaining pipeline was modest; the company merged with **Avidity Biosciences** in 2015 and later dissolved.  

**Bottom line:** The drug’s commercial life was brief (≈ 9 years), its high price never translated into widespread adoption, and the ultimate clinical failure led to regulatory removal rather than a sustained market presence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
* **Prediction:** *“If KV’s price is too high, political pressure will force a retreat.”*  
  *Outcome:* Accurate.  Intense media and congressional scrutiny led to a **price cut after Pfizer’s acquisition** and ultimately to the drug’s market exit (though the final withdrawal was driven by efficacy data, not price alone).  

* **Prediction:** *“KV played only a marginal role in getting the drug back on the market.”*  
  *Outcome:* Correct.  KV’s contribution was essentially **acquiring rights and filing the NDA**; the pivotal clinical data came from the NICHD study, and later efficacy was disproved.  

* **Prediction:** *“The drug will see wide uptake once priced at $1 500 per treatment.”*  
  *Outcome:* Incorrect.  Even after the price reduction, **prescription rates remained low** because clinicians doubted the benefit and insurers were reluctant to reimburse without stronger evidence.  

* **Prediction (implicit):** *“Orphan‑drug exclusivity can be leveraged for profit on old, low‑cost compounds.”*  
  *Outcome:* Partially true.  The Makena case **demonstrated the financial incentive** but also highlighted the **risk of regulatory and reputational backlash**, which limited the strategy’s long‑term viability.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in biotech pricing politics and illustrates how orphan‑drug incentives can be exploited; the subsequent fallout (price cuts, FDA withdrawal, policy debate) makes it a valuable case study for both industry and regulators.
