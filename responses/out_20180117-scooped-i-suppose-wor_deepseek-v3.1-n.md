# Scooped, I Suppose the Word Is (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a retraction case involving researchers at Foshan University in China who published a paper in *Natural Product Research* on the crystal structure of a compound they named "aspergicine," produced by an *Aspergillus* marine fungus from mangrove swamps. The group had initially reported a different structure in 2011, then revised it based on new X-ray crystallography work. However, it was later discovered that aspergicine was actually an already known compound called "Circumdatin B," whose crystal structure had been correctly determined and published in 2008 in the *Journal of Organic Chemistry*. The article criticizes the researchers for inadequate literature review, noting that they failed to check existing X-ray databases or search for literature on alkaloids from their specific *Aspergillus* species, leading to an avoidable retraction when the duplication was identified.

## 2. HISTORY

The publication correction process functioned as intended in this case: the Foshan University group's 2018 *Natural Product Research* paper was officially retracted after the duplication with Circumdatin B was brought to light, maintaining the integrity of the scientific record on this compound. Natural products research on mangrove-derived *Aspergillus* fungi has continued, with ongoing studies investigating the bioactivity and synthetic routes of Circumdatin B and related structures for pharmaceutical discovery. This incident appears to have remained a relatively isolated case without triggering broader policy changes, but it reinforced community expectations for thorough literature reviews prior to publication of structural characterizations. The practical outcome was primarily correctional—retraction—rather than any sudden medical or commercial importance for the compound itself.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Article's implicit prediction about research practices**: The author suggested this type of inadequate literature review undermines research quality "from swamp fungi on up." The subsequent impact mirrors this concern—while no large-scale reforms followed, the retraction served as a cautionary example within the natural products community about verification protocols before claiming structural novelty.

• **Natural products importance**: The article noted natural products can be "either totally obscure or wildly important all of a sudden." Circumdatin B (aspergicine) appears to have remained relatively obscure in subsequent years, without achieving significant commercial development or becoming a major drug lead of clinical importance.

• **Corrective measures**: The piece suggested the paper "should be" retracted, which indeed occurred, aligning with the author's expectation for appropriate corrective action in the scientific publication system.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses a relatively narrow case of research integrity in natural products chemistry—a duplicate structure determination leading to retraction. While illustrative of broader concerns about literature diligence, the specific topic lacks significant long-term scientific or industry impact.
