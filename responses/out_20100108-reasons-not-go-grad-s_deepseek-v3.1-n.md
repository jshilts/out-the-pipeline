# Reasons Not to Go to Grad School? (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 commentary by Derek Lowe discussed a viral Chronicle of Higher Education article titled "Grad School in the Humanities: Just Don't Go," analyzing how its warnings about humanities graduate programs applied (or didn't) to science graduate programs. The original humanities-focused piece listed six problematic motivations for pursuing graduate study: idealizing a subject without realistic understanding of the commitment required (1); seeking validation that's unavailable in the outside world (2); preferring structured academic environments over ambiguous real-world careers (3); romanticizing college life and wanting to continue it indefinitely (4); inability to find work using undergraduate skills, with no mentors in the workplace (5); and treating graduate school as a place to hide from recession while waiting for the job market to improve (6).

Lowe's analysis argued that sciences differ crucially from humanities because science PhDs have extensive non-academic employment options and typically aren't burdened by educational debt. However, he acknowledged that many motivations still transfer—particularly using graduate school as shelter from recession, and that people tend to extend PhDs and postdocs when industrial and academic job markets are weak.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this article's publication revealed a mixed trajectory for science graduate education and academic careers:

**Academic Job Market Deterioration:** The "baby boomer retirement" expectation that would open academic positions proved largely illusory. Tenure-track positions continued their decades-long decline, with many institutions shifting to contingent/adjunct faculty. By the mid-2010s, discussion shifted to a "crisis" in academic employment. The post-2008 economic landscape fundamentally altered higher education funding models.

**Growth in Alternative Career Paths:** The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, after a challenging period around the 2008 financial crisis, experienced substantial growth in the 2010s. This expansion absorbed many science PhDs, validating Lowe's emphasis on multiple pathways outside academia. However, competition remained intense for permanent industrial positions.

**Postdoc Proliferation:** The trend Lowe identified toward extended postdoctoral periods intensified. By 2015-2017, it was not uncommon for scientists to spend 4-7 years (or longer) in multiple postdoctoral positions before securing permanent employment, either in academia or industry. This became a systemic labor issue within scientific research.

**Student Debt Patterns Changed:** While science PhDs traditionally avoided debt burdens, this began changing in the 2010s, particularly as master's degree programs proliferated. Some science fields saw increased debt accumulation that resembled the humanities model Lowe contrasted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There was one explicit prediction included: **"All those baby boomers have to retire someday, and when that happens, there will be jobs available in academe."**

- **Outcome:** This prediction proved incorrect. Baby boomer retirements did not open the expected floodgate of tenure-track positions. Instead, universities increasingly replaced retired faculty with contingent labor (adjuncts, lecturers) or eliminated lines entirely. The expansion of non-tenure-track positions and funding constraints meant retirements created fewer opportunities than anticipated. The academic job market remained severely constrained throughout the 2010s.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article has proven prescient in identifying structural issues that remain highly relevant to graduate education and science careers. Fifteen years later, the dynamics described around extended postdocs, recession sheltering, and differences between humanities and sciences careers remain central to policy discussions about research training and the academic labor market.
