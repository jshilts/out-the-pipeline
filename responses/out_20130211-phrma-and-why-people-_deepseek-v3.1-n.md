# PhRMA And Why People Dislike the Drug Industry (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2013 blog post responds to John LaMattina's Forbes article criticizing PhRMA (the pharmaceutical industry's main trade association) for failing to improve the industry's public image. The author agrees with LaMattina that releasing clinical trial data and disclosing physician consultant payments would help rebuild trust, but notes that PhRMA shows little interest in these transparency measures.

Rather than attributing this to stupidity or short-sightedness, the author argues that PhRMA acts rationally by prioritizing regulatory and legislative affairs over public relations. Since prescription drugs aren't discretionary purchases driven by brand affection, and the industry faces heavy government regulation at every stage, PhRMA focuses resources directly on influencing lawmakers and regulators rather than attempting the much larger and less cost-effective task of shifting public opinion to indirectly influence policy.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade saw significant developments on both transparency issues the original article highlighted:

**Clinical Trial Data Disclosure:**
- **2014**: PhRMA and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) jointly launched principles for responsible sharing of clinical trial data 
- **2015-2017**: Major companies including GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and Roche established data-sharing platforms allowing researchers to request access to patient-level clinical trial data
- **2016**: The FDA began implementing the 2007 FDA Amendments Act requirement for clinical trial results reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov, though compliance remained incomplete
- **2018**: The AllTrials campaign reported that approximately 50% of clinical trials remained unreported years after completion
- **2023**: Studies continued showing that many clinical trials still fail to report results within mandated timelines, though major pharmaceutical companies generally show better compliance than smaller sponsors

**Physician Payment Disclosure (Sunshine Act):**
- **2013**: The Physician Payments Sunshine Act (part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act) went into effect, requiring manufacturers to report payments to physicians
- **2014**: The first public data release through the Open Payments database showed $3.5 billion in payments to physicians and teaching hospitals in the last five months of 2013
- **2014-2023**: Annual disclosures continued, with 2022 data showing approximately $12.6 billion in payments across 17 million records
- **Impact**: Public access to payment data enabled research into conflicts of interest, but studies showed mixed effects on physician prescribing behavior and public trust remained low

**Industry Public Perception:**
- **2013-2023**: Gallup polling consistently showed the pharmaceutical industry ranked among the lowest in public confidence (bottom three industries), with approval ratings generally between 25-40%
- **COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023)**: Initial positive sentiment toward vaccine developers (notably Pfizer and Moderna) briefly improved perceptions, but concerns about pricing, access equity, and continued high drug prices eroded these gains
- **Drug pricing debates**: Continued political focus on prescription drug costs through multiple administrations maintained pharmaceutical industry as a frequent political target

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions made in the article:**
- PhRMA would continue prioritizing direct lobbying over public relations efforts
- Public perception would remain poor because it doesn't significantly impact sales of non-discretionary prescription drugs
- The cost-benefit calculation would favor regulatory influence over public opinion campaigns

**What actually happened:**
• **PhRMA's continued focus**: The organization maintained heavy lobbying expenditures ($25+ million annually) and active engagement on regulatory issues, confirming the author's assessment of priorities
• **Persistent low public trust**: Public opinion polls consistently showed the pharmaceutical industry remained among the least trusted sectors throughout 2013-2023, validating the premise that poor public perception didn't substantially impact sales
• **Partial transparency adoption**: Contrary to the article's implications about industry resistance, external pressures (Sunshine Act, AllTrials campaign, European regulations) did eventually force greater transparency than PhRMA initially supported, though disclosure remained incomplete
• **Cost-effectiveness assessment held**: Direct lobbying and regulatory engagement continued to be more immediately impactful than public relations, though reputational issues did contribute to some policy debates (drug pricing legislation, patent reform)

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

The article correctly identified the rational actor problem in pharmaceutical industry self-regulation and predicted the persistence of low public trust alongside sustained political influence. The subsequent decade largely confirmed these insights while showing how external regulatory pressure could force transparency improvements that voluntary industry action did not deliver.
