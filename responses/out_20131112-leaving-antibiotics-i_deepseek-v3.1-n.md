# Leaving Antibiotics: An Interview (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article presents an edited transcript of a PBS Frontline interview with Dr. Charles Knirsch, Pfizer's VP of clinical research, discussing the company's 2011 decision to exit antibiotic research. Knirsch defended the move as a "portfolio management decision," citing limited scientific success, emergence of toxicity issues in development, unclear regulatory pathways, and insufficient commercial returns compared to other therapeutic areas like vaccines. The interview highlights the economic challenges of antibiotic development—with generic alternatives costing as little as $30-35 per treatment course—which reduces the commercial viability of new antibiotics. The article's author suggests the interviewer was attempting to frame large pharmaceutical companies as abandoning patients for profit, while defending Knirsch's position as a pragmatic business decision in a scientifically challenging and financially unrewarding field.

## 2. HISTORY
The withdrawal of major pharmaceutical companies from antibiotic research documented in this 2013 interview proved to be part of a sustained trend with severe public health consequences. In the subsequent decade, antimicrobial resistance escalated into a global health crisis, with the WHO declaring AMR one of the top 10 global public health threats. By 2019, the CDC reported 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections annually in the US, causing 35,000 deaths.

Pfizer's exit was followed by other major players—AstraZeneca largely exited antibiotics in 2016, Sanofi in 2018, and Novartis in 2018. The remaining companies like GSK and Merck maintained reduced pipelines. This left antibiotic development increasingly dependent on smaller biotechnology companies and public-private partnerships.

Policy responses evolved significantly. The GAIN Act incentives (2012) had already offered extended exclusivity for qualified infectious disease products. Subsequent measures included the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' new technology add-on payment program for novel antibiotics (2020) and the PASTEUR Act proposal to create subscription models delinking antibiotic revenue from volume. Europe implemented similar market reforms, with the UK launching a pilot subscription model in 2019 and Sweden adopting delinked payment models.

Clinical failures continued to plague the field. Despite investment, no truly novel antibiotic classes reached the market between 2010-2020. Companies that persisted faced financial difficulties—Achaogen and Melinta Therapeutics both filed for bankruptcy after receiving FDA approval for new antibiotics, demonstrating the fundamental market failure in the space.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The interview contained several implicit predictions about the trajectory of antibiotic research:

• **Prediction**: Pharmaceutical company withdrawals would continue due to unfavorable economics and scientific challenges.
**Outcome**: **Accurate**. Multiple major companies (AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Novartis) exited between 2016-2018, validating the trend.

• **Prediction**: The shift from small-molecule antibiotics to other approaches like vaccines (Pfizer's C. difficile vaccine strategy) would be more commercially viable.
**Outcome**: **Mostly accurate**. Pfizer's C. difficile vaccine candidate was abandoned in 2017 after Phase III failures, showing that vaccine development also faced significant hurdles, though the broader vaccine market remained more attractive than antibiotics.

• **Prediction**: Scientific and regulatory challenges would persist in antibiotic discovery.
**Outcome**: **Accurate**. No new classes of antibiotics were successfully developed through 2020, and regulatory pathways remained complex with high Phase III failure rates.

• **Prediction**: Society's valuation of antibiotics would remain misaligned with their clinical importance.
**Outcome**: **Accurate but evolving**. While the initial assessment proved true, significant policy efforts emerged in response to the crisis, though fundamental market failures persisted through the next decade.

## 4. INTEREST
**Decile Score: 8/9**

This interview captured a critical inflection point in pharmaceutical strategy that presaged the growing antimicrobial resistance crisis, combining industry insider perspective with the broader economic and scientific challenges that would define the next decade of infectious disease treatment.
