# Things I Won't Work With: Peroxide Peroxides (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from Derek Lowe's "Things I Won't Work With" series discusses the hazards of hydrogen peroxide and its more dangerous analogs. The piece starts by explaining how hydrogen peroxide's reactivity increases dramatically with concentration—from relatively safe dilute solutions to 70% concentrations requiring chain-mail gloves. The author explains that the weakness of oxygen-oxygen single bonds makes peroxides inherently unstable, with decomposition catalyzed by metals, light, and impurities.

The article focuses particularly on dihydrogen trioxide (HOOOH), which the author dubs "hydrogen perperoxide"—a molecule with three consecutive oxygen atoms. While a 2014 JACS paper reported a relatively safe synthesis method using a platinum complex at low temperatures, the compound remains highly unstable. The article also mentions the "peroxone process," which combines ozone and hydrogen peroxide to create even more reactive species including the HOOOOO⁻ anion (five consecutive oxygens), primarily used for industrial water treatment. Throughout, the author maintains a humorous but serious tone about the extreme dangers of working with these compounds.

## 2. HISTORY

The specific compounds and safety concerns discussed in this 2014 article have seen limited advancement in mainstream chemistry due to their inherent instability. Dihydrogen trioxide (HOOOH) remains a laboratory curiosity with no significant commercial applications developed since 2014. The fundamental chemistry of poly-oxygen compounds has not changed dramatically—they remain dangerously unstable and unsuitable for most practical applications beyond specialized research contexts.

The peroxone process (ozone + hydrogen peroxide) mentioned in the article has continued to be used primarily in wastewater treatment and environmental remediation, where its extreme oxidizing power can break down persistent organic pollutants. However, it has not gained widespread adoption in organic synthesis due to the "uncontrolled" nature of the reactions that Lowe noted.

Safety standards in chemistry laboratories have evolved since 2014, with increased emphasis on proper risk assessment and engineering controls, but the fundamental hazards of concentrated peroxides remain unchanged. The article's central warning—that chemists should exercise extreme caution with these materials—has proven prescient, as incidents involving peroxide compounds continue to occur when proper handling protocols are not followed.

Artemisinin and other organic peroxides used in medicine have maintained their therapeutic roles, particularly in antimalarial treatments. Research into new peroxide-containing drugs has proceeded cautiously, recognizing the balance between biological activity and chemical stability that these compounds require.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction regarding dihydrogen trioxide purification:** Lowe stated he was "very sure that it's a bad, bad, idea" to purify HOOOH and questioned "how far you could get before everything goes through the ceiling."
- **Outcome:** No significant advances in purifying or concentrating HOOOH have emerged. The compound remains too unstable for practical applications beyond basic research, confirming Lowe's assessment.

**Prediction about peroxone process in organic synthesis:** Lowe questioned whether anyone had seen the peroxone process used for organic transformations, noting it would likely be "a bit... uncontrolled."
- **Outcome:** The peroxone process has not become a standard tool in organic synthesis. Its applications remain almost exclusively in environmental remediation, where its non-selective, highly oxidizing nature is an advantage rather than a limitation for destroying contaminants.

**Prediction about systematic exploration of polyperoxides:** Lowe noted that adding more oxygen-oxygen bonds would eventually "liberate the tiles from your floor and your windows from their frames."
- **Outcome:** Chemistry has not advanced significantly in creating or utilizing longer poly-oxygen chains for practical applications. The inherent instability remains a fundamental barrier, confirming the wisdom of Lowe's cautious approach.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The rating reflects an effective but narrowly focused safety communication piece that successfully raises awareness about specific chemical hazards. The article serves an important purpose in teaching chemical safety through engaging storytelling, though it addresses a rather specialized corner of chemistry.
