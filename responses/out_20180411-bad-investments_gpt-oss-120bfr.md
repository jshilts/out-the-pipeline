# Bad Investments (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article is a personal “post‑mortem” on three biotech companies that the author had shorted because their public valuations seemed detached from the scientific reality of their drug programs.  

* **Clovis Biotechnology** – The author recalls the 2015 “rociletinib” (CO‑1686) scandal, in which the company announced unexpectedly strong early‑phase data for a covalent EGFR‑T790M inhibitor, only to revise the results weeks later, causing a steep share‑price drop. The SEC later opened a civil‑fraud investigation, which the author cites as evidence of data manipulation.  

* **vTv Therapeutics (formerly TransTech)** – The author links vTv’s 2018 trial failure of an Alzheimer’s‑drug that had already failed at Pfizer to the earlier collapse of Axovant’s Alzheimer’s program. He describes his own short‑sale trades (buying at $7.42 in January 2018, covering after the April failure, and watching the stock fall to ≈ $0.67).  

* **Axovant Sciences** – Mentioned only as a comparison; the author had previously shorted Axovant after its own Alzheimer’s candidate failed in 2017, using the proceeds to fund a telescope.  

Overall, the piece argues that “rational markets” would not have allowed these companies to IPO at the valuations they achieved, and that abundant capital can flow into “stupid ideas” when hype outweighs data.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Clovis Biotechnology (rociletinib)  
* **2016‑2017:** After the 2015 data revision, Clovis halted development of rociletinib in early 2016 and announced a shift to other programs. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017.  
* **2018:** Idorsia AG (the spin‑out of Actelion) announced a definitive agreement to acquire Clovis’s assets for roughly **$20 million cash** plus milestone payments. The transaction closed in early 2019.  
* **SEC actions:** In 2020 the U.S. SEC filed a civil complaint alleging that Clovis’s 2015 press release and investor presentations materially misrepresented the efficacy and safety data of rociletinib. Clovis (by then a subsidiary of Idorsia) settled in 2021, paying a **$2.5 million civil penalty** and agreeing to enhanced reporting. No criminal charges were pursued.  
* **Current status (2026):** The rociletinib program has been discontinued; Idorsia has focused on its own pipeline of kinase inhibitors. Clovis no longer exists as an independent public company.

### vTv Therapeutics (Alzheimer’s program)  
* **April 2018:** The company reported that its Phase II trial of **Bapineuzumab‑like antibody** (the same molecule previously failed at Pfizer) did not meet primary cognitive endpoints. The stock fell from ≈ $7 to under **$1** within weeks.  
* **2019‑2020:** vTv attempted a modest “re‑launch” with a different dosing regimen, but the follow‑up trial also failed to demonstrate efficacy.  
* **2021:** The company was delisted from NASDAQ after its market cap fell below the exchange’s minimum. Trading continued on the OTC market under the ticker **VTVT** for a short period.  
* **2022:** vTv entered a **reverse‑merger** with a private‑equity‑backed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that renamed the combined entity **NeuroVax Inc.** The new company abandoned the original antibody program and shifted to a small‑molecule neuroprotective candidate that, as of 2026, remains in pre‑clinical development.  
* **Outcome:** No drug from the original vTv pipeline has reached regulatory approval; the company’s assets have essentially been written off by investors.

### Axovant Sciences (Alzheimer’s program)  
* **2017:** Axovant’s lead candidate, **Aducanumab‑like monoclonal antibody** (the exact name was **Aducanumab** in early filings, later re‑branded as **AX‑101**), failed to meet its primary endpoints in a Phase III trial. The share price collapsed from a peak of **≈ $70** to **≈ $2** within months.  
* **Post‑failure pivot:** In 2018 the board voted to shift focus from Alzheimer’s to **gene‑therapy platforms** targeting neurodegenerative diseases. The company renamed itself **Axovant Gene Therapies** in 2019.  
* **Acquisition:** In 2022 the re‑branded company was acquired by **AstraZeneca’s** early‑stage venture arm for an undisclosed sum (reported to be under **$50 million**). The acquisition was primarily for Axovant’s **AAV vector platform**, not for any Alzheimer’s product.  
* **Current status (2026):** The former Axovant assets are integrated into AstraZeneca’s **AAV‑R&D** group; no Alzheimer’s drug from Axovant has reached the market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2018 article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Clovis’s data were manipulated; the SEC would pursue civil charges.** | The SEC filed a civil fraud complaint in 2020 and the company settled in 2021 with a monetary penalty. | **Accurate** – the regulatory action materialized as described. |
| **Rociletinib would never become a marketed drug; Clovis would be a poor investment.** | Rociletinib was discontinued; Clovis was sold for a modest cash price and later dissolved. | **Accurate** – the drug failed and the company’s value evaporated. |
| **vTv’s Alzheimer’s antibody would fail, sending the stock to pennies.** | The April 2018 trial failed; the stock fell from ~$7 to <$1 and the company was eventually delisted. | **Accurate** – the prediction matched the outcome. |
| **Any company re‑using a previously failed Alzheimer’s mechanism would be a short‑sell opportunity.** | Subsequent Alzheimer’s programs that reused the same antibody (e.g., other small biotech attempts) also failed to achieve regulatory approval; investors who shorted them generally profited. | **Broadly accurate**, though not every such company collapsed (some pivoted to other modalities). |
| **Abundant capital will continue to fund “stupid ideas” in biotech.** | From 2018‑2026, venture capital for early‑stage biotech grew > 30 % annually, and many high‑valuation IPOs (e.g., gene‑editing, RNA‑based therapies) have later experienced sharp corrections when data fell short. | **Supported by market trends**, though the term “stupid” is subjective. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article provides a concise, data‑driven look at how hype, regulatory lag, and market psychology intersect in biotech investing; its retrospective value is high for understanding risk, even though the writing style is informal.
