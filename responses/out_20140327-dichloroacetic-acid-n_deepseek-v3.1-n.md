# Dichloroacetic Acid, In a New Form (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary discusses dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a compound that generated significant attention in 2007 as a potential cancer therapy. The article notes that DCA continues to be referenced in internet forums as a "cancer cure" that pharmaceutical companies allegedly avoid because it's unpatentable, too cheap, or not profitable enough. However, the author points out that DCA remains an active area of legitimate research, with studies even involving patients who self-administered the compound.

The main scientific problem identified with DCA as a drug is its poor pharmacokinetics—as a small, highly ionized carboxylic acid, it doesn't effectively reach its site of action in the mitochondria. The article highlights a research effort from the University of Georgia attempting to address this limitation by tethering multiple DCA molecules to a scaffold designed to better target mitochondria. While this new compound showed promise in cellular studies, no in vivo data was available at the time of publication.

The author uses this example to challenge the narrative that pharmaceutical companies avoid unpatentable compounds, noting that this modified DCA molecule represents a "new molecule" that could indeed be patented due to its novelty and improved utility.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 article, research on DCA and mitochondrial-targeted approaches continued, though with mixed outcomes:

**DCA Clinical Development:**
Clinical trials of DCA itself continued, including studies for various cancers. However, these trials generally showed limited efficacy and significant side effects, particularly peripheral neuropathy. By the late 2010s, DCA had not received FDA approval for any cancer indication and remained an experimental compound used primarily in research settings.

**Mitochondrial-Targeted Drug Delivery:**
The broader field of mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics advanced significantly after 2014. Researchers developed various mitochondrial-targeting strategies using triphenylphosphonium cations, mitochondrial-penetrating peptides, and other delivery systems. Some of these platforms progressed to clinical trials for different therapeutic areas, though targeting cancer remained challenging due to the complexity of mitochondrial biology in cancer cells.

**Drug Approval and Commercial Success:**
The specific DCA-scaffold compound mentioned in the article did not progress to become an approved drug. No mitochondrial-targeted DCA derivative received FDA approval for cancer treatment in the subsequent decade.

**Research Continuation:**
The University of Georgia research group and others continued investigating mitochondrial metabolism in cancer, but the focus shifted toward better understanding the metabolic complexities of cancer cells rather than DCA specifically as a monotherapy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions and claims:

• **Prediction: The DCA-scaffold molecule would be "perfectly capable of being patented"** - **OUTCOME**: This was accurate. Pharmaceutical companies regularly patent modified versions of natural compounds and existing molecules through structural modifications, formulations, or delivery mechanisms. The patent system does allow for protection of novel derivatives with improved properties.

• **Prediction: The scaffold approach would solve DCA's poor pharmacokinetics** - **OUTCOME**: Limited success. While research on mitochondrial-targeted delivery systems advanced, the specific DCA scaffold mentioned did not lead to a clinically successful drug. The complexity of cancer metabolism and drug delivery proved more challenging than initially hoped.

• **Prediction: Pharmaceutical companies would be interested in patentable versions of DCA** - **OUTCOME**: Mixed. While companies are indeed interested in patentable compounds (the patent system functioning as described), DCA derivatives did not emerge as a major focus for pharmaceutical development due to limited clinical success of the parent compound and better alternative approaches emerging.

• **Implicit prediction: The "Evil Pharma won't work on X because it can't be patented" narrative would be disproven by such developments** - **OUTCOME**: Accurate in principle, but the specific example didn't provide compelling evidence since the DCA derivative didn't succeed commercially. Pharmaceutical companies do regularly develop patentable versions of natural products (examples include taxol derivatives, metformin formulations, etc.), but this particular case didn't become a success story.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article represents a moderately interesting case study in drug development and public perception of pharmaceutical research. While the specific DCA research didn't lead to breakthrough treatments, it illustrates broader principles about drug delivery challenges, patent strategies, and the gap between internet narratives and scientific reality. The mitochondrial-targeting approach discussed has relevance beyond this specific compound.
