# The Nativis Voyager Appears (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the Nativis Voyager, a device being tested in clinical trials for glioblastoma (GBM) patients. The company, Nativis, claimed their device could record "RF signatures" of drugs in solution and play them back to create the drug's effect without the actual compound. The author expresses extreme skepticism about this mechanism, ranking it as impossible compared to merely "unlikely" for the existing NovoCure Optune device, which uses electric fields.

The piece highlights the first reported human patient using the Voyager—a softball coach with recurrent GBM—who wears a thin blue headband over 20 hours daily. The clinical trial (NCT02296580) is aimed at recurrent GBM patients who have exhausted standard treatments like radiation and temozolomide. The author questions the scientific plausibility while acknowledging the desperate need for GBM treatments and the ethical complexity of offering hope through unproven devices. Four research centers, including Swedish Neuroscience Institute, were reportedly involved in the feasibility study.

## 2. HISTORY

Nativis and its Voyager device ultimately disappeared from legitimate clinical development without producing meaningful evidence or FDA approval. No peer-reviewed publications demonstrated efficacy for the "RF signature" recording and playback concept, which contradicts fundamental principles of pharmacology and molecular biology.

The clinical trial mentioned in the article (NCT02296580) was either terminated or completed without significant results. The glioblastoma treatment landscape for recurrent disease remains extremely challenging, with median survival typically under 12 months. NovoCure's Optune device, while controversial, did receive FDA approval and continues to be used in GBM treatment, though its overall impact on survival remains modest (typically extending survival by a few months in combination with standard therapy). No other RF-signature-based therapeutics entered mainstream medicine following Nativis's failure, as the underlying mechanism lacks scientific basis.

The company appears to have ceased operations or pivoted away from this technology without achieving clinical success or regulatory approval.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's strong skepticism about Nativis device viability**
- **Prediction**: The author expressed extreme doubt that the Nativis Voyager could work, ranking it "don't see any possible way it can be real"
- **Outcome**: **ACCURATE** - No credible evidence emerged that the device was effective, and it failed to achieve clinical success or regulatory approval

**Assessment of NovoCure device**
- **Prediction**: Described as "unlikely to be real" but mentioned it had some clinical usage in recurrent GBM
- **Outcome**: **MODERATELY ACCURATE** - The Optune device did receive FDA approval and continues to be used, though its overall clinical benefit remains modest and controversial within the neuro-oncology community

**Implied prediction about market viability**
- **Prediction**: The author noted that both devices were targeting the same desperate patient population with poor prognosis
- **Outcome**: **ACCURATE** - The GBM recurrent disease market remains challenging with high unmet need, but only the NovoCure device achieved any market presence, while Nativis disappeared completely

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates the critical importance of scientific skepticism and evidence-based evaluation in biotechnology, particularly when examining technologies that fundamentally contradict established scientific principles. The case of Nativis Voyager represents a valuable cautionary tale about the need for rigorous mechanism-of-action understanding before advancing to human trials, even in diseases with desperate unmet needs.
