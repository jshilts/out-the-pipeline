# The Novartis Pipeline (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post critiques a Reuters article claiming that Novartis could produce 14 or more blockbuster drugs within five years. The author expresses skepticism about pharmaceutical companies making bold pipeline predictions, noting that such forecasts rarely materialize as planned. The commentary highlights the track record of drug companies failing to deliver on promised timelines and suggests that companies are better off announcing results rather than making ambitious predictions that risk disappointment. While acknowledging that Novartis research has been productive and that the company has better prospects than most, the author maintains a cautious stance about these blockbuster drug predictions.

## 2. HISTORY
The five-year period following this 2012 article (2013-2017) revealed the accuracy of the author's skepticism. Novartis did not achieve 14 blockbuster drugs (>$1 billion annual sales) within this timeframe. 

Looking at Novartis's actual drug launches and approvals during 2013-2017: 
- Secukinumab (Cosentyx) approved January 2015 - became a blockbuster for psoriatic disease
- Serelaxin (Reasanz) approved in Europe 2014 but failed to gain FDA approval
- LCZ696 (Entresto) approved July 2015 - eventually became blockbuster but took time to reach those sales levels
- Kisqali (ribociclib) approved March 2017 - grew into significant cancer drug

However, many pipeline candidates did not reach blockbuster status, and some had clinical failures. Novartis's actual performance fell well short of the 14-blockbuster prediction, demonstrating the wisdom of the author's cautious approach to pharmaceutical industry forecasting. The article's skepticism was well-founded given the historically low odds of such ambitious predictions succeeding.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Reuters prediction**: Novartis would produce 14+ blockbuster drugs within five years (by 2017)
  - **Reality**: This did not materialize. Novartis launched several successful drugs but fell far short of 14 blockbusters.
  
- **Author's implied prediction**: That such bold pharmaceutical predictions rarely work out
  - **Reality**: This was validated. Novartis's actual performance confirmed industry predictions should be viewed skeptically.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3/9**

Moderate interest - the article demonstrated sound industry skepticism that proved accurate, but the underlying pattern of pharmaceutical companies overpromising is a routine story without broader transformative implications.
