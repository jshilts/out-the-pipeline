# Antidepressants: Depressing News or Not? (February 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a PLoS Medicine meta-analysis examining the clinical effectiveness of four modern antidepressants: Prozac (fluoxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Serzone (nefazodone), and Paxil (paroxetine). The analysis compared published and regulatory filing data from placebo-controlled studies, finding that these drugs showed minimal benefit over placebo for most patients.

A key finding was that the most severely depressed patients did show statistically meaningful drug response, but this appeared largely because the placebo response diminished in this group rather than because drug efficacy increased. The article notes that huge placebo effects have long plagued antidepressant trials, with 25-50% of depressed patients responding to placebo alone. The author suggests the actual news should have been that antidepressants "might actually do something" in severe cases, rather than the headlines proclaiming they don't work. The commentary also raises concerns about the meta-analysis methodology, noting most included trials were short (six weeks or less) when antidepressants may take longer to show true benefit, and that only one study examined moderately depressed patients.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2008 analysis, the controversy over antidepressant efficacy continued to evolve. The SSRIs examined (fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine) remained widely prescribed medications, with fluoxetine and paroxetine going generic and becoming more accessible. Nefazodone (Serzone) was indeed discontinued in many markets due to hepatotoxicity concerns, validating the article's reference to it as "partially discontinued."

The pharmaceutical industry faced increased scrutiny over publication bias—the tendency to publish only positive trials. This led to regulatory changes requiring registration of all clinical trials and publication of results, addressing some of the methodological concerns raised in the article.

The "antidepressants versus placebo" debate continued through subsequent meta-analyses and reviews. Research expanded to examine genetic markers (pharmacogenomics) that might predict individual patient responses, though clinical adoption of genetic testing remained limited. The STAR*D trial results, examining treatment-resistant depression, became influential in showing modest benefits and high relapse rates even with multiple medication switches.

The placebo effect in depression treatment remained a significant research focus, with studies investigating psychological mechanisms, expectancies, and the therapeutic relationship as mediators of antidepressant response. However, pinpointing exactly how much benefit is "drug effect" versus "placebo effect" remained methodologically challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions in the original article:**

• **That SSRIs would continue being prescribed despite questions about efficacy** - CONFIRMED. Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine remained first-line treatments for depression for years after 2008, though guidelines increasingly emphasized combined medication and psychotherapy approaches.

• **That publication bias and methodological limitations would continue influencing antidepressant research** - CONFIRMED. Regulatory reforms were implemented requiring trial registration and publication of results, addressing some transparency concerns. However, debates about appropriate outcome measures, trial duration, and patient selection criteria persisted.

• **That placebo effects would remain a confounding factor in psychiatric drug trials** - CONFIRMED. Meta-analyses consistently show placebo response rates between 30-45% in depression trials, though research has explored methods to reduce this (enriched enrollment, sequential parallel comparison designs).

• **That the mechanism of antidepressant action would remain incompletely understood** - CONFIRMED. While the serotonin hypothesis became increasingly questioned and alternatives like neuroplasticity and inflammation gained interest, the precise cellular mechanisms through which various antidepressants work remained incompletely resolved, even as of 2024.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses fundamental issues in psychopharmacology that remain methodologically and clinically relevant: placebo controls, publication bias, and the distinction between statistical significance and clinical meaningfulness in depression treatment. While focused on a specific drug class, it touches on broader concerns about evidence-based medicine and regulatory standards that persisted long after publication.
