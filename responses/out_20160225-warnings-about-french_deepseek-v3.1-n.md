# Warnings About the French Clinical Trial Disaster (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article covers emerging leaks and details following the January 2016 French clinical trial disaster in Rennes. The incident involved a Phase I trial of BIA 10-2474, a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor drug candidate developed by the Portuguese pharmaceutical company Bial. Six healthy volunteers were dosed; one died and five others were hospitalized with severe neurological damage.

Key revelations reported in this piece include: leaked information suggesting the affected patients suffered brain damage in critical regions including the hippocampus and pons; questions about trial design that gave large doses to five participants simultaneously; and explosive allegations that preclinical data showed several dogs died during animal testing of the compound. The author emphasizes that deaths in dog toxicology studies are typically a major red flag that normally prevents advancement to human trials unless explanations are exceptionally compelling, invoking the industry principle "Drugs kill dogs and dogs kill drugs."

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent investigations and developments confirmed many of the concerns raised in this article:

**Regulatory and Criminal Findings (2016-2018):**  
French regulatory investigations found multiple violations. The ANSM (French medicines agency) suspended Biotrial, the contract research organization conducting the trial, from conducting new studies and imposed corrective measures. A French court in 2018 fined Biotrial €30,000, while the company's medical director received a criminal conviction with a one-year suspended prison sentence and €20,000 fine for "unintentional injuries." Three other individuals were acquitted.

**Scientific and Industry Impact:**  
The disaster prompted immediate reforms in clinical trial oversight, with European regulators tightening Phase I trial protocols and increasing scrutiny of first-in-human studies. The FAAH inhibitor mechanism, which had been pursued by multiple companies (including Pfizer, Merck, and Johnson & Johnson) for conditions like anxiety and pain, fell out of favor across the industry. Janssen halted its FAAH inhibitor program in 2016, effectively ending major pharmaceutical investment in this target class.

**Victim Outcomes:**  
Contrary to early hopes about patients being "out of danger," long-term follow-up revealed severe lasting damage. Multiple victims experienced permanent neurological impairment and cognitive deficits, with some remaining seriously disabled years after the incident. The contrast between initial optimistic statements and long-term reality highlighted the complexity of predicting outcomes from deep brain injuries.

**Approved Drugs/Business Impact:**  
No FAAH inhibitors reached FDA or EMA approval following this incident. The field largely collapsed, demonstrating how a single well-publicized clinical trial disaster can eliminate an entire drug target class despite theoretical promise. The event underscored the critical importance of preclinical safety signals and continues to be cited in discussions of first-in-human trial design.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions that were validated:

• **Dog toxicity as a critical warning signal**: The author strongly suggested that dog deaths in preclinical studies should have halted or significantly slowed human trials. This prediction proved accurate—subsequent investigations identified the preclinical toxicity signals as a key failure point, validating the importance of the "drugs kill dogs" heuristic. The limited information available in 2016 did not capture all the nuances (dose relationships, specific mechanisms), but the fundamental concern was well-founded.

• **Severity of neurological damage**: While the brief mention that patients seemed "out of danger" was questioned by the author with appropriate skepticism, suggesting irreversible disability was likely. The long-term outcomes revealed permanent severe neurological impairment, validating the concern that hippocampus and pons damage would be devastating.

• **Regulatory and investigative scrutiny**: The article anticipated that the investigative committee would focus significantly on whether preclinical signals warranted human testing. This proved accurate, as this became a central element in the regulatory and legal proceedings.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**  
This article captures a pivotal moment in clinical trial safety, addressing a rare but catastrophic event that had lasting regulatory and therapeutic area impacts. The intersection of preclinical science, ethical oversight, and patient harm makes it historically significant with enduring relevance for drug development policy.
