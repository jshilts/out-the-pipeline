# A Rough Business (December 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a Wall Street Journal front-page story exposing Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMS) accounting manipulation practices. The pharmaceutical company had committed to delivering 12% annual sales growth for five consecutive years to Wall Street investors, despite facing significant patent expirations on key drugs that would inevitably reduce revenue. This unrealistic growth target created intense pressure on managers throughout the organization, leading to widespread accounting irregularities designed to artificially inflate sales and earnings figures. The revelations came as BMS was in the process of restating multiple years of financial results, with the article characterizing the findings as both "interesting" and "disturbing."

## 2. HISTORY

Bristol-Myers Squibb's accounting scandal of the early 2000s had significant real-world consequences. In 2004, the company agreed to pay $150 million to settle SEC charges related to a "channel-stuffing" scheme, where BMS artificially inflated sales by loading wholesalers/distributors with excess inventory beyond actual demand. The scheme involved offering financial inducements to wholesalers to purchase more pharmaceuticals than needed, with the excess later returned for credit, creating temporary sales numbers that misrepresented true demand.

In 2005, BMS also settled shareholder litigation for an additional $300 million, bringing total settlements to $450 million. Company executives faced individual penalties, with then-CEO Peter Dolan eventually being replaced as a result of the governance failures. BMS was required to restate financial results for 1999-2001, reducing previously reported earnings by approximately $2 billion in the restatement process. The scandal triggered increased SEC scrutiny of pharmaceutical industry accounting practices more broadly, particularly around channel-stuffing techniques.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Corporate governance impact**: The article correctly identified that maintaining 12% growth commitments in the face of patent expirations was "unkeepable" and would lead to further problems. This proved accurate - BMS faced years of SEC investigations, shareholder lawsuits, and executive turnover as a direct consequence.

• **Drug industry business model stress**: Though not explicitly predicted, the underlying pressure described reflects broader patterns in pharmaceutical companies facing patent cliffs. Pharmaceutical companies continue to face similar pressures decades later, with various companies resorting to different strategies including mergers, cost-cutting, or innovative approaches to maintain growth during patent expiration periods.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures a real accounting scandal with measurable financial and regulatory consequences, making it significantly more interesting than generic business commentary. The exposure of specific governance failures and their tangible outcomes (SEC settlements, executive changes) makes it historically noteworthy.
