# Dumber in English? (November 2007)

## 1. Summary

This commentary by Derek Lowe reflects on an article titled "Dumber in English" by Stefan Klein, which argued that conducting science in a second language (primarily English for non-native speakers) creates intellectual handicaps. The author shares personal experiences from his post-doctoral work in Germany, acknowledging his own reduced mental agility when working in German compared to his native English.

Klein's original article highlighted the tension faced by German scientists who must choose between presenting research in English to gain international credibility versus presenting in German to engage local audiences and maintain linguistic precision. The commentary discusses how German, once dominant in chemistry and physics, has been largely displaced by English in scientific discourse. Lowe also addresses concerns about scientific terminology in different languages and the separation of science from general populations in non-English-speaking countries.

## 2. History

In the 17+ years since this article was published, English has become even more dominant in scientific communication, confirming both Klein's observations and Lowe's predictions.

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- The proportion of scientific publications in English exceeded 90% in many fields by the 2010s
- PubMed and other major scientific databases are overwhelmingly English-language
- High-impact journals such as Nature, Science, Cell, and others are exclusively English-language

**Consequences:**
- Scientific communities in non-English-speaking countries increasingly use English even for domestic conferences
- Grant applications and evaluation criteria in many non-English-speaking countries now require or strongly prefer English-language proposals
- The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift toward English dominance as international collaboration became critical

The author's suggestion that "nothing will stop the rise and dominance of English in the sciences" has largely proven accurate. However, this has created systematic challenges for non-native English speakers who face publication barriers and reduced competitiveness in international scientific discourse.

## 3. Predictions

The original commentary included several explicit and implicit predictions:

- **English dominance in sciences would continue** ✓ **Mostly accurate**
  - English has become even more dominant in scientific publishing, conferences, and international collaboration
  - The trend has accelerated rather than reversed

- **Advantages of a common scientific language (lingua franca) would outweigh problems** ± **Debatable**
  - While English facilitates international collaboration and information flow, concerns about equity, accessibility, and the marginalization of non-English-speaking researchers have grown substantially
  - Many scientific organizations now explicitly recognize and attempt to address language-based barriers

- **Native English speakers' advantage would persist** ✓ **Confirmed**
  - Studies have shown that non-native English speakers face longer publication times, higher rejection rates, and greater burden in scientific writing
  - The linguistic advantage for native speakers remains a significant factor in scientific productivity metrics

## 4. Interest

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a fundamental and persistent challenge in global scientific communication that has only become more relevant with time. The tension between the practical need for a common scientific language and the equity issues this creates remains unresolved nearly two decades later.
