# Ricin Redux (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article was written by a chemist in response to ricin being discovered in the Senate building (and possibly the White House) in early 2004. The author explains that ricin is a protein toxin derived from castor beans that inhibits protein synthesis by attacking ribosomal RNA, functioning as an enzyme that can destroy thousands of ribosomes per molecule. The toxin is relatively easy to isolate and purify using methods available in open literature, and can even be purchased from biochemical supply houses. 

The article details that ricin's toxicity varies dramatically by exposure route: inhalation is the most dangerous method (comparable to anthrax weaponization), while oral ingestion is about 4000 times less potent because digestion breaks down most of the protein. The author references the famous 1978 assassination of Bulgarian exile Georgi Markov, who was killed by approximately 0.5 milligrams of ricin injected via umbrella tip. The article concludes that ricin poses limited threat unless aerosolized like anthrax, and suggests the Senate incident was likely the work of an amateur rather than a sophisticated terrorist operation.

## 2. HISTORY

The February 2004 Senate ricin incident turned out to be part of a series of ricin-related events connected to an individual named Kenneth Olsen. A white powdery substance containing ricin was found in the mailroom of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's office in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 3, 2004, leading to a three-day closure of the building and decontamination efforts. This came just three years after the 2001 anthrax attacks, which heightened bioterrorism concerns significantly.

The investigation ultimately focused on Kenneth Olsen, who was indicted in 2004 on charges of possessing a biological toxin (ricin) and attempting to use it as a weapon. However, the case took a tragic turn when Olsen died by suicide in January 2005 while awaiting trial. While prosecutors presented evidence including ricin powder found in Olsen's car and storage locker, no clear motive for targeting Senate offices was ever definitively established. The incident contributed to ongoing concerns about biosecurity vulnerabilities in government facilities and mail screening procedures.

**Clinical countermeasures:** The 2004 incident and other ricin cases spurred continued research into ricin countermeasures. Ricine, as the author noted, has no specific antidote, and treatment remains primarily supportive care. Research into ricin vaccines and therapeutic antibodies continued through the 2000s and 2010s, with several candidates entering clinical trials. The US government designated ricin as a Category B bioterrorism agent, leading to increased research funding and emergency preparedness protocols.

**Regulatory response:** Following this and similar incidents, the CDC and FBI enhanced protocols for handling suspicious substances, and mail screening procedures at government facilities were substantially improved. The incident reinforced that ricin was indeed "one of the easiest toxins to isolate" as the author stated, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities in biosecurity despite improved awareness after the 2001 anthrax attacks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's predictions and assessments regarding ricin threats:

• **Immediate threat assessment**: The author predicted the Senate incident was likely "the work of some disgruntled and/or deranged amateur" rather than sophisticated terrorists, because the ricin hadn't been processed to the level of anthrax attack material. This assessment proved largely accurate - while Kenneth Olsen had produced relatively pure ricin, there was no evidence of aerosolized weaponization or a coordinated terrorist plot.

• **Inhalation vs. ingestion danger**: The article correctly emphasized that inhalation is the most dangerous exposure route, while oral ingestion is far less effective. This assessment has remained accurate in subsequent cases and preparedness planning.

• **Accessibility concern**: The author's statement that "it's probably one of the easiest toxins to isolate" and can be obtained from supply houses has proven correct and remains a ongoing security concern. Subsequent cases, including later amateur ricin production incidents, have confirmed this relative accessibility.

• **Implicit prediction about aerosolization difficulty**: The author noted that terrorists would face manufacturing problems similar to anthrax if trying to create inhalable ricin particles. This has held true - there have been no documented cases of successful large-scale ricin aerosolization attacks, and most criminal ricin cases have involved simpler delivery methods (contaminated food, letters, etc.).

• **On weaponization potential**: While the author correctly identified the technical barriers to weaponization, the persistent accessibility of ricin means it remains a concern for individual actors rather than large-scale coordinated threats.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides competent but relatively straightforward chemistry education about ricin in response to a real-time security incident. While the toxicology and historical context are solid, it offers limited lasting biological or medical insight compared to research on therapeutics, diagnostics, or fundamental biology.
