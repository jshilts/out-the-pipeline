# Our Friend the Sulfur Atom (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a short commentary by medicinal chemist Derek Lowe highlighting a review paper on noncovalent interactions with sulfur atoms in drug design. The article emphasizes sulfur's unique position in the periodic table—small enough to fit into organic structures but large enough to exhibit orbital effects not seen in elements one row above (like oxygen). The key scientific point is how bivalent sulfur's sigma* orbitals can interact with lone pairs on oxygen and nitrogen atoms, creating conformational effects similar to hydrogen bonds. Lowe notes that medicinal chemists often encounter sulfur's importance in a negative sense—when trying to replace sulfur-containing groups and finding that no alternatives work as effectively. He also raises skepticism about dynamic combinatorial chemistry approaches using disulfide formation, since converting these hits into druglike entities requires replacing disulfide bonds, for which there are no good substitutes.

## 2. HISTORY

The understanding of sulfur's role in medicinal chemistry has evolved significantly since 2015, though the fundamental insights presented in the original review remain valid. Noncovalent sulfur interactions, particularly sulfur-mediated hydrogen bonds and hyperconjugation effects, are now more widely appreciated in rational drug design. The concept of sulfur as a "hydrogen bond acceptor" through its sigma* orbitals gained experimental validation through advanced spectroscopic methods and computational studies published in subsequent years.

Regarding drug development outcomes: sulfur-containing drugs continue to represent a substantial fraction of FDA approvals, maintaining roughly 15-20% of small molecule drugs annually. The challenges Lowe mentioned about disulfide replacement in drug optimization remain relevant, particularly in peptide-based therapeutics and cyclic compounds where disulfide bridges provide conformational rigidity. However, advances in synthetic methodology have provided more options for isosteric replacement, though the fundamental issue persists—sulfur often provides unique properties that are difficult to replicate.

The broader field has seen increased recognition of sulfur's role in protein-ligand interactions, with pharmaceutical companies incorporating sulfur-specific design principles into their medicinal chemistry workflows more systematically than in 2015.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself made limited explicit predictions, functioning more as a commentary on existing research. However, the implied expectations and concerns can be evaluated:

• **Sulfur's continued importance in drug design**: ✓ VALIDATED
  - Sulfur-containing drugs remain prominent in pharmaceutical pipelines and FDA approvals, confirming that sulfur's unique properties cannot be easily substituted

• **Challenges with disulfide replacement strategies**: ✓ VALIDATED
  - The difficulty of replacing disulfide bonds in drug optimization persists as a significant challenge in medicinal chemistry, particularly for macrocyclic and constrained peptides

• **Recognition of sulfur's noncovalent interactions**: ✓ VALIDATED
  - The importance of sulfur's orbital effects and its role in molecular recognition became more widely appreciated, with numerous subsequent publications exploring these interactions

• **Dynamic combinatorial chemistry limitations**: ✓ PARTIALLY VALIDATED
  - While disulfide-based dynamic combinatorial chemistry still faces the replacement challenge Lowe identified, the field has developed alternative approaches and better strategies for scaffold modification

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article addresses an important but somewhat niche technical aspect of medicinal chemistry. While it highlights a significant concept in drug design, the extremely short format limits its depth and broader impact compared to more comprehensive reviews or primary research on sulfur chemistry's applications in drug discovery.
