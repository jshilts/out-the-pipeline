# Evidence Against Open Offices (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses emerging evidence challenging the effectiveness of open-office designs, particularly in scientific and biotech industry settings. The article highlights a comprehensive 2011 review by organizational psychologist Matthew Davis, who analyzed over one hundred studies on office environments. Davis found that while open offices created a symbolic sense of organizational mission and gave employees a feeling of being part of innovative, collaborative enterprises, they actually damaged workers' attention spans, productivity, creative thinking, and job satisfaction. Compared to traditional enclosed offices, employees in open-plan environments experienced more uncontrolled interruptions, higher stress levels, and reduced concentration and motivation. The author personally relates to these findings, describing how interruptions disrupt deep thinking and intellectual work. The piece notes the irony that despite growing evidence of problems with open offices, many companies in the biotech/pharma industry continued enthusiastically adopting these designs.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the publication of this article, considerable research has emerged validating and expanding upon these concerns about open offices:

**Academic Research Development**: Multiple peer-reviewed studies published since 2014 have reinforced that open offices reduce rather than enhance collaboration. Notably, a 2018 Harvard Business School study using digital tracking found that face-to-face interactions decreased significantly (around 70%) when companies transitioned to open offices, while electronic communication increased - the opposite of what proponents claimed. Researchers Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban documented these findings across multiple companies implementing open-office designs.

**Pandemic Acceleration of Reassessment**: The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023) dramatically accelerated questioning of open-office orthodoxy. During periods of remote work, many companies discovered that productivity didn't collapse as feared, challenging long-held assumptions about open collaboration spaces. Post-pandemic, major companies including Google, Apple, and Microsoft redesigned their office spaces, moving away from fully open designs and incorporating more private spaces, quiet areas, and flexible working arrangements.

**Biotech Industry Impact**: The biotech and pharmaceutical industries, mentioned in the original article as enthusiastic adopters, have shown mixed responses. Some companies maintained open designs, but many began incorporating "focus rooms," quiet zones, and more private spaces alongside collaborative areas. The trend moved toward hybrid approaches rather than purely open layouts.

**No Evidence of Industry-Wide Abandonment**: However, open offices did not disappear entirely. Many companies retained elements of open design while mitigating problems through acoustic treatments, workspace zoning, and providing options for both collaborative and focused work. The conversation shifted from "open versus closed" to finding optimal configurations that balance different work modes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

While the article didn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, several implicit expectations can be evaluated:

- **Implicit Prediction**: That evidence against open offices would accumulate and potentially influence corporate decision-making
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Correct. Extensive additional research has emerged, and major companies have indeed redesigned office spaces, though the shift was more gradual than revolutionary

- **Implicit Prediction**: That the scientific/biotech community's skepticism about open offices would either be validated or proven misplaced
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Correct. Research consistently validated the concerns, showing reduced productivity and face-to-face collaboration in open offices

- **Implicit Prediction**: That open offices would continue to be popular despite evidence against them
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Correct. Open office designs remained widely used, though often in modified forms, demonstrating resistance to full abandonment despite mounting evidence

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article proved prescient in identifying a workplace design trend that subsequent research consistently confirmed as problematic. It addressed an important, practical issue affecting workplace productivity and employee wellbeing, and correctly anticipated that evidence against open offices would accumulate. However, it focused mostly on individual productivity concerns without addressing other important factors like space efficiency and the complex economic and social dynamics that sustain open offices despite their drawbacks.
