# Lose Money Now! Ask Me How! (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog describes SEC enforcement actions against fraudulent stock promotion schemes in small biotech companies. The piece highlights a specific case involving Lion Biotechnologies (formerly Lion Biotech), its former CEO Singh, and related entities like Lavos LLC and Lidingo Holdings.

The article explains that from 2011-2014, these entities engaged in classic pump-and-dump operations, paying writers to publish over 400 promotional articles and distribute emails to thousands of potential investors about small biotech stocks. The SEC settlement required Lion to pay $100,000 in civil penalties, while Singh agreed to disgorge $1.75 million plus interest and pay an additional $1 million in civil penalties, with a five-year ban from serving as a public company officer or director. The piece notes this as part of a broader pattern of stock promotion schemes targeting investors who lack the technical knowledge to evaluate biotech investments properly.

## 2. HISTORY
The SEC enforcement actions described in this 2017 article reflect ongoing regulatory efforts to combat market manipulation in the biotech sector. Following this 2017 settlement, Lion Biotechnologies continued operations and eventually rebranded as Iovance Biotherapeutics.

Iovance Biotherapeutics (formerly Lion Biotech) has since developed into a legitimate cell therapy company. The company has advanced tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies through clinical development. Most significantly, **Iovance received FDA approval for AMTAGVI (lifileucel) in February 2024** for the treatment of advanced melanoma, representing a meaningful clinical advance in cell therapy.

The broader context of biotech stock promotion schemes remains a persistent issue. The SEC has continued enforcement actions against similar schemes over the years following this 2017 article, with ongoing efforts to protect investors from pump-and-dump operations that exploit the high-risk, high-reward nature of early-stage biotech development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Prediction by author**: The article's main forward-looking statement suggests that fraudulent stock promotion schemes in small biotech will continue because "once in a while there are miraculous stories where a small company hits it big on a longshot drug candidate" and "most of the potential investors don't have enough technical knowledge to really make an informed decision."

**Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate. Stock promotion and pump-and-dump schemes have remained a persistent problem in the biotech sector. The SEC has continued bringing enforcement actions against similar schemes in subsequent years. However, the article's underlying assumption that legitimate small biotechs face challenges raising capital has also remained true, creating the market conditions that both enable genuine innovation and attract fraudulent operators.

**Specific case outcome**: While the Lion Biotech case settled in 2017 involved stock promotion misconduct, the company evolved into a legitimate therapeutic developer, achieving FDA approval for a melanoma cell therapy in 2024. This demonstrates that enforcement actions against promotion schemes don't necessarily prevent potentially valuable science from eventually reaching patients.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

While this article addresses an important and ongoing problem in biotech investing, its narrow focus on 2011-2014 fraud cases limits broader scientific or clinical relevance. The piece serves as a useful investor education tool about promotion schemes but provides limited insight into therapeutic development or regulatory science. The moderate interest score reflects that market manipulation stories have limited scientific value despite their investor protection importance.
