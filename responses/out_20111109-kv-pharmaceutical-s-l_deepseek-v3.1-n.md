# KV Pharmaceutical's Latest Makena Move (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2011 commentary updates the controversial Makena story—a progesterone injection approved by the FDA to prevent preterm birth. KV Pharmaceuticals had acquired rights to the drug and dramatically increased its price from around \$10-20 per dose to approximately \$1,500 per dose, drawing widespread outrage from patients, doctors, and Congress. Previously, the FDA had taken the unusual step of announcing it would not take enforcement action against compounding pharmacies that continued to produce the drug at much lower cost. The November 2011 article reports KV's strategic countermove: the company submitted data to the FDA claiming that compounded versions of the drug showed inconsistent purity and potency, potentially posing safety risks. The FDA was reviewing KV's data while conducting its own investigation and reminding the public that approved products generally provide greater assurance of safety and effectiveness than compounded versions.

## 2. HISTORY
The Makena pricing controversy continued to unfold after this November 2011 article:

• **March 2012**: Following KV's pressure campaign, the FDA issued warning letters to several compounding pharmacies, ordering them to stop producing Makena until they received valid prescriptions for individually identified patients. This represented a partial victory for KV in their effort to protect their market exclusivity.

• **February 2013**: KV Pharmaceuticals filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing the financial impact of the Makena controversy and other business challenges. The company's aggressive pricing strategy ultimately backfired commercially.

• **Bankruptcy and Asset Sale (2013)**: During bankruptcy proceedings, KV sold substantially all of its assets to another company, with the Makena franchise being a key part of the transaction.

• **Continued Market Dynamics**: Despite FDA's regulatory actions favoring the approved product, many healthcare providers continued to work with compounding pharmacies to provide lower-cost alternatives, demonstrating that pricing pressure and access concerns remained central issues.

• **Long-term Policy Impact**: The Makena case became a prominent example in policy discussions about drug pricing, orphan drug designation (Makena had received orphan status, providing market exclusivity), and the balance between FDA approval pathways and compounded alternatives.

The controversy highlighted the tension between incentivizing drug development through market exclusivity and ensuring patient access to affordable medications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself does not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes, focusing instead on reporting the immediate development of KV's data submission to the FDA. The author notes "We'll probably be hearing more about this. . ." which proved accurate as the story continued to develop, but this is more of an observation about an ongoing story rather than a specific prediction.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article captures a pivotal moment in an important healthcare policy controversy that embodied broader tensions around pharmaceutical pricing, regulatory authority, and patient access—issues that have only grown more salient in subsequent years.
