# Let's See: The Red Stuff or the Green Stuff? (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Reckitt Benckiser's Nurofen painkiller brand in Australia, which was marketing multiple "specialty" products for different types of pain (migraine, back pain, period pain, and tension headaches). Each variant came in different colored packaging and claimed to be "specially formulated" for specific indications. However, all products contained identical amounts of ibuprofen (300mg). The products were sold at roughly double the price of the company's regular ibuprofen tablets. The article highlights the company's explanation that this product differentiation strategy was intended to "help consumers navigate their pain relief options" in retail environments without healthcare professional guidance.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this December 2015 article, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) pursued enforcement action. In December 2015, the Federal Court of Australia ordered Nurofen to remove the specific-pain range products from shelves within three months. In April 2016, the court ordered Reckitt Benckiser to pay a A$1.7 million fine for engaging in misleading conduct and making false or misleading representations. The court found that consumers were paying up to double for products that were identical to much cheaper generic ibuprofen tablets, with the only differences being packaging, branding, and product names.

Despite the court orders, it took until February 2017 for the recalled products to be physically removed from Australian pharmacies. In March 2021, the ACCC initiated further proceedings against Reckitt Benckiser, alleging that the company continued to sell the misleading products for months after the court's removal order. Ultimately, consumers who purchased the specific-pain range products were denied class action status but could seek individual refunds. The case became a significant precedent in Australian consumer protection law regarding pharmaceutical marketing practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about specific future outcomes, regulatory actions, or company consequences. It was written as commentary on a current enforcement action, celebrating the regulatory crackdown rather than projecting what would transpire next.
