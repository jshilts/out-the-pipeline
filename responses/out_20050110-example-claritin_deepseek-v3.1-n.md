# The Example of Claritin (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes a dispute between *Slate*'s Jack Shafer and *New York Times* editor Bill Keller regarding FDA drug safety monitoring versus new drug approval priorities. The central case study involves the 1990s market dynamics between Seldane (terfenadine) and Claritin (loratadine) antihistamines.

The author provides insider perspective from their time at Schering-Plough, confirming that Seldane's safety problems (specifically cardiac arrhythmia risks) were indeed the primary driver of its market decline and Claritin's subsequent rise. While Claritin faced long FDA approval delays (already OTC in Canada before US approval), the timing worked strategically for Schering-Plough as Seldane's troubles opened market opportunities. The article highlights Schering-Plough's successful direct-to-consumer advertising campaign that drove substantial revenue, though the company later struggled after Claritin's patent expiration. The author strongly endorses Harris's statement that new drugs only supplant older ones when "demonstrably better or safer."

## 2. HISTORY

**Seldane (terfenadine):**
- Removed from US market in 1997 after FDA warnings about serious cardiac side effects (QT prolongation, torsades de pointes), particularly when taken with certain antibiotics or antifungals
- Was among first major "blockbuster" drugs to be withdrawn due to safety concerns, becoming a case study in post-marketing surveillance failures
- Remains historically significant as a catalyst for FDA reforms in drug safety monitoring

**Claritin (loratadine):**
- Schering-Plough's DTC advertising campaign became the landmark case study for pharmaceutical consumer marketing, transforming industry practices
- Achieved peak sales exceeding $3 billion annually during its patent-protected period
- Went OTC in the US in 2002 (December) after prolonged regulatory delays, though this timing had strategic advantages
- Patent expiration in 2002 marked the beginning of Schering-Plough's decline, as the company lacked a replacement pipeline product
- Now available as inexpensive generic loratadine

**Schering-Plough:**
- Entered "tar pit" period post-2000s as described, eventually merging with Merck in 2009 in a $41 billion deal
- The Claritin revenue dependence exemplified the "patent cliff" problem that has plagued many pharmaceutical companies

**FDA Policy Impact:**
- The Seldane withdrawal contributed to ongoing debates about FDA's post-marketing surveillance capabilities
- Led to increased scrutiny of drug interactions and cardiac safety in regulatory reviews
- Reinforced arguments for mandatory post-market safety studies and pharmacovigilance reforms

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no explicit predictions about future events, instead providing retrospective analysis of historical events from the 1990s and their immediate aftermath.

Implicit assumptions in the article that proved accurate:
- **"Companies spend money on advertising because they plan to make even more money"** - Confirmed by the massive ROI from Schering-Plough's Claritin DTC campaign, which became the model for pharmaceutical marketing and established DTC advertising as a standard industry practice
- **"New drugs rarely supplant older drugs unless they are demonstrably better or safer"** - This principle persisted and was validated by multiple subsequent market transitions (e.g., COX-2 inhibitors supplanting NSAIDs, then themselves facing safety issues)

The article's implicit concern about post-Claritin revenue replacement at Schering-Plough proved prescient - the company indeed struggled after patent expiration.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides valuable insider perspective on a pivotal period in pharmaceutical industry history, documenting the intersection of drug safety, regulatory dynamics, and marketing strategies that reshaped the industry. Its analysis of the link between safety failures and market opportunities remains relevant to understanding pharmaceutical business models.
