# Scaffold Popularity (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a research paper analyzing the popularity of structural scaffolds in medicinal chemistry using the ChEMBL database, covering 1998-2014 with nearly 283,000 unique compounds. The analysis identified 764 significant structural motifs that met criteria of having more than 10 derived compounds and appearing in at least 5 years of records.

The three most popular scaffolds by compound count were biphenyl, biphenyl ether, and chalcone (each with over 500 members). Biphenyls matched their prevalence in major pharmaceuticals, while biphenyl ethers were primarily confined to thyroid hormones. Interestingly, chalcones showed the steepest positive trend over time despite being less common in actual approved drugs.

When measured by assay activity, daunorubicin-like compounds and paclitaxel-family compounds showed unexpectedly high activity counts - likely driven by their parent compounds being used repeatedly as controls in oncology assays. The analysis also revealed that more populated scaffold classes tended to be assayed against diverse protein targets, while less common scaffolds focused more on cell-line assays. Chalcones were notably exceptional in having both high compound counts and high cell assay activity, which the original authors speculated might reflect ease of synthesis rather than genuine therapeutic potential.

The commentary notes that ChEMBL database may be biased toward academic work compared to patent literature, highlighting challenges in data mining for drug discovery due to curation requirements.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2018, this type of scaffold analysis has gained significant traction in the pharmaceutical industry for several concrete applications, though the specific scaffolds mentioned have seen varying levels of continued interest.

**Analytical approaches to scaffold analysis have matured significantly.** The methodology pioneered in this 2018 paper influenced subsequent development of more sophisticated cheminformatics tools. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted scaffold-based approaches for library design, virtual screening, and lead optimization. However, the bias toward academic datasets noted in the original commentary remained a persistent challenge - industry patent data remains more difficult to systematically analyze at scale.

**Chalcones specifically saw continued mixed results in drug development.** While the structural class continued to generate academic publications, chalcone-based compounds did not translate into major FDA-approved drugs in the 2018-2024 period. The skepticism expressed in the original commentary appears justified - the "high synthetic feasibility" that drove chalcone popularity did not correlate with clinical success. Most chalcone research remained in preclinical or early clinical stages, with numerous compounds showing promiscuous binding profiles that limited therapeutic utility.

**Biphenyl and biphenyl ether scaffolds maintained their established positions** in pharmaceutical development. Several new drugs containing these motifs received FDA approval between 2018-2024, continuing their demonstrated track record. The validation of these scaffolds through successful drug approvals reinforced their continued use in medicinal chemistry programs.
