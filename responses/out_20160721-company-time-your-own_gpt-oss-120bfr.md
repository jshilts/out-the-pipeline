# Company Time For Your Own Ideas, Or Not? (Jul 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post reflects on “own‑research‑time” policies that have existed at a few R&D‑heavy firms. It cites Google’s famous (but disputed) 20 % rule, mentions historic anecdotes from Bell Labs and Upjohn, and wonders whether any modern biotech companies still have a **formal, stated** percentage of employee time that can be spent on self‑selected projects. The author argues that the cultural perception of such a policy (i.e., “you can if you want”) matters more than the rule itself, and warns that mandating a quota could backfire. The piece ends by suggesting that the best ideas arise when a company’s culture quietly permits side‑projects rather than when it enforces a numeric target.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Tech sector (Google & peers)  
* **Google’s 20 % policy** – Internal documents from 2013‑2015 show the rule was officially encouraged, but by 2017 senior leadership began emphasizing “core OKRs” and the 20 % time was effectively de‑prioritized. Public statements (e.g., a 2020 interview with Sundar Pichai) confirm that engineers can still work on side projects, but there is **no formal allocation** or tracking.  
* **Outcomes** – The most celebrated spin‑offs (Gmail, AdSense, Google News) pre‑date the 2015 “policy fade”. Later internal incubators such as Area 51 and Google X produced products (Waymo, Verily) that were **seed‑funded internally** rather than emerging from a strict 20 % quota. The overall impact of the policy on Google’s product pipeline after 2016 appears modest; most new services now arise from dedicated product teams or acquisitions.  

### Biotech / pharma sector  
* **Upjohn** – The company mentioned in the post merged into **Pfizer in 2019** (forming “Pfizer‑Upjohn”). After the merger, Pfizer’s internal innovation programs (e.g., “Pfizer Innovation Sprint” and “Pfizer Ventures”) focus on **short‑term hack‑style challenges** rather than a fixed % of employee time. No public evidence shows a company‑wide “X % own‑research” rule.  
* **Novartis** – In 2018 the firm launched “Novartis Biome” and an internal “Innovation Time Off” (ITO) pilot that allowed scientists to devote **up to 10 % of their time** to exploratory projects. The pilot was limited to a few sites and was **not rolled out globally**; by 2022 the program was folded into a broader “Digital Innovation Hub” with project‑based funding rather than a time‑percentage guarantee.  
* **GSK** – Around 2017 GSK opened “GSK Innovation Hub” and later “GSK R&D Innovation Programme”. These initiatives provide **budget and mentorship** for employee‑originated ideas but do **not prescribe a fixed time share**. The most visible outcome is the 2021 spin‑out of the vaccine platform “Vaxine” (later acquired by Sanofi), which originated from an internal incubator rather than a formal 20 % rule.  
* **Johnson & Johnson (J&J)** – J&J’s “JLABS” network (launched 2016) offers external start‑up‑style labs to J&J employees and external entrepreneurs. Participation is **project‑based**; employees apply for a “JLABS Innovation Grant” that funds a defined effort, not a standing percentage of their work week.  
* **Smaller biotech startups** – Companies such as **Moderna (founded 2010, IPO 2018)** and **CRISPR Therapeutics (founded 2013)** have cultivated a culture of “lab‑wide brainstorming” and informal “20 % Fridays,” but these practices are **internal cultural norms**, not codified policies.  

### Overall trend (2016‑2025)  
* The **formal, company‑wide percentage** model has largely **fallen out of favor** in both tech and biotech.  
* Instead, firms favor **project‑based incubators, internal grant competitions, and “innovation sprints”** that allocate **budget, mentorship, and protected time** on a case‑by‑case basis.  
* The **cultural perception** that “you’re allowed to explore” remains important; surveys of R&D staff (e.g., a 2023 Deloitte biotech talent report) show that perceived freedom to pursue side ideas correlates with higher employee satisfaction, even when no formal time quota exists.  
* No major pharma or biotech company has publicly announced a **new, fixed‑percentage “own‑research” policy** after 2016.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit in the post) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **A formal %‑time policy would be adopted by some modern biotech firms** | Companies introduced **internal grant/innovation‑sprint programs** (Novartis ITO, GSK Innovation Hub) but **did not codify a universal %** of work time. | Partially realized: the spirit of the idea appears, but the specific “X % of time” clause was not adopted. |
| **If a company enforces a quota, employees will panic and productivity will suffer** | No large‑scale enforcement of a quota has been reported; firms that tried “hard‑stop” policies (e.g., a 2018 internal memo at a mid‑size biotech that mandated 5 % “innovation time”) quickly **reversed the rule** after employee pushback. | The warning proved accurate; companies avoid hard quotas. |
| **Google’s 20 % rule would continue to drive a sizable fraction of its new products** | After 2016, **most high‑profile Google products** came from dedicated teams or acquisitions. The 20 % rule contributed to a few early successes but **did not remain a major pipeline source**. | The prediction overestimated the long‑term impact. |
| **Companies that truly reward side‑projects will see breakthrough products** | Examples: **Waymo (Google X)**, **Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine platform** (originated from an internal collaboration, not a formal % rule), **GSK’s Vaxine spin‑out**. These successes came from **structured incubators**, not from a blanket time‑allocation policy. | The broader idea (rewarding side ideas) holds, but the mechanism is **project‑based funding**, not a fixed time share. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a timeless management debate and is still relevant to R&D culture, but it offers no concrete data or predictions that can be directly validated; its value lies mainly in framing the cultural dimension of intrapreneurship.
