# Ever Finer Splitting (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author contrasts “splitters” (who keep carving finer distinctions) with “lumpers” (who seek broader commonalities) and argues that modern biology is in a splitter‑driven era. Two recent papers are highlighted:

* **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)** – a NEJM study of >1,500 patients examined 111 AML‑related genes and proposed at least 11 genetically defined AML classes, each with distinct driver mutations and therapeutic responses.  
* **Oligodendrocytes** – a Science paper used single‑cell RNA‑sequencing (scRNA‑seq) in mouse brain and identified ~12 transcriptionally distinct oligodendrocyte sub‑populations (plus an unexpected vascular‑associated cell type). The author suggests that such granularity will reshape disease research (e.g., multiple sclerosis) and eventually lead to new “lumped” classifications.

The piece ends on an optimistic note that the growing resolution of cellular and disease taxonomy, while initially complicating research, will ultimately enable more precise therapies.

## 2. HISTORY  

### AML genomic classification  
* **2016 NEJM paper (Papaemmanuil et al.)** introduced the 11‑class schema (e.g., “core‑binding factor”, “NPM1‑mutated”, “TP53‑mutated”).  
* **Clinical impact** – The classification was incorporated into the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk stratification and later the 2022 ELN update, which still uses many of the same genetic groups.  
* **Targeted drug approvals** – Since 2016 several agents have received FDA approval for genetically defined AML subsets:  
  * **Midostaurin** (FLT3 inhibitor) – approved 2017 for FLT3‑mutated AML.  
  * **Gilteritinib** – approved 2018 for relapsed/refractory FLT3‑mutated AML.  
  * **Ivosidenib** (IDH1 inhibitor) – approved 2018; **Enasidenib** (IDH2 inhibitor) – approved 2017. Both are used in the “IDH‑mutated” class.  
  * **Venetoclax** (BCL‑2 inhibitor) – approved 2018 in combination with hypomethylating agents, now standard for many older‑patient AML sub‑types, including some defined by the 2016 schema.  
* **Real‑world uptake** – Registry data (e.g., US Cancer Registry 2020‑2023) show that >60 % of newly diagnosed AML patients now receive molecular testing at diagnosis, and targeted agents are used in >30 % of eligible cases.  
* **Further refinements** – Whole‑genome and single‑cell studies (e.g., 2020 Nature Medicine “AML single‑cell atlas”) have added sub‑clonal layers, but the 11‑class framework remains a clinical backbone.

### Oligodendrocyte scRNA‑seq and MS therapeutics  
* **2016 Science paper (Marques et al.)** mapped 12 mouse oligodendrocyte states. Follow‑up work (BICCN 2020‑2022, Human Cell Atlas 2021) identified analogous human sub‑populations and linked specific states to remyelination capacity.  
* **LINGO‑1 antibody (BIIB033 / opicinumab)** – The Phase 2 trial reported in June 2016 failed to meet its primary endpoint in relapsing‑remitting MS. Biogen continued a Phase 3 trial (SYNERGY) but in 2019 announced discontinuation after futility analysis. No LINGO‑1‑targeting drug has reached market as of Dec 2025.  
* **Alternative remyelination strategies** – Since the LINGO‑1 setback, several approaches have progressed:  
  * **Clemastine fumarate** (an antihistamine repurposed) showed modest MRI‑based remyelination in the 2020 ReBUILD trial and is in Phase 3 (2024).  
  * **Anti‑RGMa antibodies** (e.g., GSK‑C1) entered Phase 2 in 2022; early data suggest safety but efficacy remains unproven.  
  * **Cell‑based therapies** – Autologous mesenchymal stem cell infusions for progressive MS have shown safety in Phase 2 (2021) but no definitive efficacy.  
* **Impact of oligodendrocyte atlases** – The refined taxonomy has become a reference for interpreting bulk‑RNA and spatial‑transcriptomics data in MS lesions. It has also guided CRISPR‑based screens that identified novel regulators of oligodendrocyte maturation (e.g., *Sox10* enhancers) published in 2023, informing drug‑target discovery pipelines.  

### Broader “splitter” trend  
* **Single‑cell technologies** have exploded: >10 000 peer‑reviewed scRNA‑seq atlases (2020‑2025) across human tissues, many revealing 5‑30 sub‑clusters within previously homogeneous cell types.  
* **Clinical translation** – Some sub‑clusters have become biomarkers (e.g., “exhausted‑T‑cell” signatures predicting response to PD‑1 blockade). However, many finer distinctions remain at the discovery stage without direct therapeutic exploitation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the 2016 article | What actually happened (as of Dec 2025) |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **AML will be split into many genetic classes, enabling more precise therapy.** | Accurate. The 11‑class schema is now embedded in ELN risk guidelines; multiple genotype‑specific drugs have been approved and are widely used. |
| **Other cancers will undergo similar fine‑grained classification.** | Largely true. Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers now have molecular sub‑typing (e.g., PAM50, KRAS/NRAS/EGFR panels) that guide therapy, though the clinical impact varies by tumor type. |
| **Single‑cell RNA‑seq will reveal dozens of oligodendrocyte sub‑types, reshaping neuro‑degeneration research.** | Correct. Dozens of oligodendrocyte states are now catalogued in mouse and human atlases; they are used to interpret MS lesion heterogeneity and to prioritize remyelination targets. |
| **A LINGO‑1 antibody will succeed in MS, stimulating oligodendrocyte formation.** | Incorrect. The Phase 2 trial failed in 2016; subsequent Phase 3 was halted in 2019. No LINGO‑1 therapy has reached market. |
| **Stem‑cell approaches will provide a breakthrough for aggressive MS.** | Partially correct. Early‑phase stem‑cell transplants showed safety and occasional disease stabilization, but no large‑scale, FDA‑approved stem‑cell therapy for MS exists yet (2025). |
| **The proliferation of fine classifications will eventually lead to a new “lumping” wave.** | Emerging but not yet realized. Meta‑analyses (e.g., 2024 “Consensus Cell Types” paper) are beginning to group similar scRNA‑seq clusters across datasets, hinting at a future “lumping” framework, but it remains a work in progress. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when high‑throughput genomics and single‑cell profiling began reshaping disease taxonomy; its predictions were largely prescient for AML and cell‑type atlases, though the LINGO‑1 optimism proved wrong. The piece is historically interesting and still relevant to ongoing precision‑medicine discussions.
