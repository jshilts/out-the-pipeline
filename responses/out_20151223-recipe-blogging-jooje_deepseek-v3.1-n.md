# Recipe Blogging: Joojeh Kebab (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a cooking blog post from Science magazine's blog section featuring a traditional Iranian joojeh kebab recipe from the author's wife's family. The article provides detailed instructions for marinating chicken (preferably bone-in parts) with chopped onion, lime juice, and salt for at least one hour, then grilling or broiling while basting with a saffron extract made by steeping saffron threads in boiling water. The author discusses the chemistry behind saffron's flavor compounds, noting that the main flavor compounds are water-soluble glycosides like picrocrocin, while their aglycons such as safranal are more lipid-soluble. The recipe is traditionally served with Iranian basmati rice, with mention of a planned future post about tahdeek (the crispy rice crust at the bottom of the pot).

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published in December 2015 as part of Science magazine's blog content, appearing during a holiday period when the author indicated plans to share several recipes. The post was written in a casual, personal style typical of food blogging, with references to the author's family connections to Persian cuisine and lighthearted remarks about fast-food business ideas.

Based on the content, this appears to be recipe content published on Science magazine's blog platform rather than peer-reviewed scientific content about biotechnology. The article focuses purely on cooking instructions, ingredients, and food preparation techniques. There is no scientific research presented, no biotechnology applications discussed, no drug development mentioned, and no policy implications analyzed. The article contains no predictions about future scientific developments or biotech industry trends.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No predictions about biotechnology, scientific developments, drug approvals, policy changes, or business outcomes were made in this article. The content is exclusively recipe-focused with no forward-looking statements about the biotech industry or scientific research directions. The only forward-looking content mentioned was the author's intention to post a rice recipe in the future, which is a cooking-related announcement rather than a scientific or industry prediction.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 1** 

This is a cooking recipe blog post that was mistakenly categorized as biotechnology industry commentary. While potentially interesting to food enthusiasts or those interested in Persian cuisine, it has no relevance to biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, or scientific research. The post contains no scientific analysis beyond basic chemistry references to food compounds and serves purely as lifestyle/recipe content.
