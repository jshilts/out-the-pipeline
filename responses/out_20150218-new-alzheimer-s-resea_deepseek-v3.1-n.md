# New Alzheimer's Research in the UK (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Oxford University's new Drug Discovery Institute, launched with support from Alzheimer's Research UK, aiming to fast-track dementia treatments. The institute promised to deliver up to three new therapies for clinical development within five years. Alzheimer's Research UK was launching similar institutes at Cambridge and University College London.

A central and controversial claim came from Professor Chas Bountra at Oxford: the institute would generate high-quality drug starting points and make them "freely available to the world's biomedical community" to "crowdsource the discovery of new medicines for Alzheimer's disease," calling this approach "unprecedented." The author expressed skepticism about the ambitious three-drug-in-five-years timeline, suggesting they would need eight or nine good ideas already in hand to have any realistic chance of success, while questioning whether that many viable Alzheimer's drug targets even existed at the time.

## 2. HISTORY

**Oxford Drug Discovery Institute Performance:**
The promised delivery of "up to three new therapies" for clinical development within five years (by 2020) did not materialize as announced. Available public records and subsequent publications show no FDA-approved Alzheimer's drugs emerging from this specific Oxford initiative by the deadline. The "crowdsourcing" model of freely sharing drug candidates did not become a transformative approach in Alzheimer's drug development.

**Alzheimer's Drug Development Landscape (2015-2024):**
The broader UK dementia research landscape saw continued activity but did not produce breakthrough treatments matching the 2015 optimism. Biogen's aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 but faced limited clinical uptake due to questionable efficacy and significant side effects. Eisai's lecanemab (Leqembi) gained FDA approval in 2023 with modest cognitive benefits, and Eli Lilly's donanemab showed similar limited efficacy.

The fundamental challenge remained: no disease-modifying therapy emerged that actually slows or halts Alzheimer's progression meaningfully. The amyloid hypothesis continued driving drug development despite decades of expensive failures, with most late-stage trials ending in disappointment.

**Oxford's Subsequent Trajectory:**
Oxford's drug discovery efforts continued but without the transformative impact promised. The university maintained involvement in various research initiatives, but no major Alzheimer's breakthrough drug emerged from this specific crowdsourcing model. The UK Alzheimer's research ecosystem continued receiving funding, but tangible patient outcomes remained elusive.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Deliver up to three new therapies for further clinical development and trials within five years"** – This did not happen. No therapies from this initiative reached the clinical development milestone by 2020 as promised.

• **"Transform dementia research" through crowdsourcing drug discovery** – This transformation did not occur. The open-source crowdsourcing model failed to catalyze significant Alzheimer's drug development breakthroughs.

• **"Make [drug starting points] freely available to the world's biomedical community"** – The free availability of high-quality leads did not materialize in any transformative way that reshaped Alzheimer's drug discovery.

• **Author's skepticism about having "eight or nine really good ideas"** – This skepticism proved justified. The underlying scientific challenge in Alzheimer's drug development remained unresolved, and the promised deliverables were not achieved.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This 2015 article represents another example of premature optimism in Alzheimer's drug development, showcasing the persistent gap between ambitious promises and actual clinical outcomes that has characterized the field for decades.
