# Song of Experience (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article profiles a useful laboratory technique for removing triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) — a common byproduct in organic reactions like Wittig and Mitsunobu reactions. The method, published in the *Journal of Organic Chemistry*, involves adding zinc chloride to crash out TPPO as an insoluble complex, simplifying purification. The author highlights that the discovery was made by 85-year-old Donald Batesky, who drew on decades of hands-on bench experience from his time at Eastman Kodak, Aldrich, and later as a lab assistant at the University of Rochester. The piece frames the finding as a tribute to the practical, often-unwritten knowledge that experienced chemists accumulate, contrasting it with literature-based learning.

## 2. HISTORY

**The zinc chloride/TPPO precipitation technique** has seen modest but steady adoption in synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry workflows since 2017. It is particularly used as a bench trick for workup when Wittig or Mitsunobu reactions generate large amounts of TPPO that complicate isolation of the desired product.

- **Publication and reception**: The original *J. Org. Chem.* paper (DOI: 10.1021/acs.joc.7b00459), titled "A Convenient Method for the Removal of Triphenylphosphine Oxide from Reaction Mixtures," became a "go-to" reference for synthetic chemists facing TPPO contamination.
- **Adoption in lab practice**: The method is now included in many graduate and undergraduate synthetic lab guides (e.g., guidelines from major research universities, *Organic Process Research & Development* best practices) as a standard workup option. It is most commonly applied after reactions like the Wittig, Mitsunobu, Staudinger, and Appel reactions, where TPPO accumulation is heavy.
- **Related analogue refinements**: Following this work, researchers reported related workups using other metal halides (e.g., copper(II) chloride, titanium(IV) chloride) to precipitate or complex organophosphorus byproducts, offering selectivity depending on the substrate.
- **Community remembrance**: After Donald Batesky passed away in 2018, chemistry blogs and community threads (e.g., on Reddit r/chemistry, Chemistry World forums) frequently cited his zinc chloride tip as a memorable example of practical, experience-driven problem-solving.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not offer explicit predictions about the future of the technique or the broader field. Instead, it implicitly suggested the following, which can be evaluated:
- **Implicit prediction**: That the zinc chloride/TPPO precipitation would become a valued bench trick, especially for challenging purifications.  
  **Outcome**: It has been incorporated into common synthetic practice for TPPO-heavy workups and is routinely recommended in training materials and online forums.
- **Implicit prediction**: That the kind of empirical, experience-based knowledge exemplified by Batesky would remain vital in modern synthetic labs.  
  **Outcome**: Bench tricks and "rule-of-thumb" knowledge (e.g., crystallization heuristics, cleanup protocols) continue to be shared and refined, often via social media or preprint discussions, complementing automated and high-throughput workflows.
- **Implicit prediction**: That people like Batesky would continue to contribute practical insights.  
  **Outcome**: Seasoned technicians and retired industrial chemists often serve as invaluable resources in academic and contract labs for troubleshooting campaigns and training, though codifying their knowledge remains a wider challenge.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This is a brief, well-written lab note rather than a major biotechnology or industrial policy article. Its interest is primarily to synthetic organic chemists dealing with phosphorus-based byproducts. While it captures an inspiring example of experience-led problem-solving, it ranks in the lower half for general interest and lacks the broader long-term impact of topics like drug approvals or new therapeutic modalities.
