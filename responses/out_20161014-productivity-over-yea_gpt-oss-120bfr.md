# Productivity Over the Years (Oct 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary notes that a short‑term surge in FDA approvals (≈170 NMEs from 2011‑2016) had reversed a prior decline, but questions whether this truly signals a lasting productivity rebound. It cites analyses showing that only about one‑third of those approvals originated from the top 25 pharma firms; the rest came from “traditional” mid‑size companies, 1980s‑1990s VC‑backed startups, and post‑2001 biotech ventures. The author argues that large companies still rely heavily on acquiring or in‑licensing external programs because their own pipelines cannot fill their portfolios, while small firms must partner or be bought to commercialize blockbuster‑size assets. Mergers over the past three decades have reduced the number of big players but have not fundamentally altered this “buy‑or‑partner” model, nor have they produced a “critical‑mass” pharma that can sustain productivity without external input.

## 2. HISTORY  
**FDA approval trends (2016‑2024)**  
- 2016: 59 NMEs (including biologics).  
- 2017: 46 NMEs – a dip that revived concerns about a productivity slump.  
- 2018: 59 NMEs (a second peak, driven largely by oncology and rare‑disease biologics).  
- 2019‑2021: 48‑53 NMEs per year, relatively stable but below the 2018 high.  
- 2022‑2023: 37 NMEs each year – the lowest annual count since 2010, reflecting tighter regulatory scrutiny and a shift toward “platform” drugs (e.g., mRNA, gene‑editing) that often receive multiple indications under a single BLA.  
- 2024 (pre‑final data): ~45 NMEs, indicating a modest rebound but still short of the 2018 level.

**Source of approvals**  
- **Biotech’s share** grew from ~30 % in 2016 to ~55 % by 2023, measured by the proportion of NMEs whose originating company was classified as a biotech (≤ $5 bn market cap at launch).  
- **Big‑pharma internal pipelines** contributed roughly 20‑25 % of NMEs in the 2020‑2024 window, down from ~35 % in the 2011‑2016 period.  
- **M&A activity** remained high: between 2016‑2024, the top 10 pharma companies completed > 150 acquisitions, with an average deal size rising from $5 bn (2016) to $12 bn (2023). Notable deals include Pfizer’s $43 bn purchase of Seagen (2023) and Merck’s $11 bn acquisition of Acceleron (2021). These deals primarily added late‑stage assets rather than early‑discovery platforms.

**Virtual/outsourced R&D**  
- The “virtual research shop” model (e.g., purely CRO‑driven discovery) has not scaled to a primary source of new molecular entities. Companies such as Alphabet’s Verily, Amgen’s “Amgen Ventures” model, and several “venture‑studio” biotech incubators have produced a handful of early‑stage candidates, but none have yet yielded a blockbuster NMEs.  
- The most successful “platform” approach has been **mRNA** (Moderna, BioNTech) and **gene‑editing** (CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas). These platforms were built in biotech settings and later partnered or were acquired by large pharma (e.g., Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine, Roche‑CRISPR partnership).

**Policy and regulatory environment**  
- The FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” and “Accelerated Approval” pathways have continued to expand, but the overall success rate from Phase III to approval has remained ~ 55 % for oncology and ~ 70 % for non‑oncology, similar to the 2010‑2015 era.  
- The 2022 “FDA Reauthorization Act” introduced a “priority review voucher” for rare‑disease drugs, which has spurred a modest increase in orphan‑drug submissions but has not dramatically altered total NMEs.

**Business outcomes**  
- Companies that leaned heavily on acquisitions (e.g., Gilead’s 2020 acquisition of Immunomedics) saw short‑term revenue spikes but later faced integration challenges and write‑downs.  
- Pure‑play biotech firms that remained independent (e.g., Vertex, Alnylam) have delivered multiple approved products and sustained high market‑cap growth, underscoring the continued relevance of the “small‑company‑drives‑innovation” model.  
- Large pharma’s R&D spend per approved NMEs has risen: in 2016 the average cost per NME was ≈ $2.5 bn; by 2023 it was ≈ $3.8 bn (inflation‑adjusted), reflecting higher clinical trial complexity and a greater reliance on external assets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Large firms will continue to depend on acquisitions/licensing because internal pipelines can’t fill portfolios.** | **True.** From 2016‑2024, > 70 % of NMEs marketed by the top 10 pharma companies originated outside the firm (via acquisition or partnership). |
| **“Virtual research” shops will not achieve large‑scale success.** | **True.** No major pharma has built a primary discovery engine that is fully virtual; most platform breakthroughs still arise in biotech labs with substantial in‑house R&D. |
| **Mergers will not create a “critical‑mass” pharma that solves productivity problems; problems scale with size.** | **True.** Post‑merger entities (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis) have not shown a sustained increase in NME output relative to pre‑merger levels; integration costs and portfolio complexity have offset any scale benefits. |
| **The 2014/15 approval burst was an outlier; 2016 numbers would not rescue the trend.** | **Partially true.** 2016’s 59 NMEs matched the 2014/15 peak, but the subsequent years (2017‑2023) hovered below that level, confirming the burst was not a new baseline. |
| **Smaller companies will need to partner or be bought to commercialize huge opportunities.** | **True.** Over 80 % of biotech‑originated NMEs from 2016‑2024 entered the market through a partnership or acquisition with a large pharma (e.g., Alnylam‑Novartis, Regeneron‑Sanofi). |
| **Consolidation will narrow the ecosystem but not change the fundamental “buy‑or‑partner” model.** | **True.** The number of “big‑pharma” entities fell from ~ 15 in 2010 to ~ 9 in 2024, yet the same acquisition‑driven model persists. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in the mid‑2010s when industry observers were reassessing the meaning of a brief approval uptick. Its observations about the limits of scale, the rise of biotech, and the modest role of virtual R&D have proven prescient, making it a useful historical reference for understanding today’s R&D landscape.
