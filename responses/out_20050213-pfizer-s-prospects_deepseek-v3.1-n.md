# Pfizer's Prospects (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary from February 2005 expresses skepticism about Pfizer's business strategy and growth prospects. The author, who works for a Pfizer competitor but claims no financial stake, criticizes Pfizer's approach as contrary to what a drug company's strategy should be. The article references ongoing market doubts about Pfizer's ability to deliver double-digit growth, suggesting that the company had become "too big" for sustainable high growth rates. The author had maintained bearish views on Pfizer even during its "Unstoppable Behemoth" phase when the stock traded higher. While acknowledging that Pfizer has good people and interesting pipeline projects, the commentary argues these strengths wouldn't be sufficient to overcome the company's structural challenges.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2005 commentary, Pfizer faced significant challenges that validated many of the article's concerns:

**Patent Cliffs and Revenue Losses**: Pfizer experienced major patent expirations that devastated revenues. Most notably, Lipitor (atorvastatin), the best-selling drug in pharmaceutical history, lost patent protection in 2011 in the US (2012 in most markets), causing a massive revenue drop from its peak of nearly $13 billion annually.

**Pipeline Failures**: Several promising late-stage candidates failed or underperformed. The torcetrapib HDL-raising drug, which was expected to be a blockbuster successor to Lipitor, failed spectacularly in Phase 3 trials in 2006 due to increased mortality, resulting in a major pipeline setback and wasted R&D investment.

**Strategic Shifts**: Pfizer pursued massive acquisitions to compensate for organic growth challenges: the $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009, and later the failed $160 billion attempt to acquire AstraZeneca in 2014 (rebuffed), followed by the $14 billion acquisition of Medivation in 2016, and ultimately the $11.4 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma in 2019.

**Financial Performance**: Rather than maintaining double-digit growth, Pfizer's revenue declined from $51.3 billion in 2010 to $41.9 billion in 2012, reflecting the patent cliff impact. The company struggled to return to consistent growth, though later years saw rebounds, particularly with COVID-19 vaccine revenues temporarily boosting performance.

**R&D Restructuring**: Pfizer significantly restructured its R&D operations, closing research facilities and shifting focus toward more targeted therapeutic areas, representing a departure from the "bigger is better" approach criticized in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"Pfizer's style and strategy are just the opposite of what I think a drug company's should be"**: This proved prescient as Pfizer's massive scale and mega-acquisition strategy failed to deliver sustainable growth, leading to major restructurings in subsequent years.

• **"I'm not sure just when you cross that line, but I feel pretty safe in saying that Pfizer is on the other side of it"** (referring to being too big for double-digit growth): This prediction was accurate - Pfizer struggled with declining revenues post-2010 and never consistently achieved the ambitious growth targets that had been promised.

• **Implicit prediction that having "good people" and "interesting things in their pipeline" wouldn't be enough**: Validated by major pipeline failures like torcetrapib and the inability to replace blockbuster drugs lost to patent expiration, despite maintaining strong scientific capabilities.

• **"Pfizer's prospects"** being doubtful: The company's stock significantly underperformed broader markets for extended periods, and the business model proved unsustainable without continuous mega-acquisitions.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates strong predictive insight into pharmaceutical industry dynamics and the challenges of maintaining growth at massive scale. While not earth-shattering in scope, it correctly identified structural issues that plagued Big Pharma for the subsequent decade, making it a solid piece of industry analysis.
