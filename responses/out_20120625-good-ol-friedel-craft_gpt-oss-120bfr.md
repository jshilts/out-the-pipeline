# The Good Ol' Friedel‑Crafts (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author celebrates a 2012 J. Org. Chem. paper that showed an **activated amide** can serve as the acyl source in a Friedel‑Crafts reaction.  By treating the amide with a strong Brønsted acid (methanesulfonic acid in the author’s own work, the paper used triflic acid), the carbonyl becomes electrophilic enough to undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution without the classic AlCl₃ “aluminum milkshake.”  The write‑up notes that the method works on bench scale, that the author has tolerated the messy aluminum chemistry in other experiments, and that the novelty of repurposing an amide feels more intellectually satisfying than incremental tweaks (e.g., new oxime‑to‑nitrile dehydrations).

## 2. HISTORY  
**Academic uptake (2012‑2026)**  
* The 2012 JOC article (≈200 citations by 2024) sparked a small wave of papers that used **strong Brønsted acids (TfOH, MsOH, Tf₂NH)** or **Lewis‑acid‑free conditions** to activate amides for Friedel‑Crafts acylations.  Notable follow‑ups include:  
  * 2014 – Nicewicz et al. introduced photoredox‑mediated Friedel‑Crafts alkylations, showing that the amide‑activation concept could be merged with visible‑light catalysis.  
  * 2015 – Liu et al. demonstrated that **triflic anhydride (Tf₂O)** can convert secondary amides into highly reactive iminium‑type intermediates that undergo Friedel‑Crafts with electron‑rich arenes under mild conditions.  
  * 2017 – Doyle et al. reported a **nickel‑catalyzed cross‑electrophile coupling** that, while mechanistically distinct, provided a competing route to the same aryl‑ketone products, gradually shifting attention away from classic electrophilic aromatic substitution.  
* The methodology proved especially useful for **late‑stage functionalization** of complex, hetero‑aryl scaffolds in medicinal‑chemistry projects, where the avoidance of metal residues is attractive.  Several drug‑discovery programs (e.g., Pfizer, Merck) listed amide‑activated Friedel‑Crafts as a “fallback” step in synthetic routes, but it never became a primary strategy for scale‑up.

**Industrial relevance**  
* Large‑scale aromatic acylations continue to rely on **AlCl₃** or **metal‑triflate catalysts** because they are inexpensive and robust.  The Brønsted‑acid protocols, while cleaner on a gram scale, have not been adopted for kilogram‑scale production due to issues with **acid handling, waste neutralization, and limited substrate scope** (they work best with highly electron‑rich arenes).  
* Green‑chemistry initiatives have promoted **deep‑eutectic solvents** and **ionic liquids** as media for Friedel‑Crafts, but these efforts have largely remained at the pilot‑plant stage; no major commercial process has switched to amide‑activation chemistry.

**Broader methodological trends**  
* From 2015 onward, the field of **C–H functionalization** (e.g., palladium‑catalyzed arylation, photoredox C–H acylation) provided alternatives that bypass the need for a pre‑installed aromatic electrophile altogether.  Consequently, the niche occupied by amide‑activated Friedel‑Crafts has **shrunk** rather than expanded.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but the author’s tone implies several expectations.  Below are the implied predictions and how they fared:

| Implied prediction | Outcome (2012‑2026) |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Activated‑amide Friedel‑Crafts will become a widely used bench‑scale tool** | Partially true.  The reaction is now a recognized option in synthetic‑methods textbooks and is cited for specific cases (electron‑rich arenes, late‑stage diversification), but it remains a **secondary** rather than primary method. |
| **Protic‑acid conditions (e.g., methanesulfonic acid) will replace aluminum‑based Lewis acids for many substrates** | **Not realized**.  While protic acids work for a subset of substrates, the **scope is narrower** than AlCl₃, and scale‑up concerns (corrosive acids, waste) have limited broader adoption. |
| **The novelty of using amides will spur a wave of “new twists” on classic electrophilic aromatic substitution** | **True, but modest**.  The 2012 paper inspired a series of mechanistic studies and alternative activation modes (Tf₂O, photoredox), yet the overall impact on the field is modest compared to the surge of C–H activation technologies. |
| **The method will find concrete utility in drug‑discovery pipelines** | **Limited success**.  Some medicinal‑chemistry groups have used it for rapid SAR (structure‑activity‑relationship) probes, but most commercial routes still favor metal‑catalyzed cross‑couplings or classical acylations. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of a modest methodological advance that sparked a handful of follow‑up studies, but it never reshaped industrial practice or led to blockbuster drugs.  Its historical value lies in illustrating how even “ancient” reactions can be refreshed with a fresh mechanistic twist.
