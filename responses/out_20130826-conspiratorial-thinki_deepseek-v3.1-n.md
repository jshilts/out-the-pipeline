# On Conspiratorial Thinking (26 Aug 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a personal reflection on an email exchange the author had with someone who promoted conspiracy theories about food additives and health. Using a fictional "Dr. Cassandra" as a stand-in for the type of author who claims widespread poisoning from food additives, the author articulates a philosophical critique of conspiratorial thinking. He argues that once someone adopts the mindset that "Most Of What You Think You Know Is Wrong," it becomes impossible to establish any foundation for knowledge—if official authorities and primary sources are dismissed as fabricated, there's no way to distinguish truth from falsehood. The author describes how conspiracy believers selectively cherry-pick data that confirms their worldview while dismissing contradictory evidence, creating a self-reinforcing narrative where all parts seem to fit together beautifully—but this apparent coherence doesn't validate the conclusion. The piece includes a thought experiment suggesting that Dr. Cassandra could himself be a "false flag" operation designed to discredit legitimate opposition, illustrating how conspiratorial thinking creates infinite regress with "no bottom to it." The author concludes that he and his correspondent reached an impasse, with neither likely to persuade the other.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, conspiratorial thinking—particularly around health and science—escalated dramatically rather than diminished. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023) served as an unprecedented catalyst for health-related conspiracy theories, with misinformation spreading rapidly through social media platforms about vaccines, mask effectiveness, virus origins, and pharmaceutical company motives. Anti-vaccination movements, which had already been growing since the late 2000s, gained substantial traction and became more politically polarized. The mechanisms the author described—dismissal of scientific authorities, selective data gathering, and unfalsifiable reasoning—became central features of public discourse around public health measures. Social media algorithms often amplified conspiratorial content because it generated high engagement, creating echo chambers where the dynamics the author outlined played out at massive scale. The term "infodemic" emerged to describe the rapid spread of health misinformation, and research institutions increasingly studied the psychology behind conspiracy belief and its resistance to fact-based correction. However, despite increased awareness of these thinking patterns and efforts by platforms to moderate misinformation, conspiratorial thinking remained widespread and continued influencing public behavior and policy debates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't contain explicit forward-looking predictions about future events, but it did articulate underlying concerns about the trajectory and consequences of conspiratorial thinking. Here's how those implicit concerns compared to subsequent developments:

- **Implicit concern**: The author worried about people dismissing scientific authority and primary sources. **Outcome**: This pattern intensified dramatically during the pandemic, with notable segments of the population rejecting guidance from public health institutions like the CDC and WHO. Anti-science sentiment became more organized and politically aligned than in 2013, particularly around vaccination and public health mandates.

- **Implicit concern**: The author noted that conspiratorial thinking makes productive dialogue impossible ("we agreed to disagree"). **Outcome**: The polarization he observed in microcosm in 2013 became a defining feature of public discourse, with science and health topics becoming deeply politicized and resistant to evidence-based persuasion. The impasse he described at personal scale manifested at societal scale.

- **Implicit concern**: The author suggested conspiratorial worldviews might prevent people from functioning effectively. **Outcome**: While this didn't reach the extreme levels of the "Kooks" compendium he referenced, various communities did experience real-world impacts—vaccine hesitancy affecting public health outcomes, protests against public health measures, and in some cases, harassment of scientists and public health officials.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates keen insight into the underlying mechanics of conspiratorial thinking that became highly relevant during the subsequent decade's information crises. The author correctly identified structural problems—unfalsifiable reasoning, selective evidence gathering, and the breakdown of shared epistemic foundations—that would later characterize major public health controversies and political polarization around science.
