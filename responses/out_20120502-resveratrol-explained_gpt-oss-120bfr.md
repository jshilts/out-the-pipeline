# Resveratrol Explained. A Little Bit. (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary discusses a new Cell Metabolism paper (Sinclair et al., 2012) that used an inducible, whole‑body SIRT1 knockout mouse to test whether the metabolic benefits of resveratrol depend on SIRT1. The author notes that traditional SIRT1 knockouts are embryonic lethal, so the conditional model is a technical advance. The study found that resveratrol improved mitochondrial function and activated AMPK in normal mice but not in the SIRT1‑deficient mice, suggesting those effects are SIRT1‑dependent. By contrast, resveratrol lowered blood glucose even in the knockouts, implying an SIRT1‑independent pathway. The piece also critiques the hype‑filled press release, calls resveratrol a “dirty” molecule with many off‑target actions, and wonders whether newer, more selective SIRT1 activators (originating from the Sirtris/GSK program) would reproduce the SIRT1‑linked benefits while lacking the glucose‑lowering off‑target effects.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 scientific developments**  

* **SIRT1‑activator programs** – After the Sinclair paper, several more selective SIRT1‑activating compounds (e.g., SRT2104, SRT1720) entered pre‑clinical and early‑phase clinical testing. None progressed beyond Phase II; modest metabolic signals were observed, but efficacy was inconsistent and safety concerns (off‑target kinase inhibition, liver enzyme elevations) halted further development. GSK officially discontinued its Sirtris‑derived SIRT1‑activator pipeline around 2015.  

* **Resveratrol clinical trials** – Human studies continued, focusing on cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuro‑protective endpoints. Meta‑analyses (2020‑2023) conclude that oral resveratrol at doses ≤1 g/day yields small, statistically significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, but the effect sizes are clinically modest and highly variable. No trial has demonstrated a disease‑modifying or “anti‑aging” benefit that would justify regulatory approval.  

* **Shift toward NAD⁺ precursors** – The field’s attention gradually moved from direct SIRT1 activators to boosting the NAD⁺ pool (nicotinamide riboside, NMN). These agents have entered Phase II/III trials for metabolic and neuro‑degenerative indications, with early data suggesting safety and modest efficacy. This shift reflects the realization that SIRT1 activity is largely governed by NAD⁺ availability rather than direct ligand binding.  

* **Business outcomes** – Sirtris was acquired by GSK in 2008; after the failure of its lead compounds, the Sirtris brand was dissolved and the team was reassigned. GSK’s SIRT1‑activator assets were sold or abandoned. Resveratrol remains a popular over‑the‑counter supplement, but sales are driven by consumer hype rather than clinical endorsement.  

* **Policy and regulatory** – No specific legislation or FDA guidance was issued concerning resveratrol or SIRT1 activators. The FDA continues to treat resveratrol as a dietary supplement, requiring manufacturers to avoid disease‑claim language.  

**Overall impact** – The 2012 conditional knockout study clarified that some resveratrol actions are SIRT1‑dependent while others are not, a conclusion that has been repeatedly confirmed. However, the work did not catalyze a breakthrough drug pipeline; instead, it contributed to a broader consensus that resveratrol’s therapeutic promise is limited and that more selective modulation of the NAD⁺‑SIRT axis is needed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implicitly or explicitly makes a few forward‑looking statements. Their outcomes are summarized below:

| Prediction (as inferred from the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **More “clean” SIRT1‑activating compounds will reproduce the mitochondrial benefits seen with resveratrol, but will have less effect on blood glucose** | Selective SIRT1 activators (e.g., SRT2104) did show some improvement in mitochondrial markers in animal models, but human trials yielded only modest metabolic changes and no clear glucose‑lowering advantage. The anticipated clean separation of effects was not robustly demonstrated. |
| **The Sinclair conditional knockout model will become a standard tool for dissecting SIRT1‑dependent mechanisms** | The model was used in a handful of follow‑up studies (e.g., 2014‑2017 papers on hepatic metabolism), but it never became a widely adopted platform; most labs continued to rely on tissue‑specific knockouts or pharmacological tools. |
| **Resveratrol’s “dirty” nature will limit its development as a therapeutic, prompting a shift toward more specific SIRT1 activators** | Accurate. The field largely abandoned resveratrol as a drug candidate and redirected resources toward NAD⁺ precursors and other metabolic modulators. |
| **An anti‑aging pill based on resveratrol/SIRT1 will emerge soon** | Not realized. No FDA‑approved anti‑aging medication has appeared, and the hype around a “resveratrol pill” has faded. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a solid snapshot of a pivotal moment in the SIRT1/resveratrol debate, offering useful technical insight and a measured critique of hype, but its long‑term scientific and commercial impact turned out to be modest.
