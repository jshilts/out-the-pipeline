# A Letter of Mr. Isaac Newton...Containing His New Theory About Light and Colors (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2009 commentary reflects on Isaac Newton's 1672 paper "A Letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, Professor of the Mathematicks at the University of Cambridge, Containing His New Theory About Light and Colors," published by the Royal Society. The article celebrates Newton's foundational work on optics, including his observations about refraction, rainbows, white light, complementary colors, and human perception. It also notes that within this same work, Newton invented the reflecting telescope. The author positions Newton as one of history's most authentic scientific geniuses ("the Real Deal"), comparing him to Bernoulli through the expression "you may recognize the lion by his paw"—suggesting that even from partial evidence, true greatness is recognizable.

## 2. HISTORY

The context is that this 2009 piece was written to commemorate the accessibility of Newton's original 1672 publication through the Royal Society's digital archives. In the years following this 2009 commentary, several relevant developments occurred:

The Royal Society continued digitizing its historical archives, making more classical scientific papers freely available online. This aligned with broader open-access movements in academic publishing that gained momentum after 2009.

Newton's reflecting telescope design, invented in 1668 and described in his optical work, remained fundamentally important in astronomy. Modern reflecting telescopes—from backyard amateur instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope (launched 2021)—all descend from Newton's basic design principles, though with sophisticated improvements in mirrors, mounts, and instrumentation.

Newton's theory of light and colors, establishing that white light is composed of multiple colors that refract differentially, became universally accepted scientific fact taught in every physics curriculum worldwide. His 1672 paper represents one of the foundational texts of modern optics.

The "lion by his paw" reference to Bernoulli suggests the author's recognition that seminal thinkers leave distinctive intellectual fingerprints recognizable across centuries of scientific work.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2009 article contains no explicit predictions about future scientific or technological developments. It is purely retrospective, commemorating historical scientific achievement rather than forecasting future breakthroughs. The piece is essentially celebratory and historical rather than predictive in nature.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While elegantly written and historically informed, this is essentially a brief appreciation of archival scientific literature rather than analysis with implications for biotechnology or contemporary scientific developments. It serves as cultural commentary about scientific heritage but lacks forward-looking relevance or technical depth that would make it broadly significant for understanding current science or biotechnology trends. The connection to biotechnology (the stated focus area) is essentially nonexistent.
