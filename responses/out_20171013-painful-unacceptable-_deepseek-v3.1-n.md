# A Painful, Unacceptable Lack of Data (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a systematic evaluation of oncology drug approvals by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from 2009 to 2013. During this period, 48 cancer drugs were approved for 68 different indications. The concerning finding was that 57% of these approvals (39 out of 68) entered the market without evidence of improved overall survival or quality of life for patients. Even more troubling, at least 3.3 years post-approval, there was still no conclusive evidence for 33 of these 39 drugs showing that they actually extended or improved patients' lives.

The article highlights that regulatory agencies often accept surrogate endpoints (like progression-free survival) instead of requiring overall survival data. While this allows for faster drug approval, it leaves critical gaps in understanding whether these expensive cancer treatments actually deliver meaningful benefits to patients. The author argues for mandatory postmarketing surveillance to collect real-world survival data, acknowledging that this would make drug development slower and more expensive, but potentially more reliable.

## 2. HISTORY

The publication of this BMJ study and the accompanying commentary represented a watershed moment in oncology drug regulation discourse. In the years following 2017, several significant developments occurred:

**Regulatory Changes**: Both EMA and FDA began placing greater emphasis on overall survival data and quality-of-life endpoints. The FDA's Project Facilitate and real-world evidence initiatives gained momentum, though surrogate endpoints remain widely used due to practical constraints.

**Post-marketing Requirements**: There has been increased scrutiny of post-marketing study commitments. FDA data shows that while compliance with required post-marketing studies has improved, completion rates remain suboptimal, particularly for confirmatory trials needed to verify surrogate endpoint findings.

**Clinical Trial Design Evolution**: More recent oncology trials increasingly incorporate overall survival as a primary or key secondary endpoint, reflecting lessons learned from the era examined in the 2017 study.

**Reimbursement and Value Assessment**: Payers and health technology assessment bodies (like NICE in the UK and similar agencies in other EU countries) have become more critical of approvals based solely on surrogate markers, leading to greater cost-effectiveness scrutiny and sometimes restricted reimbursement.

**Industry Response**: The pharmaceutical industry has generally adapted to these pressures by designing trials with stronger clinical endpoints, though the fundamental tension between speed-to-market and evidence quality persists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about regulatory evolution:

- **Prediction**: That tightening survival requirements would inevitably slow drug development and increase costs
  - **Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. Regulatory requirements have become more stringent, but efficiency improvements in trial design and execution have somewhat offset time delays. Costs have continued to rise, but this reflects broader industry trends beyond just regulatory changes.

- **Prediction**: That mandatory postmarketing surveillance with approval rescission if data doesn't support benefits would face resistance and complexity
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Post-marketing requirements remain challenging to enforce consistently. While some accelerated approvals have been withdrawn (like several checkpoint inhibitor indications), the process remains controversial and legally complex, as evidenced by ongoing debates about accelerated approval pathways.

- **Prediction**: That the balance between faster access and evidence quality would remain contentious
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. This tension persists and has become more complex with the expansion of accelerated approval pathways, breakthrough therapy designations, and pressure for faster access to innovative therapies. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated this balance, leading to emergency authorizations that reignited debates about evidence standards.

- **Prediction**: That regulatory practices might not generate critical information about outcomes that matter most to patients
  - **Outcome**: **Mixed**. Progress has been made in requiring more meaningful endpoints, but surrogate markers remain common. The emergence of real-world evidence initiatives represents progress, but systematic capture of quality-of-life and survival data remains incomplete.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified a critical issue in oncology drug development that has persisted and evolved in importance. The tension between regulatory speed and evidence quality remains one of the most significant challenges in pharmaceutical policy, affecting billions in healthcare spending and patient outcomes across multiple disease areas. The essay's prescient analysis of these trade-offs continues to be relevant as regulatory agencies balance innovation access with evidence requirements.
