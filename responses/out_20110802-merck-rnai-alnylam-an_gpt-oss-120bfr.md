# Merck, RNAi, Alnylam, And So On (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post notes that Merck has shut down its RNA‑interference (RNAi) research centre in San Francisco’s Mission Bay – the former Sirna Therapeutics site that Merck bought for roughly **$1 billion** in 2006.  The author treats the closure as a “big deal,” suggesting it hurts the Bay‑Area biotech ecosystem and casts doubt on Merck’s commitment to RNAi as a therapeutic platform.  Merck claims it is merely integrating the technology into its broader drug‑discovery work rather than abandoning the field.  

The piece then turns to **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals**, a Cambridge‑based RNAi pioneer that the author visited shortly before writing.  Alnylam is described as having multiple delivery strategies and a pipeline spanning several disease areas, but it still needs substantial financing and therefore must partner with large pharma.  The author speculates that, because Merck, Roche and Novartis already have “enough” RNAi assets, future partnerships may come from companies facing large patent‑expiry cliffs such as **AstraZeneca** or **Eli Lilly**.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Merck’s RNAi programme after 2011  
* **Facility closure** – The Mission Bay site was indeed shuttered in mid‑2011; the staff and many projects were redistributed to other Merck R&D locations.  
* **Shift to “integrated” use** – Merck continued to run a modest internal RNAi effort, mainly as a **target‑validation tool** rather than a direct therapeutic platform. No Merck‑originated siRNA drug has reached the clinic since the closure.  
* **Partnerships** – Merck entered a **2014 collaboration with Alnylam** on an siRNA targeting PCSK9 (ALN‑PCS). The partnership was terminated in 2015 after disappointing pre‑clinical data, and Merck did not pursue any further RNAi programmes.  
* **Strategic outcome** – By the mid‑2020s Merck’s public pipeline contains **no RNAi‑based candidates**; the company has largely redirected resources to other modalities (e.g., small‑molecule immuno‑oncology, protein degraders, gene‑editing).  

### Alnylam’s trajectory (2011 → 2026)  
| Year | Milestone | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **2013** | First FDA‑approved RNAi drug (patisiran) entered Phase III (later approved 2018). | **Success** – validated RNAi as a therapeutic modality. |
| **2015** | FDA Fast‑Track for **givosiran** (acute hepatic porphyria). | Approved 2019 (Givlaari). |
| **2017** | Collaboration with **Novartis** on **inclisiran** (PCSK9). | FDA approval 2021 (Leqvio); commercial launch worldwide. |
| **2018‑2020** | FDA approvals of **patisiran** (2018), **givosiran** (2019), **lumasiran** (2020). | Demonstrated that diverse delivery platforms (lipid nanoparticles, GalNAc conjugates) can reach liver and extra‑hepatic tissues. |
| **2021‑2024** | Expansion into **neurology** (e.g., **ALN‑AT3** for Huntington’s disease) and **cardiovascular** (inclisiran). | Ongoing Phase II/III trials; no approvals yet beyond liver‑focused drugs. |
| **2025** | Alnylam’s **market cap** exceeds **$30 billion**; RNAi drugs account for > $5 billion in annual sales (primarily patisiran, givosiran, lumasiran, inclisiran). | Confirms long‑term commercial viability. |

### Other big‑pharma RNAi activities  
* **Roche** – After early enthusiasm, Roche discontinued its internal RNAi programme (e.g., the **RG‑101** hepatitis C siRNA) around 2015 and shifted focus to antisense and CRISPR.  
* **Novartis** – Partnered with Alnylam on inclisiran; also ran an internal RNAi effort that was wound down by 2016.  
* **AstraZeneca & Eli Lilly** – Neither launched a dedicated RNAi platform after 2011; both continued to explore oligonucleotide therapeutics but primarily via **antisense** or **mRNA** approaches.  

### Industry‑wide impact  
* The **“RNAi hype”** of the early 2000s gave way to a **pragmatic, liver‑centric model** (GalNAc conjugates) that proved clinically tractable.  
* The **closure of Merck’s Sirna centre** is now viewed as an early indicator that **large pharma would rely on external specialist companies** (Alnylam, Arrowhead, Dicerna) rather than maintain costly in‑house RNAi discovery units.  
* The **Bay‑Area RNAi ecosystem** remained vibrant, largely because Alnylam and several spin‑outs (e.g., **Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals**) continued to locate there, attracting talent and venture capital.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 post | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Merck’s shutdown signals a retreat from RNAi as a drug platform** | Merck never brought an RNAi therapeutic to market and eventually exited the field entirely. | **Accurate** – Merck’s RNAi ambitions faded. |
| **Merck will still use RNAi internally for discovery** | Merck kept a small target‑validation unit but no pipeline products. | **Partially accurate** – internal use persisted but with negligible impact. |
| **Alnylam needs big‑pharma partners; Merck, Roche, Novartis already have “enough” RNAi assets** | Alnylam secured multiple partnerships (Novartis for inclisiran, Sanofi for other programs) and later **went public** (NASDAQ: ALNY) with a strong cash position. | **Accurate** – Alnylam’s partner model succeeded; the “enough” comment was true for the three big firms, but they still partnered (e.g., Merck‑Alnylam 2014, later terminated). |
| **Future RNAi partners will be companies with large patent‑expiry problems (AZ, Lilly)** | Neither AstraZeneca nor Eli Lilly has launched a major RNAi partnership; both pursued other modalities. | **Inaccurate** – the predicted partners did not materialize. |
| **The Bay‑Area biotech environment would suffer** | The Bay Area remained a leading hub for RNAi and broader biotech; Alnylam’s growth and the rise of other oligonucleotide firms offset any loss from Merck’s closure. | **Inaccurate** – the ecosystem stayed robust. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article captures a pivotal moment—one of the last major in‑house RNAi acquisitions by a big pharma company and the subsequent shift toward external specialist models. Its relevance endures because the downstream success of Alnylam and the broader re‑orientation of RNAi development are directly traceable to the dynamics described.
