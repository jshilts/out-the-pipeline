# DNA Can Be Messed With More Than You'd Think (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights two research developments presented by Ali Tavassoli at the Challenges in Chemical Biology conference. The first is SICLOPPS (Self-Interrupted Click Ligation for Protein-Protein Interaction Screening), a method for generating large libraries of cyclic peptides to screen for inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The second, more detailed update, concerns triazole-linked DNA sequences—artificially modified DNA strands where the natural phosphodiester backbone is replaced with triazole linkages. Tavassoli's group had previously shown these modified DNAs were biocompatible in bacteria, and now reported they also work in mammalian cells (MCF-7 breast cancer cell line). The author notes this expands possibilities for artificial gene systems and observes that DNA can tolerate significant chemical modifications beyond natural structures.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 article, **triazole-modified nucleic acids** continued to be explored. Triazole linkages are part of the broader "click chemistry" toolkit (azide-alkyne cycloadditions) that has become widely adopted in chemical biology for bioconjugation and materials applications. However, **triazole-linked DNA as an artificial backbone has not become a mainstream technology** for therapeutic or diagnostic applications.

Research continued on modified nucleic acid backbones, with clinical and commercial success shifting toward other chemical modifications:
- **Phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides** (e.g., Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy, approved 2016; Waylivra for familial chylomicronemia syndrome, approved 2018)
- **2'-modified siRNA** (with multiple FDA approvals including Onpattro in 2018)
- **Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs)** and locked nucleic acids (LNAs) found applications in research tools and diagnostics, but **not widespread therapeutic drug approvals**

Concrete adoption: Researchers use triazole linkages more for bioconjugation strategies than as complete artificial DNA backbones. The biocompatibility demonstration in mammalian cells did not translate into approved drugs using triazole-linked DNA. Clinical development required other stabilization strategies (not triazole backbones).

For **SICLOPPS cyclic peptides**: While cyclic peptides remain an active area in drug discovery (particularly for targeting PPIs), SICLOPPS did not produce FDA-approved drugs in the following decade. Macrocyclic peptides have seen some approval success (e.g., cyclosporine analogs, various natural product derivatives), but not specifically from SICLOPPS-derived hits. The technology remains a research tool rather than a major drug discovery platform.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made these predictions/implications:
• **"Opens up some very interesting artificial-gene ideas"** - This proved partially true. While synthetic biology exploded (e.g., CRISPR gene editing, mRNA vaccines, CAR-T therapies), these relied on **natural or minimally modified** nucleic acid chemistry—not triazole backbones. Artificial gene therapy vectors use viral capsids, lipids, or nanoparticles rather than extensively modified DNA backbones.
• **"Extent to which DNA can be modified... What else is possible?"** - Realized in some contexts. Scientists developed numerous nucleic acid modifications (2'-fluoro, 2'-O-methyl, phosphorothioate, morpholinos), but **triazole backbones specifically did not** achieve widespread adoption. The question was visionary, but this particular modification pathway didn't deliver breakthrough applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses legitimate scientific developments, but the specific triazole-DNA technology did not translate into significant therapeutic or biotechnology breakthroughs. The broader theme (comparing DNA modifications) has enduring relevance, but this particular example represents incremental research rather than transformative impact.
