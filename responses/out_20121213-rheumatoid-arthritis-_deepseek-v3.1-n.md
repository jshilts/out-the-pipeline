# Rheumatoid Arthritis Wins A Couple of Rounds (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 article reported on two significant clinical trial setbacks for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapies on the same day. AstraZeneca's Fostamatinib (a Syk inhibitor licensed from Rigel) failed to show efficacy superiority against Humira in a head-to-head trial, raising concerns about its future prospects despite an upcoming Phase III trial. The article also noted Eli Lilly's decision to halt development of Tabalumab (an antibody against B-cell activating factor targeting the TNF pathway) due to lack of efficacy in RA patients who didn't respond to methotrexate therapy.

## 2. HISTORY

**Fostamatinib's trajectory after 2012:**
- Despite the 2012 setbacks, Fostamatinib eventually gained FDA approval in 2018 for treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults, not rheumatoid arthritis. The drug was approved under the brand name Tavalisse.
- Rigel Pharmaceuticals continued development with AstraZeneca handing back rights in 2014.
- For ITP, Fostamatinib became a second-line treatment option with demonstrated efficacy in increasing platelet counts.
- The drug never achieved success in rheumatoid arthritis treatment as originally hoped.

**Tabalumab's fate:**
- Eli Lilly's Tabalumab continued to face challenges across multiple indications.
- In 2016, Lilly discontinued global development of Tabalumab after it failed in lupus trials, ending a development program that spanned multiple autoimmune conditions.
- The failure in RA was an early indicator of broader efficacy problems that ultimately led to termination of the entire program.

**Broader industry context:**
- Anti-TNF therapies like Humira (mentioned in the article) continued to dominate RA treatment throughout the 2010s.
- Other classes of RA drugs (JAK inhibitors like Xeljanz, Olumiant) gained approval in subsequent years, offering alternative mechanisms beyond TNF inhibition, Syk inhibition, and BAFF targeting.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Fostamatinib's Phase III prospects**: The article questioned whether the upcoming Phase III trial could "turn this one into a success." **Outcome**: The drug failed in RA trials but eventually found success in a completely different indication (ITP), showing how drug development can pivot across diseases.

• **Ongoing assessment suspension**: Lilly's decision to suspend enrollment pending trial results suggested they remained somewhat hopeful. **Outcome**: The drug ultimately failed across all major indications including RA and lupus, confirming the early warning signs.

## 4. INTEREST

Score: 7

The article captured a real-time moment when two major companies faced the harsh reality of clinical failure, accurately predicting the challenging road ahead for both programs while highlighting the unpredictable nature of drug development where initial failures can sometimes lead to unexpected successes in different therapeutic areas.
