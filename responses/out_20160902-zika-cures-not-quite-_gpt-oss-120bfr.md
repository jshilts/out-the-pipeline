# Zika Cures? Not Quite Yet (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 Nature Medicine commentary highlighted a high‑throughput screen of existing pharmacological agents for activity against Zika virus (ZIKV) in a caspase‑3‑based assay. The screen identified three notable hits:  

* **Emricasan** – a pan‑caspase inhibitor that had been in clinical trials for chronic liver disease.  
* **Niclosamide** – an old anti‑helminthic drug with a known safety record but limited dosing because of side‑effects.  
* **PHA‑690509** – a cyclin‑dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that had reached Phase I trials.  

The authors argued that these compounds could serve as chemical probes to illuminate ZIKV‑host interactions (particularly the role of caspases and CDKs) and, because they are already approved or in clinical development, might be repurposed more quickly than a brand‑new molecule. They cautioned, however, that in‑vitro hits still require animal efficacy data and human trials before any claim of a “cure” is justified, a point they felt the media headlines ignored.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Zika epidemiology** – After the 2015‑2016 epidemic, the number of reported cases fell dramatically worldwide. The WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern over Zika over in November 2016, and the disease has remained relatively rare since then, reducing commercial pressure for a dedicated antiviral.

**Emricasan** – Development continued in liver‑disease indications (NASH, alcoholic hepatitis) through Phase II trials, but mixed efficacy results and safety concerns led the sponsor (Conatus Pharmaceuticals) to halt further advancement by 2020. No pre‑clinical or clinical studies of emricasan for ZIKV have been published after the 2016 screen.

**Niclosamide** – The drug’s broad antiviral activity (including against coronaviruses, dengue, and ZIKV) has been confirmed in several in‑vitro studies, but no animal‑model efficacy or clinical trial for ZIKV has been reported. Interest in niclosamide resurfaced during the COVID‑19 pandemic, yet it has not progressed to an approved antiviral indication.

**PHA‑690509 / CDK inhibitors** – PHA‑690509 (also known as seliciclib/roscovitine) remained a research tool; its clinical development stalled after early‑phase oncology trials. No follow‑up ZIKV studies using this compound or other CDK inhibitors have reached the clinic. The mechanistic link between CDK activity and ZIKV replication is now better understood, but CDK inhibition has not become a mainstream antiviral strategy for Zika.

**Overall therapeutic landscape** – To date, **no antiviral drug has received regulatory approval for ZIKV**. The most tangible progress has been in vaccine development: several candidates (DNA, mRNA, inactivated virus) entered Phase I/II trials between 2017‑2020, but none have yet been licensed, largely because the public health urgency waned. Supportive care and vector control remain the primary public‑health tools.

**Business impact** – Companies that marketed the three highlighted compounds did not experience a Zika‑related surge. Emricasan’s market value declined with its clinical setbacks; niclosamide continued as an over‑the‑counter anti‑helminthic with modest sales; CDK‑inhibitor programs shifted focus to oncology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several expectations:

- **Repurposed drugs could become Zika therapies after animal studies.**  
  *Outcome:* No animal‑model efficacy data have been published that led to clinical trials for any of the three hits. The prediction did not materialize.

- **The identified compounds would clarify Zika biology (caspase and CDK involvement).**  
  *Outcome:* Subsequent research confirmed that ZIKV can trigger apoptosis and that CDK pathways influence viral replication, but these insights have not translated into approved treatments.

- **Rapid translation to human use because the drugs were already known.**  
  *Outcome:* The timeline proved far longer than suggested; none of the compounds progressed beyond pre‑clinical speculation.

Overall, the article’s cautious tone proved accurate: the “cure” headlines were premature, and the anticipated therapeutic pipeline did not develop.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece is a useful snapshot of drug‑repurposing optimism during a public‑health crisis, and its hindsight analysis shows why such optimism often stalls, but the topic is now of moderate historical rather than current relevance.
