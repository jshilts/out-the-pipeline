# Wake Up and Smell the Solvents (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article is a personal reflection by a chemist who recently left laboratory work, reminiscing about the characteristic smells of common organic solvents encountered in synthetic chemistry labs. The author provides detailed olfactory descriptions of various solvents: acetone's penetrating solvent-like smell, ethyl acetate's fruity ester quality, hexane and methylene chloride's paint-cleaner character, THF and diethyl ether's pungent ethereal nature, and acetonitrile's notable lack of odor. The article also discusses how highly polar solvents like DMF and DMSO have minimal smell that may come from trace impurities rather than the pure compounds themselves. The author concludes that pure ethanol has the most pleasant scent among common lab solvents, distinctive for its combination of fruitiness and pungency, while other alcohols like methanol, propanols, and butanols are variously harsh, clinical, or foul-smelling.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication in 2007, significant developments occurred in laboratory safety practices and solvent handling, though many were already underway when this article was written. The chemical industry and academic labs increasingly adopted stricter safety protocols, improved ventilation systems, and moved toward greener chemistry principles. 

The period saw continued regulatory attention to solvent safety under OSHA standards and growing emphasis on fume hood usage and personal protective equipment. However, many of the solvents mentioned (acetone, ethyl acetate, ethanol, THF, DMF, DMSO) remain widely used in laboratories today due to their unique chemical properties that make them difficult to replace entirely. The practical constraints of synthetic chemistry mean that despite safety improvements, chemists still regularly work with volatile organic compounds, though with better engineering controls and safety awareness than in previous decades.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in chemistry, laboratory safety, or solvent usage. It was primarily a retrospective personal reflection rather than a forward-looking analysis. The author focused on describing current experiences and observations rather than speculating about future trends in laboratory practices, chemical synthesis, or safety regulations.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **3/10**

This article represents a light personal reflection piece rather than substantive scientific commentary about biotechnology or the pharmaceutical industry. While it provides some interesting sensory descriptions of laboratory work, it lacks the analytical depth, industry insights, or forward-looking perspective that would merit higher interest for understanding biotech developments or scientific trends. The content is more anecdotal than analytical, focusing on personal experience rather than broader scientific, technological, or business implications relevant to biotechnology.
