# People Only Fake Things That Are Valuable (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the peer review scandal uncovered by BioMed Central in early 2015, where 43 papers had to be retracted due to fabricated peer reviews. The author describes how some manipulations appeared to be conducted by third-party agencies offering language-editing and submission assistance, though it remained unclear whether authors were aware of these fabricated reviewers or proposed them directly.

The core argument presented is that this represents a "counterfeiting problem" in science, where papers function as valuable currency for career advancement—promotion, tenure, and professional recognition. The author notes that as long as scientific careers are evaluated by publication counts, there will be incentives to create fake publications, similar to how valuable currency attracts counterfeiters. The piece concludes that while publisher efforts to police this are commendable, the fundamental problem lies on the demand side—the systems that overvalue publication quantity.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 BioMed Central retractions were part of a much larger pattern that continued to unfold. In subsequent years, this scandal expanded dramatically:

- **2015-2017**: The fake peer review crisis grew significantly, with major publishers including Springer, SAGE, and others retracting hundreds of papers. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) issued guidelines on detecting and preventing peer review manipulation.

- **Scale expansion**: By 2017, over 500 papers had been retracted across multiple publishers due to peer review manipulation, revealing coordinated operations primarily involving Chinese researchers and third-party agencies.

- **Institutional responses**: Many institutions implemented more rigorous verification processes for peer reviewer identities, including requiring institutional email addresses, ORCID IDs, and cross-checking reviewer suggestions against publication databases.

- **Policy changes**: Funding agencies and academic institutions began placing greater emphasis on research quality over quantity, with some adopting DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment) principles that explicitly call for moving beyond simple publication counts for evaluation.

- **Ongoing problem**: Despite increased awareness and safeguards, fake peer review scandals continued through the late 2010s, indicating the underlying incentives described in the article remained potent.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the future:

- **Prediction**: That as long as publication count drives career advancement, peer review manipulation will continue.
  - **Reality**: Proved largely accurate. Despite improved detection and prevention measures, new cases of peer review manipulation continued to emerge through 2020s, confirming that the underlying incentive structure persists.

- **Prediction**: That publisher policing efforts alone wouldn't solve the problem because the issue lies with the demand side (evaluation systems).
  - **Reality**: Largely validated. While detection improved, fundamental reform has been slow. Many institutions still heavily weight publication metrics for hiring, promotion, and funding decisions.

- **Prediction**: That third-party agencies would continue to facilitate this manipulation.
  - **Reality**: Confirmed. Subsequent investigations revealed ongoing operation of "paper mills" and questionable author services, suggesting this became a persistent cottage industry.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience in identifying the systemic drivers of scientific misconduct nearly a decade ago. The framework of scientific publishing as a currency system vulnerable to counterfeiting has proven to be not just a metaphor but an accurate predictor of how the problem would evolve and persist despite technical and policy interventions.
