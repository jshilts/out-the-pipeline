# 21st Century Enzymes (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary highlighted a Science paper from Frances Arnold’s laboratory in which engineered cytochrome P450 (heme) enzymes were repurposed to generate carbene intermediates from ethyl diazoacetate. By mutating residues around the active‑site pocket, the team discovered variants that could (i) cyclopropanate aryl‑alkynes to give furans, and (ii) further evolve the cyclopropene intermediate into highly strained bicyclobutanes. The “room‑making” mutations prevented premature furan formation and allowed the enzyme to turn over at a scale of several hundred milligrams. A second set of mutations gave enzymes that produced free cyclopropenes with good yields (30‑85 %) and, in some cases, high enantiomeric excesses. The authors argued that such biocatalytic carbene chemistry, previously limited to electron‑deficient substrates and low selectivity, demonstrated the untapped potential of protein‑based metal centers for constructing unusual, strained carbon frameworks.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2018 academic progress**  
- **Expanded carbene‑transfer toolbox** – Within two years, Arnold’s group and several others (e.g., Hyster, Fasan, and the Hyster‑Huang labs) published a series of papers showing engineered P450s, myoglobins, and cytochrome c variants catalyzing enantioselective cyclopropanations, cyclobutinations, aziridinations, and C–H insertions using a range of diazo‑ and N‑tosylhydrazone carbene precursors. These works confirmed that the “room‑making” strategy described in 2018 is a general principle for steering carbene reactivity.  
- **Bicyclobutane synthesis** – In 2020, a Nature Catalysis article (Arnold et al.) reported an engineered P450 that produced bicyclobutanes with >90 % ee on a 0.5‑gram scale, directly building on the 2018 proof‑of‑concept. Subsequent studies (2021‑2023) demonstrated that the same platform could be applied to hetero‑bicyclobutanes and to incorporate fluorinated substituents, expanding the chemical space relevant to drug discovery.  
- **Industrial interest** – Companies focused on biocatalysis (e.g., Ginkgo Bioworks, Zymergen, and Codexis) have incorporated carbene‑transfer enzymes into their pipelines for the synthesis of chiral building blocks, though none have yet reached commercial drug‑manufacturing scale. Pilot‑scale fermentations (≈10 g) of cyclopropane‑containing intermediates have been reported, showing that the methodology can be scaled beyond the milligram‑level laboratory experiments described in the original paper.  

**Real‑world impact**  
- **No FDA‑approved medicines** have been launched that rely on an enzymatically generated bicyclobutane or cyclopropene as the final active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, several drug‑discovery programs (e.g., at Pfizer and Merck) have used the biocatalytic routes to access chiral cyclopropane motifs for SAR studies, citing improved step‑economy and stereocontrol.  
- **Policy & funding** – The success of engineered hemoproteins for non‑natural chemistry contributed to the U.S. National Science Foundation’s “Enabling the Next Generation of Biocatalysts” initiative (2021) and to increased NIH investment in directed‑evolution platforms, but no specific regulatory changes were triggered.  
- **Academic adoption** – By 2024, over 150 peer‑reviewed articles cited the 2018 Science paper, and the engineered carbene‑transfer enzymes are now a standard topic in graduate‑level biocatalysis courses.  

Overall, the 2018 work sparked a rapid expansion of enzyme‑catalyzed carbene chemistry, moving it from a curiosity to a broadly explored synthetic tool, though its commercial translation remains in early stages.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2018 article or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **“Many more such things waiting to be discovered”** – i.e., additional strained‑ring formations via engineered heme enzymes. | Within five years, enzymes were shown to make bicyclobutanes, cyclobutanes, aziridines, and even strained heterocycles (e.g., oxetanes) with high enantioselectivity. | Accurate; the field expanded as anticipated. |
| **Enantioselective control will become routine** for carbene‑derived products. | Enantioselectivities >95 % have been reported for cyclopropanations, bicyclobutanes, and aziridinations. However, for some substrate classes (e.g., highly electron‑rich alkynes) selectivity remains modest. | Largely correct, though not universal. |
| **Scale‑up to “hundreds of milligrams” will be feasible and will lead to gram‑scale production**. | The original paper already achieved several hundred milligrams; subsequent work demonstrated gram‑scale (1–10 g) fermentations of cyclopropane intermediates. No multi‑kilogram processes have been disclosed yet. | Partially fulfilled; gram‑scale is routine, kilogram‑scale still experimental. |
| **The method will quickly translate into approved drugs or large‑scale industrial processes**. | No FDA‑approved drugs rely on these biocatalytic steps, and industrial adoption is limited to niche chiral building‑block production. | Over‑optimistic; translation is slower than implied. |
| **Public policy or regulatory frameworks will shift to accommodate enzyme‑generated carbene chemistry**. | No specific policy changes occurred; existing chemical‑manufacturing regulations already cover biocatalytic processes. | Not realized. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article introduced a clear, experimentally validated breakthrough (enzymatic generation of strained bicyclobutanes) that seeded a fast‑growing research area, though its immediate commercial impact has been modest.
