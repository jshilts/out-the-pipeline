# Another STEM Jobs Myth-Breaking Article (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Andrew Hacker's New York Review of Books piece challenging the widespread narrative of a STEM shortage in the United States. The author leverages Michael Teitelbaum's book "Falling Behind? Boom, Bust, and the Global Race for Scientific Talent" to question whether there truly exists a shortage of science and engineering professionals, or if the "shortage" narrative serves other purposes. 

The piece examines the H-1B visa program, noting that foreign workers on these visas earn approximately 57% of what Americans with comparable credentials receive. UC Davis computer scientist Norman Matloff's research is cited, showing that H-1B workers are typically young, single men tied to sponsoring employers, making them "essentially immobile" and unable to switch jobs despite poor conditions due to deportation risks. The author expresses conflicted views—supporting immigration philosophically but troubled by evidence suggesting H-1B workers may be used to replace existing employees with cheaper, more controllable alternatives.

## 2. HISTORY

The STEM workforce debate continued evolving significantly after 2015, though many core tensions remained unresolved. The H-1B visa program saw continued scrutiny, with multiple reform efforts proposed in Congress but little substantial change implemented. The Trump administration did implement more restrictive policies and increased denial rates for H-1B petitions, though some of these were later reversed.

Several major tech companies faced lawsuits and investigations regarding H-1B practices and alleged discrimination against American workers. In 2021, the Biden administration made certain changes to the H-1B lottery system intended to benefit higher-wage positions, but critics argued this didn't fundamentally alter employer incentives.

Within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors specifically, the workforce dynamics evolved amidst major developments. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented demand for biotech talent during 2020-2022, with mRNA vaccine development and other therapeutic areas experiencing rapid expansion. However, by 2023-2024, the industry saw significant layoffs and hiring slowdowns, suggesting cyclical rather than sustained shortage patterns.

The broader conversation around STEM education and workforce policy continued, with various states and institutions attempting to address perceived supply-demand mismatches. Rising pharmaceutical R&D costs, drug pricing pressures, and patent cliffs for major therapies created variable demand for scientific talent across different therapeutic areas and company sizes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction that H-1B salary disparities would persist**: This largely proved accurate. Studies continued showing significant wage gaps between H-1B workers and comparable domestic hires, with ongoing debates about whether this reflected genuine market differences or systematic exploitation.

• **Concern that H-1B workers would remain "essentially immobile" due to visa restrictions**: This prediction was largely validated. Despite some minor policy adjustments, H-1B workers generally remained tied to sponsoring employers, with job mobility severely constrained by immigration status.

• **Suggestion that STEM shortage narrative might be overstated or serve other purposes**: This proved more nuanced. Periodic shortages emerged in specific sectors during boom periods (notably biotech during COVID), but these were often temporary and sector-specific rather than systemic across all STEM fields. The narrative continued serving various stakeholder interests—employers seeking lower labor costs, universities seeking enrollment, immigration advocates seeking expanded opportunities.

• **Implicit concern about impact on domestic workers**: This remained a persistent issue, with ongoing debates and some evidence of H-1B programs affecting wages and employment in certain tech sectors, though the biotech industry's impact was less clearly documented due to smaller sample sizes and different workforce dynamics.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a foundational STEM workforce policy issue with lasting implications, connecting temporary visa programs to broader questions about labor markets, immigration, and scientific workforce development. While subsequent events showed the complexity was even greater than portrayed, the core questions about STEM shortage narratives and their relationship to economic incentives remain highly relevant to understanding both the biotech industry and scientific workforce policy.
