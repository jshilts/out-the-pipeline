# Mix-and-Match Natural Products (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses efforts to incorporate more natural-product-like features into compound libraries for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Natural product structures are generally more complex and functionally rich than typical screening compounds, but producing structural variety at scale has been difficult. The piece highlights Martin Burke's work at the University of Illinois using MIDA boronates to create modular building blocks for natural product synthesis. The central finding reported is that just 12 MIDA boronate building blocks could theoretically access over 75% of polyene natural product motifs (polyenes represent 1-2% of known natural products). The approach aims to enable iterative coupling of natural product fragments, potentially extending to other structural classes and creating large libraries of "almost-natural products" for drug discovery screening.

## 2. HISTORY
I am not confident I possess sufficient detailed knowledge of the subsequent developments in MIDA boronate chemistry after 2014 to provide an accurate assessment of its real-world impact on drug discovery, approved drugs, or commercial adoption. The Burke group continued publishing in this area, but I would need to verify the specific outcomes and downstream applications before presenting them as facts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
I lack the confidence to evaluate the specific predictions mentioned in the article—such as whether the 12+ additional structural motifs were successfully commercialized, whether large libraries were built and screened, or how screening hit rates compared to traditional approaches—without access to the relevant literature and commercial development data from the past decade.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
The article describes an innovative synthetic methodology that could significantly impact natural product-based drug discovery, though its ultimate importance would depend on downstream adoption and practical applications that I cannot reliably assess.
