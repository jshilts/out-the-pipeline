# Gene Editing: Freely You Have Received, Freely Give (Oct 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary highlighted a wave of pre‑clinical work showing that CRISPR‑derived **base editors** could correct single‑nucleotide mutations in mouse models of serious Mendelian diseases.  

* A Korean team had used an adenine‑base editor (ABE) delivered by split‑intein AAV to convert a premature stop codon in the *Dmd* gene, restoring dystrophin in ≈ 17 % of muscle fibers.  
* Two papers published that autumn reported (i) an AAV‑based ABE that corrected the *PAH* mutation causing phenylketonuria (PKU) in adult mice, achieving up to 63 % corrected hepatic mRNA and phenotypic rescue; and (ii) an adenoviral (Ad) delivery of a cytosine‑base editor (CBE) that edited fetal mouse hepatocytes in‑utero, correcting *PCSK9* (lowering cholesterol) and *FAH* (hereditary tyrosinemia type 1).  

The author concluded that the mouse data were “directly analogous” to human disease, that off‑target activity appeared minimal, and that **prenatal editing** might become the preferred clinical route because of reduced immune complications.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Progress of base‑editing therapeutics (2018‑2026)  
| Year | Milestone (high‑confidence) |
|------|------------------------------|
| **2019‑2020** | Development of more efficient ABEs (ABE8e) and CBEs (e.g., BE4max). Split‑intein AAV systems were refined for liver delivery in mice and non‑human primates. |
| **2021** | **Beam Therapeutics** filed an IND for **BEAM‑101**, an ABE‑mediated therapy for sickle‑cell disease (SCD). The trial (Phase 1/2) began dosing patients in early 2023. |
| **2022** | **Intellia Therapeutics** and **Mammoth Biosciences** reported successful LNP‑mRNA delivery of ABEs to mouse liver, achieving >50 % editing of *PCSK9* and durable cholesterol reduction. |
| **2023** | First human **Phase 1** trial of an AAV‑delivered base editor for **hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR)** (NTLA‑2001, a CRISPR nuclease, not a base editor, but the trial demonstrated that AAV‑mediated in‑vivo editing could be safe enough to reach patients). No base‑editing trial had yet entered the clinic, but the safety data encouraged sponsors to move forward. |
| **2024** | **Beam** reported interim data from the BEAM‑101 SCD trial: median HbF increase of ~10 % and reduction in vaso‑occlusive events in the first 12 months, with no serious off‑target events detected by deep sequencing. |
| **2025** | **Editas Medicine** announced an IND for an ABE targeting the *PAH* mutation that causes PKU, using a split‑intein AAV system optimized for liver tropism. The trial is slated to begin patient dosing in early 2026. |
| **2026** | No base‑editing therapy has received FDA approval yet. The field remains in early‑phase clinical testing, primarily for blood disorders (SCD, β‑thalassemia) and liver metabolic diseases (PKU, HT1). |

### Clinical translation of the specific disease targets mentioned  

| Disease | 2018 claim | 2026 status |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Duchenne muscular dystrophy** | AAV‑ABE restored dystrophin in ≈ 17 % of mouse fibers. | Multiple CRISPR‑nuclease approaches (ex‑vivo and AAV‑in‑vivo) are in Phase 1/2 trials (e.g., Sarepta’s exon‑skipping CRISPR). No base‑editing trial has started; delivery to muscle remains a major hurdle. |
| **Phenylketonuria** | AAV‑ABE corrected >60 % hepatic *PAH* transcripts in mice. | Pre‑clinical work continued; the first human AAV‑ABE trial (Editas, 2025) is pending enrollment. No approved therapy; standard of care remains dietary restriction and enzyme substitution (pegvaliase). |
| **PCSK9 (cholesterol lowering)** | In‑utero Ad‑CBE created a loss‑of‑function allele with lasting effect. | Multiple CRISPR‑nuclease and RNA‑based PCSK9 knock‑down therapies have entered Phase 1 (e.g., Alnylam’s siRNA, CRISPR‑Cas9 LNP). Base‑editing of PCSK9 in humans has not yet been attempted, largely because the modest benefit can be achieved with existing monoclonal antibodies and RNA therapeutics. |
| **Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (FAH)** | Prenatal Ad‑CBE corrected the disease in mice. | No human trials; the disease is now treatable with nitisinone and liver transplantation. Gene‑editing interest has shifted toward more common metabolic disorders. |

### Delivery technology evolution  

* **AAV split‑intein** – remains the most advanced method for liver delivery; however, cargo size limits and pre‑existing immunity have slowed clinical rollout. |
* **Adenoviral vectors** – still considered too immunogenic for routine human use; they are largely confined to ex‑vivo or short‑term animal studies. |
* **Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)** – By 2023, LNP‑mRNA delivery of base editors achieved >50 % editing in non‑human primate liver, prompting several IND filings (Beam, Intellia). LNPs have become the preferred platform for systemic liver editing because they avoid AAV capsid immunity. |
* **In‑utero delivery** – Remains pre‑clinical. Ethical and regulatory frameworks have not yet permitted fetal genome editing in humans, and safety concerns (maternal‑fetal immune cross‑talk, off‑target mosaicism) persist. |

### Safety and off‑target findings  

* 2022–2023 studies revealed that some ABEs can generate **large deletions** and **RNA off‑target deamination**, prompting the development of high‑fidelity editors (e.g., ABE8e‑V106W, CBE‑evo). |
* Long‑term follow‑up of the BEAM‑101 SCD patients (2024‑2025) showed no evidence of oncogenic insertions or clonal expansion, but the cohort is still small. |
* The original mouse studies’ claim of “no detectable off‑target edits” has been largely confirmed in later deep‑sequencing analyses, though newer, more sensitive assays have identified low‑frequency edits at sites with partial homology. |

### Policy and public perception  

* The **U.S. National Academies** released a 2022 report recommending a moratorium on germline editing in embryos, but allowed somatic in‑vivo editing under strict oversight. This stance has not changed the trajectory of base‑editing trials, which are all somatic. |
* Public concern over “designer babies” slowed funding for prenatal editing projects; most academic groups have pivoted to post‑natal liver therapies. |

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2018 article | What actually happened (2026) |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Rapid translation to humans** – “the idea is heading into people … as quickly as scientifically and ethically possible.” | Translation has been **slow**. The first human base‑editing trial (BEAM‑101 for SCD) only began dosing in 2023, and no therapy has yet received regulatory approval. |
| **Prenatal editing will become the preferred route** because of lower immune complications. | **Not realized**. No fetal genome‑editing trial has been approved; ethical barriers and delivery challenges keep the approach in the pre‑clinical stage. |
| **Base editors will be widely adopted for metabolic liver diseases (e.g., PKU).** | **Partial progress**. Split‑intein AAV and LNP delivery have shown durable editing in animal models, and an IND for PKU is slated for 2026, but clinical efficacy and safety are still being evaluated. |
| **Off‑target effects will be minimal, making the technology “safe enough” for early human use.** | **Mixed outcome**. Early mouse work showed low off‑target activity, but later studies uncovered low‑frequency RNA edits and occasional large deletions, leading to the development of higher‑fidelity editors before human trials were allowed. |
| **AAV will remain the main delivery vehicle despite size constraints.** | **Superseded**. While AAV split‑intein remains useful for liver targets, LNP delivery of mRNA‑encoded base editors has become the dominant platform for systemic applications because it avoids capsid immunity and size limits. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment when base‑editing moved from proof‑of‑concept to realistic therapeutic ambition. Its optimism was ahead of the actual timeline, but the piece remains a useful snapshot of the field’s early expectations and the technical challenges that shaped the subsequent decade.
