# AstraZeneca: How Many Approvals, Again? (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reacts to AstraZeneca's November 2014 announcement that it expected "8 to 10" drug approvals in 2015-2016. The author expresses strong skepticism about this claim, noting that such a high number of approvals would be unprecedented and asking what the modern record actually was. The piece suggests the announcement appeared aimed at boosting investor confidence and deterring Pfizer from renewing its acquisition bid, while describing the target as "wildly optimistic" despite acknowledging AstraZeneca had pipeline activity.

## 2. HISTORY
AstraZeneca's actual FDA approval record for 2015-2016 fell significantly short of their 8-10 target. In 2015, AstraZeneca received FDA approval for just two drugs: Iressa (gefitinib) for metastatic NSCLC and Tagrisso (osimertinib), also for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. In 2016, they received approvals for Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) for COPD and Zoladex (goserelin acetate) for prostate cancer. This totals four FDA approvals—less than half of their stated projections.

The context matters: during this period, the pharmaceutical industry typically saw major companies achieve 1-3 approvals per year, with even market leaders rarely exceeding four. For example, in 2015, Novartis received six approvals, while in 2016, Roche received two approvals, Pfizer received four, and Merck received three—making AstraZeneca's four approvals respectable but far from record-breaking or justifying their initial claim.

The Pfizer takeover backdrop is important: Pfizer's $117 billion acquisition attempt failed in May 2014 after AstraZeneca's board rejected the offer. While the failed deal provided temporary independence, it also created pressure to demonstrate pipeline strength—explaining the ambitious public projections.

AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot, who made these projections, remained CEO throughout this period and ultimately delivered on longer-term growth targets by 2023, though the specific 2015-2016 approval forecast proved inaccurate. The company's reputation was not seriously damaged by the missed projection.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather questioned the realism of AstraZeneca's stated predictions. The author's implicit prediction was that the 8-10 approval target was unrealistically high based on historical precedent.

**AstraZeneca's original predictions:**
• 8-10 drug approvals in 2015-2016 timeframe
• Outcome: Actually achieved 4 FDA approvals (50% of target)

**Author's expressed skepticism:**
• That achieving 8-10 approvals was highly unlikely given historical records
• Outcome: Confirmed correct—no major pharma company achieved this level
• That the announcement was primarily for investor relations and anti-takeover positioning
• Outcome: Appears accurate given the failed Pfizer bid context

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

This article captures a specific moment of corporate posturing during a hostile takeover situation, but the core claim was quickly proven wrong and did not reveal deeper industry trends or long-term shifts in drug approval patterns. While mildly interesting as a case study in pharmaceutical communications, it lacks broader scientific or policy significance beyond the immediate AstraZeneca-Pfizer context.
