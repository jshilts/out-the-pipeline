# Different Screening, Different Thermodynamics? (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief announcement highlights an upcoming webinar hosted by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD) featuring Chris Lipinski, focused on enthalpic and entropic trends in ligand binding and how different screening and discovery techniques might introduce biases. The webinar would explore differences between molecules selected by industry-trained medicinal chemists versus those reported by academic chemical biologists, with CDD claiming to have quantitative data supporting these observed distinctions.

## 2. HISTORY

The webinar and related discussions reflected the emerging recognition in drug discovery that binding thermodynamics—specifically the balance between enthalpic (heat-driven) and entropic (disorder-driven) contributions—could significantly impact drug optimization and success rates. In the years following 2014:

- The concept of "enthalpy-entropy compensation" gained broader attention in medicinal chemistry, with researchers recognizing that optimizing purely for binding affinity without considering thermodynamic profiles could lead to suboptimal drugs
- Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) became more widely adopted in pharmaceutical companies as a tool to characterize binding thermodynamics during lead optimization
- Drug discovery programs increasingly incorporated thermodynamic profiling to improve selectivity and reduce off-target effects
- The distinction between industry and academic approaches to compound selection remained a topic of discussion, though the gap may have narrowed as academic drug discovery centers became more sophisticated

However, the broader adoption of thermodynamic profiling has been gradual rather than revolutionary, with many programs still prioritizing traditional metrics like IC50 and binding affinity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions in the article:**
• That the differences between industry and academic compound selection approaches would be quantitatively significant and measurable
• That thermodynamic profiling would become a more important consideration in drug discovery
• That screening technique biases would be identified and characterized

**Reality check:**
• While thermodynamic considerations certainly gained importance post-2014, they did not fundamentally transform drug discovery workflows everywhere
• ITC and thermodynamic profiling remained niche tools used primarily in larger pharmaceutical companies rather than becoming universally adopted
• Industry-academia differences in compound selection persisted but became less pronounced as academic drug discovery became more translationally focused

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This announcement reflects an interesting period when drug discovery was recognizing the importance of thermodynamic profiling, but the webinar format and limited scope make it more of historical footnote than a landmark event.
