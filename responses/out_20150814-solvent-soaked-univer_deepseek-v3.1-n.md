# The Solvent-Soaked Universe (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Rosetta mission findings showing that Comet 67P contains a variety of small organic molecules, similar to those found in the Murchison meteorite. The author argues against the popular perception of space as mostly barren, airless rocks, pointing to discoveries over the past 30 years revealing extensive liquid water oceans beneath the surfaces of outer solar system moons (Europa, Enceladus, etc.) and active geological processes even on Pluto.

The central thesis is that the universe is abundant with both water and organic chemicals—ethanol, ammonia, acetylene, cyanide, acetone, and other industrial-type compounds—that can be detected through spectroscopy across planetary systems. The author notes that chemistry and physics appear universal, with familiar molecules found throughout space. Based on this widespread availability of organic building blocks and energy sources (light, heat, geological activity), the author speculates that if abiogenesis is at all feasible, life should be common throughout the universe, absent some unknown bottleneck in the process.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent years after this 2015 article have largely validated and extended its core observations about the prevalence of organics and water in the solar system.

**Rosetta Mission Developments:** The mission continued until September 2016 when the spacecraft was deliberately crashed into Comet 67P. Final analyses confirmed the presence of numerous organic compounds including glycine (the simplest amino acid), phosphorus, and complex organic macromolecules. These findings strengthened the hypothesis that comets could have delivered prebiotic building blocks to early Earth.

**Solar System Exploration Advances:**
- **Enceladus:** Cassini's 2015 plume fly-throughs and subsequent analysis revealed molecular hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia in the ocean plumes—chemical energy sources that could support methanogenic life. In 2017, researchers confirmed the presence of complex organic molecules in Enceladus's plumes.
- **Europa:** The Galileo mission (ended 2003) had already suggested a subsurface ocean, but subsequent Earth-based telescope observations and reanalysis of old data provided stronger evidence for water plumes erupting from Europa's surface (2013, 2016, and later observations).
- **Mars:** The Curiosity rover (landing 2012) detected organic molecules in Martian rocks in 2018, and Perseverance (landing 2021) continues to search for signs of ancient microbial life in Jezero Crater.
- **Titan:** Cassini's final years provided more detailed mapping of Titan's methane lakes, and Dragonfly mission selection in 2019 promises rotorcraft exploration of Titan's prebiotic chemistry.

**Exoplanet Research Acceleration:** The transit method and spectroscopic analysis of exoplanet atmospheres have become routine, with thousands of exoplanets confirmed. While direct detection of complex organics remains challenging due to distance, water vapor has been definitively detected in several exoplanet atmospheres, and there is evidence for various molecular species consistent with the article's thesis.

**Origin of Life Research:** Laboratory studies of prebiotic chemistry have made progress in demonstrating plausible pathways for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis under early Earth conditions, though abiogenesis remains incompletely understood. The discovery of ribozymes and continued work on RNA world hypotheses support the general chemical plausibility of life's origins.

**SETI and Astrobiology Policy:** Public and private funding for SETI has increased modestly, with Breakthrough Listen launching in 2015 and continuing observations. NASA's astrobiology program has maintained support for understanding life's origins and distribution.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Several implicit predictions and expectations are found in the article, here evaluated against actual outcomes.

**Prediction:** *The universe is abundant with organic chemicals—ethanol, ammonia, acetylene, cyanide, acetone, ethylamine—across planetary systems (spectroscopic evidence and direct sampling will continue to confirm this).*

- **Outcome:** Confirmed. Subsequent observations have extended these findings. The chemical inventory of comets, asteroids, and planetary atmospheres has been shown to include numerous organic species. High-resolution spectroscopy has identified molecules like benzonitrile in interstellar clouds, demonstrating continued progress in detecting complex organics in space.

**Prediction:** *Outer solar system moons have subsurface oceans that are widespread (the article cites discoveries but expects continued validation of oceans on Europa, Enceladus, and potentially others).*

- **Outcome:** Strongly confirmed. Evidence for oceans on Europa, Enceladus, Ganymede, Callisto, and possibly Pluto has accumulated, with multiple studies concluding that liquid water oceans are common in icy worlds. Plume observations at Europa and detailed analysis of Enceladus plumes have provided direct evidence of ocean material reaching space.

**Prediction:** *If abiogenesis is chemically feasible, life should be common, given the widespread presence of organic building blocks, water, and energy sources (this is presented as a logical inference subject only to unknown bottlenecks).*

- **Outcome:** Not resolved empirically yet, but no contrary evidence has emerged. We have only one example of life (Earth), so this prediction remains speculative. The null hypothesis (life is rare) cannot be disproven until positive evidence is found elsewhere. No unambiguous signs of extraterrestrial life have been detected.

**Prediction (Implicit):** *Continued space exploration will discover more complex organic chemistry, ocean worlds, and geologically active bodies than previously expected.*

- **Outcome:** Confirmed. Pluto was already mentioned in the article, but subsequent discoveries showed Ceres contains organics and possibly a subsurface ocean. Beyond the Kuiper belt, data from New Horizons (Arrokoth flyby 2019) revealed primitive organic material preserved from the early solar system.

**Big Picture Assessment:** The chemical ubiquity thesis has held up very well, with continued discoveries extending our knowledge of organic molecules throughout the solar system and interstellar medium. What remains unanswered is whether abiogenesis represents a high-probability natural process given these conditions, or whether there are indeed critical bottlenecks (biological, chemical, or geological) that make life extremely rare despite chemical abundance.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article correctly identifies a fundamental shift in planetary science—the recognition that organics and liquid water environments are common in the solar system—and clearly articulates the implications for astrobiology at exactly the right time, amid the Rosetta mission's discoveries. It provides an accessible synthesis of observational evidence and makes a defensible, testable inference. While abiogenesis remains an unsolved problem, the article's premise that life will prove common if chemically feasible remains a productive framework for ongoing research. The core ideas have held up well under subsequent developments, and the piece crystallized a scientific viewpoint of lasting importance. The only limitation is that the final inference—life must be widespread—still awaits observational confirmation or refutation.

## 5. ANALYSIS

The author's argument rests on an accumulation of evidence from the Rosetta mission, meteorite analyses, and decades of planetary exploration showing that simple organic molecules and water are widespread in the solar system. This is combined with an implicit Copernican principle—if abiogenesis is chemically straightforward, it should have occurred wherever conditions permit. 

The article's strength lies in its recognition of what we now call the "astrobiological pivot"—the shift from assuming Earth-like life requires Earth-like planets, to recognizing that subsurface oceans and organics-rich environments are common, which expands the search space for life. The core scientific claims have been validated by subsequent research.

Where the argument remains vulnerable is in the unknown probability of abiogenesis itself. The article acknowledges this ("really low-probability bottlenecks") but suggests the burden of proof lies with demonstrating such bottlenecks exist. One could argue the reverse: our sample size of life-bearing worlds remains N=1, so even widespread organic molecules don't demonstrate high abiogenesis probability. The strength of biological evolution once started doesn't guarantee that starting is easy.

From a 2024 perspective, the article appears prescient about the continued discoveries of ocean worlds and organic molecules, but the ultimate question of life's cosmic abundance remains unresolved. The argument's structure is sound—given inputs (organics, energy, liquid water), outputs (life) depend on process probability. We still need either direct evidence of extraterrestrial life or a complete theory of abiogenesis to resolve this. Ongoing and planned missions to Europa, Enceladus, Mars, and Titan are essentially running this experiment.
