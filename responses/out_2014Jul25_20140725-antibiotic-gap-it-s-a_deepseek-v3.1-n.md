# Retrospective Analysis: "The Antibiotic Gap: It's All of the Above" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's 2014 commentary responds to a New York Times article about the shortage of new antibiotics, arguing that the Times piece oversimplified the problem as primarily economic. Lowe contends that the core issue is far more fundamental: **antibiotic drug discovery faced insurmountable scientific barriers, not just market failures**.

The central thesis is that traditional antibiotic discovery approaches were already "played out" by 2014. Large pharmaceutical companies like GSK and AstraZeneca had spent decades and massive resources attempting to find new antibiotics through conventional screening methods and genomic approaches, yet produced "zip." The problem wasn't just that antibiotics lacked profit incentives (which Lowe acknowledges is real - new antibiotics would be reserved for emergencies, limiting profitability), but rather that the scientific well had run dry. The genomic revolution that helped other therapeutic areas had already been tried extensively in bacteria, and failed to deliver new targets. The barriers to entry were extremely high because most reasonable antibiotic mechanisms had been exhausted, and screening efforts overwhelmingly produced either compounds toxic to human cells or ones that hit known targets.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this 2014 article largely validated Lowe's pessimistic assessment, though with some notable developments:

**Continued Market Exit**: Major pharmaceutical companies continued abandoning antibiotic R&D. By 2020, only a handful of large pharma companies maintained active antibiotic research programs. Novartis, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, and others exited the space entirely.

**Regulatory and Market Incentives**: In response to the crisis Lowe described, governments began implementing "push" and "pull" incentives. The U.S. created the CARB-X initiative (2016) to fund early-stage antibiotic research, and the DISARM Act was proposed to change hospital reimbursement. The UK launched a subscription-style payment model (2020) paying for antibiotics based on their value rather than volume. The PASTEUR Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress (2021) to create similar pull incentives.

**Scientific Developments**: The period saw some innovation in alternative approaches:
- **Antibiotic combinations**: Using existing drugs in combination to overcome resistance
- **Antibody-antibiotic conjugates**: Like Merck's Arikayce (2018) for resistant mycobacterial infections
- **Bacteriophage therapy**: Limited but growing clinical applications
- **Narrow-spectrum precision antibiotics**: Targeting specific resistant organisms

**Notable Drug Approvals**: Some genuinely new antibiotics emerged, though slowly:
- Zemdri (plazomicin) - 2018
- Xerava (eravacycline) - 2018  
- Fetroja (cefiderocol) - 2019
- Nuzyra (omadacycline) - 2018

**Company Failures**: Paradoxically, several companies that succeeded in getting new antibiotics approved subsequently went bankrupt or faced severe financial distress - most dramatically Achaogen (2019 bankruptcy) and Melinta Therapeutics (restructuring). This tragically confirmed Lowe's point about broken market incentives.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions:**
- **Unprofitability of antibiotics**: This prediction was validated spectacularly. Multiple companies that successfully developed and gained FDA approval for new antibiotics subsequently went bankrupt, showing that scientific success didn't translate to commercial viability. The "last resort" problem Lowe described is real - doctors do reserve novel antibiotics, preventing the volume sales needed for profitability.

- **R&D barriers**: Lowe's assessment that traditional antibiotic discovery was exhausted proved largely correct. The genomic approaches he mentioned still haven't yielded major breakthroughs. Most new antibiotics approved since 2014 represent modifications of existing chemical classes rather than fundamentally new mechanisms.

- **Business rationale for other therapeutic areas**: His comparison to cardiovascular drugs and HIV was prescient - PCSK9 inhibitors did become major blockbusters as predicted, validating the "innovation for profit" model. The contrast with antibiotics became even starker.

**Less Accurate Elements:**
- **Alzheimer's drug development**: Lowe mentioned Alzheimer's as an area people still pursued despite failures because of potential profits. However, between 2014-2024, Alzheimer's drug development proved even more challenging than antibiotic discovery, with multiple major clinical trial failures (solanezumab, aducanumab's controversial approval, etc.). This comparison wasn't quite as flattering to Alzheimer's research as implied.

- **"Nothing has worked"**: While true that genome-based approaches didn't revolutionize discovery as hoped, some smaller successes did emerge. Discoveries like teixobactin (2015) showed that there might still be novel approaches, even if they hadn't yet translated to clinical success.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 8/9**

This article ranks in the 80-89th percentile for long-term interest and importance. It represents a rare example of scientific journalism that was simultaneously **prescient, nuanced, and willing to contradict prevailing narratives**.

What makes it historically valuable:

1. **Non-obvious insight**: In an era when antibiotic resistance was widely discussed but usually framed as an economic or regulatory problem, Lowe correctly identified that the fundamental scientific challenges were at least as important - a much less popular but more accurate diagnosis.

2. **Detailed understanding of R&D realities**: The article shows deep familiarity with actual pharmaceutical research practices, going beyond surface-level "market failure" explanations. His discussion of GSK's failed efforts demonstrates genuine industry expertise.

3. **Transportable analytical framework**: The distinction Lowe makes between "market-based barriers" and "scientific barriers" proved applicable to many other areas of drug development. Understanding why antibiotics struggled required acknowledging both economic incentives AND scientific difficulty - a lesson applicable to areas like Alzheimer's, ALS, and other challenging diseases.

4. **Historical validation**: The subsequent decade largely proved Lowe right. Today's antibiotic development landscape - characterized by small biotechs, continued struggle, and growing recognition that basic scientific innovation is needed - reflects exactly the challenges he outlined. The fact that PCSK9 inhibitors became multi-billion dollar drugs while new antibiotics led to bankruptcies validated his analysis of different therapeutic areas facing fundamentally different problems.

This article has aged unusually well and represents high-quality scientific critique that remains relevant to understanding biopharmaceutical R&D challenges today.
