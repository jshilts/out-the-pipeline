# You Ask For It; You Get It (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a tongue‑in‑cheek commentary on Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ corporate culture in early 2016.  It notes that Valeant had just announced the departure of its founder‑CEO Michael Pearson amid an accounting scandal that involved “improper conduct” by the former CFO and controller and a “performance‑based environment” that encouraged aggressive revenue‑recognition.  The author strings together a series of flattering press quotes from 2013‑2015 that praised Pearson’s McKinsey‑style management, his massive stock‑based compensation, and a string of more than 50 acquisitions that grew revenue ten‑fold to > $8 billion.  The article ends by warning that such “make‑your‑numbers‑or‑I’ll‑find‑someone‑who‑will” cultures inevitably lead to misconduct and that investors should remember the pattern.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Leadership & corporate identity**  
* **June 2016** – Valeant appointed Joseph J. Papa (formerly of Bausch & Lomb) as CEO; Pearson left the board later that year.  
* **April 2018** – The company rebranded as **Bausch Health Companies Inc.** to distance itself from the Valeant brand’s negative publicity.

**Financial restatements & regulatory actions**  
* **July 2016** – Valeant restated 2014‑2015 earnings, cutting 2015 revenue by about **$1.5 billion** and acknowledging that “improper revenue‑recognition” had inflated results.  
* **2017‑2020** – The U.S. SEC opened an investigation into the 2015 restatements. In **December 2020** Bausch Health settled the SEC’s accounting‑fraud case for **$45 million** without admitting wrongdoing.  
* **2020** – The Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the company with price‑fixing of generic drugs; Bausch Health paid **$45 million** to resolve the matter in **2021**.

**Legal & commercial fallout**  
* Multiple state‑attorney‑general investigations (e.g., New York, Massachusetts) examined Valeant’s pricing of specialty drugs such as **Nitropress** and **Jublia**. Most were settled with modest penalties or required price‑adjustment agreements.  
* The company faced a series of shareholder lawsuits alleging that the 2015 restatements misled investors. Most were dismissed or settled for under **$10 million**.

**Business performance**  
* After peaking at **≈ $260 per share** in mid‑2015, the stock fell to **≈ $30** by early 2017 and hovered in the **$20‑$30** range for several years.  
* Under Papa, Bausch Health trimmed its acquisition pace, divested non‑core assets (e.g., its dermatology business to L’Oréal in 2020), and focused on a “core‑pharma” portfolio (e.g., **Bausch + Lomb eye‑care**, **Dermira**, **Aesthepharm**).  
* Debt was reduced from **≈ $30 billion** in 2016 to **≈ $15 billion** by 2023 through asset sales and a rights offering.  
* By 2023 the company reported **$11 billion** in revenue, roughly 35 % higher than the 2015 figure after restatement, but still far below the growth trajectory promised during the acquisition boom.

**Industry impact**  
* Valeant’s aggressive “price‑inflation + acquisition” model prompted a broader industry backlash, leading to tighter scrutiny of specialty‑drug pricing and more cautious M&A strategies among mid‑size pharma firms.  
* The scandal reinforced the importance of “tone‑at‑the‑top” governance; proxy‑advisor firms (ISS, Glass Lewis) subsequently downgraded Valeant’s governance scores in 2017‑2018.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Pearson would be forced out** – the “make‑your‑numbers” culture would lead to leadership change. | ✅ Pearson left Valeant in **June 2016**; Joseph Papa became CEO. |
| **Accounting misconduct would be uncovered and lead to restatements**. | ✅ Valeant restated 2014‑2015 results in **July 2016**; later SEC and DOJ settlements. |
| **The aggressive acquisition‑driven growth model would be unsustainable**. | ✅ Post‑2016, Valeant halted large‑scale deals, sold off many acquired assets, and shifted to organic growth. |
| **Governance ratings would protect the company** – the article sarcastically notes the “best governance‑risk rating” from ISS. | ❌ Governance scores were later downgraded as the scandal unfolded; the rating did **not** shield the firm. |
| **Stock price would remain high** (implicit in the glowing 2014‑2015 press). | ❌ Shares collapsed from ~ $260 (2015) to <$30 (2017) and have never recovered to pre‑scandal levels. |
| **Valeant would continue to dominate the pharma sector via price‑inflation tactics**. | ❌ Heightened regulatory and public scrutiny curtailed extreme price‑increase strategies; the company rebranded and refocused. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in a high‑profile corporate scandal that reshaped pharma‑industry governance and pricing debates; its mix of contemporary quotes and hindsight makes it a useful case study, though the piece itself is more commentary than original reporting.
