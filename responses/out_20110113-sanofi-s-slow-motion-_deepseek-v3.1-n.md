# Sanofi's Slow-Motion Takeover of Genzyme (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the ongoing acquisition negotiations between Sanofi-Aventis and Genzyme in early 2011. Instead of escalating into a hostile proxy fight, the two companies had moved into direct negotiations to resolve remaining details. The author notes that Genzyme's leadership appeared to have accepted the acquisition reality after failing to find alternative bidders who shared their valuation of the company.

Additionally, the article analyzes the outcome of specific options market bets made the previous summer (2010) regarding Genzyme's stock price. The October $75 call options expired worthless as Genzyme never reached that price, but the January $65-55 put spread also appeared destined to fail since Genzyme's stock had remained in the low $70s.

## 2. HISTORY

The Sanofi acquisition of Genzyme did proceed as anticipated. In February 2011, Sanofi-Aventis announced a definitive agreement to acquire Genzyme for $74 per share plus contingent value rights (CVRs), valuing the deal at approximately $20.1 billion. The acquisition closed in April 2011, creating one of the world's largest biotechnology companies under Sanofi's pharmaceutical umbrella.

Key subsequent developments:

- **CVR Mechanism**: The contingent value rights were tied to Genzyme's multiple sclerosis drug alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), with additional payments triggered if the drug achieved certain regulatory milestones and sales targets. Lemtrada received FDA approval in 2014, activating some CVR payments.

- **Integration Challenges**: Sanofi faced significant manufacturing and quality control issues with Genzyme's rare disease drugs, particularly Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, which had ongoing supply constraints due to production problems at Genzyme's Allston Landing facility.

- **Pipeline Evolution**: Genzyme's rare disease portfolio became a cornerstone of Sanofi's specialty care business. The company maintained Genzyme as a separate business unit initially, gradually integrating it more fully over subsequent years.

- **Long-term Impact**: The acquisition positioned Sanofi as a major player in rare diseases and multiple sclerosis, though integration complexities and manufacturing remediation required significant investment and time.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While the article accurately describes an important pharmaceutical industry acquisition and the market dynamics around it, the content is primarily focused on deal mechanics and options trading rather than the broader scientific or therapeutic implications of the companies involved.
