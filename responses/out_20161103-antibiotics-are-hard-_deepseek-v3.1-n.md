# Antibiotics Are Hard, Continued (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses the ongoing challenge of developing new antibiotics, focusing on Cempra's clinical candidate solithromycin (Solithera), a ketolide antibiotic. At the time of writing, FDA briefing documents indicated the compound showed a worse liver toxicity profile than telithromycin (Ketek), an already-marketed ketolide with known liver damage side effects. The FDA review committee recommended further clinical trials to demonstrate clear superiority over existing therapies, as mere non-inferiority to moxifloxacin for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia was insufficient given the safety concerns. The author notes uncertainty about the molecular mechanisms underlying ketolide liver toxicity and questions whether this antibiotic class can achieve both safety and efficacy, highlighting why new antibiotic development remains difficult.

## 2. HISTORY
**Solithromycin's fate**: In November 2016, the FDA's Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee voted 7-6 against approval, citing liver toxicity concerns. The FDA issued a Complete Response Letter in December 2016 requesting additional safety data. Cempra restructured in 2017 and rebranded as Melinta Therapeutics after acquiring the company. Solithromycin development was ultimately discontinued.

**Ketolide class outcomes**: None of the three major ketolides achieved successful market entry. Telithromycin (Ketek) was approved in 2004 but received black-box warnings and had restricted use due to liver toxicity and other serious side effects. Cethromycin development was also discontinued after insufficient efficacy in clinical trials.

**Antibiotic development landscape**: The period 2016-2024 saw continued struggle to develop novel antibiotics, with many large pharmaceutical companies exiting the space due to economic challenges. Several proposed FDA incentive programs were discussed but implementation varied. Melinta Therapeutics filed for bankruptcy in 2019, though some assets were later acquired. The fundamental scientific challenge of balancing efficacy and safety in antibiotic development persisted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction about needing diverse compounds**: The author suggested that answering mechanisms of toxicity would require "a lot more varied compounds" using approaches like the Myers lab synthesis method. **Outcome**: While structurally diverse compounds remain scientifically valuable, economic realities prevented widespread investment in extensive ketolide exploration after solithromycin's failure.

• **Prediction that solithromycin would face difficulty establishing superiority**: The article noted Cempra would struggle to demonstrate superiority over existing treatments. **Outcome**: Accurate—this proved impossible within the clinical development timeframe and economic constraints.

• **Prediction of ketolide class challenge**: The question whether ketolides "can be both safe and efficacious" predicted ongoing difficulties. **Outcome**: Accurate—the class ultimately failed to deliver a successful therapeutic.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article demonstrated clear foresight about regulatory and scientific challenges in antibiotic development, accurately predicting solithromycin's eventual failure while highlighting persistent structural problems in drug development that remain relevant today.
