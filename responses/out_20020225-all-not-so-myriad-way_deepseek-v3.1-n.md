# All the Not-So-Myriad Ways (February 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article argues that human mental illness, despite appearing infinitely varied, actually follows a limited set of "master templates" or pathological patterns. Drawing examples from familiar dementias—paranoids convinced their thoughts are being read, hoarders crowded out by possessions, erotomanic obsessives fixated on celebrities—the author suggests these represent "variations on the same master templates, differences of degree rather than kind." 

The central thesis proposes that while brain biochemistry is overwhelmingly complex, at a systems level there may be only several broad pathological states the neuronal network can enter, analogous to "local minima on a surface." These states could result from uncorrectable excesses or deficiencies in network signaling, or timing defects in inter-regional processing. Multiple genetic and environmental factors could push the brain into one of these defined pathological "holes," explaining why certain symptom clusters recur while others (like "inverse paranoia") don't seem to exist.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments have provided partial validation of the article's core insight, though with important caveats:

**Diagnostic Systems Evolution**: The DSM-5 (2013) maintained categorical diagnoses but acknowledged dimensional approaches and introduced spectrum concepts (autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia spectrum). The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative launched by NIMH in 2009 pursued exactly the kind of systems-level approach the article envisioned—focusing on neural circuits, domains of functioning, and dimensional constructs rather than traditional diagnostic categories.

**Neuroscience Advances**: Network neuroscience research since 2002 has revealed that brain disorders do involve disruptions to specific large-scale networks. Studies of schizophrenia, depression, and other conditions have identified consistent patterns of dysconnectivity, aberrant network topology, and altered hierarchical processing—validating the "systems level" hypothesis.

**Treatment Outcomes**: Unfortunately, psychiatric drug development remained "a slog" as predicted. Between 2002-2024, major pharmaceutical companies significantly reduced or exited neuroscience R&D due to high failure rates. Few genuinely novel mechanisms reached approval, and most "new" psychiatric medications were reformulations or derivatives of existing classes. Successes like esketamine (2019) targeted known pathways rather than novel network-level mechanisms.

**Real-World Clinical Practice**: Despite research advances, everyday psychiatric practice still relies heavily on the categorical diagnoses and symptom checklists the article implicitly criticized. The translation from network-level understanding to clinical tools has been slow.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions about mental illness and drug development:

• **"Limited number of ways humans go insane" / "several broad pathological states"**: This aligned with later network neuroscience findings showing consistent dysconnectivity patterns in psychiatric disorders. RDoC's dimensional approach partially validated this systems-level thinking. **Assessment**: Partially correct directionally, though the reality proved more nuanced with extensive comorbidity and dimensional variation.

• **"Drug development in the field is such a slog"**: This proved accurate. Between 2002-2024, psychiatric drug development had one of the highest failure rates across therapeutic areas. Many major pharma companies (GSK, Pfizer, AstraZeneca) scaled back or exited neuroscience R&D. **Assessment**: Highly accurate prediction.

• **Mental illness as local minima that multiple factors can push you into**: This anticipated the modern understanding of psychiatric disorders as multifactorial, with many pathways converging on similar network disruptions. Genetic studies later showed extensive pleiotropy (same genes affecting multiple disorders). **Assessment**: Conceptually prescient.

• **The systems-level approach being more tractable than detailed biochemistry**: This proved overly optimistic. While network-level thinking advanced, translating it into actionable therapeutic targets remained extremely difficult. Most approved drugs still target receptors and monoamine systems identified decades ago. **Assessment**: Partially incorrect—the systems approach helped understanding but didn't solve drug development.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates remarkable conceptual prescience about systems-level approaches to mental illness at a time when categorical diagnosis dominated. Its core insights—limited pathological patterns, local minima analogies, and systems-level dysfunctions—have become increasingly central to psychiatric neuroscience. The accurate prediction about drug development struggles adds credibility. However, the article's brevity and speculative nature limit its detailed impact.
