# Trifluoromethylate The Lot of 'Em (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a new chemical reaction method for synthesizing N-trifluoromethyl amines—a class of compounds that were historically difficult to make due to challenging synthetic conditions and limited availability of building blocks. The author, Derek Lowe, highlights that medicinal chemists highly value fluorinated compounds because fluorine and fluoroalkyl groups dramatically alter molecular properties, pulling electron density and increasing metabolic stability due to the strong carbon-fluorine bond. The piece notes that substituting a basic amine nitrogen with a trifluoromethyl group would neutralize the nitrogen's lone pair, fundamentally changing its properties and potentially destroying original biological activity while creating molecules worth exploring for new uses. The reaction was praised for being versatile, tolerant of functionalized molecules, and suitable for late-stage functionalization—qualities that medicinal chemists prize for exploring this previously inaccessible chemical space.

## 2. HISTORY

Between 2016 and 2024, N-trifluoromethyl amine chemistry has developed significantly, though with notable limitations that the article's comments section presciently flagged. The field has grown primarily in synthetic methodology development rather than widespread drug discovery applications.

Several research groups advanced the chemistry: Carreira's group at ETH Zurich continued developing copper-catalyzed trifluoromethylation of amines for alkene synthesis; Besset in France explored nickel-catalyzed approaches; and various Chinese and Japanese groups developed photocatalytic methods. The general approach became broadly described in reviews of fluorination chemistry, though it typically appears as one of several specialized methods rather than a mainstream technique.

The anticipated stability concerns proved real. While some N-CF₃ compounds are stable under physiological conditions, many show thermal lability and hydrolytic sensitivity that limit their utility as drugs. This has constrained widespread adoption in medicinal chemistry programs, though research continues on understanding and controlling decomposition pathways.

Building block availability improved moderately but remained limited compared to other fluorinated reagents. Companies like Fluorochem, Apollo Scientific, and Combi-Blocks expanded catalogs of N-trifluoromethyl compounds, though selection remains relatively narrow and prices elevated compared to standard building blocks.

The prediction that N-trifluoromethyl molecules would need evaluation for new uses rather than as direct analogs of existing drugs proved accurate. Most pharmaceutical applications remained in academic exploration rather than advancing to clinical candidates, with researchers investigating these compounds primarily for their unique physicochemical properties rather than as direct drug replacements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author predicted that trifluoromethylating bioactive molecules with NH groups would "destroy their original activities in most cases."  
**Reality**: This was largely correct. The CF₃ group's strong electron-withdrawing nature typically eliminates or drastically reduces binding affinity when applied to amine-containing drugs, as it fundamentally changes hydrogen bonding and electrostatic properties.

• **Prediction**: The author suggested that making these analogs would leave "completely new molecules worth looking at for other uses."  
**Reality**: Academic exploration continued, but commercial pharmaceutical interest remained limited due to stability concerns and the challenge of finding applications where the unique properties provided sufficient advantage over alternatives.

• **Prediction**: The author anticipated that readily accessible N-trifluoromethyl building blocks would spur exploration of this chemical space.  
**Reality**: Building block availability improved modestly but remained constrained by synthetic challenges and cost, limiting widespread adoption in drug discovery programs.

• **Prediction**: The author expected that reactions with "low barrier to entry" and "tolerant of late-stage functionalization" would enable broad exploration.  
**Reality**: While synthetic methods continued developing, the stability issues and synthetic challenges meant that exploration remained primarily with specialized academic groups rather than becoming routine medicinal chemistry practice.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article represents a moderately interesting analysis of a specific chemical methodology rather than a field-defining breakthrough. While the chemistry was academically valuable and the synthesis challenges legitimate, the stability limitations and narrow pharmaceutical applicability meant that the promise of widespread impact in drug discovery was not fully realized, though the synthetic advances contributed to the broader fluorination toolkit.
