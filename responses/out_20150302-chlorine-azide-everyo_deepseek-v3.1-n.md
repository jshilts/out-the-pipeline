# Chlorine Azide For Everyone (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2015 *Journal of Organic Chemistry* paper that presented a safer method for generating and using chlorine azide (ClN₃), a notoriously explosive and hazardous compound classified by the author as one of his "Things I Won't Work With." The new approach involves in situ preparation of small amounts of chlorine azide in dilute solution with slow release, followed by immediate reaction with alkenes to produce beta-chloro azide products. The authors explicitly warned against isolating the gaseous ClN₃, as they experienced occasional explosions during attempts to transfer it with nitrogen gas into organic solvents. Instead, they developed a procedure where ClN₃ is generated in small quantities in the presence of an alkene substrate for immediate reaction, substantially reducing but not eliminating the hazards. The blog author notes this advancement brings chlorine azide usage into the realm of possibility for synthetic applications, though it would still require careful consideration and good justification.

## 2. HISTORY

Since the article's publication, the use of chlorine azide in organic synthesis has remained a niche area, primarily of academic interest rather than industrial application. The safety improvements described in the 2015 paper did not lead to widespread adoption of chlorine azide chemistry in pharmaceutical or fine chemical manufacturing, where safety concerns continue to limit the use of highly energetic azides.

Research into safer azide chemistry has generally progressed along different pathways, focusing on stable azide transfer reagents, continuous flow chemistry approaches for hazardous intermediates, and development of alternative methods for introducing nitrogen-containing functional groups. The beta-chloro azide products mentioned in the paper represent useful intermediates, but synthetic chemists have generally preferred routes that avoid working with explosive gases.

The field of synthetic chemistry has moved toward more user-friendly reagents and processes, particularly in industrial settings. While academic research groups may have explored the 2015 methodology for specific transformations, there is no evidence that this marked a turning point in chlorine azide's acceptance or led to new pharmaceutical developments or FDA-approved drugs based on this chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article predictions:**
- **Implicit prediction**: That safer handling methods would make chlorine azide more accessible to synthetic chemists.
  - **Outcome**: While the methodology represented a safety improvement, chlorine azide remains a specialized reagent used primarily in academic research rather than routine synthesis.

- **Implicit prediction**: That this advancement would enable more widespread use of chlorine azide in synthetic applications.
  - **Outcome**: The chemistry did not achieve widespread adoption. Synthetic chemistry has largely moved toward developing inherently safer alternatives rather than making dangerous reagents marginally safer to use.

**Bigger picture assessment**: The fundamental challenge with highly energetic azides like ClN₃ lies in their intrinsic instability, not just handling procedures. While incremental safety improvements are valuable, the broader synthetic community has prioritized developing fundamentally safer nitrogen-introduction strategies, such as stable azide surrogates, photochemical methods, and transition metal-catalyzed amination reactions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This represents a moderately interesting technical advance in handling a dangerous reagent, but it addresses a niche synthetic problem without broader implications for drug development, biotechnology, or industrial chemistry. The limited impact over nearly a decade since publication reflects that while technically clever, the approach didn't solve a sufficiently important problem to drive widespread adoption.
