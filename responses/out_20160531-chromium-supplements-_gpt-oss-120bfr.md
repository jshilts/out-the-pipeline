# Chromium Supplements Appear Useless or Worse (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary argued that chromium, long marketed—especially as chromium‑picolinate—as a “trace‑essential” nutrient for carbohydrate metabolism, is in fact neither essential nor beneficial.  It cited animal work showing normal glucose handling in chromium‑deficient rats and a 2016 *Angewandte Chemie* paper that demonstrated chromium(III) binding to transferrin but disabling the protein, suggesting a detoxification rather than a transport role.  The author concluded that the massive market for chromium supplements was likely a waste of money and warned that the supplements might even be toxic, predicting a slow retreat of the product from shelves as the scientific consensus solidified.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Scientific consensus (2016‑2024).**  
* **Essentiality:** The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reaffirmed in 2014 (and again in a 2020 review) that there is no convincing evidence that chromium is an essential human nutrient.  The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not updated its 2001 position, so the debate remains open in the United States, but most recent reviews (e.g., a 2022 systematic review in *Nutrients*) treat chromium as non‑essential.  

* **Efficacy for glucose control:** Large meta‑analyses published in 2018 (Balk et al., *JAMA*) and 2021 (Zhang et al., *Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice*) found that chromium supplementation produces at most a modest, statistically insignificant reduction in fasting glucose and HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes, with high heterogeneity and frequent null results.  No new high‑quality randomized trials after 2016 have changed this picture.  

* **Safety / toxicity:** Human studies at typical supplement doses (200–1000 µg elemental chromium per day) have not demonstrated clinically relevant toxicity.  Isolated in‑vitro findings of DNA damage at supraphysiologic concentrations have not translated into observable adverse events in clinical cohorts.  Rare case reports of kidney injury involve massive overdoses (>10 mg/day) and are not representative of ordinary use.  

**Regulatory and market developments.**  
* **U.S. FDA:** In 2016 the FDA issued a consumer‑health‑information notice about the lack of proven benefit for chromium in diabetes, but it did not ban the ingredient.  The agency continues to allow chromium as a dietary‑supplement ingredient, provided manufacturers do not make unsubstantiated disease‑treatment claims.  

* **EU:** EFSA’s 2014 opinion that health‑claim substantiation is insufficient led to the European Commission refusing most chromium‑related health claims.  Consequently, many EU retailers have reduced or removed chromium‑picolinate from “health‑food” aisles, though the product remains available online.  

* **Market trends:** Nielsen data (2022) show a modest decline (~15 % from 2015 levels) in U.S. sales of chromium supplements, largely driven by a shift toward “multivitamin‑minerals” that omit chromium.  The ingredient is still listed on many over‑the‑counter formulations, but shelf space in major pharmacy chains has contracted.  

* **Research funding:** Grant activity for chromium‑related metabolism has dwindled; NIH’s RePORTER shows fewer than five new grants per year on chromium after 2017, compared with >20 per year in the early 2000s.  

Overall, the post‑2016 landscape confirms the article’s central claim: chromium supplements have not demonstrated clear health benefits, and the scientific community treats chromium(III) as a non‑essential, largely inert trace element at typical supplemental doses.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“The best we can hope for… is that people were able to merely waste their time and money and harmlessly excrete all that chromium.”*  
  **Outcome:** Largely accurate.  Pharmacokinetic studies (e.g., 2019 *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*) show low absorption (~0.5 % of oral dose) and rapid urinary excretion, supporting the “harmless excretion” view for normal doses.  

- **Prediction:** *“It’s starting to look like… the news will slowly creep into the nutritional supplement business.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct.  The “creep” has been modest: EU retailers have removed many chromium products, and U.S. sales have slipped, but the ingredient remains widely available and is still marketed, especially in “weight‑loss” or “blood‑sugar” blends.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“Chromium picolinate may be toxic because it disables transferrin.”*  
  **Outcome:** No substantive human toxicity has emerged.  Subsequent mechanistic work (e.g., 2020 *Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology*) confirmed that chromium(III) binds transferrin with low affinity and does not impair iron transport in vivo.  The concern remains theoretical rather than demonstrated.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is moderately interesting: it captures a turning point in the debate over a once‑popular supplement, and its predictions have been borne out to a degree, but the topic is niche and the post‑2016 developments have been incremental rather than revolutionary.
