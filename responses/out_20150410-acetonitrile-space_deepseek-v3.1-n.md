# Acetonitrile. . .In Space! (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2015 *Nature* paper that detected hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetonitrile (methyl cyanide), and other cyanide-containing compounds in the protoplanetary disk around a young star system. This discovery supported the hypothesis that organic building blocks for life are common throughout the universe, not unique to our solar system. The author contextualizes this finding alongside existing knowledge about carbonaceous chondrite meteorites (like the Murchison meteorite) that contain rich organic compounds, and widespread detection of small organic molecules in interstellar nebulae. The piece argues that since life's basic chemical precursors appear abundant in space, the emergence of life might not be limited by availability of starting materials, though other steps remain uncertain. The author suggests microbial life could be relatively common in the universe while making clear the distinction from intelligent alien life, referencing the Fermi Paradox.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 detection, subsequent years saw significant advances in astrochemistry and the study of prebiotic molecules in space. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which made the original 2015 detection, continued identifying increasingly complex organic molecules in protoplanetary disks and star-forming regions, including glycolaldehyde, ethanol, and other prebiotically relevant compounds.

Rosetta mission data (2014-2016) provided ground-truth confirmation when the Philae lander detected organic compounds including HCN on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, directly validating that such molecules can survive and be delivered to planetary surfaces. Subsequent research confirmed acetonitrile and other nitriles as common constituents in comets and protoplanetary environments.

The field of prebiotic chemistry advanced significantly, with laboratory experiments demonstrating plausible pathways from simple molecules like HCN and acetonitrile to nucleobases, amino acids, and other biological building blocks under conditions mimicking early Earth or icy interstellar grains. These developments strengthened the hypothesis that Earth's organic inventory was supplemented or seeded by extraterrestrial delivery.

NASA's OSIRIS-REx and JAXA's Hayabusa2 missions successfully returned samples from asteroids Bennu and Ryugu (2020-2023), with both containing complex organic molecules including nitrogen-containing compounds, providing further evidence that prebiotic chemistry is widespread in our solar system.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about the implications of detecting prebiotic molecules in space:

• **Abundance of organic building blocks**: The prediction that these molecules would prove common throughout space has been strongly validated. Multiple protoplanetary disks, comets, and asteroids have since been shown to contain similar organic inventories, with ALMA and other observatories detecting dozens of prebiotic molecules across various astrophysical environments.

• **Delivery of organics to planetary surfaces**: While the article didn't explicitly predict this, it implied such compounds could reach planets. This has been confirmed through comet and asteroid sample analyses, and increasingly sophisticated models show organic molecules can survive atmospheric entry and impact delivery.

• **Non-uniqueness of our solar system's organic inventory**: This prediction held up well. Subsequent observations showed similar molecular compositions in multiple young stellar systems, supporting the idea that our solar system's organic chemistry was not exceptional.

• **Microbial life potentially being common**: This prediction remains speculative but has gained support through continued discoveries of extreme environments where life thrives on Earth, the confirmed presence of liquid water on multiple solar system bodies (Europa, Enceladus, Mars), and the growing catalog of potentially habitable exoplanets. However, no extraterrestrial life has been detected, so this remains an open question.

• **Distinction between microbial and intelligent life**: This differentiation remains relevant as SETI and related searches continue without confirmed detections, while the search for biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres has become a major focus of upcoming missions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a significant piece of evidence in astrobiology and prebiotic chemistry at a time when the field was rapidly advancing. While focused on a single discovery, it correctly anticipated broader trends in understanding the cosmic abundance of life's building blocks, and subsequent developments largely validated its key insights about the ubiquity of prebiotic molecules.
