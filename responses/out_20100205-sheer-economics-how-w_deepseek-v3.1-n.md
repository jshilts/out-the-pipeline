# Sheer Economics: How We Got in This Fix (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes a Morgan Stanley investment appraisal advising pharmaceutical companies to drastically cut internal small-molecule research and reallocate capital toward in-licensing external drug candidates. The investment thesis argued that in-licensing could deliver **three times the return on invested capital** compared to internal R&D, primarily because it offloads early-stage risk (pre-phase II projects have <10% market success probability) onto smaller biotech companies and their investors.

The author examines the structural drivers: large pharma's R&D costs had become unsustainably high relative to failure rates, creating compelling economic pressure to externalize research. The piece also challenges the "Evil Clueless MBA CEO" narrative—arguing these decisions reflect rational responses to economic incentives rather than managerial incompetence. Key consequences identified include: continued R&D layoffs at large companies, growth of smaller biotech firms as innovation sources, increased outsourcing to lower-cost regions (China, India), and fundamental reshaping of the pharma industry's innovation model.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Externalization Strategy Played Out as Predicted:**
- **Major pharma companies significantly reduced internal discovery research** between 2010-2020. Pfizer closed its Sandwich, UK research site (2011) and Groton reductions; AstraZeneca cut R&D headcount by ~40% (2010-2016); Sanofi underwent major restructuring. Industry-wide R&D headcount at large pharma declined substantially.
  
- **In-licensing and acquisitions became dominant strategies:** 
  - 2010-2019 saw hundreds of licensing deals and major acquisitions of biotech companies by pharma. Examples: Gilead's $11B acquisition of Pharmasset (2011) brought them sofosbuvir; Roche's continued biotech acquisition strategy (Genentech already owned, but further deals like Spark Therapeutics $4.8B in 2019).
  - Deal values for promising clinical-stage assets reached unprecedented levels, with some pre-commercial acquisitions exceeding $10-20B.

**Clinical Success Rates Didn't Fundamentally Improve:**
- The shift to in-licensing didn't dramatically increase drug approval success rates. FDA drug approvals remained relatively stable (20-60 per year), though the number of new molecular entities fluctuated. The industry continued facing well-documented productivity challenges.
- Promising licensed assets still faced substantial failure—many high-profile licensing deals didn't result in approved drugs (e.g., numerous oncology and Alzheimer's candidates failed in late-stage trials despite promising early data).

**Biotech Ecosystem Grew but Funding Remained Cyclical:**
- The 2010-2020 decade saw robust biotech venture funding and IPO activity, validating the article's thesis that smaller companies would host innovation. However, funding availability remained cyclical—2016 and 2022-2023 saw significant downturns in biotech financing.
  
**Outsourcing to Asia Accelerated:**
- Clinical trial conduct and manufacturing increasingly moved to China and India as predicted. However, cost advantages narrowed over time as wages and infrastructure costs rose in these regions, though the shift created lasting structural changes in pharmaceutical supply chains.

**Policy Developments:**
- FDA created expedited pathways (Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2012), which somewhat addressed the cost-risk dynamic by allowing faster development timelines for promising candidates.
- Drug pricing pressures intensified throughout 2010-2020, creating additional economic pressure on the industry model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Large companies will withdraw from internal small-molecule research and reallocate capital to in-licensing"**: **Accurate.** This happened extensively across the industry—AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Pfizer, Merck, and others significantly cut discovery research while increasing external partnerships and acquisitions.

• **"More people will work for smaller companies"**: **Accurate.** Biotech sector employment grew substantially, particularly in major hubs (Boston, San Francisco, San Diego), though job security remained less stable than in traditional big pharma.

• **"Outsourcing will continue to China/India as long as cost advantages exist"**: **Accurate.** Outsourcing grew dramatically in the 2010s across manufacturing, clinical trials, and some research functions, though cost advantages did narrow over time as predicted.

• **"Internal R&D will get smaller and cheaper"**: **Accurate.** Major pharma companies reduced internal R&D headcount and facilities substantially while shifting toward smaller, more targeted research organizations.

• **"Medicinal chemist's union idea is useless"**: **Accurate.** No meaningful unionization occurred in pharmaceutical R&D, and the geographic mobility of research work made collective bargaining leverage minimal.

• **Risk-adjusted three-times return advantage of in-licensing**: **Difficult to verify empirically.** While the trend toward externalization clearly occurred, precise ROI calculations remain proprietary. The thesis drove behavior, but whether returns actually improved by 2-3x isn't publicly documented.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article correctly predicted major structural changes in pharmaceutical R&D and explained the underlying economic drivers with clear reasoning. It successfully anticipated the externalization trend that dominated the 2010s biopharma landscape, making it highly relevant for understanding the industry's evolution and having lasting importance for appreciating how economic incentives shape innovation models.
