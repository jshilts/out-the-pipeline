# You Guys Don’t Do Innovation. The iPad. That’s Innovative  
**31 Oct 2011**

## 1. SUMMARY  
In this Forbes commentary, Matthew Herper (quoted by Derek Lowe) argues that the kind of breakthrough thinking that produced the iPad is largely absent from modern medicine. He contends that while Steve Jobs could “magically” combine design, engineering, and market insight to create a product that reshaped an industry, the same approach has not translated to healthcare. The piece points to the conservatism of regulators, the fragmented nature of the U.S. health‑care system, and the risk‑averse culture of pharma and biotech as barriers that keep medicine from delivering truly disruptive, consumer‑focused innovations. Herper suggests that without a “Jobs‑style” visionary who can align technology, patient experience, and business models, breakthroughs will remain incremental rather than transformative.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Digital health and consumer devices** – After 2011 the iPad and other tablets quickly entered clinical settings for imaging review, electronic‑health‑record (EHR) access, and patient education. However, adoption was uneven; hospitals that invested early saw modest workflow gains, but the promised “tablet‑driven revolution” in bedside care never became universal.  

**Regulatory environment** – The FDA’s “Digital Health Innovation Action Plan” (2017) and the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) created clearer pathways for software‑as‑a‑medical‑device (SaMD) and for real‑world evidence, easing some of the regulatory inertia Herper highlighted. Still, most high‑risk therapeutics continue to follow the traditional drug‑development timeline.  

**Biotech business models** – The period saw a surge in “platform” companies (e.g., CRISPR‑based firms, RNA‑interference, cell‑therapy platforms). While these entities raised record venture capital, many have struggled to translate platform promise into approved products. As of 2024, only a handful of CRISPR therapies (e.g., exa‑cel, NTLA‑2001) have reached market, and their uptake is limited by cost and delivery challenges.  

**Precision medicine** – Genomic sequencing became routine in oncology and rare‑disease diagnosis, but the impact on overall health outcomes has been modest. The “precision‑medicine hype” of the early 2010s gave way to a more measured view that many targeted therapies improve survival for niche populations rather than delivering broad, iPad‑like disruption.  

**Consumer‑focused health tech** – Wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit) and health‑app ecosystems grew dramatically, providing continuous biometric data. Some data streams have been incorporated into clinical trials and chronic‑disease monitoring, but integration with reimbursement and clinical decision‑making remains limited.  

**Policy shifts** – The Affordable Care Act’s emphasis on value‑based care spurred pilots that reward outcomes over volume, nudging providers toward data‑driven interventions. Yet, systemic change has been incremental; the U.S. still lacks a single, consumer‑centric health‑care platform comparable to the iPad’s market dominance.  

Overall, the post‑2011 landscape shows pockets of genuine innovation (digital therapeutics, gene editing, AI‑assisted diagnostics) but also confirms Herper’s observation that medicine’s structural constraints have prevented a wholesale, consumer‑driven transformation akin to the iPad’s impact on computing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *Medicine will not see an “iPad‑style” breakthrough because of regulatory and cultural inertia.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely accurate. While tablets are now commonplace in hospitals, they have not reshaped the business model or patient experience at the scale of the iPad in consumer tech. Regulatory reforms have eased some pathways, but the core drug‑development pipeline remains unchanged.

- **Prediction:** *Visionary leadership (a “Steve Jobs” figure) is needed to drive health‑care innovation.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. Figures such as Dr. Eric Topol, Dr. Atul Gawande, and entrepreneurs like Dr. Jennifer Doudna have championed disruptive ideas, yet no single individual has unified the industry in the way Jobs did for Apple. Innovation has been more distributed across academia, biotech startups, and big tech.

- **Prediction:** *Consumer‑focused devices will quickly become central to clinical practice.*  
  **Outcome:** Over‑optimistic. Consumer wearables are widely used for personal health tracking, but their integration into routine clinical decision‑making is still limited to specific programs (e.g., cardiac monitoring, diabetes management). Reimbursement and data‑privacy issues have slowed broader adoption.

- **Prediction:** *Pharma and biotech will struggle to adopt rapid, design‑centric product cycles.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Most large pharma still follows multi‑year, phase‑based development cycles. Some biotech firms have adopted “lean” platform approaches (e.g., Moderna’s mRNA pipeline), but the overall industry pace remains far slower than consumer‑tech product cycles.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a clear, early‑stage critique of why health‑care innovation lags behind consumer tech, a theme that remains relevant as digital health, AI, and gene‑editing mature. Its perspective anticipates many of the structural challenges still being debated in 2026.
