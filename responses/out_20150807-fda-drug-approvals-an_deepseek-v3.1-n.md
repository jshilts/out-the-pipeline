# On the FDA, Drug Approvals, and Not Knowing Enough (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes a 2015 FDA white paper titled "Targeted Drug Development: Why Are Many Diseases Lagging Behind," which argued that the main barrier to drug discovery isn't regulatory overreach but fundamental gaps in scientific understanding. The piece focuses primarily on Alzheimer's disease and diabetes as case studies. For Alzheimer's, the author notes the absence of reliable small animal models—despite decades of research, no spontaneous mutant rodents with AD exist, and engineered models suffer from circular reasoning (requiring prior assumptions about amyloid pathways). For diabetes, while better understood than Alzheimer's, the article highlights persistent uncertainties: the triggers for Type I autoimmune responses remain unclear, and the exact molecular pathways causing insulin resistance in Type II are not fully established.

The article contextualizes the FDA report as a defensive response to the 21st Century Cures Act then moving through Congress, which aimed to accelerate drug approvals. It references concerns raised by the New England Journal of Medicine about the risks of relying on underpowered trials and premature biomarkers, while ultimately endorsing the FDA's core message: the bottleneck is scientific knowledge, not regulatory speed.

## 2. HISTORY

**Alzheimer's Disease:** The subsequent decade largely validated the article's skepticism. Between 2015 and 2023, numerous amyloid-targeting drugs failed in Phase III trials, including major programs from Eli Lilly, Merck, Roche, and others. The much-anticipated amyloid cascade hypothesis—the primary target of most drug development—failed to translate into meaningful cognitive benefits despite successfully reducing amyloid plaques. Biogen's aducanumab received controversial FDA approval in 2021 based on biomarker data, but faced widespread criticism over weak clinical evidence and has seen very limited patient uptake. Lecanemab showed modest cognitive benefit in 2022 but with significant safety concerns. By 2024, the field had largely shifted toward exploring alternative mechanisms beyond amyloid.

**Diabetes:** New drug classes emerged that transformed Type II diabetes treatment. GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide demonstrated not only superior glucose control but also substantial cardiovascular and weight loss benefits, becoming blockbuster therapies widely adopted by patients. These drugs worked through mechanisms that were not primarily focused on insulin resistance pathways, suggesting the article's point about incomplete understanding was prescient. For Type I diabetes, no major breakthroughs occurred in understanding autoimmune triggers, though continuous glucose monitoring and closed-loop systems significantly improved disease management.

**21st Century Cures Act** passed in December 2016. Its provisions included increased NIH funding, streamlined clinical trial requirements, and expanded use of biomarkers for approval. While it did accelerate some drug approvals, it also drew criticism for potentially lowering evidence standards. Real-world outcomes were mixed—the act didn't substantially change the fundamental science bottlenecks the FDA white paper identified.

**Regulatory Outcomes:** The FDA did maintain its position as one of the faster drug approval agencies globally. However, the agency faced ongoing controversies over accelerated approvals, particularly in areas like Alzheimer's and oncology, where biomarker-based approvals sometimes preceded confirmatory clinical benefit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The problem is not that the Phase III trial got in the way"**: This proved correct. Between 2015-2024, multiple high-profile Alzheimer's drugs succeeded in Phase II but failed in adequately powered Phase III trials, confirming that the Phase III bottleneck identified real therapeutic failures rather than regulatory obstruction.

• **Amyloid pathway assumptions would face validation challenges**: The article's skepticism about engineered mouse models based on amyloid assumptions was validated. Subsequent human trials repeatedly failed to show clinical benefit from amyloid reduction, suggesting either the animal models were misleading or the amyloid hypothesis itself was incomplete.

• **Knowledge gaps, not regulation, remain the primary bottleneck**: This core thesis was largely confirmed. Despite regulatory streamlining through the 21st Century Cures Act, the fundamental challenge of understanding disease mechanisms remained the main obstacle. Areas with clearer biology (like GLP-1 in diabetes) advanced rapidly, while areas with knowledge gaps (Alzheimer's) continued to struggle regardless of regulatory speed.

• **FDA defensiveness related to 21st Century Cures Act**: The article correctly identified that FDA pushback was tied to Congressional pressure. The agency's subsequent behavior—maintaining approval speed while facing criticism for evidence standards—reflected this ongoing tension between speed and scientific rigor.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated exceptional prescience about the coming decade's failures in Alzheimer's drug development and correctly identified that fundamental knowledge gaps, not regulatory hurdles, would remain the primary constraint on therapeutic progress—a lesson that proved broadly applicable across multiple disease areas.
