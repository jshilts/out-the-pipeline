# Publish On Sight (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a short, cynical blog post commenting on a research paper about ionic liquids on the surface of carbon nanotubes. The author suggests that the paper's subject matter is "editor-bait"—meaning it's designed to appeal to journal editors due to trendy keywords rather than scientific merit. They specifically note that the inclusion of fluorescent glowing BODIPY-laced samples in the graphical abstract would make the manuscript particularly attractive for publication. The tone is critical of how research publication decisions can be influenced by fashionable topics and presentation rather than substance.

## 2. HISTORY
In the decade since this 2014 blog post, several relevant trends emerged in scientific publishing and materials science:

**Publication Trends**: The concern about "editor-bait" and fashionable topics has persisted, with continued discussions about whether trendy research areas (like those mentioned—ionic liquids, carbon nanotubes, fluorescent materials) receive disproportionate attention and funding compared to less glamorous but equally important work. However, the specific paper mentioned does not appear to have had substantial long-term impact based on available citation data.

**Ionic Liquids Research**: Research on ionic liquids continued through the 2010s and into the 2020s, with applications in batteries, supercapacitors, and green chemistry. However, the field did not experience the revolutionary breakthroughs that some early hype suggested, and practical commercial applications remained limited compared to predictions.

**Carbon Nanotubes**: The carbon nanotube field, once extremely hyped in the 2000s and early 2010s, saw more measured development. While scientific research continued, widespread commercial adoption fell short of early expectations, with applications remaining somewhat niche rather than transformative across industries.

**BODIPY Dyes**: BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) fluorescent dyes continued to be widely used in chemical and biological research for labeling and imaging applications, maintaining their status as useful tools rather than transformative breakthrough materials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments, focusing instead on commentary about contemporary publishing practices and research trends.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2/9**

The article addresses enduring concerns in scientific publishing about fashion-driven research and editorial decisions, but its very limited scope and blog-style format make it primarily of niche historical interest rather than substantively important for understanding major developments in biotechnology or materials science.
