# An Odd Paper? (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a peculiar 2017 research paper published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces titled "Earthicle: The Design of a Conceptually New Type of Particle." The paper describes multilayered nanoparticles with an iron core, drawing analogy to Earth's layered structure. What makes it bizarre is its introductory homage to Hermes Trismegistus and alchemical traditions, its extremely long abstract, and its unusual philosophical framing. The authors explicitly state they followed no clinical hypothesis but instead pursued "imaginative play devoid of purpose" based on analogy to planetary formation, anticipating "the inevitability of its therapeutic potentials." The paper presents experimental data on iron/silicate particles and their effects on cell lines, but frames the work as "stochastic similarity between the formation of earthicles in our three-neck flask reactors and the formation of earth-like planets in the Milky Way." The article's author questions whether this crosses into concerning territory that compromises scientific credibility.

## 2. HISTORY

The "earthicle" concept appears to have had minimal to no subsequent scientific impact. A search reveals no follow-up research building on this concept, no FDA-approved therapies or clinical trials, and no adoption in pharmaceutical development. The paper has garnered attention primarily for its unusual presentation style rather than its scientific contributions. Multilayered nanoparticles with iron cores continue to be researched for drug delivery and theranostic applications, but the "earthicle" conceptual framework and its alchemy-inspired methodology have not been embraced by the scientific community.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The authors claimed "the inevitability of its therapeutic potentials" and positioned earthicles as "ultimate drug delivery vehicle – a multimodal, navigable, theranostic 'spaceship' for the next generation of nanoscale biodevices."

• **Reality**: No therapeutic applications emerged. The paper's conceptual framework was not adopted, and no earthicle-based therapies reached clinical development. The prediction was unsupported by evidence and has proven incorrect.

• **Prediction**: The authors anticipated the concept would be "endlessly modifiable in analogy with planets" and that their work represented "the earliest beginnings of the development of the idea."

• **Reality**: The concept did not develop further. While multilayered nanoparticles remain an active research area, the planetary analogy and alchemical framing disappeared from the literature.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article serves as an interesting case study in scientific communication and peer review practices, highlighting how unusual framing can undermine credibility, even with underlying experimental data. Its main relevance is to discussions about scientific publishing rather than the science itself.

## 5. THOUGHTS AND ANALYSIS NEEDING MORE RESEARCH

• What was the peer review process for this paper, and how did reviewers justify its acceptance?
• How has the journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces addressed similar submissions since this publication?
• What were the research team's subsequent publications and whether they continued this conceptual approach?
• How many citations has this paper received and in what context?
• Whether this represents a legitimate but poorly communicated research direction or if concerns about scientific rigor were warranted.
