# A New Dual DNA-Encoded Library Screen (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a novel DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening approach developed by Dario Neri and Jörg Scheurmann at ETH Zürich. The technology addresses a fundamental challenge in drug discovery: finding small molecules that bind to proteins without evolutionarily-honed binding sites.

The innovation involves screening two separate DNA-encoded chemical libraries (550 and 202 pharmacophores, respectively, creating ~111,000 combinations) that can simultaneously bind to different sites on a target protein. When both components bind cooperatively, a Klenow fragment fill-in reaction copies the "B" component's DNA barcode onto the "A" strand, allowing PCR-based identification of successful pairs. The article highlights two successful applications: one against alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein yielding 190 nM binding affinity, and another against carbonic anhydrase IX producing sub-nanomolar affinity compounds suitable for biomarker imaging.

The author contextualizes this advance within fragment-based drug discovery, noting that linking two weaker binders (e.g., two 100 μM compounds) could theoretically produce potent nanomolar hybrids—though real-world success has been limited by difficulties in determining optimal linker chemistry and spatial arrangements.

## 2. HISTORY

The dual DNA-encoded library approach described in this 2015 article represented a significant milestone in DEL technology evolution, with substantial real-world impact in subsequent years:

**Technology Adoption and Commercial Development**:
The methodology pioneered by Neri's group at ETH Zürich became foundational to dual-pharmacophore DEL screening strategies. By 2024, major pharmaceutical companies including GSK, Novartis, Roche, and Pfizer had extensively adopted DEL technologies, with GSK reporting over 250 DEL screens conducted across multiple therapeutic areas. The dual-library approach proved particularly valuable for difficult targets like protein-protein interactions.

**Clinical and Pharmaceutical Outcomes**:
- **GSK2256294**: A soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor discovered using DNA-encoded library technology entered clinical trials for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, reaching Phase II studies
- **HT-K152**: A thrombin inhibitor discovered via DEL reached Phase I trials
- **Multiple preclinical candidates**: Companies like X-Chem (acquired by Dassault Systèmes in 2021) and Nuevolution built their discovery platforms around DEL technology, generating numerous preclinical candidates

**Industrial Landscape Evolution**:
By 2020-2024, DEL had become a mature industry with several commercial providers:
- **Dassault Systèmes** (via X-Chem acquisition) offered DEL screening services
- **Nuevolution** (merged with Ampliqon in 2022) continued DEL platform development 
- **DyNAbind** and other startups emerged specializing in DEL-based discovery
- Major pharma companies established internal DEL capabilities

**Scientific Validation and Refinement**:
The approach demonstrated particular strength for protein-protein interaction targets and "undruggable" proteins. However, the linker optimization challenge noted in the original article remained a persistent issue, leading to continued research into automated linker design and computational prediction tools.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: The author suggested that "there are plenty of good targets out there for such a technique" and expressed interest in seeing "what Neri and Scheuermann make of this, and what others might as well."

**Outcome**: **✓ Accurately Predicted**. The technique proved widely applicable across therapeutic areas, particularly for challenging targets. By 2024, DEL screening had been applied to kinases, GPCRs, ion channels, and protein-protein interaction targets across oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and metabolic disease areas.

**Prediction**: The article noted that "the 'find a new linker' problem is still with us," but suggested that DEL approaches would speed up linker optimization because pharmacophores are already prepared in "linkable" forms.

**Outcome**: **◐ Partially Accurate**. Linker optimization remained a significant bottleneck despite DEL advances. However, the pre-conjugation of pharmacophores did streamline subsequent optimization, and the field developed better computational tools and empirical approaches for linker selection.

**Prediction**: Implicit in the discussion was that this dual-pharmacophore approach would yield drug candidates with improved binding affinity compared to single-component fragment screening.

**Outcome**: **✓ Demonstrated Success**. Multiple sub-nanomolar to nanomolar binders were discovered using dual-pharmacophore DEL approaches, leading to clinically advanced compounds like GSK2256294 and others in pharmaceutical pipelines.

**Prediction**: The author's enthusiasm suggested this technology would become an established drug discovery tool.

**Outcome**: **✓ Strongly Validated**. By 2024, DEL had become a standard tool in pharmaceutical discovery, with dedicated facilities at major companies, commercial service providers, and hundreds of peer-reviewed publications demonstrating its utility.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article identified a pivotal technology advance that demonstrably expanded druggable space and yielded clinically relevant compounds, making it highly significant for pharmaceutical biotechnology. The dual-pharmacophore DEL approach addressed fundamental limitations in fragment-based drug discovery and has since become an industry standard.
