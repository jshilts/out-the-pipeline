# Article Title (Month Year)
And It Goes Like This! (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a personal anecdote about data backup practices in the late 1980s compared to 2007. The author recounts writing their PhD dissertation in 1988 using floppy disks, and experiencing a disk failure that erased two weeks of work. This traumatic event converted them to the "Backup Religion," leading to extreme paranoia where they maintained up to five separate copies of their dissertation in progress - storing them in different locations (lab desk, car, apartment, hood drawer, and coat) to protect against various failure scenarios.

The author also shares a humorous episode where fire trucks passing near the chemistry building at 3 AM triggered anxiety about whether they had turned off their heating mantle and whether their NMR hard copies (which couldn't be digitally backed up at the time) were burning. They ended up calling the lab in the middle of the night but hung up when a colleague answered, too embarrassed to ask if the building was on fire.

The article provides context about the technological limitations of the era - how entire programs could fit on single floppy disks, and how precious physical data (like NMR printouts) couldn't be easily duplicated digitally.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was written in 2007, which represents an interesting midpoint in the evolution of data backup technology. In subsequent years (2008-2024), data backup underwent revolutionary changes that made the author's anecdote increasingly historical rather than topical:

**Storage Technology Evolution:**
- **2007-2010**: External hard drives became mainstream; USB flash drives replaced floppies
- **2010-2015**: Cloud backup services emerged (Dropbox founded 2007, grew mainstream by 2010-2012; Google Drive launched 2012; iCloud 2011)
- **2015-2024**: Cloud-first backup became standard; multiple redundant cloud providers; automatic continuous backup

**Scientific Data Management:**
- NMR and research data became predominantly digital and automated
- Lab information management systems (LIMS) became widespread
- Institutional repositories and cloud storage became standard for academic data preservation
- Scientific journals increasingly required data availability statements

**Impact on Scientific Practice:**
- PhD students in 2024 would find the concept of "NMR hard copies" and floppy-based dissertation work archaic
- Version control systems (Git) became standard for code and documents
- Collaborative real-time platforms (Overleaf for LaTeX, Google Docs) eliminated single-point-of-failure concerns
- Data management plans became required for many funding applications

**The 2-week loss of work** the author experienced in 1988 became increasingly preventable through automated backup solutions that run continuously in the background.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article is retrospective rather than predictive - it's looking back at 1988 from the perspective of 2007. However, it implicitly contains observations about how backup practices had evolved over those 19 years. No direct predictions about the future are made in the text.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While engagingly written as a personal anecdote, this article has limited long-term importance or broad relevance to biotechnology/science policy. It's primarily a nostalgic reflection on outdated technology practices that became increasingly anachronistic after 2007. The comparison to biotechnology in the prompt template appears to be a mismatch - this is essentially a technology/backup anecdote with a chemistry PhD setting, not a commentary on the biotech industry.
