# The Infinitely Active Impurity (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes a common problem in drug discovery: a screening hit that appears active but loses activity upon re-testing with fresh material. The phenomenon is attributed to an "infinitely active impurity"—a trace contaminant in the original batch responsible for biological activity. The author recounts a personal experience where batch-to-batch variability was traced to an unexpected zinc complex, and highlights a Pfizer case study published in ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters. In the Pfizer example, a kynurenine aminotransferase II inhibitor hit was deconstructed to reveal that a trace N-hydroxy impurity was causing the activity through covalent interaction with the enzyme's PLP cofactor. The article notes that covalent inhibitors, while historically viewed with skepticism due to toxicity concerns, were experiencing a "revival of interest," citing Avila Therapeutics' recent acquisition by Celgene as evidence of shifting industry perspectives on irreversible inhibition strategies.

## 2. HISTORY

The timing of this article proved prescient regarding covalent drug development. Avila Therapeutics, mentioned for its January 2012 acquisition by Celgene for $350M plus milestones, exemplified a broader industry shift. Avila specialized in irreversible covalent inhibitors designed to bind selectively to disease-relevant proteins. However, the company's lead programs faced mixed outcomes—while the platform showed promise, challenges with selectivity and unexpected off-target effects limited clinical advancement.

The intervening years validated the article's observation about revived interest in covalent inhibitors. Major FDA approvals followed: Ibrutinib (Imbruvica), approved in 2013 for mantle cell lymphoma, became a breakthrough covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, achieving blockbuster status with multi-billion dollar annual sales and transforming treatment for multiple B-cell malignancies. Afatinib (Gilotrif), approved in 2013, demonstrated efficacy in EGFR-mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer. Osimertinib (Tagrisso), approved in 2015 for EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC, strengthened confidence in covalent approaches by achieving superior selectivity—avoiding wild-type EGFR inhibition while maintaining efficacy. Neratinib (Nerlynx), approved in 2017 for HER2-positive breast cancer, extended covalent applications to dual HER2/EGFR targeting.

By 2012-2020, approximately a dozen covalent drugs received FDA approval across oncology, autoimmune diseases, and other therapeutic areas, establishing irreversible inhibition as a validated drug discovery strategy. The paradigm shift was also reflected in pharmaceutical business development: AstraZeneca's $8.3B acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics in 2013 and subsequent investments in targeted covalent platforms demonstrated sustained commercial interest. However, not all programs succeeded—selectivity remained a persistent challenge, with several candidates failing due to off-target toxicity, validating the article's recognition of historical concerns.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Covalent inhibitor resurgence**: The article correctly anticipated that the "revival of interest" in covalent drugs would continue beyond 2012. This prediction proved accurate, with major drug approvals between 2013-2020 (Ibrutinib, Osimertinib, Neratinib, Afatinib) and sustained industry investment in irreversible inhibition platforms.

• **Toxicity concerns vs. benefits**: The author acknowledged that "increased off-target toxicity has always been the worry with covalent drugs" but noted emerging recognition of potential advantages including "low dose requirements and reduced off-target toxicity." This nuanced view was validated—FDA-approved covalent inhibitors demonstrated that with proper molecular design, therapeutic indices could be achieved, though selectivity challenges persisted.

• **Acquisition trends**: The Celgene-Avila acquisition mentioned in the article foreshadowed ongoing deal activity around covalent platforms, though Avila specifically did not lead to novel approvals as prominently as initially anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captured pharmaceutical research's pragmatic realities—batch variability, trace impurities, and the scientific detective work needed to understand bioassay results—while accurately sensing a shift toward covalent inhibitors that would produce major approved drugs within five years. The post maintains lasting relevance by addressing timeless experimental challenges alongside emerging therapeutic paradigms.
