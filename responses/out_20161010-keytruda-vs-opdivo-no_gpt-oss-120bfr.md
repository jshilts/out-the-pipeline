# Keytruda vs. Opdivo: No Contest (October 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary compared two PD‑1 checkpoint inhibitors—Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo)—as they were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting. Both drugs had already shown activity in previously‑treated non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The author highlighted a head‑to‑head impression:  

* **Keytruda** was tested in a Phase III trial (KEYNOTE‑024) that enrolled only patients whose tumors expressed PD‑L1 on ≥50 % of cells (using Merck’s 22C3 assay). The trial reported higher response rates, longer progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than chemotherapy, with fewer severe adverse events.  

* **Opdivo** was tested in a broader first‑line NSCLC population (CheckMate 026) using a lower PD‑L1 cutoff and a different assay (28‑8). The results showed no OS benefit versus chemotherapy, and the author concluded that Opdivo “does not work” in newly diagnosed NSCLC, while Keytruda “does.” The piece framed the outcome as a consequence of Merck’s biomarker‑driven, conservative trial design versus BMS’s “big gamble.”

## 2. HISTORY  
### Clinical development after 2016  

| Year | Keytruda (pembrolizumab) | Opdivo (nivolumab) |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| **2017** | FDA approval for first‑line NSCLC with PD‑L1 ≥50 % (based on KEYNOTE‑024). | FDA approval for first‑line NSCLC with PD‑L1 ≥5 % (CheckMate 026) **denied** – the trial failed to meet its primary OS endpoint. |
| **2018** | FDA expands first‑line indication to PD‑L1 ≥1 % (KEYNOTE‑042). | FDA approves Opdivo **in combination with chemotherapy** for first‑line NSCLC regardless of PD‑L1 (CheckMate 227 cohort A, 9‑month OS benefit). |
| **2019** | FDA approves pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (KEYNOTE‑189 for non‑squamous, KEYNOTE‑407 for squamous) – now the standard of care for most patients, independent of PD‑L1. | FDA approves Opdivo + chemotherapy (CheckMate 227) and Opdivo + ipilimumab (CheckMate 227 cohort B) for first‑line NSCLC, also independent of PD‑L1. |
| **2020‑2023** | Both drugs receive numerous additional approvals (e.g., adjuvant NSCLC, metastatic melanoma, head‑and‑neck, urothelial carcinoma, etc.). Pembrolizumab becomes the world’s best‑selling cancer drug, exceeding $20 billion in annual sales by 2023. Nivolumab’s sales grow steadily, reaching roughly $6‑7 billion annually, largely driven by melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and NSCLC combination regimens. |
| **2024** | Real‑world data confirm that pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD‑L1 ≥50 % patients yields median OS >30 months, comparable to trial results. | Real‑world data show that nivolumab‑plus‑chemotherapy provides OS benefits similar to pembrolizumab‑plus‑chemotherapy; the choice between the two is now driven by payer contracts, toxicity profiles, and physician preference rather than clear efficacy superiority. |

### Market and business impact  

* **Merck** leveraged the early success of KEYNOTE‑024 to position Keytruda as a “first‑line” immunotherapy leader. The drug’s label expansion and combination approvals propelled Merck’s oncology revenue from ≈ $2 billion in 2016 to > $13 billion in 2023.  
* **BMS** suffered a short‑term setback after CheckMate 026, but quickly recovered by pursuing combination strategies. The company’s 2022 oncology revenue (≈ $9 billion) was heavily supported by Opdivo in NSCLC, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma.  
* Both companies invested heavily in companion‑diagnostic development. The 22C3 (Merck) and 28‑8 (BMS) PD‑L1 assays remain the FDA‑cleared tests for their respective drugs, but cross‑validation studies have shown only modest concordance, reinforcing the article’s point that assay differences matter.

### Scientific and regulatory evolution  

* The field moved from **single‑agent PD‑1 monotherapy limited to high PD‑L1** to **chemo‑immunotherapy combos** that benefit virtually all NSCLC patients.  
* Biomarker strategies have become more nuanced: tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene expression signatures, and multiplex IHC are now explored, but PD‑L1 remains the primary clinical test.  
* No major safety concerns have emerged for either drug beyond the expected immune‑related adverse events; both agents have well‑characterized management guidelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Keytruda would dominate the first‑line NSCLC market; Opdivo would “not work” in newly diagnosed patients.** | *Partial truth.* Pembrolizumab monotherapy indeed dominated the PD‑L1 ≥50 % segment and set the benchmark for first‑line immunotherapy. However, Opdivo later succeeded **when combined with chemotherapy** and later with ipilimumab, capturing a comparable market share. |
| **The advantage stemmed from Merck’s conservative, biomarker‑restricted trial design.** | Correct that the ≥50 % PD‑L1 restriction produced a clear OS benefit. The later success of Opdivo in broader populations demonstrated that the biomarker‑restricted approach was not the only path to efficacy; combination therapy can overcome lower PD‑L1 expression. |
| **Opdivo’s lower PD‑L1 cutoff and assay would render it ineffective versus standard chemotherapy.** | The CheckMate 026 monotherapy trial indeed failed to show OS benefit at the lower cutoff. Yet subsequent trials (CheckMate 227) used **different designs (chemo‑immunotherapy, dual‑checkpoint blockade)** and achieved statistically significant OS improvements, disproving the notion that Opdivo could not be effective at any PD‑L1 level. |
| **Keytruda’s superiority would continue to widen over time.** | Early data (6‑month follow‑up) were accurate; the OS gap persisted in high‑PD‑L1 patients. However, once both drugs entered combination regimens, the efficacy gap narrowed dramatically; head‑to‑head real‑world studies show similar survival outcomes when matched for regimen. |
| **The commercial opportunity could reach $8 billion annually.** | By 2023, pembrolizumab’s annual sales in oncology exceeded $13 billion, surpassing the forecast. Opdivo’s NSCLC‑related sales contributed several billion dollars, confirming the market size prediction. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment in immuno‑oncology, correctly identified the impact of biomarker‑driven trial design, and foreshadowed the commercial stakes; its mis‑prediction about Opdivo’s ultimate fate makes it a valuable case study in how trial strategy and combination therapy can reshape early conclusions.
