# Target (In)validation

## 1. SUMMARY

This June 2015 commentary discusses a review by Ramzi Sweis (AbbVie) in *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* about target validation in drug discovery. The central argument is that medicinal chemistry teams often "blindly accept" biological targets as sound without rigorously testing whether hitting those targets will actually treat the disease. 

The article highlights that definitive target validation before drug development is rare—even seemingly solid genetic evidence like PCSK9 mutations doesn't guarantee therapeutic success. The author stresses that teams should "stress-test" their assays early with whatever compounds they have, rather than waiting for optimal chemical matter. Key recommendations include: testing negative controls (structurally similar inactive compounds), using multiple chemical series when possible, and maintaining organized suspicion of one's own convictions rather than charging ahead with single-minded focus. The piece frames this as expensive but necessary "tuition" in drug discovery, where human nature's tendency toward confirmation bias must be actively counteracted.

## 2. HISTORY

The principles articulated in 2015 have become even more salient in the subsequent decade. PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab and alirocumab) were approved by the FDA in 2015 and achieved substantial clinical adoption for cardiovascular disease prevention, validating that specific target genetically. However, they represent an exception rather than the rule.

The broader pharmaceutical landscape has seen numerous high-profile target validation failures. Alzheimer's disease research exemplifies this—despite amyloid-beta being pursued for decades, therapies like aducanumab (approved 2021) and lecanemab (2023) show marginal clinical benefits at best, suggesting the target may not be as central to disease progression as hypothesized. Cancer immunotherapy provides mixed validation: while PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized treatment, many other immunologic targets failed in clinical trials.

Approaches to target validation evolved technologically between 2015-2024. CRISPR screening became widespread for functional genomics, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) emerged as a way to test target necessity through degradation rather than inhibition, and machine learning began assisting target-disease association predictions. However, these advances haven't eliminated fundamental validation challenges—Phase II clinical trial failure rates remain around 30-40% for target validation reasons.

Regulatory and industry practices evolved toward requiring more robust preclinical validation. The FDA's increased emphasis on biomarkers and mechanistic understanding reflects growing appreciation for exactly the skeptical rigor advocated in the 2015 article. Companies like Vertex demonstrated success through rigorous target validation (CFTR modulators for cystic fibrosis), while others faced expensive late-stage failures by moving forward with insufficient validation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Waiting for better compounds before asking hard questions" as counterproductive**: This prediction proved accurate. The subsequent decade saw increased recognition that deferring difficult validation experiments compounds risk—teams now generally accept earlier stress-testing of assays and programs.
- **"PCSK9 might not recapitulate human knockout mutations in every respect"**: This cautious concern proved overstated for PCSK9 itself (the drugs largely work as intended), but the principle remains valid. Many genetic associations haven't translated into successful drugs—for example, various cancer driver mutations haven't yielded effective therapies despite strong genetic evidence.
- **"Projects charging ahead after in vivo efficacy without multiple chemical series confirmation"**: This continued to be problematic. Between 2015-2024, numerous programs advanced based on single chemical scaffold data and later failed due to off-target effects or target irrelevance.
- **Overall target validation uncertainty increasing**: This didn't happen as predicted. While validation remains challenging, improved genetic tools (GWAS, CRISPR screening, proteomics) provided better pre-drugging target confidence in many cases.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article remains highly relevant because it articulates fundamental principles that continue challenging drug discovery today. The core tension between program momentum and rigorous skepticism remains unresolved, making this guidance timeless even as specific technologies evolve.
