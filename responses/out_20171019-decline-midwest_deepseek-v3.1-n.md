# Decline of the Midwest? (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary by Derek Lowe discusses the funding crisis at large Midwestern public research universities and the broader threat to U.S. R&D capacity. The article highlights how state-level financial problems are undermining historically strong chemistry departments and research programs at institutions like Ohio State, University of Wisconsin, and Iowa State, while private universities and certain well-funded public schools (University of Michigan, University of Virginia) remain on more stable footing. Lowe warns that this decline risks creating a concentration of scientific research in elite coastal institutions (Harvard, MIT, Stanford) and already-established biopharma hubs like Boston-Cambridge, leaving entire regions without the technology-based economic engines that universities and their spin-offs provide. The piece emphasizes that this represents a state-versus-private funding breakdown rather than purely a Midwest-versus-coasts issue, with California's university system also facing similar pressures. Lowe argues that maintaining geographic diversity in research capacity is crucial for national scientific progress, as industrial R&D has already shown concerning concentration patterns.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in this 2017 article proved prescient, as the subsequent years saw continued erosion of public university funding and increased geographic concentration of biotechnology and research activity. Between 2017-2024, Midwestern public universities faced mounting financial pressures, though the outcomes varied significantly by institution. The University of Wisconsin system, specifically mentioned in the article for dropping out of NSF's top five rankings, continued to face state budget constraints and legislative challenges that impacted research capacity and faculty retention. Ohio State maintained significant research activity but struggled with the same state funding instability the article highlighted.

The biopharma concentration Lowe observed in Cambridge/Boston intensified dramatically. The Boston-Cambridge corridor solidified its position as the world's leading biotech hub, with the Kendall Square area alone housing hundreds of biopharma companies by 2024. However, this concentration exacerbated the very regional disparities Lowe warned about. Smaller biotech hubs did emerge in cities like Indianapolis (Eli Lilly anchored), St. Louis (Cortex Innovation Community), and Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, but these remained secondary to the dominant Boston-San Francisco axis.

The trend toward geographic R&D concentration in biotechnology accelerated. Major pharmaceutical companies continued consolidating research operations into flagship facilities in Cambridge, San Francisco, San Diego, and a few other coastal locations. Pfizer's decision to move its headquarters from New York to New York highlighted this pattern of concentration into elite biotech ecosystems. While some Midwestern institutions maintained strong research programs—particularly in agricultural biotechnology, certain engineering fields, and specialized areas—the overall shift toward coastal concentration of high-impact life sciences research continued.

The COVID-19 pandemic from 2020-2022 paradoxically both highlighted the importance of distributed R&D capacity (as supply chain vulnerabilities became apparent) while further accelerating geographic concentration, as funding flows increasingly targeted established hubs with proven rapid-response capabilities. Federal research funding through agencies like NIH continued showing geographic bias toward established elite institutions, though some initiatives attempted to broaden distribution.

Midwestern universities responded through various strategies: forming regional consortia to pool resources, increasing industry partnerships, and focusing on specialized niches where they could maintain competitiveness despite funding challenges. However, the fundamental disparity between public university funding models and the resources available to private institutions and well-funded state schools (like the University of Michigan) persisted and in many cases widened.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Midwestern public universities will continue declining relative to private institutions and well-funded public schools**

*Outcome:* Mixed but generally accurate. While complete collapse was avoided, the relative position of many Midwestern public universities did decline. Faculty poaching continued, with talent migration toward better-funded institutions. However, some schools like the University of Michigan and Purdue managed to maintain strong positions through aggressive fundraising and strategic partnerships.

**Prediction: Geographic concentration of biopharma R&D will continue, creating regional economic disparities**

*Outcome:* Highly accurate. The Boston-Cambridge corridor became even more dominant, and biopharma consolidation into a few major hubs (Boston, San Francisco, San Diego, Research Triangle) accelerated. This created exactly the type of "winners and losers" regional dynamic Lowe warned about.

**Prediction: This concentration pattern will represent the "worst of both worlds"—declining regions lose R&D capacity while no new research universities emerge to replace them**

*Outcome:* Accurate. No significant new research universities emerged in affected regions to compensate for declining capacity. The startup ecosystem Lowe mentioned as an alternative for industrial research did enable some geographic diversification, but university research remained subject to the concentration forces he identified.

**Warning: Scientific research may concentrate primarily in elite coastal institutions (Harvard, Stanford, MIT)**

*Outcome:* Partially realized. While elite institutions did capture disproportionate share of federal funding and high-impact research, Midwestern and other regional universities maintained research programs—just at reduced scale and often in more specialized areas. The concentration was more pronounced in cutting-edge biotechnology and certain fields than across all scientific disciplines.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates clear prescience about important structural trends affecting U.S. research capacity and biotechnology industry geography. While focused on a specific concern about Midwestern universities, it identified broader issues of funding models and geographic concentration that had significant implications for how scientific research and biopharma R&D actually developed through 2024. The piece correctly anticipated that these dynamics would affect both academic research distribution and economic development patterns. However, it doesn't reach the highest interest tier because some of the predicted consequences—while real—didn't reach the most catastrophic levels initially feared, and the piece's narrow focus on the Midwest specifically rather than on the broader structural issue limits its broader applicability.
