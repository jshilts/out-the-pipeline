# Return of Neowater (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a scientific commentary responding to claims made about "Neowater," a purported nanotech-modified water product marketed by the company DoCoop. The author, writing as a chemist, engages with a company representative who appeared in earlier comment threads defending Neowater's validity. 

The article takes a skeptical but open-minded approach, acknowledging that water does exhibit different properties near solid interfaces, and that nanoscale particles could theoretically propagate such interfacial effects throughout bulk water. However, rather than dismissing the claims outright, the author poses six specific, testable physicochemical questions that would need to be answered to validate Neowater's purported properties. These questions address colligative properties (boiling point elevation, freezing point depression), vapor pressure deviations from Raoult's law, surface tension, electrical conductivity, reaction kinetics for standard chemical transformations, and the feasibility of preparing deuterated Neowater for NMR studies of biomolecules.

## 2. HISTORY
After the 2006 publication of this article, Neowater and similar "nanostructured water" products largely failed to gain scientific credibility or commercial traction. DoCoop's claims about Neowater being a fundamentally different form of water with enhanced properties for biological applications did not withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny.

No peer-reviewed studies emerged demonstrating that Neowater exhibited the anomalous physicochemical properties that would distinguish it from regular water containing nanoparticles. The nanotechnology boom of the mid-2000s, while producing legitimate advances in areas like drug delivery and materials science, also generated numerous questionable products making extraordinary claims about water modification - a category that Neowater appeared to fall into.

The company DoCoop does not appear to have achieved significant market presence or scientific acceptance for Neowater technology. No FDA-approved drugs or medical devices based on Neowater reached the market, nor did the technology become adopted in pharmaceutical manufacturing or biotechnology research despite claims about its benefits for biomolecules.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made no explicit predictions about future developments. However, its implicit expectations and challenges can be evaluated:

• **Scientific validation challenge**: The author implicitly predicted that rigorous physicochemical testing would either validate or debunk Neowater's claims. **Outcome**: No subsequent scientific literature emerged supporting Neowater's extraordinary properties through the types of measurements proposed.

• **Biomolecular applications**: The article suggested that if Neowater were genuine, it could have interesting applications for studying protein conformations via NMR. **Outcome**: No credible scientific literature appeared demonstrating such applications, suggesting the technology did not deliver on its promises for biomolecular research.

• **Commercial viability**: While not stated explicitly, the tone suggested skepticism about whether Neowater represented a genuine technological advance versus marketing claims. **Outcome**: Neowater failed to achieve market significance or scientific acceptance.

• **Nanotechnology credibility**: The article appeared during a period of both legitimate nanotechnology development and extravagant claims. **Outcome**: The nanotechnology field matured with more rigorous standards, while products making unsupported claims like Neowater were largely discredited or disappeared from the market.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This article is moderately interesting as an example of scientific skepticism and the importance of rigorous testing for extraordinary claims, but it addresses a fringe technology that proved insignificant. Its value lies primarily in the methodological approach to evaluating controversial scientific claims rather than the subject matter itself.
