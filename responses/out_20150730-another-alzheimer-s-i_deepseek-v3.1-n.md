# Another Alzheimer's IPO (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary criticizes the impending IPO of vTv Therapeutics, a company pursuing Alzheimer's disease treatment through azeliragon (formerly PF-04494700), a discarded Pfizer drug candidate targeting the RAGE receptor. The article highlights concerning Phase II trial results where a 20mg/day dose caused acute cognitive worsening and was stopped by the Data Monitoring Committee, while a 5mg/day dose showed a statistically significant 3.1-point benefit on the ADASCog scale but without power for secondary endpoints. The author expresses strong skepticism about the compound's viability due to a seemingly narrow therapeutic window, questioning the leadership's pharmaceutical expertise—particularly that of chairman Jeff Kindler, Pfizer's controversial former CEO—and considering the drug a "longshot longshot" despite vTv's rebranding from TransTech Pharma to position itself as an Alzheimer's therapy company.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's author filed this one in the "told you so" category—there are few long-odds bets quite as long as an Alzheimer's trial built around recycled assets and eyebrow-raising secondary claims:

- **Azeliragon's clinical trajectory**: vTv initiated a pivotal Phase III trial, STEADFAST, which **failed** in 2018 and **again** in 2020, effectively ending the program without ever demonstrating efficacy or a viable path to approval; the signals flagged in 2015 did not mature into a medicine.
- **vTv's pivot and struggles**: Without azeliragon, the firm struggled to advance its remaining pipeline, including the TTP339 diabetes asset referenced in the article, and turned to repurposing and reformulating earlier compounds. No approved therapies emerged from its legacy TransTech programs.
- **RAGE as a target**: More broadly, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts did not break through as a validated therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. Neither academic follow-up nor industry investment produced successful late-stage candidates, and many groups moved away from RAGE in the post-2015 period.
- **Investor outcomes**: vTv's valuation was volatile. After listing amid considerable hype in 2015, the stock declined in later years as STEADFAST failed, and the company's strategic redirection never yielded an approved drug.
- **Who ran what**: The piece's pointed concern about leadership (Kindler as chair and a CEO with non-pharma experience) proved largely predictive of the difficulties in steering a high-risk program under these conditions.
- **Broader context**: Around the same period, other Alzheimer's candidates with better-resourced backing also saw pivotal failures, illustrating both the field's paucity of validated targets and the reality that Phase II signals—especially when coupled with safety red flags—often do not replicate at scale.

In short, the program ended where it likely belonged: discontinued after confirmatory trials. The arc from Pfizer discard to vTv IPO yielded no therapeutics, a common but costly pattern in neurodegeneration drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Main prediction**: The author characterized azeliragon as a "longshot longshot" with a tight therapeutic window and expressed skepticism that it would succeed.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. The Phase III STEADFAST trials failed in 2018 and again in 2020, confirming the doubts about viability and the compound's narrow margin between ineffective and harmful doses.

- **Implicit prediction about expertise**: The article questioned whether leadership—particularly Pfizer's former CEO Jeff Kindler as chairman and a CEO without pharmaceutical R&D experience—could successfully develop such a challenging compound.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Drug development requires deep, specialized expertise, and while leadership changes occurred over time, the company was unable to advance its programs to approval under the leadership structure referenced here.

- **Implicit prediction about the IPO**: The piece viewed vTv's rebranding and public offering with significant skepticism, suggesting investors might be acquiring a highly speculative, discarded asset.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Following the STEADFAST failures, the company's valuation and pipeline never met the initial IPO ambitions, aligning with the author's caution against assuming that discarded Big Pharma assets are hidden gems.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This piece underscores how skeptical clinical and strategic analysis, combined with an understanding of recycled-asset IPOs, can identify high-risk ventures early; it has niche but durable relevance for investors and drug developers weighing Phase II signals.
