# Article Title (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a landmark paper on fragment-based chemogenomics conducted in whole cells, representing a collaboration between Scripps, University of Lausanne, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the Salk Institute. The research employed a photoaffinity/click-labeling approach using 14 chemical fragments with diazirine-alkyne tags to covalently label proteins within living HEK293T cells upon UV exposure. Using quantitative SILAC mass spectrometry, the team mapped over 2,000 fragment-binding proteins, with only 17% having known ligands - highlighting the vast unexplored "ligandability" of the human proteome.

The methodology enabled precise identification of binding sites and demonstrated that each fragment exhibited distinct protein labeling profiles. The researchers successfully validated the approach by developing chemical probes for previously "undruggable" targets including enzyme PTGR2 and transporter SLC25A20. Most remarkably, they extended the technique to phenotypic screening using 465 elaborated compounds in an adipocyte differentiation assay, ultimately identifying PGRMC2 as a novel target for a compound that promotes adipogenesis through gain-of-function mechanisms rather than inhibition.

## 2. HISTORY

Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) and chemoproteomics have seen substantial advancement since 2017, though progress has been more incremental than revolutionary. The specific targets highlighted in the paper provide a useful case study of the field's trajectory:

**PTGR2 (Prostaglandin Reductase 2)**: This enzyme has remained relatively niche in drug discovery. No FDA-approved drugs targeting PTGR2 have emerged, though research continues into its role in inflammatory pathways. The lack of therapeutic validation suggests this target may not have panned out as a major drug discovery avenue.

**SLC25A20 (Mitochondrial Carnitine/Acylcarnitine Transporter)**: This transporter has gained more attention, particularly in metabolic disorders and rare diseases. However, developing small-molecule modulators for solute carriers has proven notoriously difficult, and no SLC25A20-targeted therapies have reached FDA approval. The challenge of drugging transporters remains a significant bottleneck.

**PGRMC2 (Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 2)**: This target has garnered increasing interest in cancer research, particularly breast and ovarian cancers, as well as metabolic diseases. Research has implicated PGRMC2 in cytochrome P450 interactions and steroid signaling, but selective small-molecule probes remain elusive. No PGRMC2-targeted drugs have advanced to clinical approval.

**Bristol-Myers Squibb's Involvement**: As a major collaborator, BMS's engagement suggests pharmaceutical industry interest in chemoproteomics platforms, but the company has not prominently featured this specific methodology in its subsequent drug development programs that reached market approval.

The broader chemoproteomics field has evolved significantly, with improved photoaffinity probes, quantitative mass spectrometry methods, and integration with machine learning. However, the promise of systematically drugging the "undruggable" proteome has faced the harsh realities of medicinal chemistry - many targets have proven less tractable than hoped, and the complexity of cellular systems continues to challenge straightforward interpretation of fragment binding data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions about the future impact of this technology:

• **"Fragment-based screens and phenotypic screening are two worlds that never intersect, but here is the pathway between them"** - This integration has occurred but not at the revolutionary scale predicted. While fragment-based approaches have gained traction, the seamless marriage with phenotypic screening remains challenging due to issues with fragment cell permeability, target engagement validation, and the complexity of cellular context.

• **"This is one of the most interesting, useful, encouraging and thought-provoking chemical biology papers I've ever seen"** - The paper indeed became highly influential in chemical biology circles, with over 200 citations and spawning numerous follow-up studies. However, its practical impact on drug discovery has been more modest than this enthusiastic prediction suggested.

• **Implicit prediction that the identified targets (PTGR2, SLC25A20, PGRMC2) would yield drug discovery programs** - Only PGRMC2 has seen sustained interest, primarily in academic settings. None have led to clinical candidates, reflecting the difficulty of translating chemical probe targets into viable therapeutics.

• **"Huge amount of useful research" pathway opened** - Chemoproteomics has indeed expanded as a field, with improved methodologies and broader adoption in both academia and industry. However, the systematic drugging of the proteome remains aspirational rather than realized, with most successful applications still focusing on traditional target classes.

• **"Versatility and scope of chemical proteomics for accelerating the discovery of small-molecule probes"** - While the technique has become a valuable tool in specialized laboratories, it has not fundamentally transformed drug discovery timelines or success rates. The complexity of cellular systems, challenges in target validation, and difficulties in fragment-to-drug optimization have limited widespread adoption.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This represents an important methodological advance in chemical biology that successfully bridged fragment screening and phenotypic approaches. While the specific targets haven't yielded breakthrough drugs, the conceptual framework has influenced chemoproteomics development, though the revolutionary impact on drug discovery predicted hasn't fully materialized.
