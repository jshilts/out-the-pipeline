# Voodoo Nominations (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article characterizes protein and small-molecule crystallization as a poorly understood, highly empirical "black art" in chemistry, likening it to voodoo. It highlights the immense parameter space researchers must explore: solvents and solvent mixtures, temperature profiles, concentrations, stirring rates, vessel materials, and trace impurities—any of which can make or break crystal formation. The author cites fructose, historically known as the "uncrystallizable sugar," which required brute-force trial and error over decades and was eventually nucleated by a crystal of pentaerythritol, illustrating the unpredictable, non-rational nature of the field.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years since 2015, protein crystallization and structure determination have continued to advance through a combination of traditional methods and accelerating technologies. Key developments include:

- Computational and physics-based methods have seen wider application but remain limited for practical crystal prediction, especially for high-value polymorphs; empirical screens and fragment-based approaches still dominate early discovery.
- AlphaFold (2020) and related AI tools dramatically improved protein structure prediction, reducing—but not eliminating—the need for experimental structures to guide molecular design and optimization.
- AI-guided crystallization platforms and automated laboratory systems (e.g., Berkeley Lights, Gingko Bioworks' infrastructure) have scaled empirical screening, though the fundamental unpredictability remains.
- Polymorph control remains a critical hurdle for small-molecule drugs, with late-appearing forms sometimes derailing development timelines or requiring formulation changes.
- High-throughput crystallization pipelines in structural genomics consortia and pharma are now standard, reducing time to structure in straightforward cases, but difficult targets continue to require extensive screening and domain expertise.
- Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a mature alternative for many protein targets that resist crystallization, leading to many structures without crystals; its adoption has changed, but not eliminated, the role of crystallography. 

Overall, crystallization has become more automated and higher-throughput, but the core challenge of rational prediction remains largely unsolved. Success still depends heavily on empirical optimization and operator experience.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not articulate explicit forward-looking predictions. It frames crystallization as a persistently empirical, non-rational practice ("voodoo") rather than forecasting specific breakthroughs. If anything, the implicit expectation was that crystallization would remain a "black art," and in practical settings this has largely held true despite advances in parallel technologies and automation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captures an enduring, high-stakes bottleneck in drug discovery and structural biology, resonating with practitioners and remaining relevant almost a decade later. It aligns with subsequent developments in which automation and AI improved throughput but did not fully rationalize crystal and polymorph prediction.
