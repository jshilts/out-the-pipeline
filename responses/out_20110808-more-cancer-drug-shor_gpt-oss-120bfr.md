# More On Cancer Drug Shortages (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post revisits a June‑2011 piece on the growing scarcity of injectable oncology medicines in the United States. It argues that the problem is multi‑factorial, citing regulatory bottlenecks, price‑control mechanisms, and the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA). The MMA forced Medicare to reimburse physicians at a drug’s “actual average selling price” (ASP) plus a 6 % handling fee and capped ASP increases at 6 % every six months.  

According to the author, these caps blunt the profit incentive for generic manufacturers once a cancer drug goes off‑patent and its price collapses (often > 90 %). When a shortage emerges, manufacturers cannot raise prices enough to attract new production capacity, so they may abandon the low‑margin product in favor of more lucrative drugs. The piece concludes that the only durable fix would be to make the production of generic cancer drugs financially attractive, a politically difficult proposition because the U.S. already enjoys relatively low generic prices.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2011 regulatory response  
* **2012–2014 – FDA Drug Shortage Task Force** – The FDA formalised a “Drug Shortage Task Force” (DSTF) in 2012 and issued guidance (2014) urging manufacturers to notify the agency earlier of potential supply interruptions.  
* **2015 – FDA’s “Drug Shortage Mitigation” initiatives** – The agency began publishing a public “Drug Shortage Database” (updated weekly) and launched a voluntary “Drug Shortage Mitigation” program that offers expedited review for shortage‑relief submissions.  
* **2018 – FDA’s “Drug Shortage Prevention” plan** – A multi‑year strategy emphasised better forecasting, increased inspections of overseas facilities, and incentives for “critical” oncology injectables.  
* **2020 – COVID‑19 pandemic** – The pandemic temporarily amplified shortages (e.g., vincristine, paclitaxel) due to raw‑material constraints, prompting the FDA to issue emergency guidance and to expand the “Drug Shortage Task Force” charter.  

Overall, the number of reported oncology drug shortages peaked around 2012–2014 (≈ 30 % of injectable chemotherapies) and has modestly declined since, but shortages remain a persistent issue. The FDA’s database still lists recurring gaps for agents such as methotrexate, 5‑fluorouracil, and several monoclonal antibodies.

### Pricing and profit‑margin policies  
* **MMA’s ASP cap** – The 6 % semi‑annual ASP ceiling remains in force. No major legislative amendment has lifted it for generics.  
* **2018 – Medicare Part D Inflation Rebates** – Targeted brand‑name drugs; generic oncology agents were largely untouched.  
* **2022 – Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)** – Introduced mandatory price negotiations for a limited set of high‑cost brand drugs (starting 2026) and inflation rebates, but it does **not** apply to generic chemotherapy agents.  
* **2022 – CREATES Act** – Aimed to improve the flow of “samples” to generic manufacturers, thereby fostering competition, but it does not directly raise profit margins.  
* **2023 – GDUFA II (Generic Drug User Fee Amendments)** – Provided additional fees to fund FDA inspections of overseas facilities, indirectly supporting supply‑chain reliability but not profitability.  

### Market outcomes for generic oncology drugs  
* **Continued low margins** – Generic injectable chemotherapies still operate on thin margins (often < 5 % net). Many manufacturers have exited or reduced capacity, citing the ASP cap and volatile raw‑material costs.  
* **Consolidation** – The generic oncology market has consolidated; a handful of large firms (e.g., Teva, Mylan, Fresenius Kabi) now dominate production of many high‑volume agents.  
* **Limited new entrants** – Despite the CREATES Act, the number of new generic entrants for complex injectables has risen only modestly (≈ 10 % increase in NME filings 2015‑2023).  

### Real‑world impact on patients  
* **Clinical delays** – Oncology clinics report occasional treatment postponements when a key drug (e.g., carboplatin) is unavailable, leading to protocol deviations and, in rare cases, suboptimal outcomes.  
* **Cost shifting** – Hospitals sometimes purchase “shortage‑price” drugs at higher than ASP rates under the 340B program or via “compounding” arrangements, passing higher costs to insurers and patients.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2011 post | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Making generic cancer drug production more profitable would resolve shortages.** | Profitability has **not** been substantially improved. The ASP cap remains, and while the FDA has introduced supply‑chain incentives, generic oncology margins are still low. Shortages have **decreased modestly** but persist, indicating the prediction was only partially correct. |
| **Price controls and regulatory factors are the primary drivers of shortages.** | Evidence supports that **both** factors matter. The ASP cap limits revenue, and regulatory delays (e.g., lengthy FDA approvals for new manufacturers) have contributed to supply gaps. However, additional contributors—global raw‑material shortages, manufacturing concentration, and pandemic‑related disruptions—have also become significant. |
| **A political solution to raise generic drug profits would be difficult.** | This proved accurate. Legislative attempts (CREATES Act, GDUFA II) have focused on competition and safety rather than profit increases. No major bill has lifted the ASP cap for generics, reflecting the political resistance the author anticipated. |
| **Shortages would be alleviated once the market adjusts after a drug goes generic.** | The market adjustment often leads to a **sharp price drop**, but the subsequent low margins have **not** reliably attracted new manufacturers, so the expected rebound in supply has been limited. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article touches on a concrete, enduring problem (oncology drug shortages) and links it to a specific policy (the 2003 Medicare ASP cap). Its analysis remains relevant to current debates about drug pricing and supply‑chain resilience, though the piece is brief and lacks detailed data.
