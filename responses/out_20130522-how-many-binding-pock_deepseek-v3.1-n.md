# How Many Binding Pockets Are There?
## May 2013

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article discusses a PNAS paper by Jeffrey Skolnick and Mu Gao at Georgia Tech addressing a fundamental question in biochemistry: how many distinct small-molecule binding pockets exist across proteins. The article frames this question within two competing theories of protein evolution. The "inherent functionality model" posits that binding pockets are natural consequences of protein folding, with early proteins having primitive, nonspecific binding capabilities that evolution refined. The alternative "acquired functionality model" suggests early proteins were more spherical with rare binding events, making pocket formation itself the key evolutionary development.

The Skolnick study computationally generated artificial proteins made entirely of poly-leucine (the ART library), modeling them after known protein structures from the PDB. Despite lacking functional side chains, these artificial proteins exhibited small-molecule binding pockets that aligned well with those in natural proteins. The authors estimated a surprisingly small number—around 500—distinct binding pocket types exist.

The article's author, a medicinal chemist, expresses skepticism about both the methodology and the specific estimate of 500 pockets. While acknowledging that binding pocket diversity is finite, they argue the number is likely larger than proposed. The author particularly objects to the paper's suggestion that drug discovery operates under naive "one molecule-one target" assumptions, arguing that polypharmacology and off-target effects are well-recognized challenges in pharmaceutical research.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, research on binding pocket evolution and drug promiscuity has evolved significantly, validating some of the core insights while refining others:

**Computational and Structural Biology Advances**: Subsequent research has largely supported the general principle that binding pockets can emerge from fundamental protein structural principles rather than requiring elaborate evolutionary design. Studies using more sophisticated computational approaches, including deep learning methods like AlphaFold, have reinforced that protein structure space is more constrained than sequence space, supporting the idea of limited pocket diversity.

**Polypharmacology Recognition**: The article's dismissal of "one molecule-one target" as a straw man argument proved prescient. By the mid-2010s, systematic drug profiling studies (such as those using kinome-wide screens) routinely demonstrated that most drugs interact with multiple targets. This recognition led to more sophisticated approaches in drug discovery, including designed polypharmacology for complex diseases and better computational prediction of off-target effects.

**Drug Development Implications**: The prediction of inherent binding promiscuity has had concrete impacts on pharmaceutical practice. Systematic off-target screening became standard practice, and the concept informed the development of safety pharmacology panels that specifically test for binding to problematic targets like hERG, various CYP enzymes, and others mentioned in the article. This has led to both improved drug safety and more sophisticated understanding of drug mechanisms.

**Evolutionary Biology**: Research on protein evolution has increasingly recognized that functional convergence through structural similarity is more common than previously appreciated. Studies of extremophile proteins and artificial protein design have supported the idea that function can emerge from basic structural properties, validating some of the foundational premises discussed in the 2013 work.

**Precision Medicine Impact**: The understanding of binding pocket limitations has informed target selection strategies. Rather than pursuing highly specific inhibitors for every target, drug discovery has increasingly embraced the reality of polypharmacology, sometimes designing compounds with controlled multi-target profiles for diseases like cancer and CNS disorders.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Only about 500 distinct binding pocket types exist"**  
  This quantitative prediction appears to have been too restrictive. While successive research has confirmed that binding pocket diversity is finite and constrained by fundamental protein structural principles, later studies suggest greater diversity than 500 types. Comprehensive analyses of the expanding PDB database and systematic pocket classification efforts indicate thousands of distinct pocket geometries, though the exact number depends heavily on classification criteria.

- **"Ligand-binding promiscuity is an inherent feature of proteins"**  
  This prediction has been strongly validated. Extensive drug profiling studies and systematic binding assays conducted since 2013 consistently demonstrate that most small molecules interact with multiple protein targets. The recognition of polypharmacology as a fundamental characteristic of drug action has become standard in pharmaceutical sciences.

- **"One molecule-one protein target is an incorrect assumption underlying many aspects of drug discovery"**  
  This has proven correct in that the pharmaceutical industry has moved decisively away from any naive single-target assumptions. However, the article's characterization of this view as already being a "straw man" in 2013 was accurate—informed drug discovery practice already recognized off-target effects as a major consideration.

- **"Similar binding pockets across different protein families may be coincidental rather than indicating evolutionary relationship"**  
  This insight has been broadly validated. Research on convergent evolution and functional annotation transfer has increasingly recognized that structural similarity does not necessarily imply evolutionary relatedness. This has important implications for drug repurposing and target prediction.

- **"Implications for origin-of-life studies: random proteins could display various functions"**  
  This prediction has found support in subsequent research on protein design and synthetic biology. Studies of random protein libraries and de novo protein design have demonstrated that functional binding and catalytic sites can emerge from basic structural principles without requiring specific evolutionary optimization.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article addresses fundamental questions that have proven prescient and increasingly relevant in drug discovery and protein science. While some arguments about industry practices reflected knowledge already present in 2013, the core scientific questions about binding pocket diversity and protein evolution have driven significant subsequent research and have concrete implications for how we approach drug design and target validation.
