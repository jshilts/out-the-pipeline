# More on Autism (And Mercury) (December 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2002 commentary addresses the ongoing scientific debate about whether thimerosal (a mercury-containing preservative formerly used in vaccines) causes autism. The author argues against both specific mechanistic hypotheses: first, that some readers still propose general organomercury toxicity rather than a specific brain lesion (which the author addressed in a previous post). Second, the author contends that autism is too specific a condition to explain through broad mercury toxicity, while also being too heterogeneous to attribute to a specific MPTP-like mechanism (referring to a known neurotoxin model). To support this position, the article cites an Institute of Medicine report noting that mercury typically produces multiple neurological symptoms simultaneously rather than the specific pattern of autism, and references what is described as "Rochester data" suggesting the thimerosal hypothesis is increasingly unlikely.

## 2. HISTORY

The controversy around thimerosal and autism evolved significantly after this 2002 article. Following years of extensive epidemiological research, multiple major studies—including systematic reviews by the Institute of Medicine (IOM)—repeatedly found no causal link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. In response to public concern and the precautionary principle, thimerosal was largely removed from routine childhood vaccines in the United States and several other countries by the early 2000s (though it remains in some formulations where alternatives are limited).

Subsequent autism rates did not decline after thimerosal removal, providing strong evidence against the hypothesized link. Research into autism increasingly focused on genetic factors, prenatal influences, and neurodevelopmental processes. From a policy and public health standpoint, the persistent controversy contributed to vaccine hesitancy and had measurable effects on immunization rates and public trust in scientific institutions. The scientific consensus solidified that vaccines do not cause autism, with major health organizations worldwide—including WHO, CDC, and multiple international bodies—issuing clear statements to that effect based on accumulated evidence. However, the controversy's legacy continues to echo in public discourse around vaccination.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no explicit forward-looking predictions. It speaks from a 2002 perspective about "increasingly likely" conclusions based on then-available evidence, but doesn't offer testable claims about how the field would develop.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This represents a routine 2002 commentary within an ongoing scientific debate, useful for understanding the intermediate state of the thimerosal-autism controversy as evidence was accumulating but before broad consensus resolution. Its tone and reasoning reflect the scientific process of weighing evidence and narrowing hypotheses as results emerge, but by modern standards it offers little novel insight beyond this specific historical moment.
