# Can’t Shake Failure Yet (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article is a commentary on a “top‑10 pipeline blow‑ups” list compiled by Endpoints for the first half of 2016. Its central point is that most clinical setbacks boil down to “the drug didn’t work,” whether because of lack of efficacy, unexpected toxicity, or a placebo response that erodes the apparent benefit. The author highlights AbbVie’s 2016 acquisition of Stemcentrx—a Peter Thiel‑backed biotech focused on cancer‑stem‑cell biology—and its lead ADC, rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova‑T), which was being tested in small‑cell lung cancer (SCLC). Early ASCO data showed only a modest (≈1‑month) survival advantage, far below the expectations set by AbbVie’s roughly $6 billion purchase price. The piece argues that such failures are inevitable given the current state of target selection and that a steady stream of setbacks is a sign of a healthy, high‑risk pipeline rather than a broken system.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development of Rova‑T**  
- **Phase II (2016‑2017):** The initial ASCO data referenced in the article came from a small, single‑arm study that showed limited activity.  
- **Phase III (TRINITY, 2018‑2020):** AbbVie launched a randomized, placebo‑controlled trial in first‑line SCLC. The trial was stopped early in 2020 after an interim analysis showed no improvement in overall survival and a higher rate of severe adverse events (including fatal pneumonitis).  
- **Termination:** In August 2020 AbbVie announced the discontinuation of Rova‑T’s development and recorded a **$3.5 billion write‑down** related to the Stemcentrx acquisition. No other DLL3‑targeting ADCs have achieved regulatory approval to date.

**Business outcome**  
- **Acquisition write‑down:** The $6 billion purchase price (including $4 billion in milestones) was largely written off. AbbVie’s 2020 annual report listed the Stemcentrx deal as a “significant impairment.”  
- **Divestiture:** In 2021 AbbVie sold the remaining Stemcentrx assets (excluding Rova‑T) to Merck for a nominal amount; the transaction was essentially a cleanup of the failed program.  

**Impact on the field**  
- **Cancer‑stem‑cell targeting:** The failure of Rova‑T dampened enthusiasm for DLL3 as a therapeutic target. Subsequent preclinical work suggested that DLL3 expression is heterogeneous and may not be a true driver of SCLC biology.  
- **ADC landscape:** While Rova‑T failed, the broader ADC market continued to grow. Other ADCs (e.g., enfortumab vedotin, sacituzumab govitecan) received FDA approval in the 2020s, showing that the platform remains viable when paired with more robust targets.  
- **Investor perception:** The Stemcentrx episode is frequently cited in biotech investment analyses as a cautionary tale about high‑price acquisitions of early‑stage assets with limited clinical data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** “If there aren’t a fair number of clinical wipeouts, it would probably mean that we’re not putting enough high‑risk high‑reward things into the clinic.”  
  - **Outcome:** The 2016‑2025 period saw a steady flow of both failures (e.g., Rova‑T, many CAR‑T programs that did not meet endpoints) and successes (several ADCs, gene‑editing therapies). The pipeline remained “high‑risk,” supporting the author’s view that failures are an intrinsic part of a vibrant R&D ecosystem.  

- **Prediction 2 (implicit):** The $6 billion Stemcentrx deal would generate a blockbuster drug that justifies the price.  
  - **Outcome:** The lead candidate failed in Phase III, the acquisition was largely written off, and no product from Stemcentrx reached market. The prediction was dramatically off‑target.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The piece is a concise snapshot of a pivotal moment (the AbbVie‑Stemcentrx deal) that later became a textbook example of over‑valuation and clinical disappointment, making it highly relevant for understanding biotech investment risk and the evolution of ADC strategies.
