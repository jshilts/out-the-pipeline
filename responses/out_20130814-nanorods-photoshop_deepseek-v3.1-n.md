# Nanorods? Or Photoshop? (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from August 2013 discusses alleged data manipulation in a Nano Letters paper from the Pease group, later retracted. The article highlights odd images that appeared to be crude Photoshop artifacts and notes that chemistry blogs were instrumental in bringing attention to the issue.

## 2. HISTORY

The article reflects an early instance of crowd-sourced research integrity oversight, where online science communities helped detect potential misconduct. In the years following 2013, this general approach—community vigilance and preprint/post-publication discussion leading to corrections or retractions—has become more common and now is supported by institutional platforms (e.g., PubPeer). The particular Nano Letters paper was withdrawn after investigation. Over the subsequent decade, concerns about image manipulation and research reproducibility have prompted journals and funders to adopt stricter screening policies and forensic image-analysis tools.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction (implicit):** That chemistry blogs and community scrutiny could influence journal actions.  
  **Outcome:** This has proven true. Community platforms and post-publication peer review (e.g., PubPeer, blogs, social media) now regularly drive corrections, expressions of concern, and retractions.
- **Prediction (implicit):** That the incident would prompt investigation and potentially a retraction.  
  **Outcome:** The paper was in fact withdrawn after investigation, validating the concern. This pattern of online scrutiny leading to formal actions has since become more standardized.
- **Bigger picture outcome:** Image forensics and data-integrity checks are now more integrated into editorial workflows, though widespread adoption varies by journal and funding agency.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**  
While it highlighted early post-publication peer review and image manipulation in a high-impact journal, its narrow scope and modest long-term impact place it below landmark cases of research integrity.
