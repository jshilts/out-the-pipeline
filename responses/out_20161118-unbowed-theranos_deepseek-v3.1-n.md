# Unbowed at Theranos (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the Wall Street Journal's reporting on Tyler Shultz, the Theranos whistleblower and grandson of former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served on Theranos's board. Tyler Shultz joined Theranos enthusiastically but discovered serious problems with the company's Edison blood-testing devices during his work on the assay validation team. He found that test results varied widely when rerun on the same blood samples, and Theranos routinely discarded outlier values from validation reports to reduce apparent variability. One validation report claimed 95% sensitivity for an infectious disease test, while the raw data showed only 65% and 80% sensitivity from the underlying experiments.

When Shultz raised concerns internally, he was ignored. He subsequently contacted regulatory authorities and eventually the Wall Street Journal, triggering intense retaliation from the company. The article highlights the severe family strain this caused, as his grandfather remained on the Theranos board and seemed to maintain allegiance to the company over his grandson, even as Tyler and colleagues knew CEO Elizabeth Holmes's claims about the devices being used in medevac helicopters and operating rooms were false. The piece praises Shultz's integrity in refusing to compromise his principles despite intense pressure.

## 2. HISTORY

Theranos collapsed completely following these revelations. In March 2018, the SEC charged Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes, and President Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani with massive fraud, alleging they raised more than $700 million while deceiving investors about the company's technology and business performance. Holmes settled with the SEC, paying a $500,000 penalty and accepting a 10-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

More significantly, criminal charges followed. In January 2022, after a high-profile trial, Elizabeth Holmes was convicted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy. She was sentenced in November 2022 to 11 years and 3 months in federal prison, with restitution of $452 million to victims. She began serving her sentence in May 2023. Sunny Balwani was also convicted on fraud charges and sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison.

Theranos dissolved in September 2018, having never produced a commercially viable blood-testing device. The company's estimated peak valuation of $9 billion evaporated entirely. No Theranos technology was ever FDA-approved for clinical use, and the thousands of test results the company had provided to patients (despite regulatory approval) were declared unreliable.

The scandal led to significant regulatory changes, including increased scrutiny of laboratory-developed tests and enhanced oversight of diagnostic claims by the FDA. Several books and documentaries followed, most notably John Carreyrou's "Bad Blood" (2018), which detailed the fraud, and a 2019 HBO documentary. The case became a cautionary tale about Silicon Valley's "fake it till you make it" culture and the importance of scientific validation in health technology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"May there be plenty more with his integrity"** (referring to Tyler Shultz): This expressed hope for future whistleblowers proved relevant, as the Theranos case became a landmark example that likely encouraged other whistleblowers in biotech and tech. However, major fraud cases continued to emerge in subsequent years (such as the CSL plasma scandal and various crypto frauds), suggesting that while individual whistleblowers emerged, systemic change remained incomplete.

• **Implicit prediction that the truth would eventually prevail**: This proved accurate, as comprehensive government investigations, criminal prosecutions, and extensive media coverage ultimately exposed the full scope of Theranos's fraud. The company's complete collapse and the criminal convictions validated the whistleblowers' claims and demonstrated that even well-connected, highly funded frauds can be brought down.

• **Implicit prediction about family dynamics**: The article's focus on the Shultz family conflict highlighted how corporate loyalty could strain even close family relationships. This pattern of board members and investors defending fraudulent companies against insider concerns has been observed in subsequent scandals, suggesting such dynamics persist in corporate governance.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

The article identified a crucial moment in what became one of the most significant corporate fraud cases in modern history, demonstrating exceptional prescience about the magnitude of the Theranos scandal and its wider implications for healthcare technology and corporate accountability.
