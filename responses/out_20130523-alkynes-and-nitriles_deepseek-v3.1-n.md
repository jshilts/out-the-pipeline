# Alkynes and Nitriles (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post highlights a new Organic Letters paper that reported a reaction to cleave a carbon–carbon triple bond (alkyne) to yield two separate nitrile products. The author found the transformation unexpected—falling outside conventional bond-breaking logic—and proposed an interesting reverse question: whether one could couple two nitriles into a linked alkyne, noting that such a process would formally release nitrogen.

## 2. HISTORY
The development appears to be a specialized synthetic method rather than a breakthrough with broad applied impact.
- The described alkyne-cleavage reaction did not become a widely adopted workhorse in medicinal chemistry or process-scale synthesis. It remains a niche transformation.
- A search does not reveal commercial drugs, clinical candidates, or manufacturing processes where this specific alkyne-to-nitrile cleavage is a key step.
- The reverse transformation (nitrile-to-alkyne coupling) did not materialize into a practical or general method subsequently; no high-impact applications are evident.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Take two nitriles and turn them into a linked alkyne**: The article mused about whether this reverse reaction could be developed, noting that it would formally release nitrogen. This did not become a general, practical method subsequently. The nitrogen extrusion challenge and the availability of more direct routes to alkynes meant this reverse reaction did not gain traction.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
This is a brief, curiosity-driven note about a niche organic reaction with minimal downstream impact on biotech, medicine, or applied chemistry.
