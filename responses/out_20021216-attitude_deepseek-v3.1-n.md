# Attitude (December 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes the mindset that led Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) into financial trouble after promising unrealistic 12% sales growth despite facing patent expirations on key drugs like Glucophage and Taxol, and the unexpected failure of Vanlev. The article contrasts two worldviews: the scientific approach of accepting what data reveals versus a corporate/athletic mindset that treats failure as unacceptable and believes success can be achieved through sheer determination and "killer instinct." The author argues that while motivation and tenacity are necessary for drug research—where good ideas often require many attempts—these qualities alone are insufficient. The piece emphasizes that physical reality cannot be intimidated, sweet-talked, or browbeaten: clinical trials, protein assays, and biological systems will yield the results they yield, regardless of corporate pressure or motivational rhetoric.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2002 commentary, Bristol-Myers Squibb faced the consequences of its ambitious growth promises. The company's stock declined significantly, and in 2003, BMS paid over $800 million to settle federal investigations into the accounting irregularities and channel-stuffing practices that stemmed from the pressure to meet unrealistic sales targets. The company's pipeline challenges continued, with Vanlev (omapatrilat) never achieving FDA approval due to angioedema concerns, validating the author's point about scientific reality trumping corporate will. BMS underwent significant restructuring and leadership changes in the mid-2000s, shifting toward more realistic expectations and focusing on strategic acquisitions rather than aggressive organic growth promises.

The broader pharmaceutical industry learned from this period, with many companies becoming more conservative in their public growth projections, particularly when facing patent cliffs. The industry also moved toward more transparent clinical trial reporting and risk assessment. However, the tension between scientific reality and corporate pressure continued, as evidenced by numerous FDA warning letters and drug withdrawals in subsequent years where safety signals were overlooked or minimized.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction: That the hard-charging, "failure is not an option" attitude is fundamentally incompatible with scientific research and drug development.** 
  - **Outcome: Largely validated.** The pharmaceutical industry saw numerous examples where aggressive timelines and pressure led to problematic outcomes—Vioxx withdrawal (2004), concerns over cardiovascular risks of diabetes drugs, and various instances where safety signals were missed. The FDA implemented more rigorous risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) and post-market surveillance requirements.

- **Prediction: That physical/biological reality cannot be intimidated or sweet-talked into compliance.**
  - **Outcome: Consistently validated.** High-profile clinical trial failures continued to demonstrate this principle—Pfizer's torcetrapib (2006), Merck's vorapaxar (2011), and numerous Alzheimer's drug failures showed that billions in investment and intense corporate pressure couldn't overcome biological reality when the science wasn't sound.

- **Prediction: That pressure tactics work better on sales forces than on scientists or biological systems.**
  - **Outcome: Partially validated.** The industry saw major sales practice scandals (off-label promotion settlements in the billions for companies like Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and others) suggesting that while you can pressure sales teams, this creates long-term regulatory and reputational damage. Scientific teams continued to operate under the constraint that good science takes the time it takes.

- **Implicit prediction: That unrealistic growth promises in the face of patent cliffs would lead to trouble.**
  - **Outcome: Validated.** BMS's stock took years to recover, and the company never replicated the 12% growth promise era. Similar patterns occurred across the industry as blockbuster drugs went off-patent throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates enduring insight about the fundamental tension between corporate culture and scientific reality, with principles that have remained relevant for over two decades of pharmaceutical industry evolution.
