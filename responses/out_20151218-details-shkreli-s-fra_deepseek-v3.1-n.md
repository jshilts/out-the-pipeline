# The Details of Shkreli's Fraud (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article provides commentary on Martin Shkreli's federal indictment for securities fraud, linking to a Bloomberg View analysis that details how he allegedly sustained a Ponzi-like scheme. The piece explains that Shkreli had lost significant investor money but told investors he had doubled it, leading him to take progressively riskier bets in an attempt to recover losses—a strategy that rarely succeeds. The author notes that Shkreli had mostly succeeded with this approach until his own "fantastically obnoxious" behavior brought unwanted attention that led to his indictment. The article also contains an extended digression about Cordwainer Smith's science fiction, referencing the story "Drunkboat" and discussing obscure connections between Smith's characters and a Tennessee high school.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the December 2015 indictment detailed in this article, Martin Shkreli was convicted in August 2017 on three counts of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and ordered to forfeit $7.4 million in assets. The conviction specifically related to his management of hedge funds MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and his pharmaceutical company Retrophin—not directly to the controversial drug pricing of Daraprim that had previously made him infamous. Shkreli began serving his sentence in 2018 at Federal Correctional Institution Allenwood Low. In 2022, he was fined $64.6 million and banned for life from the pharmaceutical industry by a federal judge for anticompetitive practices related to Daraprim. Shkreli was released from prison in May 2022. Separately, the anecdotal claim about Cordwainer Smith's connection to Dobyns-Bennett High School in Tennessee appears to have been confirmed by reader correspondence mentioned in the article's update, though this remains a minor literary footnote rather than a major biographical detail about Smith.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about Shkreli's case or the biotechnology industry. Rather, it was retrospective analysis of events already underway by December 2015.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 2**

While the Shkreli case itself was significant for pharmaceutical industry ethics and securities fraud prosecution, this particular article's value is limited by its brevity on the actual fraud details (referring readers elsewhere) and its disproportionate focus on unrelated science fiction trivia that adds little substantive insight to either the legal case or biotech industry developments.
