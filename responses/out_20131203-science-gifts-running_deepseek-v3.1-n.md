# Science Gifts: Running Experiments at Home (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article highlights a small boom in "home experiment" books aimed at audiences interested in science but lacking formal training—whether young students or adults who missed science education. It recommends several book series including Robert Bruce Thompson's Illustrated Guides (Chemistry, Biology, Forensic Science), Hands-On Chemistry/Physics Activities, Theodore Gray's Mad Science books (noted as experiments you "probably shouldn't" do at home due to materials and hazards), and Bassam Shakhashiri's Chemical Demonstrations series (primarily for educators but useful for serious home experimenters). The author frames these resources as valuable science gifts that can engage non-specialist audiences with hands-on learning.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2013, the home science experimentation landscape expanded significantly beyond books into new formats and technologies:

**Market Growth and Access:** The home science experiment market grew substantially, with Amazon and specialty retailers offering broader equipment access. However, supply chain challenges emerged for some chemistry materials as awareness and participation increased.

**Theodore Gray's Continued Influence:** Gray's "Mad Science" series maintained popularity. His 2020 book "The Elements: A Visual Exploration" became a bestseller, and his periodic table website attracted millions of visitors. He continued public demonstrations at universities and science festivals.

**Maker Movement Expansion:** The maker movement (which overlapped with home experimentation) grew dramatically post-2013, with makerspaces appearing in many cities and libraries. This provided community infrastructure for amateur science experimentation.

**Regulatory Developments:** Safety concerns increased regarding home chemistry experiments using hazardous materials. Some jurisdictions (including parts of Europe and Australia) implemented additional restrictions on certain chemical purchases following incidents involving amateur chemistry.

**Digital Shift:** The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022) accelerated development of virtual science experiment platforms and simulation tools, complementing physical home experiments.

**Economic Development:** While specific financial outcomes for Thompson's and Shahashiri's series aren't publicly detailed, the broader DIY science kit market reached over $2 billion annually by 2022, suggesting sustained demand.

**Educational Integration:** Home experimentation became more formally integrated into science curricula during pandemic remote learning, accelerating adoption of home experiment methodologies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Predicted audience:** The article identified "people interested in science but without training" and young people as a "good audience" for these materials. **✓ Accurate:** Market growth in DIY science kits (reaching billions annually) and proliferation of maker communities confirms sustained interest from these demographics.

- **Content demand:** The author noted the "small boom in this sort of book" was ongoing and expected continued interest. **✓ Accurate:** Sales data and expanded product offerings indicate continued market growth through 2024.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3/9**

This article captured an emerging trend in science education accessibility but covered well-established book recommendations rather than breaking new ground. It has historical value as documentation of the pre-expansion DIY science landscape, but limited broader scientific or policy significance.
