# The CRISPR Interference Case (January 14, 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that the CRISPR patent dispute between Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang has entered an official interference proceeding at the USPTO. Under the older "first to invent" patent regime (pre-2013), Doudna filed a provisional application on May 25, 2012, while Zhang filed on December 12, 2012, but Zhang's patent was expedited and granted on April 15, 2014, while Doudna's application remained pending. This created interference between the earlier inventor's rights and the later inventor's granted patent.

The author notes that interference proceedings are notoriously complex, involving three patent judges sifting through extensive evidence including lab notebooks, emails, and meeting records to determine priority of invention. The piece speculates that either Zhang or Doudna would "win big" in an up-or-down ruling, though settlement remained possible. However, the author also raises the prescient question of whether newer CRISPR variants and therapeutic applications might ultimately prove more valuable than the original patents, suggesting that regardless of the interference outcome, the courts would continue seeing CRISPR patent cases due to ongoing technological developments.

## 2. HISTORY

**Patent Interference Outcome**: The interference proceeding concluded in February 2017 with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ruling in favor of the Broad Institute (Zhang's institution), determining that Zhang's claims covering CRISPR-Cas9 editing in eukaryotic cells were separately patentable from Doudna's broader claims, which primarily focused on CRISPR applications in vitro and in prokaryotic cells. This created a split patent landscape rather than a simple winner-take-all outcome.

**Legal Developments**: Following the interference decision, both sides pursued extensive appeals. In 2018, the Federal Circuit Court upheld the PTAB decision. Further legal battles continued into 2022, when the USPTO issued a preliminary decision that Doudna's team was first to invent the foundational CRISPR technology, while Zhang's team was first to demonstrate it in human cells. This established parallel patent estates.

**Commercial Impact**: The patent split enabled both University of California/Berkeley (Doudna) and Broad Institute to license their respective IP. UC Berkeley established a non-exclusive licensing program through Caribou Biosciences, while Broad Institute licensed through Editas Medicine. Multiple companies emerged with different CRISPR platforms: Editas Medicine (Zhang, Broad), Intellia Therapeutics (Doudna, Caribou), and CRISPR Therapeutics (Emmanuelle Charpentier).

**Regulatory and Clinical Achievements**: The first CRISPR-based therapeutic received regulatory approval in November 2023, when the UK's MHRA approved Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel) for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, developed by CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. This was followed shortly by FDA approval in December 2023 for the same indications. The therapy involves ex vivo editing of patient hematopoietic stem cells.

**Scientific Development**: Following 2016, numerous CRISPR variants and improvements emerged, including base editing (developed by David Liu's team in 2016-2017) and prime editing (2019), which provided more precise alternatives to traditional CRISPR-Cas9 and generated their own patent portfolios, partially validating the article's speculation that newer methods might prove valuable.

**Market Impact**: As of late 2023, the global CRISPR market reached several billion dollars annually, with dozens of clinical trials ongoing for various diseases including inherited blood disorders, cancer, and rare diseases. However, widespread patient uptake of approved CRISPR therapies has been limited by extremely high costs (priced at approximately \$2.2 million per patient) and the complex nature of the treatment requiring specialized centers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Either the Zhang patent estate or the Doudna one will win big"**: **Partially accurate but overly simplified**. The interference proceeding resulted in a split decision rather than an outright victory for one side, with both parties retaining significant patent rights in different jurisdictions and applications.

• **"There's still a chance that the two sides could strike a deal"**: **Accurate but incomplete**. While the parties never reached a comprehensive settlement, they established separate licensing arrangements through different commercial entities, effectively creating a market with multiple players rather than a unified pool.

• **"Will some of these newer, more specific and controllable forms of CRISPR turn out to have more valuable patent rights than the original?"**: **Accurate prediction**. Base editing and prime editing technologies developed post-2016 have indeed generated substantial additional patent portfolios and commercial value, with companies like Beam Therapeutics building platforms around these improved methods.

• **"You also have to think that there will be specific techniques and tricks that will have to be applied to get the technology to work therapeutically in humans, which takes you into still more new IP space"**: **Accurate**. Numerous method patents covering delivery systems, manufacturing processes, and therapeutic applications have emerged, creating extensive IP beyond the foundational CRISPR-Cas9 patents.

• **"The courts are not through seeing CRISPR cases, not as long as it works as well as it does"**: **Accurate**. Patent litigation between various CRISPR entities has continued through at least 2024, with ongoing disputes over scope, validity, and infringement of various CRISPR-related patents.

• **"At least these later disputes will be first-to-file ones!"**: **Accurate**. Subsequent CRISPR patent applications after 2013 have indeed operated under the first-to-file system, simplifying (though not eliminating) priority disputes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional foresight about the CRISPR patent landscape, correctly predicting that newer CRISPR variants would create additional valuable IP and that litigation would continue far beyond the initial interference proceeding, while also accurately capturing the technical and legal complexity of the dispute at a critical early moment when the technology's commercial potential was still emerging.
