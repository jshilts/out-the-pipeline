# 115 Years of JACS Titles (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes word frequency trends in titles from the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) over 115 years, based on graphical data compiled by Stuart Cantrill. The analysis reveals distinct historical patterns in chemical research focus: early periods (1900s) emphasized analytical methods with words like "determination," "analysis," and "estimation," followed by "acid" dominating from the 1910s through the 1950s. "Synthesis" emerged as a major theme starting in the 1930s and maintained top rankings for decades. The article notes interesting grammatical shifts, such as "Reaction" versus "Reactions" appearing and disappearing from top-ten lists across different decades. More recent periods show "Protein," "Via," and "Nanoparticles" entering the top ten for the first time (2010-2014), suggesting evolving research priorities toward biological and materials chemistry. The author humorously suggests the perfect contemporary JACS paper title would be "Studies of Protein Complexes Via Molecular Synthesis of Nanoparticles," incorporating seven top-ten words from the 2010-2014 period.

## 2. HISTORY
While specific quantitative updates on subsequent 2015-2024 JACS title word frequencies are limited in the literature, the broader trends identified in this 2015 analysis have largely continued and intensified, particularly the shift toward interdisciplinary and biological chemistry. JACS has maintained its position as one of the premier chemistry journals, and the emphasis on proteins, nanoparticles, and synthesis has become even more pronounced in the chemical literature of the late 2010s and early 2020s. The rise of biomolecular chemistry and materials science within traditional chemistry journals reflects the increasing interdisciplinary nature of chemical research. However, without access to updated comprehensive data on JACS title word frequencies beyond 2015, it is difficult to assess whether the specific trend predictions mentioned held true or if new words emerged in the top ranks after 2015.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
Since this article was primarily retrospective rather than forward-looking, I will refrain from evaluating predictions. The piece focused on analyzing historical data through 2014 and did not make explicit predictions about future developments in chemical research beyond suggesting that the 2010-2014 trend toward proteins, synthesis, and nanoparticles represented an ongoing shift in research focus.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article provides an interesting historical linguistics analysis of chemistry research trends, but it represents a niche analytical exercise rather than a piece with broad scientific or societal significance. The insights are primarily observational and descriptive, offering limited actionable information about the actual state or future direction of chemical science beyond how researchers choose to title their papers.
