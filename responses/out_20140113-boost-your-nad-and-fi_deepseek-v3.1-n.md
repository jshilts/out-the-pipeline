# Boost Your NAD And Fix It All? (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Cell paper from the Sinclair lab at Harvard proposing a new connection between SIRT1 and aging. The proposed mechanism involves declining NAD+ levels with age, which impairs SIRT1 function, leading to loss of constraint on HIF-1. Elevated HIF-1 then disrupts nucleus-mitochondria communication pathways, resulting in reduced mitochondrial protein production, impaired energy generation, and cellular aging phenotypes.

Notably, these effects were reportedly reversed at the cellular level in aging mice after just one week of treatment with NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide), an NAD+ precursor. The author notes that similar effects had been shown in diabetic rodents by researchers at Washington University. The piece situates these findings within broader contexts of mitochondrial aging research and cancer biology, acknowledging that while the mechanism isn't "crazy talk," human intervention trials would be needed before considering any supplementation.

## 2. HISTORY

**Scientific Developments:**
The NAD+/sirtuin field saw continued research but also encountered significant controversies and replication challenges. Key subsequent developments include:

- **Sirtuin research progression**: While Sinclair's lab continued publishing on NAD+ metabolism and aging, broader questions emerged about sirtuins' direct role as aging regulators. Some studies failed to reproduce earlier lifespan extension claims, and the field moved toward more nuanced mechanisms rather than simple sirtuin activation as a universal anti-aging strategy.

- **Clinical trials**: Several NAD+ precursor trials were conducted in humans. Elysium Health, co-founded by Leonard Guarente, launched supplements containing NR (nicotinamide riboside) and conducted human studies showing some biomarker improvements, though critics noted conflicts of interest and modest effect sizes. Smaller studies with NMN showed some metabolic and vascular improvements in middle-aged and older adults, but nothing approaching dramatic anti-aging effects.

- **FDA regulatory actions**: In 2019, the FDA sent warning letters to companies making anti-aging claims about NAD+ supplements, clarifying that these products are not approved drugs and that claims about treating or preventing diseases were inappropriate.

- **Drug development**: No NAD+ precursor has achieved FDA approval as an anti-aging therapeutic as of 2024. Several compounds remain in various stages of clinical development, primarily for metabolic conditions rather than general aging.

**Commercial outcomes:**
The supplement industry capitalized heavily on the NAD+ research, with numerous companies marketing NMN, NR, and other NAD+ boosters as anti-aging products. However, in 2022, the FDA determined that NMN cannot be sold as a dietary supplement in the US when intended for use as a drug, affecting market availability.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: That NMN would "fly off the shelves down at the supplement stores" and that the attitude toward intervening in aging mechanisms was comparable to treating diabetes or bacterial infections with drugs.

**Outcome**: 
- NMN and other NAD+ boosting supplements did indeed become popular commercially, with numerous companies entering the market
- However, regulatory pushback significantly constrained these markets compared to the initial enthusiasm
- No NAD+ precursor achieved drug approval for aging, unlike antibiotics or diabetes medications
- The analogy to treating aging like a disease has remained largely aspirational rather than achieved

**Prediction**: "All this recent NAD work suggests that we might get that chance sooner than later" (referring to meaningful human anti-aging interventions)

**Outcome**:
- While NAD+ research has continued, no breakthrough anti-aging therapeutic has emerged from this work as of 2024
- Progress has been incremental rather than transformative
- The fundamental complexity of aging biology has proven more challenging than the early enthusiasm suggested

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article represents a thoughtful take on an intriguing but ultimately controversial area of aging research. It captures a moment when NAD+ interventions seemed particularly promising, and accurately anticipated both scientific interest and commercial enthusiasm, while the subsequent history illuminates the gap between cellular findings and meaningful human applications.
