# Antipsychotic Drugs Against Cancer? (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted a surprising finding from a phenotypic screen for agents that kill cancer‑stem‑like cells (CSCs) while sparing normal stem cells. The screen identified the old phenothiazine antipsychotics thioridazine, fluphenazine and prochlorperazine as active compounds. The authors noted that the activity correlated with dopamine‑receptor (DR) expression on the CSCs, suggesting that antagonism of DRs might be the operative mechanism. They pointed to earlier epidemiological hints that schizophrenic patients on phenothiazines had lower cancer incidence, and argued that “ancient” antipsychotics could be a tractable small‑molecule way to hit CSCs—provided researchers set aside preconceived notions about target space.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Pre‑clinical work (2012‑2016).**  
- Multiple groups confirmed that thioridazine (and to a lesser extent fluphenazine) could reduce viability of CSC‑enriched populations in breast, lung, glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models. The proposed mechanisms expanded beyond DR blockade to include inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, induction of autophagy, and disruption of mitochondrial function.  
- Structure‑activity‑relationship (SAR) studies showed that the phenothiazine core retained activity, but the therapeutic window remained narrow because the concentrations needed to kill CSCs approached those that cause cardiac QT prolongation.

**Early‑phase clinical attempts (2015‑2019).**  
- A small, open‑label Phase I trial (University of Texas, 2015) administered low‑dose thioridazine to patients with refractory AML. The study reported modest reductions in leukemic blasts in a subset of patients, but also observed dose‑limiting QTc prolongation and neuro‑psychiatric side effects. The trial was not expanded.  
- A 2017 pilot study in advanced solid tumors (UK) used thioridazine 25 mg/day as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy. No objective responses were recorded; the study was terminated for safety concerns.  
- No formal Phase II or III trials of any phenothiazine for cancer have been launched as of early 2024.

**Regulatory and commercial outcome.**  
- No phenothiazine antipsychotic has received FDA, EMA, or other major agency approval for an oncology indication.  
- Pharmaceutical interest shifted toward designing “cleaner” dopamine‑receptor antagonists or downstream pathway inhibitors rather than repurposing the original drugs, because the safety liabilities (QT prolongation, extrapyramidal symptoms) outweigh the modest pre‑clinical efficacy.

**Broader impact on the field.**  
- The thioridazine story contributed to the rise of drug‑repurposing platforms (e.g., the NIH NCATS Repurposing Hub) but did not become a cornerstone of CSC‑targeted therapy.  
- Research on dopamine signaling in cancer continued, especially in neuro‑endocrine tumors and glioblastoma, but the focus moved to more selective dopamine‑D2‑like receptor modulators (e.g., ONC201, a D2 antagonist/DRD2 agonist) rather than classic phenothiazines.  
- The notion that “old drugs can hit unexpected biology” remains influential, but the specific claim that phenothiazine antipsychotics are a practical CSC‑targeting class has not been borne out in practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** Phenothiazine antipsychotics would become a tractable small‑molecule approach to eradicate CSCs and possibly enter clinical use.  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. Pre‑clinical promise did not translate into safe, efficacious clinical regimens; no approvals have been granted.

- **Prediction:** Dopamine‑receptor expression would serve as a reliable biomarker to select patients for phenothiazine therapy.  
  **Outcome:** No validated DR‑based companion diagnostic has emerged; heterogeneity of DR expression in tumors proved too great for patient stratification.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The repurposing of thioridazine would spark broader interest in antipsychotics for oncology.  
  **Outcome:** Interest in drug repurposing grew, but subsequent work focused on newer, more selective agents (e.g., ONC201, pimozide derivatives) rather than the original phenothiazines.

- **Prediction (implicit):** Epidemiological links between antipsychotic use and reduced cancer incidence would be confirmed and mechanistically explained.  
  **Outcome:** Later epidemiological analyses produced mixed results; confounding factors (smoking, healthcare access) limited definitive conclusions, and mechanistic links remain speculative.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a clear early example of drug‑repurposing hype that sparked genuine scientific follow‑up, yet the specific therapeutic promise has not materialized, limiting its long‑term impact.
