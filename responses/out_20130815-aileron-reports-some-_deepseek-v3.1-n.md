# Aileron Reports Some Stapled Peptide Results (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Aileron Therapeutics' publication in PNAS detailing results from their stapled peptide compound ATSP-7041, which targets both MDM2 and MDMX proteins to activate the suppressed p53 pathway in cancer cells. The author notes that while stapled peptides as a drug class have faced skepticism and controversy, ATSP-7041 showed promising results and was advancing toward clinical trials. However, the article also mentions that Aileron had recently conducted layoffs, potentially affecting some authors of the PNAS publication, and notes that several other companies have compounds targeting the same MDM2 pathway, creating a competitive landscape for evaluating real-world therapeutic potential.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 publication, the stapled peptide field and Aileron's specific programs underwent significant evolution. Aileron continued developing ATSP-7041 and related compounds, with the company advancing into clinical trials. However, the translation from promising preclinical data to clinical success proved challenging. The broader stapled peptide therapeutic platform faced ongoing hurdles related to drug delivery, stability, and manufacturing scalability.

Regarding the specific MDM2/MDMX pathway targeting, while p53 activation remained an attractive cancer therapeutic strategy, several companies encountered difficulties demonstrating consistent clinical efficacy. The competitive landscape mentioned in the article evolved, with some programs advancing while others faced setbacks.

Aileron underwent strategic shifts over the subsequent years, with the company adapting its focus and pipeline based on clinical results and funding realities. The company's workforce changes mentioned in 2013 reflected broader challenges in the biotechnology sector around translating promising research into viable therapeutic programs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes several implicit predictions and observations:

• **Stapled peptides advancing to clinic**: The article noted ATSP-7041 was "heading towards the clinic." This did occur, with Aileron advancing compounds into clinical development, though clinical success remained challenging.

• **Real-world performance assessment needed**: The author noted it would be "interesting to see how they all fare in the real world" regarding MDM2-targeting compounds. This proved prescient, as real-world clinical testing revealed complexities not apparent in preclinical models.

• **Competitive MDM2 inhibitor landscape**: Multiple companies pursuing MDM2/p53 pathway activation did indeed create a competitive environment, with mixed clinical outcomes across different approaches and companies.

• **Company viability concerns**: The mention of Aileron's layoffs suggested underlying challenges that proved indicative of the difficulties small biotechnology companies face in advancing novel therapeutic platforms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses an interesting therapeutic approach (stapled peptides) and important cancer target (p53 pathway), but represents a fairly routine biotechnology pipeline update without broader historical significance. It captures a snapshot of early-stage drug development challenges but does not represent a pivotal moment or breakthrough in the field.
