# The Future of In the Pipeline (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief announcement post, dated July 20, 2015, is not a commentary about the biotechnology industry. Instead, it's a blog migration notice from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, a long-running and influential chemistry and drug discovery blog. The author announces that after 13 years at Corante.com, the blog—along with all archives and comments—is moving to Science Translational Medicine's platform.

Key commitments made in the transition include preservation of all historical content, continued editorial independence (no review by Science), maintenance of the existing focus on drug discovery, continuation of comment functionality to preserve the established community, an open-access model with no paywall, and automatic redirects from the old domain. The target migration date was sometime in August 2015, pending final testing of the new platform.

## 2. HISTORY

The blog migration did indeed take place as described. "In the Pipeline" successfully moved to Science Translational Medicine in 2015 and has continued publishing there to the present day (over nine years as of this writing).

The blog maintained its editorial independence and focus on pharmaceutical research and drug discovery throughout this period. Derek Lowe continued as a regular contributing editor at Science Translational Medicine while working in the drug discovery industry. The commenting community and open-access model were preserved as promised in the announcement.

During this period from 2015 to the present, the blog has covered numerous biopharma developments, including clinical trial results, drug approvals, industry trends, and scientific controversies. It remains one of the more influential industry blogs in the pharmaceutical space, providing analysis and commentary on topics ranging from early-stage research to clinical development and regulatory issues.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contained no predictions about biotechnology industry developments, scientific advances, or medical breakthroughs. Rather, it only included commitments about the blog's migration and operational changes:

- **Content preservation**: ✓ Successfully maintained
- **Editorial independence**: ✓ Maintained throughout
- **Focus continuity**: ✓ Preserved the drug discovery focus
- **Comments functionality**: ✓ Implemented
- **Open-access**: ✓ Implemented
- **Redirect plan**: ✓ Presumably executed

The article did not make industry predictions, which is appropriate for a blog migration announcement.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 0.5/10**

This content is essentially off-topic for biotechnology industry analysis. While "In the Pipeline" itself is a significant industry blog, this particular post was just an administrative announcement about a platform migration with no industry commentary, predictions, or analysis. Its long-term importance is limited to blog infrastructure history rather than substantive developments in biotechnology or drug discovery.
