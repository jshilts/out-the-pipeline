# How Not to Do It: NMR Magnets (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 blog post comments on an NMR imaging incident at an Indian facility where two people became pinned to the machine by an oxygen cylinder that was brought into the magnet room. Both individuals sustained injuries. The article raises two critical safety concerns: first, how ferromagnetic materials were allowed near the powerful NMR magnet, and second, why the emergency quench system failed to activate promptly, taking four hours for a technician to manually shut down the magnet. The author references rumors that some facilities may bypass quench circuits to avoid the cost of magnet recharging, while emphasizing the need for strict safety protocols around high-field NMR equipment.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this incident, the broader NMR and MRI safety community reinforced the critical importance of access control and ferromagnetic detection systems around high-field magnets. The incident highlighted systemic issues with emergency protocols that likely spurred increased scrutiny of safety procedures at both clinical and research facilities worldwide. While the specific outcome of any investigation into GE's equipment or hospital procedures isn't publicly documented in readily accessible sources, such incidents typically lead to enhanced training requirements and equipment safety audits within the industry. The blog's concerns about potential quench circuit bypassing - if substantiated - would represent serious regulatory violations, though confirmation of these specific allegations remains unverified in public sources.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions about the future were made in this article. The piece focused on analyzing a recent incident rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4**

While the article addresses important safety issues in NMR/MRI facilities, it is primarily a commentary on an isolated incident rather than examining broader technological or policy developments of long-term significance to the biotechnology field.
