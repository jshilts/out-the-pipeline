# A Modest Literature Proposal (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 commentary critiques a *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* paper on BACE-1 inhibitor compounds for Alzheimer's disease. The author expresses frustration that the research presents compounds with molecular weights around 900 containing four amides and a sulfonamide—properties that make them unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier or function in living systems. The central complaint is that the paper lacks any *in vivo* data or even cellular assays, instead relying solely on *in vitro* enzymatic assays against BACE-1. The author proposes splitting medicinal chemistry journals into two categories: one for purely *in vitro* work and another requiring at least some attempt at *in vivo* testing. The critique highlights the disconnect between studying compounds against isolated enzymes versus testing them in biological systems that have membranes to cross and metabolic processes that can reject problematic molecules.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade demonstrated the prescience of this critique through the troubled clinical trajectory of BACE-1 inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease:

**Clinical Failures (2010-2019):** Multiple pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in BACE-1 inhibitor programs following the amyloid hypothesis. Major programs at Eli Lilly (LY2886721), Merck (verubecestat), AstraZeneca/Lilly (lanabecestat), Johnson & Johnson (atabecestat), Novartis (umibecestat), and Eisai/Biogen (elenbecestat) progressed to Phase II and III trials. Nearly all failed due to lack of efficacy in treating Alzheimer's symptoms or concerning side effects.

**The Amyloid Paradox:** While BACE-1 inhibitors successfully reduced amyloid-beta levels in cerebrospinal fluid and brain plaques, this biomarker improvement did not translate into meaningful clinical benefit for patients' cognitive function or daily living activities. The failures suggested that amyloid reduction alone, even when achieved early in disease progression, was insufficient to halt cognitive decline.

**FDA Approval of Aduhelm (2021) and Leqembi (2023):** The FDA granted accelerated approval to two anti-amyloid antibodies—aducanumab and lecanemab—but these work through clearance mechanisms rather than BACE-1 inhibition. Both faced significant controversy regarding clinical meaningfulness, though lecanemab demonstrated modest cognitive benefit. The uptake has been limited by accessibility issues, insurance coverage disputes, and the requirement for regular infusions plus monitoring for brain swelling and bleeding.

**Scientific Acceptance:** The scientific community gradually recognized the limitations of purely *in vitro* drug discovery approaches, particularly for CNS targets requiring blood-brain barrier penetration. Pharmaceutical companies enhanced their screening cascades to include earlier *in vivo* pharmacokinetic assessments. However, many academic medicinal chemistry publications continued focusing on *in vitro* optimization due to resource constraints and publication pressures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction: BACE-1 inhibitors with poor drug-like properties would fail** ✓ **SUPPORTED**: The author's skepticism about 900 MW compounds with multiple amides/sulfonamides reaching therapeutic targets proved justified. Most failed due to poor brain penetration, insufficient oral bioavailability, or toxicity.
  
- **Implicit prediction: *In vitro* activity doesn't guarantee *in vivo* success** ✓ **STRONGLY SUPPORTED**: The subsequent decade of BACE-1 inhibitor failures validated this concern. Many programs advanced based on potent *in vitro* BACE-1 inhibition but failed in humans despite adequate target engagement.

- **Implicit prediction: Medicinal chemistry needs more biological relevance** ✓ **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**: Pharmaceutical industry practices evolved toward earlier incorporation of ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) profiling and blood-brain barrier assessments. However, academic medicinal chemistry publications continued prioritizing *in vitro* biochemical potency due to resource limitations, though some journals began requesting more comprehensive characterization.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional scientific foresight and offers a concise, concrete critique that resonated with the subsequent decade of clinical failures in Alzheimer's drug development. It remains highly relevant as the field continues grappling with the same fundamental challenges of translating *in vitro* findings into meaningful patient benefit.
