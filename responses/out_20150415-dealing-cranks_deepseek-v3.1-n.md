# Dealing With Cranks (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the ethical dilemma scientists and science writers face when responding to public figures like Dr. Oz and the "Food Babe" who promote pseudoscience. The author references a Vox article by Julia Belluz that suggests strategically targeting not just the cranks themselves, but the media platforms, advertisers, and publishers that enable their careers. Key recommendations include maintaining scientific accuracy, avoiding the creation of martyrs, not overstating their influence, and being wary of becoming part of the spectacle oneself—what journalist Brendan Nyhan called a "synergy" where critics inadvertently benefit from and amplify the very pseudoscience they seek to debunk. The author acknowledges the personal temptation to engage ("it is sort of fun") but worries about legitimizing bad actors through response.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments bore out the article's core dilemma. Dr. Oz continued his television career through the late 2010s, though with increasing controversy: he faced a 2014 Senate hearing over false weight-loss claims, and by 2021, physicians called for his dismissal from Columbia University. Medical institutions like the American College of Cardiology criticized his continued faculty position. However, rather than fading, the problem expanded. Figures promoting medical misinformation gained new prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023), drawing intense media coverage and sparking debates over how platforms should moderate health misinformation. The proliferation of social media made the central tension more acute: refuting false claims often amplifies them. By the mid-2020s, many public health communicators adopted strategic silence on lower-tier misinformation spreaders while focusing on high-impact interventions (correcting records for large audiences, working with platforms on policy). Some influencers who promoted pandemic misinformation faced reduced access to mainstream platforms but often migrated to less-moderated spaces. The dynamic largely confirmed the article's worries about "wrestling with pigs" and the legitimacy-conferring risk of response.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction that Dr. Oz's influence might wane or face accountability**:  
  - *Reality*: Dr. Oz remained prominent and, in 2022, ran for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania; though he lost, the run cemented his political transformation and demonstrated durable name recognition. The trajectory was not decline but repurposing into political celebrity.  
• **Implicit prediction that targeting enablers (shows, advertisers) could curb pseudoscience**:  
  - *Reality*: Some advertisers did pull support from programs featuring dubious claims, and platforms eventually tightened health misinformation policies; yet, the ecosystem proved resilient. New channels (podcasts, streaming, social media) substituted for traditional gatekeepers, and the influencer economy often rewarded sensationalism over accuracy.  
• **Implicit prediction that journalists covering cranks risk becoming part of the spectacle**:  
  - *Reality*: During the pandemic, many science journalists became essential sources amid high demand for clear explanations; some developed large followings but also faced accusations of showboating or exaggeration. The tension between debunking misinformation and amplifying it remains unresolved.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article's central dilemma has proven durable and grown more acute with social media and pandemic-era misinformation controversies, making the piece more prescient and broadly applicable than its 2015 framing might have suggested.
