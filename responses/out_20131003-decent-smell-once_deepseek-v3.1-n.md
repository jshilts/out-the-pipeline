# A Decent Smell, For Once (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a lighthearted blog post from an organic chemist describing aromatic compounds that smell like food. The author notes while weighing acetophenones that 2-acetylpyridine smells distinctly like corn chips/tortilla chips, which prompts them to ask fellow chemists what reagents remind them of food. The author confirms via Google Scholar that 2-acetylpyridine is indeed found in tortilla chips, then adds that 3,4-dimethoxyacetophenone smells like bacon. The post concludes with an update that the subsequent reaction mixture has turned into a "spicy Szechuan motor oil" color and likely no longer smells pleasant.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which has been running since the early 2000s and continues to the present day. The blog typically covers pharmaceutical chemistry, drug discovery, and biotechnology industry topics, with occasional lighter personal posts like this one. 

The specific compounds mentioned (2-acetylpyridine and 3,4-dimethoxyacetophenone) are common organic reagents used in chemical synthesis. 2-Acetylpyridine is indeed known to contribute to corn chip aromas and is used in flavor chemistry. These compounds continue to be standard laboratory reagents with no particular breakthrough developments specifically tied to them since 2013. The blog itself has maintained its readership and influence in the pharmaceutical chemistry community.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no explicit predictions about the future of biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, or scientific research. It is purely an observational post about sensory experiences in the chemistry lab.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a personal anecdote about chemical aromas with minimal relevance to the biotechnology industry or substantive scientific developments. While mildly entertaining for chemists, it has essentially no long-term importance for understanding biotechnology trends, drug development outcomes, or policy changes.

*Note: This appears to be a casual blog post rather than a substantive commentary article about the biotechnology industry. It lacks the analytical depth, industry focus, and predictive elements that would typically warrant detailed retrospective analysis.*
