# One Conspiracy After Another (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This appears to be a brief blog post by Derek Lowe referencing a cartoon about encountering people on the internet who confidently discuss chemistry and cancer cures despite questionable expertise. The post links to a cartoon about "viral cancer cure conspiracies," suggesting it addresses the phenomenon of online misinformation about medical topics, particularly unsubstantiated claims about cancer treatments. The author is described as someone with experience dealing with internet commentators who lack formal chemistry training but present themselves as knowledgeable.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2013, the problem of online medical misinformation has significantly worsened rather than improved. The period from 2013-2024 saw several major developments: The rise of social media platforms amplified conspiracy theories about cancer and other diseases; The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2024) dramatically increased public attention to health information and misinformation, leading to widespread dissemination of unproven treatments; Many social media platforms implemented fact-checking systems and content moderation policies for health claims; There have been numerous regulatory actions against companies making false cancer treatment claims online; The WHO and other health organizations have launched initiatives to combat health misinformation. However, despite these efforts, access to unverified health claims and conspiracy theories about cancer cures remains widespread on the internet.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The article doesn't contain explicit predictions** - it's primarily a commentary on the existing state of internet misinformation about chemistry and cancer treatments circa 2013. The post describes a contemporaneous issue rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a short blog post commentary with very limited original analysis - primarily serving to reference a cartoon. While the broader topic of medical misinformation has become increasingly important, the specific article has minimal analytical content and provides little insight beyond acknowledging the existence of internet conspiracies about cancer cures.
