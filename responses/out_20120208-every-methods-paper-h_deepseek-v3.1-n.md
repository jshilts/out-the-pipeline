I notice that you've provided a PROMPT_TEMPLATE for analyzing biotechnology articles, but the actual article you've linked to ("Every Methods Paper Has a Table" from February 2012) is not about the biotechnology industry specifically. Rather, it's a short blog post about scientific methodology papers and the importance of transparency in reporting failed experiments.

If you'd like me to proceed with analyzing this specific article using the template structure, I can do that. However, I want to confirm: 

**Is this the correct article you want me to analyze, or would you prefer to provide a different article that's actually about biotechnology?**

Alternatively, I can simply proceed with analyzing this article as-is, but I want to make sure this aligns with your expectations since the prompt template references "biotechnology industry" commentary specifically.
