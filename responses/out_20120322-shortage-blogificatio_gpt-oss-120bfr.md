# Shortage of Blogification (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a brief, informal note from a science‑focused blogger apologizing for not publishing a regular update because of technical problems (a dead laptop) and a “blizzard of Real Science™” keeping the author busy. The author uses the gap to ask readers for suggestions on topics that have been under‑discussed on the blog, indicating a desire to keep future content fresh and relevant. No specific scientific claims, technologies, or companies are mentioned.

## 2. HISTORY  
Because the entry contains no substantive discussion of biotechnology, there are no downstream scientific developments, regulatory actions, product approvals, or business outcomes that can be traced back to it. The post simply reflects a routine editorial pause on a personal blog and did not influence the broader biotech field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not make any explicit or implicit predictions about scientific advances, market trends, or policy changes, so there are no predictions to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 0/10**  
The piece is a meta‑blogging note without any scientific content; it holds no relevance to biotechnology history or future developments.
