# IDO Appears to Have Wiped Out (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports the abrupt collapse of the industry‑wide push to develop indole‑2,3‑dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors as cancer immunotherapy.  After Merck’s Phase III trial of the PD‑1 antibody Keytruda + Incyte’s IDO inhibitor epacadostat showed no added benefit, two other large Phase III programs—Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s Flexus‑derived IDO inhibitor and an unnamed partner—were quietly withdrawn from ClinicalTrials.gov.  The author argues that the failures expose a systemic problem: huge, late‑stage investments are being made on targets that look promising biochemically but lack robust early clinical validation.  He asks whether better predictive tools (e.g., AI platforms) could have averted the waste and lists several other “high‑hype” targets that later fell flat.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2018 fate of IDO inhibitors**  
* **Epacadostat (Incyte/ Merck)** – The ECHO‑301/KEYNOTE‑252 trial (Keytruda + epacadostat) was halted in May 2018 after a futility analysis. Merck discontinued the combination and later terminated all epacadostat monotherapy programs. Incyte shifted focus to other immuno‑oncology assets (e.g., the selective IDO1 inhibitor BMS‑986205 was later acquired by BMS, but that program was also stopped in 2019).  
* **BMS Flexus IDO inhibitor (BMS‑986205)** – After the Merck failure, BMS announced in April 2018 that it was dropping its Phase III IDO studies. The compound entered early‑stage development again in 2020 as a “next‑generation” IDO1/TDO dual inhibitor (BMS‑986205) but was discontinued in 2021 after modest activity in a small basket trial.  
* **Navoximod (GDC‑0919, Genentech/ Roche)** – A Phase I/II trial in melanoma (2019) showed no efficacy; Roche halted further development in 2020.  
* **Other companies** – Pfizer, Novartis, and several biotech start‑ups either paused or terminated their IDO programs by 2020. No IDO‑targeting drug has reached regulatory approval as of early 2026.  

**Impact on the field**  
* The IDO episode reinforced skepticism about “checkpoint‑plus‑metabolism” combos. Subsequent immunotherapy trials have focused more on proven synergistic pathways (e.g., LAG‑3, TIGIT, TIM‑3) rather than IDO.  
* Investment in AI‑driven target validation grew modestly; platforms such as BenevolentAI, Insilico Medicine, and Atomwise received additional funding, but none have demonstrably prevented a repeat of the IDO misstep.  
* The broader lesson—need for earlier, more predictive biomarkers—has been incorporated into trial designs (e.g., adaptive Phase II/III platforms, biomarker‑driven patient enrichment).  

**Related “failed” targets mentioned in the article**  
| Target | Outcome (2018‑2026) |
|--------|--------------------|
| **CB1 antagonists** (e.g., rimonabant) | Withdrawn from market in 2008; no new CB1 antagonists have reached approval for obesity. |
| **Cathepsin K inhibitors** (e.g., odanacatib) | Odanacatib’s Phase III trial stopped in 2016 due to stroke risk; no cathepsin K drugs approved for osteoporosis. |
| **Anti‑amyloid antibodies** | Early antibodies (bapineuzumab, solanezumab) failed; later agents (aducanumab 2021, lecanemab 2023) achieved accelerated approvals, but clinical benefit remains controversial. |
| **Mixed PPAR ligands** (e.g., aleglitazar) | Phase III failures; no mixed‑PPAR drugs approved. |
| **CETP inhibitors** (e.g., anacetrapib, evacetrapib) | Large Phase III trials (REVEAL, ACCELERATE) showed modest LDL reduction without CV benefit; programs halted. Newer CETP inhibitors (e.g., obicetrapib) are still in Phase II as of 2025. |
| **Substance P antagonists** (e.g., aprepitant for pain) | No FDA‑approved pain indication; development largely abandoned. |
| **γ‑Secretase inhibitors** (e.g., semagacestat) | Phase III Alzheimer’s trials stopped for worsening cognition; no γ‑secretase drugs approved. |

Overall, the IDO story is emblematic of a wave of high‑profile target failures that prompted a modest shift toward more rigorous early‑phase validation but did not fundamentally change the “big‑bet” funding model in biotech.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts; they are listed below with the actual outcomes.

| Prediction (as implied in the article) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“The excursion into IDO inhibitors has been a costly mistake.”** | Accurate. Combined spending by Merck, BMS, Incyte, Pfizer, and others is estimated at > $2 billion in R&D, with no approved product. |
| **“BMS/Flexus effort was doomed as well.”** | Correct. BMS cancelled its Phase III IDO studies in 2018 and later terminated the program entirely. |
| **“AI platforms like BenevolentAI could have warned people off.”** | Not realized. BenevolentAI’s “machine brain” continued to be marketed for target discovery, but there is no public evidence it flagged IDO as a dead end before the failures. |
| **“We need better ways to avoid spending Phase III money on unvalidated targets.”** | Partially addressed. Adaptive trial designs (e.g., I-SPY2, NCT NCT04511177) and biomarker‑driven enrichment have become more common, but large Phase III bets on novel immuno‑oncology combos still occur. |
| **“Other historically hyped targets (CB1, cathepsin K, CETP, etc.) will also collapse.”** | Largely true; each listed target experienced major setbacks, though a few (anti‑amyloid antibodies) later achieved conditional approvals, tempering the blanket statement. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece captures a pivotal moment in immuno‑oncology, illustrating how a single high‑profile failure can reshape an entire therapeutic class and provoke industry‑wide reflection on drug‑development strategy. Its relevance persists for investors, scientists, and policy‑makers tracking the balance between hype and evidence.
