# Understanding Antidepressants - Or Not (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary challenges the common assumption that we understand how antidepressants work, particularly SSRIs like Prozac. The author argues that while SSRIs demonstrably increase serotonin levels, the broader claim that "serotonin = happiness" or that we understand depression's underlying mechanisms is unfounded. He points to several sobering realities: the search for serotonergic gene variants linked to depression has been frustrating, antidepressant response rates are variable and unpredictable, many patients show only partial responses or discontinue treatment, and newer drugs don't show clear superiority in efficacy over older ones (though better side effect profiles improve adherence).

The author acknowledges progress in understanding mechanical aspects of brain function (like the visual cortex), but emphasizes that higher functions like emotion and cognition remain poorly understood at the mechanistic level. He suggests that better treatments are more likely to come from empirical discovery of neuroactive compounds and combinations rather than from detailed molecular understanding of depression, which remains elusive due to the brain's complexity, the limitations of our investigative tools, and the interplay of countless factors.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2018 article, several developments have reinforced the author's central thesis while also opening new research directions:

**Reinforcement of Serotonin Hypothesis Challenges**: The debate about the serotonin-depression link intensified significantly. A widely-cited 2022 umbrella review in *Molecular Psychiatry* examined the evidence for the serotonin theory of depression and concluded that the main areas of serotonin research show no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. This generated substantial public discussion about whether decades of SSRI prescribing were based on an oversimplified or incorrect biochemical model.

**Progress in Treatment Modalities**: Ketamine and esketamine gained FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression (esketamine nasal spray approved in 2019), representing the first truly novel antidepressant mechanism in decades. These work as NMDA receptor antagonists rather than through monoamine pathways, validating the author's suggestion that novel mechanisms could emerge from empirical discovery. Psychedelics (psilocybin, MDMA) have advanced through clinical trials for depression and PTSD, with breakthrough therapy designations from FDA, suggesting alternative pathways beyond traditional monoamine systems.

**Continued SSRIs as First-Line**: Despite mechanistic uncertainty, SSRIs and SNRIs remain first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines worldwide. Their real-world effectiveness has been confirmed through large-scale observational studies, even as their mechanism remains incompletely understood, exactly as the author predicted regarding empirical utility preceding mechanistic understanding.

**Research Tool Limitations Persist**: The fundamental limitations the author described—our inability to study neuronal activity at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution in living human brains—remain largely unchanged. While techniques like optogenetics, CLARITY, and advanced fMRI have progressed, they still cannot provide the granular, real-time observation of complex neural circuits that would be needed for true mechanistic understanding of depression.

**Industry R&D Challenges Continue**: Pharmaceutical companies continued to face high failure rates in CNS drug development, with several major companies scaling back or exiting neuroscience research entirely. This reinforced the author's point about the difficulty of rationally designing CNS drugs based on incomplete mechanistic understanding.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about antidepressant research and CNS drug development:

• **Prediction**: New antidepressant agents will emerge from empirical discovery rather than rational design based on mechanistic understanding.
  - **Outcome**: **Largely accurate**. Ketamine/esketamine and psychedelics represent the most significant new antidepressant mechanisms, both discovered through empirical observation of psychoactive effects rather than rational design targeting depression mechanisms. However, research continues into targeted approaches (glutamate modulators, GABAergic drugs, etc.) with mixed success.

• **Prediction**: Useful treatments can still be developed without detailed understanding of depression's cellular/molecular underpinnings.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Esketamine gained FDA approval and widespread clinical use despite incomplete understanding of its antidepressant mechanism. Psychedelic therapies show promise in trials. SSRIs remain widely prescribed despite ongoing debates about their mechanism.

• **Prediction**: It will be "quite a while" before we achieve detailed cellular and molecular understanding of depression.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. As of 2025, no comprehensive mechanistic understanding of depression exists. The field remains characterized by competing theories (neuroinflammation, neuroplasticity, network dysfunction, etc.) without consensus on primary pathophysiology.

• **Prediction**: Progress in understanding higher brain functions (cognition, emotion) will remain much harder than understanding mechanical aspects like sensory processing.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. While techniques like fMRI have improved, we still lack the ability to observe or manipulate specific neural circuits underlying complex emotions in humans with sufficient precision. Advances in artificial neural networks have provided new theoretical frameworks but haven't resolved fundamental measurement limitations in human neuroscience.

• **Implicit prediction**: The variable response rates and partial efficacy of existing antidepressants will persist.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Meta-analyses continue to show response rates around 50-60% for conventional antidepressants, with many patients experiencing only partial improvement. Treatment-resistant depression affects approximately one-third of patients, representing an ongoing clinical challenge.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about the trajectory of depression research and antidepressant development. The author correctly identified both the limitations of existing mechanistic understanding and the likely path forward through empirical discovery. The subsequent intensification of debates about the serotonin hypothesis, the emergence of ketamine and psychedelic therapies, and the persistent challenges in CNS drug development all validate the article's core insights. It remains highly relevant to ongoing discussions about evidence-based psychiatry, pharmaceutical development strategies, and the appropriate relationship between scientific understanding and clinical practice.
