# X-Ray Structures Of Everything. Without Crystals. Holy Cow (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a groundbreaking paper by Makoto Fujita's group at the University of Tokyo demonstrating "crystalline sponge method"—a technique that enables X-ray crystallography of small molecules without needing to crystallize the target molecules themselves. Instead, researchers soak solutions containing tiny amounts (as little as 80 nanograms) of compounds into porous crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which trap the molecules in defined orientations. The method was shown to work on marine natural products like miyakosyne A and could even be combined with HPLC separation for LC/SCD (liquid chromatography/single-crystal diffraction) analysis. Expert commentators in the same Nature issue described this as "breathtakingly simple" and predicted that researchers might stop trying to crystallize molecules conventionally.

## 2. HISTORY

The crystalline sponge method developed by Fujita and colleagues has had significant impact on natural product chemistry, structural biology, and drug discovery. The technique gained widespread adoption for determining structures of compounds that are difficult to crystallize. However, several limitations emerged in implementation, including the requirement to optimize the appropriate molecular cages for different compound classes. The method has led to improved methods in structural determinations of synthetic and natural products. Scientists have refined conditions involving different transition metals and organic linkers. Moreover, there are advances in MOF engineering which have led to enhancements, and various applications in analytical chemistry have developed, although it has not reached the level of being ubiquitously used by every research group. Overall, the impact reflects meaningful adoption across chemistry fields while facing practical limitations in routine use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Researchers will stop trying to crystallize new molecules conventionally.
  - **Outcome**: Crystallization has remained a primary technique in labs. Many parts of natural product structure determination continue using traditional crystallization, NMR, and other methods, though crystalline sponge provides alternative options.

• **Prediction**: LC/SCD will become a technique for routine analysis.
  - **Outcome**: The method has been specialized and is not a routine, walk-up technique as predicted. Few facilities offer robotic systems and automated analysis services using crystalline sponge methods.

• **Prediction**: Natural product structure determination would "end."
  - **Outcome**: While the method improves capabilities for nanocrystalline samples, natural product structure determination continues with conventional crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and other methods, supplemented rather than replaced by crystalline sponge approaches. 

• **Prediction**: The method would work for proteins using larger-pore MOFs.
  - **Outcome**: Though research continues, the crystalline sponge method has primarily remained limited to small molecules rather than proteins. Protein crystallography still dominates for macromolecular structural biology.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article covers a highly impactful methodology that enabled major advances in structural chemistry and brought practical benefits to natural product and small-molecule structure determination, though it did not entirely displace conventional crystallization as initially anticipated.
