# Scientific Snobbery (Mar 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article starts by pointing out a real and often-unspoken bias in science: snobbery. The author, based at the University of South Dakota, Vermillion, observes that researchers routinely make snap judgments at conferences, prioritizing work from star universities like Stanford or Harvard over more relevant studies from less famous institutions. This bias, he notes, extends to industry, where a candidate’s reputation is heavily influenced by their previous employer’s prestige rather than their individual merit. The author suggests that while this behavior is part of "human nature," the best we can do is to be aware of it and consciously correct for it, as many talented individuals come from obscure backgrounds.

## 2. HISTORY
The core issue raised in this 2013 commentary—bias favoring prestigious institutions in science—has remained a persistent and widely discussed problem. In the subsequent decade, no single policy or reform has eradicated it, but its dynamics have evolved and been studied more explicitly.

Concrete developments include:

*   **Academic and Public Discourse:** The term "prestige bias" or "status bias" has become a standard part of the vocabulary in meta-science and science policy discussions. A significant moment was a 2019 paper in *PLOS Biology* that provided large-scale evidence that faculty hiring in North America is a steep prestige hierarchy, where most professors are trained at a small number of elite universities (the "gilded" ones). This study gave empirical weight to the anecdotal experience described in the 2013 article.
*   **Rising Challenge from New Research Hubs:** The article implicitly equates prestige with traditional, established institutions. The period after 2013 saw the dramatic rise of research institutions in China (e.g., the growth of Tsinghua and Peking University in global rankings) and other countries, which began to challenge the long-standing dominance of the traditional Western "star universities."
*   **Shift to Remote and Preprint Culture:** The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a major shift to remote conferences and the widespread adoption of preprints in biology (via bioRxiv) and other fields. This partially changed the dynamics of scientific presentation. Conference snobbery became less about an institution's name on a nametag and more about the data presented in a Zoom window or the perceived rigor of a preprint. However, the brand of the institution still carries significant weight on a CV.
*   **Industry Trends in Biopharma:** The biopharma landscape continued its long-term trend of fragmentation. The period after 2013 saw a boom in venture capital for new biotech startups. In this environment, the "pedigree" of an executive team (e.g., having experience at a successful company like Genentech, Vertex, or one of the few elite biotech firms—the "blue bloods") became, if anything, *more* important for securing funding and talent. This confirms the author's observation about industrial snobbery.
*   **No Central Policy Fix:** No top-down policy, like a change in grant review from major funding bodies (NIH, NSF), has successfully eliminated this bias. While NIH has made efforts (e.g., training on unconscious bias), the peer review process's reliance on investigator "track record" continues to perpetuate a system where prestige begets more prestige.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article is retrospective and doesn't make explicit predictions about the future. It's a commentary on a persistent, human-nature-driven problem. The implicit prediction is that this state of affairs will likely continue.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**
The article addresses a real and chronic issue in the scientific community, but it offers only an observation without proposing any concrete solutions or providing novel insights, limiting its long-term importance.
