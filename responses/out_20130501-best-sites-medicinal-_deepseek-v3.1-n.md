# Best Sites for a Medicinal Chemist? (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This May 2013 blog post is a call for suggestions rather than a traditional article. The author is traveling and solicits recommendations for the best websites that medicinal chemists should bookmark. The request seeks comprehensive resources across medicine, biology, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceutical development. The author notes that while shorter lists exist, there isn't one comprehensive, easily findable resource, and they aim to crowdsource suggestions from readers to create a valuable compiled list.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2013 post, several developments reshaped how medicinal chemists access information:

**Resource Aggregation**: Comprehensive curated lists did emerge, including institution-maintained resource pages, professional society repositories (ACS Medicinal Chemistry Division), and community-driven platforms like Reddit's r/MedicinalChemistry and Chemistry Stack Exchange.

**Open Access Movement**: Major shifts occurred with PubMed Central expansion, preprint servers (bioRxiv, chemRxiv from 2017), and open-access chemistry databases becoming more comprehensive and freely available.

**Commercial Platform Evolution**: Reaxys, SciFinder, and PubChem significantly enhanced functionality. KNIME and other cheminformatics platforms integrated more medicinal chemistry workflows.

**Professional Development**: Online learning platforms (Coursera, edX) developed specialized medicinal chemistry courses, and virtual conferences became established, especially accelerating during 2020-2021.

**Tool and Database Proliferation**: Structure databases (PDB, ChEMBL), ADMET prediction tools, and virtual screening platforms became more sophisticated and web-accessible.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions present in the post:**
• That the internet would remain the primary information source for medicinal chemists ✓ **Accurate** - Web-based resources continued to dominate
• That crowdsourcing would generate a valuable comprehensive list ✓ **Partially accurate** - Multiple lists were created, though no single universally adopted "one big list" emerged; fragmentation persisted across institutional and commercial repositories
• That commented suggestions would accumulate into something useful ✓ **Accurate** - Community input did contribute to resource identification, though the format evolved to forums, social media, and collaborative documents rather than blog comments

**Broader context**: The post predates major shifts toward mobile-first access, AI-driven literature analysis, and the widespread adoption of preprints in chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The post is a practical question rather than a forward-looking analysis or substantive report, so it has limited lasting importance. While it captures a genuine information-seeking need of the time, it lacks analytical depth and doesn't discuss emerging trends or novel insights about medicinal chemistry or the biotechnology industry. The interest derives mainly from its value as a historical snapshot of how scientists sought information resources in 2013.
