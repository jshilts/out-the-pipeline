# CNS Drug Development Claims Another Victim (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reported on Allon Therapeutics' failure of its lead compound davunetide in Phase 2/3 clinical trials for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Davunetide was an oligopeptide derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), representing a small Vancouver-based company's attempt to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. The drug failed both primary endpoints in its pivotal trial, illustrating the high-risk nature of CNS drug development, particularly in neurodegeneration, and highlighting how many such research efforts proceed unknown to the public despite their scientific significance.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the December 2012 trial failure, Allon Therapeutics faced immediate financial collapse. The company delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in March 2013 and was acquired by FPC Capital Corp in a reverse takeover transaction. The davunetide compound itself did not advance further in clinical development for any indication.

The broader field of neurodegenerative drug development continued to face similar challenges. Between 1998-2017, the clinical success rate for Alzheimer's disease drugs was approximately 2-3%, far below the 10-20% average across all therapeutic areas. No disease-modifying treatments for PSP have been approved by FDA to date, though symptomatic treatments like levodopa and amantadine remain in use.

The ADNP protein pathway that davunetide targeted has seen continued basic research interest, with studies identifying its role in autism spectrum disorders and maintaining tau protein homeostasis. However, no ADNP-derived therapeutics have reached market approval.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article predictions/assumptions evaluated:**

• **Implicit prediction: Neurodegeneration research background would remain underappreciated** - **Accurate**. Public awareness of drug failure rates remained limited, though increased transparency initiatives emerged gradually.

• **Implicit prediction: Small company failures represent typical drug research outcomes** - **Accurate**. Small biotech companies continue to face >90% clinical failure rates for new molecular entities.

The article made no explicit forward-looking predictions about davunetide's ultimate success or the broader field.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 3/9**

This article represents a routine example of the high failure rates in CNS drug development rather than a landmark case. While it illustrates important industry challenges, davunetide's failure did not fundamentally reshape the field or represent an exceptional scientific or commercial development.
