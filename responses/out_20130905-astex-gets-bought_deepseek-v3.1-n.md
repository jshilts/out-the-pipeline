# Astex Gets Bought (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that Astex Pharmaceuticals, a pioneer in fragment-based drug discovery, was acquired by Japanese pharmaceutical company Otsuka for $886 million in September 2013. The acquisition was primarily driven by Otsuka's interest in Astex's oncology drug portfolio and their unique fragment-based drug discovery platform. 

The president of Otsuka expressed commitment to preserving Astex's research operations and culture, emphasizing respect for Astex's "uniqueness" and fragment-based technology. The article notes that Japanese pharmaceutical companies had generally maintained their promises to leave acquired research operations intact, suggesting this approach made strategic sense given Astex's specialized capabilities in fragment-based discovery methods.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 acquisition, Astex continued operations as a subsidiary of Otsuka. In 2014, Astex's investigational drug **estevamertide (AT9283)**, a multi-kinase inhibitor, progressed in clinical trials for various cancers, though it ultimately did not receive FDA approval for widespread use.

**Kisqali (ribociclib)**, developed through Astex's fragment-based discovery platform, received FDA approval in March 2017 for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with aromatase inhibitors. This became the most significant commercial success associated with Astex's technology, with global sales reaching over $1 billion annually by the early 2020s.

However, other Astex-discovered compounds faced challenges. **SGI-110 (guadecitabine)**, a next-generation DNA methyltransferase inhibitor for acute myeloid leukemia, failed to meet primary endpoints in Phase 3 trials around 2019-2020, leading to pipeline setbacks.

Otsuka maintained its commitment to Astex's research independence, with Astex continuing its fragment-based drug discovery operations in Cambridge, UK, contributing to Otsuka's broader oncology research efforts through the late 2010s and early 2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: Otsuka would "continue to respect Astex's uniqueness and leverage it to bring further growth"**  
*Outcome:* Partially accurate. Otsuka did maintain Astex's operational independence as promised, characteristic of Japanese pharmaceutical acquisition strategies. However, the "further growth" was mixed - while Kisqali became a blockbuster success, other pipeline candidates failed, making the overall growth trajectory more modest than perhaps envisioned.

**• Implied prediction: Astex's fragment-based platform would continue delivering value**  
*Outcome:* This proved accurate. Fragment-based drug discovery remained scientifically valuable, and Kisqali's approval demonstrated the platform's continued relevance. However, the modest rate of subsequent approvals suggested more realistic timelines and success rates than early enthusiasm might have suggested.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important validation milestone for fragment-based drug discovery through a major acquisition, though the long-term impact was more measured - one significant drug success among other pipeline disappointments, making it moderately interesting rather than transformative.
