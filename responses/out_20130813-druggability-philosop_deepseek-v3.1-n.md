# Druggability: A Philosophical Investigation (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses a philosophical question about the fundamental limits of drug discovery: whether there exists a drug for every biologically possible therapeutic goal. Using analogies from software development and engineering—where physical possibility generally guarantees that a program or machine can be built—the author explores why biochemistry might be different.

Key arguments include:
- Unlike computing (governed by Turing machines and Church-Turing principles), biochemistry resists mathematical formalization due to its algorithmic complexity
- We know disease-free biochemical states exist (people without MS, diabetes, etc.), so the challenge is restoration rather than fundamental impossibility
- However, some conditions like late-stage Alzheimer's may be practically incurable due to irreversible information loss
- Even when mechanisms exist (like insulin deficiency in diabetes), small-molecule solutions may not be possible—protein-protein interactions are harder to mimic than disrupt
- For conditions like schizophrenia, even complete knowledge of all receptor subtypes wouldn't automatically reveal the right therapeutic approach
- The "druggable universe" of molecules, while vast, may still have questions for which no chemical answer exists—echoing Wittgenstein's limits on expressibility

## 2. HISTORY

**Alzheimer's Disease**: The article's pessimistic view about late-stage Alzheimer's being incurable has largely held true. Between 2013-2024, numerous drug candidates failed in clinical trials targeting amyloid and tau pathology. The much-hyped aducanumab received controversial FDA approval in 2021 despite mixed efficacy data, and lecanemab showed modest cognitive benefits in 2022-2023 but with safety concerns. Current clinical practice still focuses on symptom management rather than cure, validating the author's concern that information loss and neuronal death create fundamental barriers.

**Diabetes Treatment**: The landscape has evolved significantly. While no small-molecule insulin mimetic has emerged (confirming the author's prediction), GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) became blockbuster drugs for type 2 diabetes and obesity. These work through different mechanisms than direct insulin replacement. Artificial pancreas systems combining continuous glucose monitoring with automated insulin delivery have improved type 1 diabetes management, though the fundamental challenge of perfect physiological mimicry remains. Stem cell-derived beta cell transplantation has advanced but requires immunosuppression.

**Schizophrenia Treatment**: The "which combination" problem identified in the article persists. Second-generation antipsychotics still dominate, with clozapine remaining the gold standard for treatment-resistant cases. However, meta-analyses show most patients experience suboptimal outcomes, and the mechanistic understanding remains incomplete. The field has shifted toward early intervention and personalized approaches, but no breakthrough therapies emerged that fundamentally changed the treatment paradigm.

**Protein-Protein Interaction Drugs**: The prediction that disrupting interactions is easier than mimicking them proved accurate. Successes include venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor, approved 2016), sotorasib (KRAS inhibitor, approved 2021), and various checkpoint inhibitors in oncology. However, these remain exceptions—PPI modulation remains extremely challenging.

**Druggability Assessment**: The concept of "druggability" became more sophisticated through structural genomics and chemoproteomics. Computational tools now better predict binding site characteristics, but the fundamental limits identified in 2013 still constrain drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Small-molecule insulin mimetic unlikeliness**: ✅ **Accurate**
- No such drug reached market or even late-stage trials. Insulin analogs and delivery systems improved, but the fundamental challenge of mimicking insulin's receptor binding with small molecules proved insurmountable, exactly as predicted.

**Alzheimer's incurability at late stages**: ✅ **Largely accurate**
- Clinical trial evidence strongly supports this. Even drugs showing plaque reduction like aducanumab and lecanemab provide only modest symptomatic benefit at best. The field shifted toward earlier intervention and prevention, implicitly accepting the limits of late-stage treatment.

**Schizophrenia mechanism complexity**: ✅ **Accurate**
- No breakthrough mechanistic understanding emerged. The dopamine hypothesis evolved but remains incomplete. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia still affects ~30% of patients, and targeted polypharmacology ("which combination" problem) remains poorly understood.

**Protein-protein disruption being easier than restoration**: ✅ **Accurate**
- The most successful new drugs disrupting PPIs (venetoclax, KRAS inhibitors) confirm this asymmetry. Restoring disrupted interactions with small molecules remains extraordinarily difficult, with few successes.

**"Long, long time before we hit chemical language limits"**: ✅ **Accurate**
- While AI drug discovery (AlphaFold, generative chemistry) accelerated in the 2020s, fundamental biological complexity still limits success rates. Most drug discovery programs still fail, confirming the author's assessment that we're far from hitting theoretical limits due to biological rather than chemical constraints.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about the fundamental challenges facing drug discovery, correctly identifying specific bottlenecks (insulin mimetics, late-stage neurodegeneration, schizophrenia complexity) that persisted over a decade later. Its philosophical framework proved more useful than optimistic technological predictions common in 2013.
