# How To Enhance Your Online Reputation. Sure. (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a follow-up to the Anil Potti cancer research scandal at Duke University. Potti, a researcher who had faked clinical trial results and left Duke with numerous retracted papers, had hired an online reputation management firm to improve his public image. The reputation firm employed deceptive tactics, including filing a false DMCA takedown notice claiming that critical blog posts about Potti on Retraction Watch were actually plagiarized from a fake Indian news site called "Newsbulet.in." The takedown notice was fraudulent—the domain didn't exist until months after the original posts, and the contact information pointed to a London nightclub. The author criticized both the dishonesty of the reputation management attempt and its ultimate futility, noting that Google results about Potti still prominently featured details of the scandal and discussion of this DMCA manipulation. The article demonstrates how attempts to suppress information online often backfire and become counterproductive.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the consequences of Potti's research misconduct continued to unfold:

**Legal and Institutional Actions:**
- The Duke cancer research scandal led to multiple institutional investigations and settlements, with Duke University facing lawsuits from patients and families affected by the flawed clinical trials
- In 2015, Duke agreed to pay $112.5 million to settle lawsuits related to flawed cancer research that included Potti's work
- The scandal prompted broader scrutiny of oversight mechanisms in academic medical research and conflicts of interest

**Career and Professional Consequences:**
- Despite reputation management attempts, Potti's name remained permanently associated with research fraud in academic circles
- The fraudulent DMCA takedown strategy was exposed and criticized across multiple science blogs and news outlets, further damaging rather than improving his reputation
- Potti moved to North Dakota and established a cancer treatment clinic, where he continued to face scrutiny and opposition from the medical community

**Research Integrity Impact:**
- The case became a landmark example in discussions about research integrity and oversight in personalized medicine
- It contributed to increased awareness about the importance of reproducibility in cancer research
- The scandal influenced institutional policies regarding data verification and clinical trial oversight at multiple research institutions

**Regulatory and Policy Changes:**
- The case was frequently cited in discussions leading to enhanced research oversight requirements
- It contributed to ongoing debates about strengthening mechanisms for detecting and preventing research misconduct
- The visible failure of reputation management attempts reinforced that scientific misconduct has lasting, public consequences in the digital age

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made the following explicit predictions and observations about their likely outcomes:

• **Prediction: Reputation management attempts would fail** ✓ Accurate
  - "Getting the internet off of you is impossible" - This proved correct, as Potti's name remained prominently associated with research misconduct in search results and academic discussions for years afterward

• **Prediction: The fraudulent DMCA tactic would backfire** ✓ Accurate  
  - The article suggested that the takedown attempt was so poorly executed that it would draw more attention to the scandal - This happened almost immediately, with multiple science blogs and news sites (including Ars Technica) covering the fraudulent DMCA claims, amplifying rather than suppressing the negative coverage

• **Prediction: Google results would continue showing scandal details** ✓ Accurate
  - The author noted that early reputation management success in keeping the scandal off the first page of Google results "didn't last long" - Subsequent years showed Potti's name remained strongly associated with research misconduct in search results

• **Implicit prediction: Such tactics reflect poorly on scientific integrity** ✓ Accurate
  - The article's tone suggested that attempts to cover up misconduct rather than address it honestly would compound reputational damage - This proved correct in both the short and long term

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses an important intersection of research ethics, digital transparency, and reputation management in science, but it's primarily a follow-up piece about an already-known scandal rather than breaking new ground on scientific or policy developments.
