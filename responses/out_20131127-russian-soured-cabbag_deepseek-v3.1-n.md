# Russian Soured Cabbage (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a fermented cabbage recipe post rather than a biotechnology article. It provides detailed instructions for making Russian soured cabbage using fresh cabbage, salt, carrots, apple, cranberries, and caraway seeds. The recipe involves a fermentation process lasting 4-5 days at room temperature, with the author noting that initial gas production comes from Leuconostoc mesenteroides bacteria, which creates anaerobic conditions for Lactobacillus plantarum to produce lactic acid and the characteristic sour flavor. The post describes the culinary result as milder than traditional sauerkraut, with a flavor profile resembling rye bread due to the caraway seeds.

## 2. HISTORY
This blog post from Science magazine's blog section was a cooking/recipe entry, not a biotechnology research article or industry commentary. Since publication in November 2013, this appears to remain a recipe blog post with no documented subsequent developments in terms of clinical trials, FDA approvals, drug developments, or biotech industry impact. The fermentation microbiology described (Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus species) represents well-established scientific knowledge that has been understood for decades in food science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This recipe post contains no predictions about biotechnology, drug development, or industry trends. No predictive statements about future developments could be identified.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 1/9**

This is a cooking recipe blog post published in a science magazine's general interest blog, not a biotechnology industry article. It falls outside the scope of biotechnology industry commentary entirely and therefore ranks in the bottom decile for interest in that context.
