# Put Them in Cells and Find Out (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a landmark 2014 study from Ben Cravatt's group that experimentally investigated how many proteins small molecules actually bind to in cellular assays. The researchers created a library of approximately 60 diverse compounds using Ugi chemistry, each containing a small diazirine photoaffinity handle and an alkyne for click chemistry tagging. When they treated PC-3 prostate cancer cells with these compounds and performed photoaffinity labeling, they found that most compounds bound to multiple proteins (1-9 targets each), with the six closely studied compounds collectively labeling about 24 different proteins. Notably, only half of these proteins were previously known to have small-molecule ligands. The study revealed several important findings: small molecules typically hit multiple targets in cells, non-enzymatic proteins (like scaffolding and signaling proteins) can still bind small molecules, and certain proteins act as "promiscuous binders" that interact with many different compounds. These findings challenged assumptions about target selectivity and suggested more potential binding sites exist than previously recognized.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2014 publication, the key findings and technological approaches had several important impacts on drug discovery and chemical biology:

**Technology Adoption and Refinement**: The photoaffinity labeling approach using diazirine groups became increasingly adopted in target identification and validation studies. By 2016-2020, these methods were widely recognized as valuable for phenotypic screening follow-up.

**Clinical and Pipeline Impact**: Several outcomes can be traced:
- **NAMPT inhibitors** (mentioned as promiscuous binder): Multiple NAMPT inhibitors entered clinical trials for cancer treatment. Most failed due to dose-limiting toxicities (e.g., GMX1777, FK866), demonstrating the challenges when targeting metabolic enzymes.
- **Chemical Biology Tool Development**: The study contributed to the growing field of chemoproteomics, which by 2018-2020 had become a standard approach for target identification.
- **Polypharmacology Recognition**: The field increasingly acknowledged that "selective" drugs often hit multiple targets, leading to more systematic off-target profiling using methods like the one described.

**Business Impact**: While not directly leading to specific drug approvals, this type of research supported the broader shift toward phenotypic screening and target identification platforms. Companies specializing in chemoproteomics emerged and gained traction (e.g., Vividion Therapeutics, acquired by Bayer in 2021 for $1.5-2 billion).

The actual therapeutic success from discovering new binding sites has been mixed - while some new binding pockets led to drug candidates, many faced challenges in achieving sufficient selectivity and safety.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predicted**: The article suggested that most small molecules hit multiple proteins (1-12 targets) rather than being highly selective.
**Outcome**: ✓ **Broadly accurate** - The field increasingly recognized polypharmacology as common. However, drug discovery still pursues selective compounds when possible for safety reasons.

**Predicted**: More small-molecule binding sites exist than previously thought, including on non-enzymatic proteins.
**Outcome**: ✓ **Confirmed** - Chemoproteomics revealed many "ligandable" proteins beyond enzymes, though this hasn't translated into as many successful drugs as hoped.

**Predicted**: Promiscuous binding proteins (including newly identified ones like PTGR, VDAC subtypes) would be important to understand.
**Outcome**: ✓ **Partially realized** - These proteins have been studied, but whether they became important drug targets is unclear. Some proteins like these have remained research tools rather than therapeutic targets.

**Implied Prediction**: Non-enzymatic proteins could become drug targets.
**Outcome**: ± **Modest success** - While some progress occurred (e.g., protein-protein interaction inhibitors), most successful drugs still target enzymes or receptors. The promise of drugging scaffolding/signaling proteins proved harder to realize than hoped.

The broader implication that more binding sites exist was correct, but the practical translation to drugs has been slower than optimistic 2014 expectations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important methodological advance that influenced chemical biology and target identification approaches, leading to real technological adoption even if therapeutic translation proved more challenging than hoped.
