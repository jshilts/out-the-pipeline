# The Norbornyl Cation Structure (Really) (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article announces that the long-standing debate over the structure of the norbornyl cation—a classic controversy in organic chemistry—has been definitively resolved through a low-temperature crystal structure. The structure confirms the "nonclassical" configuration proposed by Winstein and supported by Olah and Schleyer, definitively refuting H. C. Brown's opposing view. Although most chemists had already accepted the nonclassical interpretation for years, this 2013 experimental result provided the conclusive proof. A memorable quote from the then-95-year-old J. D. Roberts suggests that even this definitive evidence wouldn't have changed H. C. Brown's mind.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 low-temperature crystal structure (published in *Science*) by Scholz et al. marked the definitive end to one of organic chemistry's most iconic debates (Keese, 2006). By 2024, the norbornyl cation stands as a settled textbook example of nonclassical bonding, with the 2013 result widely cited in organic chemistry education. The biomolecular/biotechnology impact was indirect; this was primarily an advancement in fundamental chemical theory and physical organic chemistry methodology. The main practical legacy is pedagogical: the norbornyl cation is now standard material in advanced organic chemistry curricula as a clear, historically documented case study in mechanism verification and scientific dispute resolution.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction:** The 2013 crystal structure would be the "last shot fired" in the debate.
  - **Outcome:** This proved correct. By 2024, there have been no significant subsequent challenges to the 2013 result, and the nonclassical structure is universally accepted in the chemical literature and textbooks.

- **Prediction (implied):** H. C. Brown would not have been persuaded even by this evidence.
  - **Outcome:** This prediction was made by J. D. Roberts in 2013 in past tense about Brown's hypothetical response. Brown had died in 2004, so we cannot directly test this, but given his lifelong position it is plausible he would have remained skeptical.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

Shows how long-standing scientific debates are resolved with modern techniques, offering pedagogical value and historical perspective.
