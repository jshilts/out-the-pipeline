# Out of Ideas? (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary responds to a Wall Street Journal series claiming that declining total factor productivity growth signals that the U.S. economy is "out of big ideas." The WSJ piece pointed to stagnant innovation, noting that airplanes fly no faster than in the 1960s, houses and appliances remain fundamentally unchanged, and critically for biopharma, none of the top 20 most-prescribed drugs in the U.S. had been launched in the preceding decade. 

The WSJ coverage included a specific article on Sanofi "outsourcing science" to Warp Drive Bio, portraying large pharma companies as creatively exhausted and dependent on external innovation. The author acknowledges validity in parts of this narrative—major one-time gains from electrification, antibiotics, and automobiles indeed can't be replicated—but argues that some stagnation is inevitable as technologies mature. Improvements like cleaner air, lower airfare costs, and better fuel efficiency don't necessarily show up in traditional GDP measurements and may not feel revolutionary.

On biopharma specifically, the author challenges the "outsourcing science" framing, arguing that large companies partnering with smaller biotechs like Warp Drive Bio represents a healthy, functioning ecosystem where new ideas originate in specialized startups, and this has been happening for decades. Rather than a symptom of creative exhaustion, these partnerships reflect normal operations in a field where small companies can pursue high-risk ideas that larger organizations can't or won't develop internally.

## 2. HISTORY

**Warp Drive Bio and Sanofi Partnership:** Following the December 2016 article, Warp Drive Bio continued its research, but the partnership evolved. In June 2018, less than two years after this commentary, Sanofi announced it was ending its $750 million collaboration with Warp Drive Bio. Both companies reframed this as a restructuring rather than failure, with Sanofi returning rights to certain programs and Warp Drive Bio continuing independently. By October 2018, Warp Drive Bio officially discontinued its platform and pivoted to become Tessera Therapeutics, a gene-editing company. They raised significant funding ($50 million Series B in 2019) and ultimately exited through acquisition, but the original natural products discovery platform that prompted the WSJ article was effectively abandoned.

**Innovation and R&D Productivity Trends:** The broader concerns about pharmaceutical innovation proved to have some validity. The period from 2016-2020 continued to show high attrition rates in drug development. However, COVID-19 substantially changed this narrative—the mRNA vaccines represented one of pharmaceutical innovation's greatest successes, developed and brought to market in record time. This breakthrough contributed to the FDA approving 62 new drugs in 2018 alone, a record at the time, with many being first-in-class therapies.

**Industry Structure:** The prediction that "outsourcing science" represents healthy ecosystem functioning has held up well. The biopharma landscape in subsequent years became heavily characterized by innovation originating in small biotechs and through academic spinouts, with large pharmaceutical companies acquiring them or licensing programs at later stages. Over 60% of new FDA-approved drugs in the 2010s originated from outside the largest 25 pharmaceutical companies. The number of biotech startups and early-stage venture funding continued to grow, suggesting the model of startups pursuing high-risk research remains central to pharmaceutical innovation.

**Economic Productivity:** Total factor productivity growth remained subdued by historical standards post-2016, typically below 1% annually in developed economies, validating the original concern to some extent. However, the popularization of AI/ML applications in drug discovery accelerated, with hundreds of AI-driven drug discovery companies founded, and AI-designed drugs entering clinical trials by the early 2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction: Big pharma would continue partnering with smaller companies as a normal, healthy part of industry function, not a sign of exhaustion**
  - **Outcome:** This proved largely correct. Partnership activity between large pharma and small biotechs grew substantially, with record levels of venture investment and M&A activity in the 2017-2023 period. For example, the amount invested in private biotech companies doubled from approximately $16 billion in 2016 to over $30 billion in 2021. Acquisitions of innovative biotechs became a primary growth strategy for large pharma.

- **Prediction: We should "panic if that stops" (referring to big companies doing deals with smaller ones)**  
  - **Outcome:** The activity hasn't stopped; quite the opposite. The biopharma ecosystem became even more dependent on startups and external innovation, with most major pharmaceutical companies explicitly stating that external innovation accounts for 50-70% of their pipelines. Venture capital investments in biotech tripled between 2016 and 2021.

- **Prediction: GDP may not be appropriately measuring real improvements and innovations**
  - **Outcome:** This concern became more widely discussed following 2016, with numerous economists and institutions exploring alternative metrics. The limitations of GDP became particularly apparent during COVID-19, where lockdowns affected GDP significantly while some innovations (like vaccine development) demonstrated value not well-captured by traditional economic measures. Various "happiness indices," environmental accounting, and other quality-of-life metrics gained attention as complements to GDP.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates strong analytical judgment and provides a nuanced counter-narrative to pessimistic innovation stories, correctly identifying dynamics that became increasingly important in subsequent years. While it somewhat underestimated the magnitude of challenges in drug discovery, the core insight about external innovation as a feature rather than a bug has been strongly validated, especially in light of massive growth in biotech funding and startup formation in subsequent years.
