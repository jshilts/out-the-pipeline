# One of Those (September 29, 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a lawsuit filed by Incyte Corporation against Flexus Biosciences and its executives over alleged theft of trade secrets. Incyte claims that Dr. Jordan Fridman, its chief scientific officer who was privy to confidential clinical trial results for Incyte's IDO-1 inhibitor cancer drug, improperly shared confidential information after being hired by Flexus. The lawsuit alleges that this inside information allowed Flexus to "bet the company" on the same IDO mechanism and then sell its assets to Bristol-Myers Squibb for $1.25 billion within 18 months of formation. The article examines the unusual circumstances of the case, including Fridman's three-month delay between giving notice and actually leaving Incyte, and questions what specific confidential information could have made Flexus's program so valuable. The author notes that multiple companies were already pursuing IDO as a drug target, raising questions about what unique insights Incyte's data could have provided to justify the billion-dollar acquisition.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent history of IDO inhibitors proved to be sobering and largely disappointing:

**Clinical Failures**: Incyte's IDO-1 inhibitor, epacadostat, failed in Phase 3 clinical trials in 2018 when combined with Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for melanoma patients, showing no additional benefit over Keytruda alone. This failure effectively ended epacadostat's development.

**Business Impact**: The clinical failures led to substantial write-downs and restructuring. Pfizer terminated its IDO development programs, and other companies either halted or reprioritized their IDO inhibitor pipelines.

**Bristol-Myers Squibb Outcome**: Despite the $1.25 billion acquisition of Flexus in 2015, Bristol-Myers Squibb ultimately discontinued development of their IDO program. The high-value acquisition preceded the discovery that the clinical approach was flawed.

**Mechanism Understanding**: Subsequent research revealed that IDO inhibition alone was insufficient to overcome cancer immunosuppression, as TDO (tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase) serves a redundant function, and cancer cells can upregulate multiple immune checkpoint pathways.

**Legal Resolution**: The lawsuit between Incyte and Flexus was resolved out of court, with no significant public disclosures about any specific trade secrets. The confidentiality of the settlement meant that the core question of what information justified the Flexus acquisition remained unanswered.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction that IDO-1 inhibitors would become successful cancer treatments**: The assumption underlying both Incyte's lawsuit and Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition was that access to Incyte's clinical data would lead to a successful drug program. **Outcome**: This proved incorrect; IDO-1 inhibitors failed to demonstrate efficacy in multiple Phase 3 trials, and no IDO inhibitor has received FDA approval for cancer treatment.

• **Implication that the trade secrets would lead to competitive advantage in the IDO space**: Both companies operated on the assumption that proprietary information about Incyte's successful Phase 2 results would translate to clinical and commercial success. **Outcome**: The mechanism itself appears to have been fundamentally flawed, making proprietary data about patient selection or trial design largely irrelevant.

• **Suggestion that the lawsuit would reveal scientifically valuable information if it went to trial**: The author expressed hope that an open trial would reveal "what key piece of information would have made their data package compelling enough." **Outcome**: The case settled privately, preventing public disclosure of any scientific insights or confirming whether the confidential information truly provided strategic value.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a compelling intersection of corporate intrigue, intellectual property disputes, and the inherent uncertainties of drug development. The story remains highly relevant because it highlights how billions of dollars can be deployed based on scientific assumptions that later prove incorrect, and how quickly therapeutic targets can transition from "hot" to abandoned in biotechnology.
