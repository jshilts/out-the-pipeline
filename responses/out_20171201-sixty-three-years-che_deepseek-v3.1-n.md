# Sixty-Three Years in Chemistry: An Interview with Donald Batesky (December 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is an interview with Donald Batesky, an 85-year-old synthetic organic chemist at the University of Rochester, discussing his 63-year career in chemistry. Batesky graduated from Purdue in 1954 and began work immediately at Kodak in their Synthetic Chemicals division, where he spent decades doing custom synthesis, process chemistry, and technical services work. He describes making numerous compounds including pharmaceutical ingredients (the X-ray contrast agent Pantopaque/iophendylate, the antihelminthic pyrvinium), uranium processing chemicals, liquid crystals, photochromic agents, and flavoring agents. After taking early retirement from Kodak in 1991, he returned to custom synthesis work for Aldrich Chemicals, producing nearly 600 products over fifteen years, and continued working into his eighties at the University of Rochester making nickel ligands and other compounds. The article provides a window into the evolution of industrial chemistry from the 1950s through the 2010s, including changes in business models, safety practices, and the transition from small-volume custom work to large-scale chemical supply companies.

## 2. HISTORY
The article was published in December 2017, with an update noting Batesky's death on September 19, 2018—nine months after the interview. His career spanned the second half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, covering major transformations in the chemical industry. The compounds he worked on reflect these changes: iophendylate (Pantopaque) was introduced in 1944, used through the 1970s, and was ultimately replaced by water-soluble contrast agents. Pyrvinium pamoate remains in use as an antihelminthic treatment today, demonstrating the longevity of some mid-century pharmaceutical discoveries; research continued into its potential anticancer applications. The broader industrial context includes Kodak's shift away from the fine chemicals business, with many of these operations eventually consolidated or discontinued—consistent with Batesky's observation that the chemicals business was taken over by Tennessee Eastman, who "had no idea of how to run a bottle business." His transition to work for Aldrich reflects the rise of specialized chemical suppliers filling niches left by large industrial manufacturers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article contains a historical interview rather than forward-looking predictions about biotechnology or healthcare. It documents Batesky's personal predictions about his own career trajectory—specifically his concerns, upon retiring, that "you need something to do!" and later wondering "Is this the end of the trail?" when lab space was needed back. These concerns were resolved by his continued work: he found lab space at Kodak again, did custom synthesis for Aldrich for another fifteen years, and later worked at the University of Rochester. His self-assessment proved modest; rather than winding down his career at retirement age, he continued making chemicals for decades more, indicating that his personal expectations about stopping were repeatedly exceeded by opportunities to continue doing what he loved.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
This is a personal career retrospective and oral history rather than analytical commentary about the biotechnology industry. While it touches on chemical manufacturing relevant to drug development (including a contrast agent and antiparasitic), it lacks substantive analysis of industry trends, technological predictions, or concrete outcomes related to the biotech sector. It serves primarily as a human-interest profile of a chemist, exploring themes like lifelong learning, industrial safety evolution, and the personal rewards of hands-on chemistry work. The piece is well-written and engaging for those interested in chemistry careers, but it offers limited content relevant to biotech outcomes or evaluation of industry predictions.
