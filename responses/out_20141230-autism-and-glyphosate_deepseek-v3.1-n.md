# Autism and Glyphosate: (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article from Science Magazine's "Pipeline" blog addresses alarming claims being circulated about glyphosate and autism. Specifically, it responds to emails the author is receiving about a prediction by MIT researcher Stephanie Seneff that "half of all children will be autistic by 2025." The author characterizes Seneff's views on glyphosate as "tendentious and shoddily backed up," noting that her work lacks original research and ignores important invalidating evidence. The article also mentions that the website promoting this autism prediction simultaneously promotes the thoroughly discredited claim about MMR vaccine links to autism, which the author sees as disqualifying. The author positions this as part of a pattern of poor-quality claims about glyphosate, referencing an earlier 2013 post that criticized similar work by Seneff.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent developments largely vindicated the author's skeptical assessment:

**Glyphosate Research and Regulation (2014-2024):** Major regulatory bodies worldwide continued to review glyphosate safety. The EPA's 2015 review concluded glyphosate is "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans." The European Food Safety Authority reached similar conclusions in 2015 and 2023. The WHO's IARC classification of glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic" in 2015 created ongoing controversy and litigation, but hundreds of subsequent studies failed to establish clear causal links to cancer or autism at environmental exposure levels.

**Autism Rates and Etiology:** National autism prevalence data from CDC shows steady increases since 2014, with rates moving from approximately 1 in 59 children (2014 estimates) to 1 in 36 children by 2023. However, these increases are primarily attributed to improved screening, diagnostic criteria expansion, and increased awareness rather than environmental causes. The 2025 prediction that "half of all children" would be autistic clearly failed to materialize.

**Seneff's Influence:** Seneff continued publishing papers on glyphosate and health through mid-2020s, often in lower-tier or predatory journals, and became associated with COVID-19 misinformation. Her work has been widely criticized by toxicologists and epidemiologists for methodological flaws and cherry-picking evidence.

**Glyphosate Litigation:** Beginning around 2017, thousands of lawsuits were filed claiming glyphosate causes cancer, leading to multi-billion dollar settlements. However, no lawsuits emerged connecting glyphosate to autism, and the scientific consensus remains that glyphosate does not cause autism.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself did not make specific predictions about the future, but rather criticized a prediction made by Stephanie Seneff.

**Seneff's Prediction Discussed in Article:**
• **"Half of all children will be autistic by 2025"** - This prediction clearly failed completely. Current 2024 autism prevalence estimates from CDC are approximately 1 in 36 children (about 2.8%), dramatically different from 50%. The increase in diagnosed autism cases has been steady but modest, primarily reflecting better screening and diagnostic practices rather than explosive epidemic growth.

No other specific predictions were made in this brief commentary article.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3/9**

This article has moderate historical interest as an early warning about misinformation that would grow significantly in subsequent years, particularly around glyphosate safety and anti-vaccine messaging. However, it's primarily a brief blog post responding to already-discredited claims rather than containing novel analysis or predictions worth long-term tracking.
