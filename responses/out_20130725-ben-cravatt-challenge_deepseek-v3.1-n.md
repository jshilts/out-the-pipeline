# Article Title (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article summarizes a presentation by Ben Cravatt on activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of serine hydrolase enzymes, which constitute up to 2% of all human proteins but remain largely uncharacterized, with only 10% having useful pharmacological tools. Cravatt discusses two case studies: PF-3845, a covalent FAAH inhibitor discovered by Pfizer that was abandoned due to its reactive arylurea mechanism, and JZL184, a MAGL inhibitor with cross-reactivity to FAAH despite a 300-fold potency window.

The key technical insight highlighted is that covalent inhibitors targeting serine hydrolases pose unique selectivity challenges due to the long half-life (12-14 hours) of enzyme inactivation in the brain. Cravatt recommends 2000-5000-fold selectivity windows for practical therapeutic use, as even 300-fold can lead to behavioral issues in mouse models when multiple enzymes are inhibited. The article also notes that while serine hydrolase inhibitors tend to be selective within their class, they present opportunities for deliberately engineered short half-lives.

## 2. HISTORY

**FAAH Inhibitors: Clinical Failures**
The article's discussion of FAAH inhibitors proved prescient regarding industry challenges. Pfizer's PF-3845 never advanced beyond preclinical stages, and subsequent FAAH inhibitor development faced significant setbacks. Most notably, Bial's FAAH inhibitor BIA 10-2474 reached Phase I trials but was catastrophically abandoned in January 2016 after causing severe neurological toxicity in healthy volunteers, resulting in one death and several cases of brain damage. This triggered widespread regulatory scrutiny of covalent inhibitors and activity-based protein profiling approaches.

**MAGL Inhibitors: Mixed Progress**
MAGL inhibitor research (exemplified by JZL184) advanced primarily into cancer research applications, building on evidence that MAGL plays roles in tumor growth and metabolism. However, non-specific MAGL inhibitors demonstrated toxicity concerns similar to those highlighted by Cravatt regarding undesirable CNS effects.

**Selectivity Challenges Validated**
Work by Cravatt's group and collaborators subsequently demonstrated the validity of his selectivity concerns. Several studies confirmed that 300-fold selectivity is insufficient for daily dosing regimens due to cumulative inhibition effects. Later publications refined activity-based probes and inhibitor design principles to achieve wider selectivity windows.

**Covalent Inhibitor Landscape Evolution**
By the late 2010s, Merck's EGFR inhibitor osimertinib and other covalent kinase inhibitors achieved success, leading companies including Pfizer to reassess covalent targeting. Cravatt's research helped establish ABPP as a valuable tool in drug discovery, including applications in identifying off-targets and optimizing selectivity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Covalent inhibitors require 2000-5000-fold selectivity for safe daily dosing, not 300-fold, due to long enzyme inactivation half-lives in brain tissue. **Outcome**: **Mostly validated**. Cravatt's safety concerns proved correct, particularly in FAAH inhibitor development. The BIA 10-2474 tragedy demonstrated that insufficient selectivity can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

• **Prediction**: Serine hydrolase inhibitors likely remain selective within their enzyme class, unlike cysteine-reactive inhibitors. **Outcome**: **Generally supported**. Subsequent research showed serine hydrolase inhibitors have favorable selectivity profiles within their mechanistic class, with most off-target concerns limited to related enzymes.

• **Prediction**: Covalent mechanisms offer unique opportunities for engineered half-lives and therapeutic benefits. **Outcome**: **Validated**. Covalent EGFR inhibitors and other approved covalent drugs proved the therapeutic utility of deliberate residence time engineering, particularly in oncology applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates high technical prescience in highlighting selectivity challenges and predicting covalent inhibitor safety issues. Its relevance improved dramatically following the BIA 10-2474 tragedy in 2016, which made Cravatt's warnings about insufficient selectivity seem prophetic. The discussion of activity-based protein profiling and PF-3845/Pfizer's approach also provides interesting historical context for industry evolution in accepting covalent targeting strategies.
