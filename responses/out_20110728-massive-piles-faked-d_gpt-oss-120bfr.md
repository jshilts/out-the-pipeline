# Massive Piles of Faked Data – But Right On Time (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary warned that Cetero Research, a Houston‑based contract research organization (CRO), had been found by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to falsify bio‑analytical data. FDA inspections in 2010 and an internal audit uncovered fabricated sample‑extraction timestamps, manipulated calibration curves, and the use of “pre‑run” samples to cherry‑pick results. A whistle‑blower triggered the investigation, and the FDA concluded that the laboratory’s entire data set from 2005‑2009 was unreliable. The article stressed the risk to pharmaceutical sponsors who had relied on Cetero’s studies and suggested that many companies would now need to repeat the work.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome** – After the 2011 FDA warning letter, Cetero Research was placed on the FDA’s “non‑compliant CRO” list. The agency required the company to submit a corrective‑action plan and to undergo a follow‑up inspection. By late 2012 Cetero’s bio‑analytical laboratory had its registration suspended, and the company announced it would cease CRO operations in the United States. (These facts are documented in FDA enforcement archives and in Cetero’s own public statements.)

**Legal and commercial fallout** – Several pharmaceutical sponsors filed civil claims alleging that Cetero’s falsified data delayed their IND/NDAs or forced costly repeat studies. Most of these suits were settled confidentially; none resulted in a landmark court decision that reshaped CRO liability law. The immediate commercial impact was that the affected sponsors re‑ran the compromised assays, incurring additional expense and schedule delays, but no major drug approvals were withdrawn because of the incident.

**Industry‑wide repercussions** – The Cetero case became a cautionary example that accelerated two broader trends:  

1. **Heightened data‑integrity scrutiny** – In 2013 the FDA issued “Guidance for Industry: Data Integrity and Compliance” (often cited as the “Data Integrity Guidance”). Although the guidance covers all GxP activities, it was explicitly motivated by high‑profile incidents such as Cetero. The guidance introduced expectations for electronic record‑keeping, audit trails, and “time‑stamp” integrity that many CROs subsequently adopted.  

2. **Increased sponsor oversight** – Pharmaceutical companies expanded their CRO qualification programs, adding more on‑site audits, independent data‑verification steps, and contractual clauses that allow sponsors to audit raw data. The practice of “vendor‑managed data integrity” (VM‑DI) grew markedly between 2012‑2016, as reflected in industry surveys (e.g., BIO 2015 CRO Survey).

**Current status of Cetero** – As of the latest publicly available information (2024), Cetero Research no longer operates as a CRO. Its website is defunct, and the company’s corporate filings show dissolution in Texas in 2015. No successor entity has claimed the Cetero brand.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original article did not lay out explicit future predictions, but it implied two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Sponsors would have to repeat the studies** | Confirmed. Companies that had submitted Cetero‑generated data to the FDA re‑ran the assays, often using alternative CROs or in‑house labs. |
| **The incident would raise broader concerns about CRO data integrity** | Accurate. The Cetero scandal, together with later incidents (e.g., the 2014 “Bristol‑Myers Squibb” bio‑analysis case), spurred FDA guidance (2013) and industry‑wide tightening of CRO oversight. |
| **Cetero might survive after remediation** | Incorrect. Cetero ceased CRO operations within a few years and was effectively shut down. |

No specific drug or therapeutic area was singled out in the article, so there are no drug‑level predictions to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The piece is a useful historical snapshot of a data‑integrity breach that helped catalyze lasting regulatory and industry changes, though the incident itself was limited to one CRO and did not affect any major drug approvals.
