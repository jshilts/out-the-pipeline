# The Perfect Papers For Each Journal (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article presents a satirical guide to major chemistry journals, characterizing each publication by the stereotypical papers they publish. The piece humorously categorizes journals based on perceived research quality, scope, and publishing culture. For *JACS*, it suggests high-quality nanoscale work that narrowly missed *Science/Nature*; for *Angewandte Chemie*, it highlights genuinely useful papers with cringeworthy puns; for *Tetrahedron Letters*, it mocks papers lacking experimental details; and for *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, it depicts pharmaceutical companies publishing project failures alongside academic labs with overhyped drug leads. The article captures the insider perspective on different publishing venues' reputations within the chemistry community circa 2013.

## 2. HISTORY
This 2013 satire reflected real tensions in academic publishing that have since evolved. The humor resonated because it captured genuine concerns about declining experimental rigor, the pressure to publish in high-impact journals, and the perceived differences in scientific quality across publishing venues.

In the subsequent decade, the chemistry publishing landscape underwent significant changes. The rise of open access megajournals (like *ACS Omega*, launched 2016, and *Nature Communications*, which grew substantially post-2013) provided alternatives to traditional journal hierarchies. Predatory publishing also expanded dramatically, with thousands of low-quality journals appearing, making the article's satirical observations about journal quality standards more relevant than ever.

The relationship between academic labs and pharmaceutical companies evolved as well, with increased focus on reproducibility issues that this piece indirectly highlights. The "Viking funeral" papers—where companies publish failed drug discovery projects—became more common as open science initiatives grew, though not always in *J. Med. Chem.* specifically. Post-2013 also saw the continued growth of Chinese chemistry research, making the comment about "Chinese labs you've never heard of" increasingly anachronistic.

Meanwhile, the pressure towards shorter, flashier publications intensified, validating the article's critique of journals prioritizing novelty over thoroughness. The trend toward supplementary information rather than comprehensive experimental sections in main papers, which this piece lampoons via *Tetrahedron Letters* and *Organic Letters*, became even more pronounced.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction about publishing quality decline**: The article suggested journal standards were slipping, with venues accepting increasingly superficial or incomplete work. **Outcome**: This trend largely continued; the reproducibility crisis in chemistry and other sciences became widely acknowledged by 2015-2018, with numerous high-profile studies showing that published results often couldn't be replicated.

• **Implicit prediction about Chinese chemistry research growth**: The reference to unknown Chinese labs publishing in *Chemical Communications* reflected the beginning of China's rapid expansion in scientific publishing. **Outcome**: China surpassed the US in total scientific publications around 2016-2017 and became the world's largest producer of chemistry research, making the "Chinese lab you've never heard of" comment seem prescient about both the growth and the occasional lack of recognition.

• **Implicit prediction about publisher consolidation**: The piece highlighted the proliferation of specialized chemical biology journals (*ACS Chemical Biology*, *ChemBioChem*, *Nature Chemical Biology*). **Outcome**: This continued; many publishers launched additional specialized titles, though some consolidation occurred through mergers and some journals ceased operations as the market became saturated.

• **Implicit prediction about medicinal chemistry challenges**: The "Viking funeral" description of pharma projects reflected the industry's low success rate. **Outcome**: Drug development success rates remained low; a 2016 study showed only 13.8% of drugs entering clinical trials achieved FDA approval, validating the article's cynical assessment.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 5/10**

The article captures a specific moment in chemistry publishing culture with insider humor that resonated within the community, but its narrow focus limits broader scientific importance. The piece successfully identified ongoing trends in publishing quality and research culture that remained relevant, though it lacked direct implications for biotechnology, drug development, or public policy.
