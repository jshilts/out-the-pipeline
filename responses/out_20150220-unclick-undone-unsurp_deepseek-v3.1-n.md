# Unclick Undone, Unsurprisingly (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary reports the retraction of a now-infamous "unclick" chemistry paper published in *Science*. The article explains that the retraction followed a misconduct investigation at the University of Texas at Austin, where a common author across three related papers (Kelly Wiggins) had confessed to fabricating data. The editorial notes that while the UT investigation's full results were not shared publicly, the corresponding author (C. W. Bielawski) determined that the key results were untrustworthy. Bielawski and another co-author (Brantley) voluntarily withdrew the paper, while Wiggins could not be contacted.

## 2. HISTORY

The "unclick" research purported to describe methods to reverse click chemistry reactions—a significant claim given click chemistry's importance in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical biology. The retraction occurred within approximately a year of the original publication, triggered by evidence of systematic data fabrication by Kelly Wiggins.

This case became part of a broader pattern of research misconduct cases in chemistry during the mid-2010s, contributing to increased scrutiny around data integrity and reproducibility in the chemical sciences. The retraction led to institutional consequences including Dr. Bielawski's temporary stepping down from his editorial position at *Chemical Communications*.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction by the author**: "I would guess that we're probably not going to hear from her again" regarding Kelly Wiggins.
  
  **Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate. After the scandal, Wiggins effectively disappeared from scientific publishing and public scientific discourse, with no subsequent publications or professional appearances in the field that would attract public attention.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This short blog post functions primarily as a retraction notice update rather than substantive scientific commentary, serving historical documentation of a misconduct case but offering limited broader analytical value about biotechnology developments.
