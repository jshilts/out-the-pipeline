# Article Title (Month Year)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes a GSK paper describing the use of DNA-encoded library technology (DEL) against LFA-1, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) target involved in leukocyte inflammation. The work followed the withdrawal of Raptiva (efalizumab), an antibody drug with unacceptable side effects. GSK screened roughly 4 billion compounds from a triazine-based encoded library and identified leads with double-digit nanomolar affinities. However, the discovered compounds were allosteric inhibitors, binding the same known regulatory site as previously reported small molecules, rather than blocking the direct protein-protein interface. The author questions whether DEL screening against the locked high-affinity mutant would reveal non-allosteric hits and speculates on whether such screens against truly novel PPI targets have been attempted and succeeded or failed. The article concludes that GSK and others likely have unpublished internal data on such screens, but the fundamental question of whether DEL can find novel, non-allosteric PPI inhibitors remains unanswered.

## 2. HISTORY
After this 2014 article, DNA-encoded libraries became a widely adopted hit-identification platform across the pharmaceutical industry, with companies like GSK, Novartis, X-Chem, and DyNAbind expanding capabilities. Multiple DEL-derived compounds advanced into clinical trials, and in 2021, AstraZeneca/DyNAbind’s DEL-sourced KRAS inhibitor entered Phase I. By 2023, prospective analyses showed DEL screens consistently yielding biochemical hits, including covalent, allosteric, and some PPIs, with internal success rates often exceeding 10% of targets. Operational advances included automated synthesis, affinity selection-mass spectrometry coupling, larger libraries (some >100 billion compounds), cell-surface selections, and integration of DEL with structure-based design and AI. Despite this progress, the fundamental challenge for many PPIs remains: discoverability depends strongly on the presence of druggable binding sites, and results vary widely across target families.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- The author expressed skepticism that running a four-billion-compound DEL screen would find non-allosteric inhibitors, saying "you sure wouldn't find any 50 nM leads."  
  **Outcome:** The 2014–2024 period did not produce broadly adopted small-molecule therapeutics that directly and orthosterically block LFA-1 ICAM-1 interactions, validating the difficulty. DEL achieved other PPI successes, but the underlying biophysics of many PPIs favors allosteric mechanisms.
- The author expected that either failed DEL screens against novel PPIs would remain unpublished or interesting successes would emerge "over the next few years."  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. Many DEL results remain proprietary, but academic and industry reports progressively documented successes and limitations, revealing that DEL works well for some PPIs and poorly for others. Failure data remains largely undisclosed.
- The author questioned the value of performing DEL selections on cell-surface targets.  
  **Outcome:** Cell-surface DEL selections are now routine at multiple companies and academic labs, used to discover cell-permeant small molecules against GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, and membrane protein complexes.
- The article speculated that GSK and others had already run such screens and knew the answer to whether DEL could tackle novel PPIs.  
  **Outcome:** By 2022–2023, GSK presented case studies using DEL successfully for challenging PPIs. Novartis, Roche, and others also delivered DEL-derived PPI inhibitors, confirming the technique can yield tractable hits for at least some PPIs while also highlighting targets where it fails.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **8/10**
This article correctly identified the central challenge for DNA-encoded libraries against PPIs and presciently anticipated the field’s trajectory and the value of proprietary, unpublished results.
