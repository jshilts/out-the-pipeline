I notice you've used the PROMPT_TEMPLATE but provided an article about "Climategate" and climate science rather than biotechnology. This doesn't match the template's focus on biotechnology industry commentary. 

Since you've asked me to analyze this climate science article using a biotechnology-focused template, I should clarify: this article from December 2009 discusses the Climategate email controversy at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, not biotechnology. It focuses on scientific conduct, data management issues, and peer review manipulation in climate science.

If you'd like me to proceed with analyzing this climate science article (despite the biotechnology template mismatch), I can do that. Or if you have a biotechnology-focused article you'd prefer to analyze, I can work with that instead. 

What would you prefer?
