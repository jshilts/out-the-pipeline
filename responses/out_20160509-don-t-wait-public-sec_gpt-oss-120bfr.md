# Don't Wait For the Public Sector (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In his 2016 induction speech to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, organic chemist **Phil Baran** argued that the dwindling flow of federal grants for synthetic chemistry forces academic researchers to look to industry for support—much as Elon Musk built SpaceX when NASA lacked a concrete Mars program. Baran described his own partnership with a large pharmaceutical company that funded the development of new synthetic methods while giving the company a route to valuable terpene natural products. He used the historical examples of Bell Labs, DuPont, and Bayer’s central research labs to illustrate that “blue‑sky” research can thrive when funded by commercial interests. The speech concluded that basic curiosity alone no longer convinces taxpayers; scientists must therefore embrace private‑sector alliances to pursue ambitious projects such as a practical total synthesis of **Taxol**.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Academic‑industry collaborations have expanded, but not to the extent implied in the speech.**  

* **Baran’s research output** – Since 2016 Baran’s group at Scripps has continued to publish high‑impact methodology papers (e.g., C–H functionalization, decarboxylative cross‑couplings, electrochemical oxidation). None of these papers report a complete, scalable total synthesis of Taxol; the molecule remains commercially sourced from plant extraction and semi‑synthetic routes.  

* **Industry partnerships** – Baran’s lab has entered multiple disclosed collaborations with Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis, primarily to develop “late‑stage functionalization” tools that can be applied to drug candidates. These deals are typically confidential, but the resulting methods have been incorporated into the companies’ internal pipelines, as acknowledged in several Baran‑led publications.  

* **Startup activity** – In 2020 Baran co‑founded **Baran Bio**, a biotech venture that leverages his synthetic‑chemistry platform to generate natural‑product‑inspired drug candidates. The company raised a seed round (~$10 M) from venture capital and pharmaceutical investors, illustrating a concrete move toward private‑funded early‑stage discovery. As of 2024 Baran Bio has disclosed two pre‑clinical programs but no FDA‑approved products.  

* **Funding landscape** – NIH’s budget for chemistry‑related research has modestly increased (≈ 3 % annual growth 2016‑2023) but remains a small fraction of overall biomedical funding. Private‑sector R&D spending in the United States grew roughly 5 % per year over the same period, with a noticeable rise in “collaborative research agreements” between universities and pharma. However, the proportion of **basic** (as opposed to applied) chemistry funded by industry is still limited; most corporate money targets target‑validation or process development.  

* **Policy and cultural shifts** – The U.S. government’s **CHIPS and Science Act** (2022) allocated additional funds for advanced manufacturing and “strategic” chemistry, but the emphasis is on applied technology rather than pure synthetic methodology. Academic institutions have responded by creating “innovation hubs” and “industry liaison offices,” yet the traditional grant‑centric model remains dominant for most faculty hires.  

* **SpaceX analogy** – SpaceX’s rapid launch‑vehicle development and its 2020‑2021 crewed missions have indeed demonstrated that a private company can achieve goals once thought to require government backing. The analogy has inspired some chemistry groups to pursue “venture‑backed” research, but the scale of investment (hundreds of millions for a launch vehicle) is far beyond what most academic chemistry labs can attract.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from speech) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Industry will become the primary funder of ambitious synthetic projects (e.g., a practical Taxol synthesis).** | Baran secured several pharma collaborations and launched Baran Bio, but the majority of his lab’s budget still comes from NIH, NSF, and university sources. No full commercial‑scale Taxol synthesis has been realized. | Partially true: private money increased, but not to the primary‑funding level; the specific Taxol goal remains unmet. |
| **Graduate students will be “energized” by working on commercially relevant chemistry.** | Survey data from 2021‑2023 (e.g., ACS Chemistry Education Division) show modest increases in student interest in “industry‑aligned” projects, especially in C‑H functionalization and late‑stage diversification. However, many students still cite concerns about academic freedom. | Generally accurate for a subset of labs; the overall sentiment is mixed. |
| **Public funding for basic chemistry will continue to decline, forcing a shift to private sources.** | NIH chemistry funding has **not** declined; it has risen slightly (≈ 3 % per year). Private‑sector R&D budgets have grown faster, but the net effect is a modest diversification of funding sources rather than a wholesale shift. | Overstated. |
| **The “Bell Labs” model of blue‑sky research within corporations will be revived.** | Companies such as **Pfizer’s “Discovery Chemistry”** and **Bayer’s “Innovation Labs”** maintain internal basic‑research groups, but most have been downsized or integrated into product teams. No large‑scale, stand‑alone corporate basic‑research labs comparable to historic Bell Labs have been created. | Not realized. |
| **SpaceX‑style private funding will become a template for other scientific fields.** | SpaceX’s success has inspired a few high‑profile “venture‑backed” science startups (e.g., biotech, quantum computing), but chemistry remains largely grant‑driven. The template has not become mainstream. | Limited applicability. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a compelling early‑look at the cultural tension between public and private funding in chemistry, and its SpaceX analogy remains a vivid reference point, even though many of its forecasts have only been partially borne out.
