# Dogs and Ponys (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief 2011 blog post about a recurring organizational dysfunction the author calls "dog-and-pony-itis"—the tendency for internal meetings to drift from substantive problem-solving into polished, superficial presentations. The author claims to have observed this pattern at every company he worked at and suspects it is universal. The cycle begins with meetings being overloaded and overlapping, triggering a purge and the creation of a "Brand New Meeting" intended to be candid and useful. Initially effective, such meetings soon accrete "barnacles" and devolve into performance: attendees showcase what is working and omit messy details. As the new meeting hollows out, other meetings spring up to fill the gap, restarting the cycle. The author sees the dynamic as inevitable ("comes on like rust"), reports having seen multiple "get-rid-of-this-stupid-meeting" initiatives that eventually failed, and ends by asking readers for proven solutions.

## 2. HISTORY

The article is a short opinion/advice blog post and not a scientific report, so there are no formal post-publication studies, clinical outcomes, or public policy actions tied to it. Its "history" consists of the broader cultural and industry discussion around workplace meetings and meeting hygiene after 2011. Subsequent developments include:

- **Widespread adoption of agile and lean practices** (roughly 2010s onward) that prioritize short, focused stand-ups and explicitly discourage long, presentation-style meetings. Many firms implemented daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives designed to surface real blockers and discourage status theater.
- **Major technology companies publicly reprioritizing meeting culture** (mid- to late-2010s). Examples include Amazon's "six-pager" narrative memos replacing slide decks in many meetings, and Google's efforts to optimize meeting size and agendas based on research into psychological safety and effective teams.
- **A sharp rise in literature and tooling targeting "meeting hygiene."** Books, essays, and consultants built careers on fixing meeting culture (e.g., "Death by Meeting," "The Surprising Science of Meetings"), focusing on clear agendas, roles, time-boxing, and pre-reads to reduce show-and-tell dynamics.
- **Pandemic-driven shifts to remote/hybrid work** (2020 onward) accelerated the use of dedicated meeting platforms and async-first communication norms. Many companies adopted written updates and async video to reduce synchronous meetings and created stronger norms for agendas and note-taking to combat "Zoom fatigue" and meeting bloat.
- **Ongoing recurrence of the pattern** described by the author. Despite advances, status-reporting "dog-and-pony" meetings remain common in large organizations, and periodic reorganization of meeting calendars remains a standard management intervention.

Overall, while practical frameworks and tooling to combat ineffective meetings have matured since 2011, the underlying tension between candid problem-solving and polished presentation persists, and no single "cure" has eliminated the cycle.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original post did not include explicit forward-looking predictions. It posed a question ("has anyone broken out? And if you have, how?") and implicitly suggested the cycle would likely repeat. To the extent one can treat that as a forecast, it has largely held: organizational attempts to reinvent meetings still frequently revert to status-theater, and periodic purges of "stupid meetings" remain a common managerial response.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The topic is evergreen and recognizable, but the post is a short, informal blog entry with limited analysis and no empirical evidence. It triggered a useful comment thread but falls in the bottom half of interest and long-term importance for articles that discuss scientific progress or biotechnology.
