# Experience Phase III Failure, Twice (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the clinical failure of Takeda and Amgen's non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) drug motesanib, an anti-VEGF multi-kinase inhibitor. Despite encouraging Phase II results, the initial Phase III trial failed to show benefit when added to standard chemotherapy. Takeda then performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis that appeared to show better response in Asian patients, prompting a second, Asia-focused Phase III trial. That trial also failed to meet its primary endpoint (progression-free survival), leading to the drug's abandonment in NSCLC. The article uses this case to illustrate the risks of post-hoc subgroup analysis and the difficulty of resurrecting failed drugs through targeted population studies.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2015 failure in NSCLC:

**Thyroid Cancer Development:** Motesanib continued to be studied in thyroid cancer, but ultimately failed to gain regulatory approval in major markets. Clinical trials continued through 2016-2017 but did not result in market approval.

**Takeda's Strategic Response:** After the 2015 failure, Takeda largely deprioritized motesanib and instead focused on other oncology assets. The company began divesting non-core assets and restructuring its R&D pipeline.

**Amgen's Complete Exit:** Amgen had already exited the motesanib partnership prior to the second Phase III failure, avoiding further investment in what they likely recognized as a high-risk rescue attempt.

**Clinical Research Practices:** This case became one of several high-profile examples cited in discussions about the dangers of post-hoc subgroup analysis. FDA guidelines and industry practices increasingly emphasized pre-specified subgroup analyses in trial design.

**Impact on NSCLC Treatment:** NSCLC treatment evolved toward targeted therapies (EGFR, ALK inhibitors) and immunotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) rather than broad anti-angiogenesis approaches, making motesanib's mechanism less relevant to current standard of care.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"I believe the compound is still being looked at in thyroid cancer"** - **Partially accurate**: Motesanib did continue in thyroid cancer trials but ultimately failed to achieve approval.

• **Implicit prediction about resurrection strategies working** - **Accurate**: The author's skepticism about post-hoc subgroup rescue strategies was validated. Motesanib's complete failure in the second Asian-focused trial confirmed that the subgroup effect was likely statistical noise.

• **Implicit prediction about viability of broad anti-angiogenesis in NSCLC** - **Accurate**: The approach of adding broad multi-kinase inhibitors to chemotherapy in NSCLC has largely been abandoned in favor of more targeted approaches and immunotherapy.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates high educational value about clinical research methodology and the statistical dangers of post-hoc analyses, using a concrete commercial example that validated the author's skepticism. The case illustrates broader principles that remain relevant in drug development today.
