# "That Can't Be Right - Try Again" - 2 Jan 2007

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a short blog post reacting to a New York Times interview with Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. The article's author highlights what they perceive as an unusually sympathetic tone from the NYT toward both pharmaceutical companies and proposals to expand healthcare delivery beyond traditional physician-led models.

The summary of Christensen's views from the interview includes several key claims:

1. **Historical analogy**: A century ago, "consumption" was thought to be one disease but later turned out to include multiple distinct conditions like tuberculosis and pneumonia. Once precise diagnostics were developed, treatment became rules-based enough that technicians and nurses could handle it rather than requiring physicians.

2. **Healthcare efficiency critique**: Christensen argues the pharmaceutical industry has focused too much on therapy rather than diagnosis, and that many diseases remain poorly diagnosed. This keeps treatment unnecessarily expensive and confined to costly hospital settings.

3. **Innovative care models**: He points to MinuteClinics in Minnesota as a successful example of commoditized healthcare expertise - nurse practitioners treating "16 rules-based disorders" (strep throat, pink eye, urinary tract infections, earaches, sinus infections) in retail stores like Target and CVS for $39 with a 15-minute guarantee.

4. **Pharmaceutical innovation value**: The interview suggests that pharmaceutical breakthroughs with precise diagnosis and effective therapy save the healthcare system money despite high drug costs, a point the blog author finds notable given typical NYT business coverage of drug companies.

The "that can't be right" title reflects the author's surprise at what they perceive as unusually pro-pharma and pro-disruption messaging from the Times' business section.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent 17 years have largely validated and expanded upon Christensen's observations, particularly regarding retail clinic expansion and the broader trend toward healthcare commoditization:

**Retail Clinic Growth**: MinuteClinics expanded dramatically, with CVS acquiring the chain in 2006-2007 and growing from 80 locations to over 1,100 by 2018. Competitors emerged including Walmart Health clinics, Walgreens' Healthcare Clinics, and various urgent care chains. By 2023, these retail clinics handled millions of patient visits annually for acute conditions, vaccinations, and basic health screenings.

**Scope Expansion**: Retail clinics gradually expanded beyond the "16 rules-based disorders" mentioned in 2007. Services grew to include chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension), preventive care, mental health services, and more complex diagnostics. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend as retail pharmacies became primary sites for testing and vaccination.

**State Regulation Changes**: The patchwork of regulations mentioned by Christensen evolved significantly. Most states expanded nurse practitioner prescribing authority, with full practice authority laws passed in over 20 states by 2023. Telehealth regulations were dramatically liberalized during COVID-19, then partially codified post-pandemic.

**Diagnostics and Pharmaceutical Development**: The industry did see increased integration of diagnostics and therapeutics, particularly in oncology, rare diseases, and personalized medicine. Companion diagnostics became standard for many targeted cancer therapies. However, the pace of "precision diagnosis" adoption varied substantially across therapeutic areas, with the most significant advances in cancer, genetic disorders, and some infectious diseases.

**Healthcare Delivery Economics**: The 2008-2023 period saw continued pressure on healthcare costs, driving further commoditization and convenience-focused care models. Traditional hospital systems responded by acquiring urgent care centers, developing their own retail clinics, and emphasizing outpatient care.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The interview contained several implicit and explicit predictions about healthcare delivery evolution:

• **Retail clinic expansion and commoditization would continue**: **ACCURATE** - Retail clinics expanded dramatically through 2023, with major pharmacy chains operating thousands of locations. The model successfully addressed convenience and accessibility concerns, particularly for acute care needs.

• **Nurse practitioners and other mid-level providers would handle more diagnostic tasks**: **MOSTLY ACCURATE** - Scope of practice expansions occurred in most states, though physician groups continued to resist full practice authority. The trend toward team-based care and task-shifting accelerated across healthcare settings.

• **Regulatory barriers would gradually fall**: **ACCURATE** - State-by-state scope of practice reforms continued, though progress remained uneven. Federal telehealth waivers during COVID-19 demonstrated that rapid regulatory change was possible when necessary.

• **Precise diagnosis would drive pharmaceutical innovation and value**: **PARTIALLY ACCURATE** - Personalized medicine and companion diagnostics grew substantially, especially in oncology. However, the vision of "precise diagnosis" enabling widespread commoditization of care proved more complex than envisioned, with many diseases remaining difficult to diagnose precisely even in 2024.

• **Convenience and accessibility would define "quality" for routine healthcare**: **ACCURATE** - Consumer preferences strongly shifted toward convenient care options. Retail clinics, urgent care centers, and telehealth platforms consistently emphasized speed, ease of access, and transparent pricing as key quality indicators alongside clinical outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an early articulation of retail clinic disruption and healthcare commoditization trends that became highly significant over the subsequent 17 years. While the specific format (blog commentary on NYT interview) limits depth, the underlying themes about convenience-driven care delivery, scope of practice evolution, and integration of diagnostics with therapeutics proved prescient and substantial.
