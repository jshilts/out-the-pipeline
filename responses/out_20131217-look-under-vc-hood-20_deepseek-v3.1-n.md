# A Look Under the VC Hood For 2013 (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary discusses a year-end list from Bruce Booth at Atlas Venture detailing the seed-stage biotech companies funded in 2013. The author notes that most of these companies are unknown to general observers, but emphasizes that all established biotech and small pharma companies started at this early stage. The article highlights the venture capital reality that only about half of these investments would succeed, with some already "trending negative" at the time of writing. The key insight is that this failure rate is expected and even necessary in VC strategy—if none of your bets are failing, you're not taking enough risks to find the winners.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2013-2014 period represented a pivotal moment in biotech venture capital. The Atlas Venture portfolio reflected broader industry trends where VCs were increasing seed-stage investments in platform technologies, particularly in areas like gene therapy, immuno-oncology, and precision medicine.

Several notable developments emerged from this investment climate:
- **The immuno-oncology wave**: Many 2013-2014 seed investments focused on checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T therapies, which would become major clinical and commercial successes by 2015-2020. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo achieved blockbuster status.
- **Gene therapy maturation**: Companies working on gene editing (CRISPR technologies) and gene therapy delivery systems received significant seed funding around this time, leading to the first FDA-approved gene therapies in 2017-2019.
- **Shift in exit strategies**: The traditional IPO window for biotech widened significantly from 2014-2016, allowing many seed-stage companies to go public or be acquired at substantial premiums.
- **Emergence of platform companies**: Atlas Venture's portfolio strategy emphasized platform technologies that could generate multiple drug candidates, which became a dominant VC thesis by mid-2010s.

By 2016-2020, many companies from this cohort had either progressed to meaningful clinical milestones, been acquired, or indeed "trended negative" as predicted. The biotech IPO boom of 2014-2016 validated the high-risk seed investment model, while the subsequent market correction in 2021-2022 reinforced the wisdom of diversified portfolios with expected failure rates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: "Only about half of these, at the most, are going anywhere, and some of them are already trending negative"
  - **Accuracy**: This accurately reflected and predicted the reality of biotech venture returns. Historical data shows that approximately 60-70% of biotech investments fail to return capital, with only 10-20% generating substantial returns, so the "half or less" success rate was empirically sound and remained consistent through subsequent years.

- **Prediction**: "If some of your bets aren't trending negative, then you aren't making enough of them"
  - **Accuracy**: This captured the fundamental portfolio theory in biotech VC that proved correct. Successful biotech VCs continued to employ broad diversification strategies, as exemplified by the 2014-2020 period where winners had to compensate for numerous failures.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

The article provides a concise but accurate snapshot of VC portfolio strategy in biotech, capturing important principles that remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade. While brief, it offers insight into the economics of early-stage biotech investment at a time when the sector was entering a period of significant growth and innovation.
