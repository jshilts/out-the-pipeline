I need to analyze this Science Magazine article about biotech investing. However, I notice you've provided what appears to be a fragment rather than the complete article. The text you've shared seems to be commentary about Provectus investors rather than the full Science Magazine piece you mentioned.

Could you please provide the complete article text? I want to make sure I have all the content before attempting a thorough analysis with the four sections you've requested (Summary, History, Predictions, and Interest scoring).

Once you share the full article, I'll be happy to provide the thoughtful and critical analysis you're looking for, examining how the piece's claims have held up over time and what we've learned about biotech investing patterns since its publication.
