# Business Books: The Enantiomers (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a brief recommendation piece about business books for CEOs and managers seeking alternatives to popular management bestsellers. The author references a Forbes article by David Shaywitz titled "Reading for Newly-Humbled CEOs," which suggests books for business leaders during the 2009 economic downturn. The piece highlights two specific recommended titles: "The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers," described as a critical takedown of fashionable management theories, and "Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths And Total Nonsense," which appears to take a skeptical, evidence-based approach to business practices.

The article's context is clearly the post-financial-crisis environment of early 2009, when business leaders were presumably more receptive to critical perspectives on management and more skeptical of conventional business wisdom.

## 2. HISTORY

The two books mentioned have had different trajectories since 2009:

**"The Halo Effect" (by Philip Rosenzweig)** - Published in 2007, this book gained considerable traction in academic and professional management circles. It challenged the methodology of popular business books like "Good to Great" and "In Search of Excellence," arguing that many business success stories suffer from retrospective bias and halo effects. The book became influential in business education and continues to be taught in MBA programs, contributing to more rigorous, evidence-based approaches to analyzing business performance.

**"Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths And Total Nonsense" (by Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton)** - Published in 2006, this Stanford professors' work reinforced the growing movement toward evidence-based management. Pfeffer and Sutton became leading voices in promoting data-driven decision making over management fads. Their work influenced both academic research and corporate practices, particularly in human resources and organizational behavior.

Neither book became a mainstream bestseller comparable to works like "Good to Great," but both achieved lasting influence in business education and among practitioners seeking more rigorous approaches to management.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself makes no explicit predictions. However, the titles suggest an implicit prediction that business leaders would move away from formulaic success stories toward more critical, evidence-based approaches to management. If we evaluate this implied prediction:

• **Move toward evidence-based management**: This trend did materialize, with increasing emphasis on data-driven decision making, A/B testing, and empirical validation in business practices, accelerated by the growth of big data analytics and technology companies' influence on management practices.

• **Skepticism of business fads**: The post-2008 period did see continued, though not universal, skepticism toward simplistic business formulas, though the market for business bestsellers and management trends continues to thrive.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**
