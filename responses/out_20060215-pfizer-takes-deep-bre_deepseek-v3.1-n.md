# Pfizer Takes a Deep Breath (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Pfizer's newly approved inhaled insulin product Exubera, which had just received regulatory approval after a long and difficult development process. The author highlights the unique challenges of inhaled powdered drugs, particularly for insulin: concerns about long-term effects on lung function, dosing variability under different health conditions (allergies, flu), and dose reproducibility. These issues are especially critical for insulin given its narrow therapeutic window—both underdosing and overdosing can have serious consequences.

The article notes that Exubera's labeling requires patients to undergo baseline pulmonary function tests and ongoing monitoring. The main concern raised is whether payers (insurance companies, managed care) will cover the product given its expected cost premium of 2-4 times that of injectable insulin. The piece references analysis from consultants suggesting that payers would likely restrict Exubera's availability or impose high co-payments unless the product could demonstrate compelling health outcome improvements rather than just patient convenience. The author expresses hope that this represents a shift toward more rigorous cost/benefit analysis in drug coverage decisions rather than reliance on pharmaceutical marketing power.

## 2. HISTORY

Exubera was indeed launched in 2006 as the first inhaled insulin product, but it proved to be a commercial failure. Despite Pfizer's significant marketing investment, the product only generated approximately $12 million in sales during its first full year—far below the blockbuster expectations. In October 2007, just over a year after launch, Pfizer announced it would discontinue Exubera and take a $2.8 billion charge related to the product's failure.

The failure stemmed from several factors that aligned with the article's concerns: high cost compared to injectable insulin, the cumbersome inhaler device size, lingering safety concerns about long-term lung effects, and limited payer coverage. Additionally, patients still needed to inject insulin for certain situations, reducing the convenience benefit. The requirement for pulmonary function testing before and during treatment added another barrier.

No subsequent inhaled insulin products achieved significant commercial success. MannKind Corporation's Afrezza, approved by the FDA in 2014, also struggled with similar issues including limited insurance coverage, device concerns, and the need for backup injections. The inhaled insulin delivery route never achieved the widespread adoption that was originally anticipated, with injectable and later pump-based systems remaining dominant. The experience demonstrated the difficulty of disrupting established diabetes management paradigms even with novel delivery mechanisms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Payer resistance to coverage**: The article predicted that payers would "either dramatically limit Exubera's availability to patients, impose very high co-payments, or reject coverage of it outright" unless there was compelling evidence of improved health outcomes beyond convenience. **This proved accurate**—limited insurance coverage was indeed a major factor in Exubera's commercial failure.

• **Cost premium as a barrier**: The article noted estimates of 2-4 times the cost of injectable insulin and questioned whether patients and payers would accept this "convenience premium." **This was correct**—the high cost relative to injectable insulin made the value proposition difficult to justify.

• **Need for outcome-based value proposition**: The prediction that payers would demand "credible and compelling value proposition rather than an argument centered on patient convenience" **was prescient**. The lack of demonstrated superior clinical outcomes, combined with device drawbacks and safety monitoring requirements, made the convenience argument insufficient.

• **Marketing power limitations**: The article questioned whether Pfizer's "famous marketing powers" could overcome cost/benefit concerns if the landscape was shifting toward more rigorous economic analysis. **This proved accurate**—even substantial marketing investment couldn't overcome the fundamental economic and clinical barriers.

• **Comparison to other inhaled therapies**: The article's skepticism about inhaled delivery based on mixed experiences with asthma inhalers and Flumist **was somewhat borne out**, though the specific challenges with insulin were more complex than these comparisons suggested.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience about the commercial failure of inhaled insulin, correctly identifying the key barriers (cost, payer resistance, need for outcome evidence) that would ultimately doom Exubera. Its analysis of the shift toward evidence-based reimbursement decisions has proven increasingly relevant in healthcare economics.
