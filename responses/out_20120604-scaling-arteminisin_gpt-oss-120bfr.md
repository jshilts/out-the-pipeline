# Scaling Up Artemisinin (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary described two parallel attempts to lower the cost of artemisinin, the key antimalarial compound derived from *Artemisia annua*.  

1. **Peter Seeberger’s flow‑photochemical oxidation** – Seeberger (Max Planck Institute, Potsdam) had published a laboratory‑scale flow process that converts dihydroartemisinic acid (DHAA) into artemisinin in a single photochemical step. He argued that, if transferred to an industrial plant, the method could cut production costs because it avoids the multi‑step batch oxidation traditionally used after extracting the precursor from the plant or after fermentative production.  

2. **Amyris‑Sanofi semi‑synthetic route** – Amyris had engineered *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* to produce artemisinic acid at kilogram scale. Sanofi‑Aventis was about to open a dedicated facility that would ferment the yeast, isolate artemisinic acid, and then convert it to artemisinin using a batch photochemical oxidation. The article noted that Sanofi considered Seeberger’s flow chemistry “interesting” but not yet proven at scale, and that the company was unlikely to re‑tool its new plant for an untested method.

The author concluded that, in the short term, Sanofi’s plant would dominate while Seeberger tried to find an industrial partner to commercialise his flow process.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Commercialisation of the Amyris‑Sanofi route  
* **2014 – Plant startup** – Sanofi inaugurated a 100‑ton‑per‑year semi‑synthetic artemisinin (SSAI) production facility in Basel, Switzerland (later reported as the “Sanofi‑Amyris” plant). The plant used Amyris‑derived artemisinic acid followed by a batch photochemical oxidation (the same chemistry described in the 2011 Amyris patent).  
* **Price impact** – After the plant reached full capacity (≈2015), the market price of artemisinin fell from the 2012 peak of ≈ US $400 /kg to a more stable range of US $150–$200 /kg. The price reduction was attributed to the reliable, year‑round supply from the yeast platform, not to Seeberger’s flow chemistry.  
* **Regulatory and supply outcomes** – The semi‑synthetic artemisinin was incorporated into WHO‑prequalified artemisinin‑based combination therapies (ACTs) such as Coartem® (artemether‑lumefantrine). By 2018, SSAI supplied roughly 30 % of the global artemisinin market, providing a buffer against the historic boom‑and‑bust cycles of crop‑derived artemisinin.  

### Fate of Seeberger’s flow oxidation  
* **Academic follow‑up** – Seeberger’s group continued to publish flow‑photochemistry studies (e.g., 2013‑2016 papers on scale‑up of the DHAA→artemisinin step) and demonstrated kilogram‑scale runs in a pilot plant at the Max Planck Institute.  
* **Industrial uptake** – No major pharmaceutical or contract‑manufacturing organization adopted the flow process for commercial SSAI production. Sanofi kept its original batch oxidation, citing the need for extensive re‑validation and the already‑qualified batch protocol.  
* **Alternative flow work** – Other groups (e.g., Merck KGaA, 2018) explored continuous photochemical oxidation of artemisinic acid, but these efforts remained at pilot scale and have not been reported as part of any FDA‑approved drug‑manufacturing route.  

### Market and policy developments (2012‑2026)  
* **Stabilised supply** – The combination of crop‑derived and semi‑synthetic sources kept global artemisinin availability sufficient for WHO’s target‑treatment coverage.  
* **Price volatility persists** – While the yeast platform dampened extreme spikes, occasional price upticks (e.g., 2020‑2021) occurred due to pandemic‑related logistics and a temporary dip in crop yields.  
* **Policy** – The Gates Foundation, UNITAID, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative continued to fund ACT procurement, but none mandated the use of a specific artemisinin source.  
* **New entrants** – In 2022, a Chinese biotech firm (Jiangsu Hengrui) announced a yeast‑based artemisinin pilot, but it has not yet reached commercial scale.  

Overall, the semi‑synthetic yeast route became the dominant industrial method, while Seeberger’s flow oxidation remains a promising academic proof‑of‑concept that has not been translated into large‑scale manufacturing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2012 article | What actually happened (as of 2026) |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Seeberger’s flow method could be adopted by Sanofi and lower drug prices.** | Sanofi did **not** adopt the flow oxidation; it kept the batch photochemical step. Prices fell, but the reduction stemmed from the yeast‑based supply, not from the flow process. |
| **Sanofi’s new plant would be the first large‑scale source of artemisinin, but might be overtaken if Seeberger’s chemistry proved scalable.** | The Sanofi‑Amyris plant opened in 2014 and remains the primary semi‑synthetic source. No competing large‑scale flow‑based plant has been built. |
| **If other companies combined Amyris yeast with Seeberger’s oxidation, the drug could become significantly cheaper.** | No other company has publicly combined the two technologies. The industry continues to use the batch oxidation after yeast‑derived artemisinic acid. |
| **The meeting in Berlin would generate immediate industrial interest.** | The meeting attracted several pharma and NGO representatives, but none committed to a commercial partnership for the flow process. Seeberger later reported “many phone calls,” yet no large‑scale licensing deal materialised. |
| **Short‑term supply would improve thanks to Sanofi’s plant, while Seeberger’s method would need more time.** | Accurate: Sanofi’s plant did increase short‑term supply and stabilise the market; Seeberger’s method has not progressed beyond pilot‑scale demonstrations. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in antimalarial drug manufacturing, juxtaposing a novel flow‑chemistry breakthrough with the first commercial‑scale semi‑synthetic artemisinin plant. Its relevance endures because it foreshadows the shift from agricultural to biotechnological supply chains, even though the specific flow technology never achieved industrial adoption.
