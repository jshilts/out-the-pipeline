# Total Synthesis in Print (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary discusses a blog post from the Baran group analyzing the percentage of papers in the *Journal of the American Chemical Society* (JACS) with "total synthesis" in their titles. A chart reproduced in the article shows that the percentage peaked in the early 1980s, has never returned to those levels, and experienced a marked decline after 2000. The author notes that JACS appears to have increased its total number of publications around 2000, but didn't fill those additional pages with total synthesis papers. 2013 appears to be an outlier with higher numbers, though it was only May when the article was published. The author acknowledges their well-documented critical views on total synthesis and raises several confounding variables that might explain the trend: whether absolute numbers have actually decreased, whether papers have migrated to lower-impact journals, or whether fewer papers use "Total synthesis of..." in their titles compared to earlier decades.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2013, the field of total synthesis continued to evolve significantly, though the trend of declining prominence in high-impact journals largely continued. Several developments shaped the landscape:

**Academic Publishing Trends**: JACS and other high-impact chemistry journals continued publishing fewer traditional total synthesis papers, with notable exceptions for molecules of exceptional complexity or those demonstrating new methodological advances. The focus shifted toward papers that integrated synthesis with biological evaluation, target-oriented synthesis with therapeutic relevance, or methodological innovations applicable beyond single targets.

**Methodological Evolution**: The field saw increased emphasis on step-economy, atom economy, and sustainable synthesis approaches. Chemists like Phil Baran (whose blog sparked the original discussion) continued advocating for more practical and efficient synthetic approaches. Methods such as C-H functionalization, photoredox catalysis, and electrochemistry gained prominence as tools to streamline complex molecule synthesis.

**Industrial Impact**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly relied on synthetic chemistry for complex natural product-derived drugs, though the business model shifted. Notable examples include the continued importance of paclitaxel (Taxol) analogs, epothilones, and marine-derived compounds. However, many companies reduced internal total synthesis efforts, instead emphasizing medicinal chemistry optimization and outsourcing complex synthetic challenges to academic collaborators or specialized CROs.

**Major Synthetic Achievements Post-2013**: Several landmark syntheses were published demonstrating that complex total synthesis remained viable, including work on molecules like ingenol, phorbol, and various complex alkaloids. These syntheses increasingly emphasized providing material for biological studies rather than synthesis for its own sake.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions about the future appear in this article; it is primarily concerned with documenting a historical trend and raising questions about confounding variables. The author's implicit questions were:
- Whether total synthesis papers had migrated to lower-impact journals rather than disappearing entirely
- Whether the absolute number of total synthesis papers had declined
- Whether terminology had shifted (fewer papers using "Total synthesis of..." in titles)

**What Actually Happened**: 
- Total synthesis did continue in specialized journals and increasingly in journals focused on chemical biology
- The absolute number likely remained substantial but became more distributed across journals of varying impact factors
- Synthesis papers increasingly emphasized biological relevance, methodology development, or materials applications rather than pure "total synthesis" in titles
- The trend toward integration with biological studies accelerated, making many synthesis papers harder to categorize simply

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article captures a specific bibliometric observation from 2013 about declining total synthesis publications in JACS. While it documents an interesting trend in chemical publishing, it represents a narrow slice of academic chemistry culture rather than addressing major developments in biotechnology or drug discovery with broader impact.
