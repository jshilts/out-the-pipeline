# Organizing Research (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The blog post discusses an Angewandte Chemie article by Caspar Hirschi titled "The Organization of Innovation - The History of an Obsession," which examines how both industrial and academic research have been structured over time. The original article challenges the prevailing narrative about an innovation slowdown, arguing instead that the problem lies not with technological development itself but with our "theory-based obsession with innovation" and market-oriented competition as the primary driver of research organization.

Hirschi contrasts the 1920-1960 period—characterized by institutions like Bell Labs and the "Central Research" departments of companies like DuPont, Bayer, and Ciba—with modern research organization. The older model, influenced by Kenneth Mees of Eastman Kodak, emphasized giving scientists "the greatest possible latitude," flat hierarchies, permanent appointments for senior staff, and opportunities to publish. Research was viewed as a "gamble" requiring abundance of staff, ideas, money, and time—with the understanding that fundamental research could take ten years or more to yield results.

The article traces how industrial research labs were historically funded by monopoly or near-monopoly profits (AT&T, IBM, Kodak), and how these institutions used research as public relations tools to justify their market positions through elaborate "Industrial Versailles" research centers. The narrative culminates with the post-Sputnik era explosion in government research funding, which introduced market-like competition for grants and fundamentally changed both academic and industrial research by forcing fundamental research to be packaged as application-oriented projects with defined timeframes.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this 2013 article has been marked by continued debates about research organization and innovation, with both concerning trends and notable counterexamples that echo Hirschi's historical analysis.

**Corporate R&D Trends:** The decline of large-scale corporate basic research has largely continued. Companies like Pfizer, Merck, and other major pharmaceutical firms have further reduced or restructured their central research divisions. However, there have been exceptions: Google's AI research, particularly DeepMind, has maintained some aspects of the Bell Labs model with significant autonomy and publication freedom, leading to breakthroughs like AlphaFold. Microsoft Research has also sustained long-term basic research efforts, notably in quantum computing.

**Academic Research Funding:** The competitive, project-based funding model criticized in the article has become even more entrenched. Success rates for major NIH grants dropped to historic lows around 2014-2017 (reportedly below 20% for many programs), though they recovered somewhat by 2020-2023. The pressure for immediate translation and commercialization has intensified, with funding agencies increasingly emphasizing "broader impacts" and practical applications in grant proposals.

**COVID-19 Response:** The pandemic provided a real-world test of different research organization models. Operation Warp Speed demonstrated how directed, well-funded research with clear goals and minimal bureaucracy could accelerate innovation—echoing some aspects of the WWII-era research that the article mentions. The rapid development of mRNA vaccines drew heavily on decades of basic research (including work by Katalin Karikó that was initially considered speculative), providing evidence for both sides of the debate: long-term basic research was essential, but crisis-driven focused R&D delivered practical results.

**Policy Responses:** Some efforts have emerged to address the concerns raised. The National Science Foundation launched the NSF Convergence Accelerator in 2019, attempting to bridge basic research and practical application. Various initiatives have promoted "use-inspired research" and industry-academic partnerships. However, these largely maintain competitive funding models rather than returning to the sustained institutional support characteristic of the 1950s-1960s.

**Industrial Counter-Trends:** While most corporations continued to move away from basic research, some notable exceptions emerged. Google's various research divisions, Amazon's AWS research efforts, and Microsoft's expanded research portfolio represent significant investments in exploratory work. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly rely on partnerships with academic centers and biotech startups rather than internal basic research, a trend that has accelerated since 2013.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about the trajectory of research organization:

• **Market-driven research organization would continue to dominate:** This prediction has been largely accurate. Competitive grant systems, emphasis on commercialization potential, and project-based funding have become even more entrenched in both academic and industrial research.

• **The tension between fundamental research and application-oriented packaging would intensify:** Correct. Grant applications increasingly require detailed commercialization plans, broader impacts statements, and translation pathways, even for basic research proposals.

• **The relationship between research organization and innovation outcomes would remain contested:** Accurate. Debates about research productivity, the reproducibility crisis, and optimal innovation ecosystems have continued throughout the 2010s and 2020s.

• **The historical model of industrial basic research labs would not return:** Mixed. While the traditional corporate central research lab model has not seen broad revival, some tech companies have adopted elements of this approach (autonomous research divisions, publication freedom, long time horizons) with notable success in fields like AI and quantum computing.

• **The "efficiency engineering" approach to R&D would continue to cause problems:** Evidence suggests this concern was well-founded. The pharmaceutical industry has faced ongoing challenges with R&D productivity, and debates about appropriate metrics for research evaluation continue across sectors.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article addresses enduring structural questions about research organization that remain highly relevant. The analysis connects historical patterns to contemporary challenges in a way that continues to inform current debates about research funding, corporate R&D strategy, and innovation policy. Its insights about the relationship between organizational models and research productivity have proven prescient and continue to influence both academic study and practical decision-making in research management.
