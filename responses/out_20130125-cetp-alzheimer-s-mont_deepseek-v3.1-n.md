# CETP, Alzheimer's, Monty Hall, and Roulette. And Goats. (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary analyzes the high-risk, high-reward drug development strategies employed by major pharmaceutical companies (Merck and Lilly) targeting cardiovascular disease via CETP inhibition and Alzheimer's disease. The author describes CETP inhibitors as having "incinerated a lot of money over the years," with all previous candidates failing in development, including torcetrapib (blood pressure issues) and Roche's dacetrapib (lack of efficacy). Merck's anacetrapib and Lilly's evacetrapib were described as chemically "ugly-looking" compounds representing massive financial bets. The article frames big pharma's approach as similar to a Martingale betting system—placing increasingly larger bets on unproven biology. Using the Monty Hall paradox as an analogy, the author questions whether the odds had truly improved for CETP (where some clues existed but biology remained poorly understood) versus Alzheimer's (described as "an unrelieved string of failures" where "nothing we've tried has worked much"). The central thesis is that these companies were chasing the biggest markets because only massive potential revenue could justify the enormous costs, essentially hoping for rescue from fundamental scientific challenges that remained unresolved.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent decade validated the article's caution and extended the pattern of failures it described, with some notable exceptions and continued struggles.

**CETP Inhibitors**: After the article, both remaining candidates met the fate of their predecessors. Lilly's evacetrapib was discontinued in October 2015 after the ACCELERATE trial failed to show cardiovascular benefit despite raising HDL cholesterol. Merck's anacetrapib showed modest preliminary benefit in the REVEAL trial (2017), reducing cardiovascular events by 9% but with significant concerns about drug accumulation in adipose tissue due to its extremely long half-life. While technically a "success" statistically, the small benefit combined with safety concerns led Merck to abandon development in October 2017, effectively ending CETP inhibition as a viable approach to cardiovascular disease prevention. The CEΤP hypothesis—that raising HDL cholesterol would reduce cardiovascular risk—proved to be fundamentally flawed, marking one of pharmaceutical history's most expensive dead ends (estimated total industry losses exceeding $5-10 billion).

**Tredaptive Context**: Merck's Tredaptive (nicotinic acid/laropiprant) referenced in the article as another HDL-raising failure was indeed discontinued globally in January 2013 after the HPS2-THRIVE trial showed no cardiovascular benefit plus increased serious adverse events, validating Frazier's nervous tone.

**Alzheimer's Development**: The article's characterization of Alzheimer's drug development as an "unrelieved string of failures" largely continued post-2013. However, these failures led to a significant scientific recalibration. The amyloid hypothesis, which dominated Alzheimer's research for decades, faced increasing doubt as multiple anti-amyloid antibodies failed clinical trials throughout the 2010s. Critically, in 2021, the controversy intensified when Biogen's Aduhelm (aducanumab) received accelerated FDA approval despite mixed evidence and strong advisory committee opposition, creating massive controversy about regulatory standards and scientific validity. In January 2023, Eisai/Biogen's Lecanemab became the first anti-amyloid therapy to show clear (though modest) cognitive benefit in a well-controlled trial, receiving traditional FDA approval. However, the drug's real-world impact remains limited—modest clinical effect (0.45 point slowing on 18-point cognitive scale over 18 months), high cost (~$26,500/year), risk of brain swelling and bleeding, and questions about whether it meaningfully improves quality of life for patients. The prevailing view among many neurologists is that this represents incremental progress rather than transformative success, with most patients not experiencing noticeable benefit. The tau hypothesis and other mechanisms remain under investigation, but the field has shifted toward combination therapies and earlier intervention. Meanwhile, Lilly's bet on Alzheimer's mentioned in the article continued with their anti-amyloid antibody donanemab, which showed similar modest efficacy to Lecanemab in 2023 trials, consistent with the broader pattern of marginal progress.

**Big Pharma Strategy**: The article's diagnosis that big pharma was relying on massive bets in huge markets proved prescient. The subsequent decade saw continued consolidation and strategic shifts toward oncology (where biomarker-based approaches reduced failure rates), rare diseases (with premium pricing), and immunology. The CETP and many Alzheimer's failures contributed to major pipeline restructuring across the industry, with companies increasingly exiting neuroscience and cardiovascular research unless they had differentiated approaches or better understanding of disease biology. The trend toward precision medicine and biomarker-guided development accelerated as industry learned from these expensive failures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Merck's "ugly-looking" anacetrapib**: The article described it pessimistically. *Result*: Correct. While technically showing statistical benefit in REVEAL (2017), the effect was too small and accompanied by long-term safety concerns, leading to abandonment.
• **Lilly's bet on CETP and Alzheimer's**: Described as betting most of their future on these areas. *Result*: CETP was a complete failure (evacetrapib discontinued 2015). Alzheimer's investment eventually produced donanemab (2023), showing modest efficacy similar to Lecanemab but not the transformative success hoped for in 2013.
• **"Nothing we've tried has worked much" (Alzheimer's)**: *Result*: Largely accurate through 2023, when modest efficacy was finally demonstrated. However, the article's skepticism proved essentially correct—success remained limited and controversial, not the breakthrough imagined when the field was betting heavily on amyloid in early 2010s.
• **Big pharma "hoping for rescue"**: *Result*: Prescient. Industry did shift toward more targeted approaches and reduced investment in speculative high-risk/high-reward neuroscience programs, acknowledging that throwing money at poorly understood biology rarely succeeds.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional scientific foresight and analytical framework for evaluating pharmaceutical risk that was validated by subsequent events, earning it high interest for retrospective analysis and continued relevance to understanding drug development failures.
