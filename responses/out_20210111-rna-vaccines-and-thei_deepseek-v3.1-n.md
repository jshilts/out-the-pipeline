# RNA Vaccines And Their Lipids (January 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article provides a detailed technical explanation of how mRNA vaccines work, focusing on the biological mechanisms and formulation chemistry behind the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The author emphasizes that mRNA vaccines were not invented from scratch in 2020, but represent the culmination of decades of research into RNA therapeutics and drug delivery systems dating back 20-30 years.

The article explains the complex biology of mRNA processing in cells, including 5-prime capping, 3-prime poly-A tail addition, splicing mechanisms, and untranslated regulatory regions. It describes how the vaccine mRNAs were engineered with optimized codons (favoring C and G residues), modified bases like pseudouridine for stability and reduced immune recognition, and the stabilized Spike protein variant.

A major focus is on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as delivery vehicles, explaining how these protect mRNA from degradation by RNases and facilitate cellular uptake through endocytosis. The article describes the four-component lipid formulation used in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (developed by Acuitas), including proprietary lipids ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 (ionizable tertiary amines), along with DSPC and cholesterol. It also mentions Moderna's ongoing patent disputes with Arbutus over LNP technology.

## 2. HISTORY

**Vaccine Deployment and Impact:**
Both mRNA vaccines discussed achieved massive real-world deployment. Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine (BNT162b2) and Moderna's mRNA-1273 became the backbone of vaccination campaigns globally, with billions of doses administered worldwide. The vaccines demonstrated effectiveness at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death, though breakthrough infections occurred especially with emerging variants.

**Regulatory Approvals:**
- Both vaccines received full FDA approval (not just emergency use authorization) - Pfizer/BioNTech in August 2021 (brand name Comirnaty) and Moderna in January 2022 (brand name Spikevax)
- Widespread approval in Europe (EMA), UK (MHRA), and other regulatory jurisdictions
- Authorized for multiple age groups including children

**Clinical Outcomes:**
The vaccines performed as hoped in preventing severe outcomes, though real-world effectiveness against infection decreased with variants like Delta and Omicron, necessitating booster doses. Studies showed durable protection against severe disease and death even as neutralizing antibody levels waned.

**Patent Disputes Resolution:**
The Moderna-Arbutus patent dispute was eventually settled, with Moderna agreeing to pay licensing fees. Moderna settled with Arbutus and Genevant Sciences in 2022, resolving the long-standing patent infringement claims related to LNP technology. The settlement provided Arbutus with royalties on Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine sales.

**Technology Adoption:**
The success of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines catalyzed investment and research into mRNA applications beyond COVID-19, including vaccines for influenza, RSV, Zika, and personalized cancer vaccines. Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna expanded their mRNA vaccine pipelines significantly. The LNP delivery technology proved robust and became standard for mRNA therapeutic delivery.

**Manufacturing Scale-Up:**
Both companies achieved massive manufacturing scale, producing billions of doses annually. The experience validated rapid response vaccine platform technology, with new variant-targeted vaccines developed and authorized within months rather than years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"If Arbutus has a case, I would expect them to eventually get a judgement giving them some royalties off the Moderna vaccine"**
  - **Actual outcome**: Correct. Moderna settled with Arbutus and Genevant in 2022, providing royalty payments for use of LNP technology. The exact financial terms were not disclosed, but the licensing agreement resolved the patent infringement claims.

• **"A number of lawyers will have steady employment thanks to this issue for some time to come"**
  - **Actual outcome**: Correct. The patent litigation was prolonged and complex, involving multiple parties and spanning several years before reaching settlement.

• **Implicit predictions about LNP technology success**: The article strongly suggested LNPs would prove effective delivery vehicles
  - **Actual outcome**: Success confirmed. LNP formulations enabled effective mRNA delivery at massive scale and became the gold standard for mRNA vaccine delivery systems, adopted by multiple companies and research programs.

• **Implicit predictions about mRNA vaccine success**: The technical groundwork described suggested reasons for optimism about mRNA vaccine effectiveness
  - **Actual outcome**: Exceeded expectations. While the article focused on technical feasibility, the real-world effectiveness, safety profile, and manufacturability surpassed initial hopes, leading to global deployment and regulatory approvals.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article ranks in the top decile for interest because it correctly identified the foundational technologies that would prove critical to one of the most important medical breakthroughs of the 21st century. The technical explanations accurately predicted why mRNA vaccines would succeed (built on decades of research) and provided detailed insight into the chemistry and biology that enabled rapid COVID-19 vaccine development. The article's emphasis on delivery systems (LNPs), optimization strategies, and intellectual property dynamics proved prescient and remains highly relevant to understanding mRNA therapeutic development.
