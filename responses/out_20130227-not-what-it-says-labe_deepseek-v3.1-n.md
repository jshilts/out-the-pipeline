# Not What It Says On the Label, Though (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article addresses the critical issue of compound purity in drug discovery, noting that experienced medicinal chemists routinely verify hit compounds by re-ordering from archives and commercial sources, then checking via LC/MS and NMR. The article cites statistics from Emerald Bio showing high failure rates when validating commercial fragment libraries: 16% failed on average, with one vendor reaching 33%. Insolubility (47%), degradation or impurities (39%), and spectral mismatch (17%) were the leading causes. The author urges readers to recognize that commercial purity claims cannot be taken at face value, as these quality-control failures lead to wasted effort and resources.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments in the compound quality space evolved in several concrete directions:

**Commercial suppliers**: Many suppliers introduced enhanced QC protocols, including third-party testing, especially after the Emerald findings and similar reports in 2013–2015. For example, sigma-aldrich (now MilliporeSigma) increased its QC standards for screening compound collections.

**New Standards**: Industry publications like the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* made compound characterization more rigorous for manuscripts, beginning around 2016–2017.

**Academic findings**: Research on the topic proliferated, revealing that quality issues are widespread but have improved somewhat over time. For example, drug discovery programs often budget time for compound requalification, and many labs now rely on smaller suppliers with higher QC standards.

**Market impact**: Low-quality suppliers often lost market share, with top-tier suppliers emphasizing purity and characterization, though some issues (e.g., isomers, trace impurities) still persist today.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions about the future. It instead focused on emphasizing immediate risks in using commercial compounds without requalification and soliciting reader estimates of commercial failure rates.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article raises an important operational issue that directly affects medicinal chemistry progress, but the topic is niche and procedural rather than transformative—it did not lead to major policy shifts or technological breakthroughs.
