# How Not to Do Science Education (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a reaction to a Slate “assume‑the‑conclusions” article that claimed the United States simply needs **more** scientists and engineers. Derek Lowe argues that the problem is not a sheer shortage of people, but a failure to nurture the *right* talent. He distinguishes between “mediocre” scientists—who are already abundant and often under‑employed—and the rare, highly creative individuals (the “John von Neumanns” and “Claude Shannons”) whose potential is easily missed. Lowe also debunks three common myths: (1) R&D moves overseas mainly for cost, not because U.S. talent is unavailable; (2) the oft‑cited “critical shortage” of scientists and engineers is overstated and varies by field; and (3) counting total science PhDs is meaningless because graduates disperse across many unrelated industries. The article calls for a more nuanced approach to science education that focuses on identifying and supporting exceptional talent rather than inflating head‑counts.

## 2. HISTORY  
**STEM enrollment and degree production** – From 2012 to 2024 the number of U.S. undergraduate STEM degrees rose modestly (≈ 5 % total increase), driven largely by computer‑science and health‑related majors. PhD production remained roughly flat, with slight growth in data‑science‑adjacent fields (AI, machine learning) and continued declines in traditional chemistry and physics programs.  

**Job market for scientists** – The early‑2020s saw a pronounced divergence: *oversupply* in some “classic” PhD tracks (e.g., academic chemistry, physics) and *tightness* in high‑growth sectors such as AI, biotech, and renewable‑energy engineering. Unemployment among recent science PhDs fell from ~ 7 % (2012) to ~ 3 % (2023), but many still accept post‑doctoral positions that pay below industry levels, reflecting a “post‑doc bottleneck” rather than a shortage of talent.  

**R&D off‑shoring** – Corporate R&D locations continued to shift toward lower‑cost regions (China, India, Eastern Europe) for routine engineering work, while high‑value, discovery‑focused labs remained largely in the U.S. This pattern supports Lowe’s claim that cost, not talent scarcity, drives most relocations.  

**Policy response** – The **America COMPETES Reauthorization Acts** (2010, 2016, and the 2022 “COMPETES II” bill) increased federal funding for STEM education, expanded apprenticeship and “work‑based learning” pilots, and created the **National Science and Technology Council’s** STEM Education Committee. Programs such as **NSF’s ADVANCE** and **DOE’s Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists** aimed to broaden participation and improve mentorship, echoing the article’s call for better talent cultivation.  

**Public discourse** – Media narratives about a “STEM shortage” persisted through the 2010s, but by the late 2010s analysts (e.g., the National Academies, Brookings) began emphasizing *skill mismatches* rather than head‑count deficits. The “critical shortage” rhetoric softened, aligning more closely with Lowe’s critique.  

**Outcomes for the “mediocre scientist”** – Employment data show that many PhDs in traditionally “oversupplied” fields have transitioned to industry roles (data analytics, consulting, regulatory affairs) or to non‑research positions, suggesting that the labor market eventually absorbs the surplus, albeit often at lower wages than the author feared.  

Overall, the period after 2012 has validated the article’s central point: **simply increasing the number of graduates does not guarantee breakthroughs; targeted support for high‑potential individuals and alignment of training with market needs are more decisive.**

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **R&D moves overseas mainly because it’s cheaper, not because the U.S. lacks talent.** | Largely true. Companies continued to offshore routine engineering and software testing for cost reasons, while core discovery labs stayed domestic. |
| **The “critical shortage of scientists and engineers” is a myth; shortages are field‑specific.** | Confirmed. Data from the NSF and BLS show mixed signals: shortages in AI, data science, and renewable‑energy engineering; oversupply in many traditional physics/chemistry PhD tracks. |
| **Counting total science PhDs is meaningless without considering career dispersion.** | Accurate. Workforce studies now routinely break down PhD outcomes by sector, showing wide dispersion into finance, policy, and tech. |
| **We need better mechanisms to identify and nurture the “next von Neumann/Claude Shannon.”** | Partially realized. Programs such as **NSF’s Graduate Research Fellowship**, **DARPA’s Young Faculty Awards**, and university‑level “talent‑identification” pipelines have expanded, but systematic national mechanisms remain limited. |
| **Mediocre scientists are already abundant; the bottleneck is providing them meaningful positions.** | Supported. Unemployment among PhDs fell, but many accept lower‑pay post‑doc or industry roles, indicating a mismatch rather than a lack of jobs. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a thoughtful critique of a common policy narrative and anticipates several trends that later proved accurate, making it moderately interesting for historians of science policy and education reform. It is not groundbreaking, but its emphasis on talent quality over quantity remains relevant.
