# Of Drug Research and Moneyball (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article draws parallels between the data-driven revolution in baseball described in Michael Lewis's *Moneyball* and the persistent challenges in drug discovery. The author reflects on how Bill James's analytical approach to baseball in the 1980s, later adopted by Billy Beane and the Oakland A's, represented a broader trend of "intellectualization" of previously intuition-based fields, enabled by computing power. The core insight was that Beane was essentially "arbitraging the mispricing of baseball players" by using data to find undervalued assets.

The author then asks whether the same concept applies to drug research, where preclinical programs, drug targets, and compounds represent assets that are routinely "mispriced" through failed clinical trials, unexpected toxicity, and targets that don't pan out. Unlike baseball in the 1980s, drug research already employs statisticians and computational experts, yet still faces these high failure rates. The article poses the question of what can be done when even an already analytical field continues to struggle with fundamental valuation problems in its research assets.

## 2. HISTORY

The core issues raised in this 2011 article have persisted and arguably intensified in the subsequent decade. Drug development costs continued to rise, with estimates reaching $2-3 billion per approved drug by the mid-2010s, while clinical trial failure rates remained stubbornly high at approximately 90% for drugs entering Phase I.

Several trends emerged in response to these challenges, though none represented a complete solution:

**Computational and AI-driven approaches expanded significantly.** Between 2012-2022, numerous startups and established companies invested heavily in using machine learning, AI, and big data analytics to improve drug discovery. Companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals raised substantial funding to apply computational methods to target identification and drug design. By the early 2020s, some AI-designed drugs had entered clinical trials, though definitive evidence of improved success rates remained limited.

**Biomarkers and precision medicine became increasingly important.** The use of biomarkers to better stratify patients and predict drug response represented one practical application of more sophisticated data analysis. Drugs like Keytruda (pembrolizumab) demonstrated the power of biomarker-driven development, showing that better patient selection could improve outcomes and regulatory success.

**Regulatory pathways evolved.** The FDA established breakthrough therapy designation in 2012, followed by other expedited programs aimed at accelerating development of promising drugs. These programs allowed for more flexible trial designs and earlier regulatory feedback, though they didn't fundamentally change underlying success rates.

**Clinical trial design became more sophisticated.** Adaptive trial designs, real-world evidence, and Bayesian statistical methods saw increased adoption, representing attempts to extract more information from clinical data and make better decisions earlier in development.

Despite these advances, the fundamental challenge identified in the article remained: predicting which drug candidates will succeed remained extremely difficult. The industry continued to see expensive late-stage failures, such as Alzheimer's disease programs from major companies that failed despite promising early data. High-profile successes like COVID-19 vaccine development showed that rapid progress was possible under extraordinary circumstances, but didn't translate into systemic improvements in success rates across therapeutic areas.

Costs continued to drive consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry, with large companies relying increasingly on acquiring smaller biotechs rather than developing drugs entirely in-house.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself doesn't make explicit quantitative predictions about future outcomes. Instead, it poses a fundamental question about whether the analytical approaches that transformed baseball could be successfully applied to drug discovery's valuation problem.

**Implicit expectations that emerged from the article's framework:**
- **That data-driven approaches would need to evolve beyond existing statistical methods** - This proved true, with AI and machine learning approaches expanding significantly post-2011, though their impact on success rates remains unproven at scale.

- **That the industry would need new approaches to "price" drug assets correctly** - The industry did see innovation in this area, including new trial designs, biomarkers, and computational methods, though fundamental success rates didn't dramatically improve.

- **That computing power and analytical sophistication would continue increasing** - This prediction was correct; computational capabilities expanded enormously, enabling more sophisticated modeling and data analysis throughout the 2010s.

The article's implicit question about whether the drug industry could achieve a "Moneyball moment" hasn't been conclusively answered. While analytical sophistication increased dramatically, the complexity of biology meant that simple statistical arbitrage opportunities didn't emerge in the same way they did in baseball.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

The article addresses a persistent, fundamental challenge in drug development using an insightful analogy that remains relevant. It captures a tension between analytical sophistication and biological complexity that has continued to define the industry, making it prescient in identifying a core unsolved problem.
