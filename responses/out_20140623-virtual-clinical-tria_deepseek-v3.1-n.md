# The Virtual Clinical Trial: Not Quite Around the Corner (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a popular press piece from The Atlantic about "virtual clinical trials"—the concept of using big data and computer simulations to test new drugs instead of traditional human trials. The Atlantic piece featured Dassault Systèmes and Accelrys executives who claimed this approach could revolutionize drug discovery by creating cell-level simulations that would predict individual patient responses to therapies, potentially reducing the 10-12 year, $1+ billion drug development timeline while improving response rates (which they noted were below 50% for many approved drugs).

The author Derek Lowe expresses skepticism, acknowledging that personalized medicine is indeed the future direction but emphasizing that such virtual trials are "not just around the corner." He argues that human biochemistry is far too complex and poorly understood for reliable simulation-based drug approval, estimating it would take 20-25 years minimum before such approaches could replace clinical trials. He dismisses claims that lack of data sharing or "cultural shifts" are the main barriers, arguing instead that fundamental scientific ignorance about human biology is the real limitation, noting that massive financial incentives already exist for anyone who could truly solve this problem.

## 2. HISTORY

A decade after this article, virtual clinical trials have indeed not replaced traditional human trials for drug approval. Major developments include:

**Regulatory acceptance of modeling**: Virtual trials have found roles as **supplementary** tools rather than replacements. The FDA established its Model-Informed Drug Development (MIDD) program, which accepts computational models to optimize trial design, predict drug-drug interactions, and support dose selection—but still requires traditional clinical evidence for approval. No drug has been approved based solely on virtual trial results.

**Technological progress**: Companies like Dassault Systèmes have developed platforms like SIMULIA for biological modeling, and others like Certara have built significant businesses around pharmacometric modeling and simulation services. These tools are now routinely used to guide clinical trial design, predict outcomes, and analyze complex datasets.

**Successes and limitations**: Virtual approaches have demonstrated value in specific niches—predicting cardiac toxicity, optimizing trial enrollment criteria, and modeling pharmacokinetics. However, they have not solved the fundamental challenge Lowe identified: human biology's complexity. Late-stage clinical trial failure rates remain high (around 40-50%), and most approved drugs still show variable patient response rates.

**Digital transformation**: Real-world evidence and electronic health records are increasingly used to supplement traditional trials, particularly accelerated during COVID-19. However, these remain observational supplements rather than replacements for prospective controlled trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1**: "No such simulated clinical trial, one that could serve as the basis for a drug approval, is anywhere near even being proposed. How long before one is, then? If things go really swimmingly, I'd say 20 to 25 years from now."

- **Assessment**: Accurate timeframe estimation. As of 2024, we are still 10+ years away from this prediction's outer bound, and there is no clear path toward regulatory acceptance of purely virtual trials for novel drug approval. **Correct.**

**Prediction 2**: The revolution is not "around the corner," and calls for "cultural shifts in medicine toward openness and resource sharing" are diverting attention from "harder parts of the problem."

- **Assessment**: Largely correct. While data sharing has improved through initiatives like ClinicalTrials.gov and federated learning approaches, the fundamental barrier remains scientific understanding of human biology, not data access. **Mostly correct.**

**Prediction 3**: "Pouring on the openness and sharing probably wouldn't hurt... but it's not going to suddenly open up any blocked-up floodgates... We don't know enough."

- **Assessment**: Correct. Despite advances in AI and machine learning and increased data sharing, drug development timelines and costs have not dramatically decreased. **Correct.**

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient skepticism about biotech hype cycles while correctly identifying that technological capability doesn't automatically solve fundamental scientific ignorance, remaining highly relevant to current discussions about AI in drug discovery.
