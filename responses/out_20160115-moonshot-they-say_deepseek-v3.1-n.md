# Moonshot, They Say (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the announcement of Vice President Joe Biden's cancer "moonshot" initiative from the 2016 State of the Union address. The author argues that the "moonshot" framing is inappropriate for cancer research, drawing parallels to previous flashy initiatives like the 2013 BRAIN Initiative and the Personalized Medicine Initiative. These earlier efforts allegedly suffered from poorly defined scientific questions, inadequate funding relative to scope, and wasted time in planning meetings that diverted researchers from actual science.

The core argument is that the original Apollo moon mission succeeded because the underlying physics principles were well-understood (rocket engines, orbital mechanics, lunar position), allowing precise engineering solutions. In contrast, cancer biology involves far greater fundamental uncertainty—we cannot predict who will get cancer, what type, or how individual cells will transform. The author contends that steady, sustained research funding is more valuable than dramatic but short-lived political initiatives that prioritize public relations over scientific progress.

## 2. HISTORY

**Cancer Moonshot Implementation (2016-2022):**
The initiative launched with $1.8 billion in funding over seven years through the 21st Century Cures Act. Led by Biden until 2017, it continued under the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The Moonshot established focused research programs including:
- Pediatric Cancer initiatives
- Immunotherapy-based approaches
- Enhanced data-sharing platforms like the Genomic Data Commons
- Blood-based biopsy development for early detection

**Concrete Outcomes:**
- **No dramatic breakthroughs**: The initiative did not produce revolutionary cancer cures or fundamentally change cancer treatment paradigms by 2024
- **Incremental contributions**: It funded research that contributed to existing areas like immunotherapy and precision oncology, but within the broader scientific landscape rather than as transformative discoveries
- **Policy infrastructure**: Created new research coordination mechanisms, but without significantly altering the overall cancer research ecosystem
- **Funding reality**: The $1.8 billion spread over seven years represented a modest increment to existing NCI funding (~$5-6 billion annually), confirming the article's concern about inadequate resources relative to ambitious goals

**Clinical Impact:**
- No major new cancer drugs were developed primarily through Moonshot funding by 2024
- Existing immunotherapy drugs (Keytruda, Opdivo) continued their expansion into new indications, but this resulted from broader trends rather than Moonshot-specific efforts
- Early detection technologies remain promising but not yet widely deployed

**Academic Research Impact:**
- Researchers did participate in Moonshot-related meetings and committees, partially validating the article's concern about administrative burden
- However, the initiative did not significantly alter overall cancer research trajectories or solve fundamental biological uncertainties

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article's Predictions:**
- **"Funding things this way will make things slightly worse"**: The Moonshot created additional administrative layers and coordination challenges, but did not measurably worsen overall cancer research outcomes. The opportunity cost was likely modest rather than actively harmful.
- **"The money will disappear anyway"**: Funding was indeed time-limited (7 years), but $1.8 billion was spent rather than disappearing
- **"Steady funding is better than flashy initiatives"**: This appears validated—cancer research continued progressing incrementally through conventional channels, with Moonshot contributing within existing frameworks rather than transforming them
- **"You can't solve biological problems through moon-shot style approaches when fundamental principles are unclear"**: The continued lack of revolutionary cancer cures by 2024 supports this position, though Moonshot never realistically aimed for a single "cure"

**Implicit Predictions:**
- **Cancer research requires fundamental biological understanding before engineering-style solutions work**: Still largely true in 2024. Breakthroughs remain incremental rather than revolutionary.
- **Political signaling won't solve scientific complexity**: The Moonshot's primary legacy may be political rather than scientific impact.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article correctly identified fundamental problems with science policy approaches, though underestimated the modest positive contributions such initiatives can make. It represents important ongoing tensions in how society organizes and funds scientific research for complex problems.
