# Check, Please (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article argues that the cancer drug market is undergoing a fundamental transformation driven by improved understanding of which patients will respond to which drugs. The author notes that current practice involves giving drugs like Gleevec to patients with cancer types beyond those the drug is known to treat, benefiting from a "let's-give-it-a-shot" mentality that wastes patients' time and insurance money while occasionally yielding surprises.

The central prediction is that cancer will gradually transform into hundreds or thousands of orphan diseases, each requiring specific therapies tailored to patient subpopulations. This shift will drastically reduce market sizes for individual drugs—potentially by an order of magnitude—while development costs remain similar, forcing drug prices to increase substantially. The author anticipates that while doctors and patients will adapt to this new paradigm, insurance companies and HMOs will face significant challenges as cancer patients require highly expensive, long-term medications to keep cancer in check rather than cure it.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's predictions about cancer treatment personalization proved remarkably prescient. The period following 2004 saw the rapid emergence of molecularly targeted therapies and the crucial development of companion diagnostics to guide treatment selection.

**Targeted Therapy Successes**: Drugs like Herceptin (trastuzumab) for HER2-positive breast cancer, already approved in 1998, became models for biomarker-driven treatment. The subsequent years brought numerous targeted agents including EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib), ALK inhibitors (crizotinib), and BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib), each tied to specific molecular signatures.

**Companion Diagnostics Growth**: The FDA increasingly required or recommended biomarker testing before prescribing targeted therapies. HER2 testing became standard for breast cancer, EGFR and ALK testing for lung cancer, and various genetic panels emerged for treatment selection.

**Market Fragmentation**: Cancer did indeed fragment into smaller populations defined by molecular markers. Lung cancer, previously treated as broad categories, split into EGFR+, ALK+, ROS1+, and numerous other subsets, each with targeted therapies.

**Pricing Reality**: Drug prices escalated dramatically, with many targeted therapies costing tens of thousands annually. This created the insurance challenges the author predicted, leading to prior authorization requirements, step therapy policies, and significant access barriers.

**Clincial Validation**: Numerous trials validated that molecular testing improved outcomes, reducing costs per quality-adjusted life year while increasing upfront expenses.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Transformation to "Constellation of Orphan Diseases"**: **+90% Accurate**
  - Cancer treatment did fragment into smaller subsets based on molecular markers, though the analogy to traditional orphan diseases (affecting <200,000 people) overstated the case somewhat. Many biomarker-defined populations still number in tens of thousands.

• **Market Size Reduction by Order of Magnitude**: **+70% Accurate**  
  - Market sizes for individual designer therapies did shrink—cancer drug targets were deprioritized if treated populations were too small—but many blockbuster drugs still emerged for biomarkers common enough to support large sales (e.g., PD-1 inhibitors for broad populations).

• **Drug Prices Increasing**: **+95% Accurate**
  - Cancer drug prices escalated dramatically post-2004, with many targeted therapies and biologics exceeding $100,000 annually per patient, creating the insurance challenges the author predicted.

• **Insurance Company Issues**: **+100% Accurate**
  - Payers struggled with expensive, long-term therapies. This drove development of utilization management, specialty pharmacy programs, outcomes-based contracts, and tiered formularies to control costs.

• **Long-term Treatment Rather Than Cures**: **+95% Accurate**
  - Many targeted therapies became chronic treatments maintaining disease control rather than achieving complete cures, leading to sustained costs over time.

• **Needing "Lots More Drugs"**: **+100% Accurate**  
  - The subsequent decades saw explosive growth in targeted cancer drugs: hundreds of new approvals across dozens of mechanisms, fulfilling the prediction that therapy needs would multiply.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional foresight in predicting major trends in oncology drug development and commercialization, correctly anticipating personalized medicine's economic and healthcare system ramifications nearly two decades before widespread implementation.
