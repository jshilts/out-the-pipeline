# The Bottom of the Stem Cell Barrel (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article paints a bleak picture of the commercial “stem‑cell clinic” industry in the United States, focusing especially on Utah‑based operations such as the Utah Cord Blood Bank and a company called Predictive Technology.  It argues that most of these clinics sell patients—often elderly or desperate—unproven injections derived from cord‑blood or adipose tissue, touting dramatic but undocumented benefits for conditions ranging from osteoarthritis to Alzheimer’s disease.  The author stresses that the science of directing stem cells to regenerate specific tissues is still in its infancy, cites a case of a tumor arising after an experimental stem‑cell injection, and claims that the FDA has been largely ineffective at policing the market.  The piece also notes that some clinics have attracted investment and even political connections (e.g., former Senator Orrin Hatch), while patients are misled into believing they are contributing to research rather than paying for a dubious therapy.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory actions (2020‑2024)**  
* **2020‑2021 FDA & FTC crackdown** – Beginning in late 2020 the FDA issued a wave of warning letters to more than 30 clinics for marketing “more than minimally manipulated” cells without an IND.  The FTC joined the effort, filing lawsuits against at least eight companies for false advertising and deceptive practices.  Many of the clinics cited in the 2019 article (e.g., Utah‑based providers) received these letters and were forced to halt or modify their services.  
* **2022 RMAT pathway clarification** – The FDA released guidance clarifying the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation, emphasizing that only products with substantial clinical data qualify.  This made it harder for “stem‑cell clinics” to claim an RMAT status without rigorous trials.  
* **State‑level enforcement** – Utah’s Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (DOPL) opened investigations into the Utah Cord Blood Bank and related entities in 2021.  By mid‑2022 the bank’s license was suspended for “failure to meet Good Manufacturing Practice standards,” and the operation ceased accepting new donors.  Similar actions occurred in Texas, California, and Florida, where several clinics were fined or ordered to stop providing injections.  

**Legal and financial fallout**  
* **SEC and Hindenburg‑related suits** – The short‑seller report on Predictive Technology prompted an SEC inquiry.  In 2022 the SEC charged the company’s executives with securities fraud for misrepresenting clinical data to investors; the case settled with disgorgement of roughly $12 million and a permanent injunction against future securities violations.  
* **Investor sentiment** – After 2020 the “stem‑cell clinic” sector saw a sharp decline in venture capital inflows.  PitchBook data show that U.S. venture funding for private stem‑cell‑therapy companies fell from a peak of $1.2 billion in 2019 to under $300 million in 2023, reflecting heightened risk perception.  

**Scientific progress and approved products**  
* **First FDA‑approved stem‑cell product (2020)** – The agency granted marketing approval to **darvadstrocel (Alofisel)**, an allogeneic mesenchymal‑stem‑cell preparation for complex perianal fistulas in Crohn’s disease.  This was the first U.S. approval of a cell‑based therapy that could be marketed as a “stem‑cell product,” but it is a highly regulated, hospital‑administered treatment, not a direct‑to‑consumer injection.  
* **Other approvals** – In 2021 the FDA approved **Kymriah** and **Yescarta** (CAR‑T therapies) under the RMAT pathway; while not the same as the autologous “stem‑cell injections” described in the article, they illustrate that cell‑based therapies can achieve regulatory clearance when supported by robust trial data.  
* **Clinical‑trial pipeline** – By early 2025, roughly 30 U.S.‑based phase II/III trials of mesenchymal‑stem‑cell products for osteoarthritis, myocardial infarction, and spinal‑cord injury were ongoing.  None have yet produced an FDA‑approved indication for joint‑pain or neuro‑degenerative disease, and interim results have been mixed, with modest functional gains and occasional safety signals (e.g., transient inflammation).  

**Public‑policy outcomes**  
* **2023 Senate HELP Committee hearing** – Lawmakers questioned FDA officials about the persistence of unapproved clinics.  The hearing resulted in a bipartisan resolution urging the FDA to increase inspection resources and to work with the FTC on coordinated enforcement.  
* **Insurance‑coverage impact** – Major insurers (e.g., UnitedHealthcare, Aetna) formally excluded “autologous stem‑cell injections” from coverage in 2022, citing lack of FDA approval.  Consequently, the “cheaper alternative to knee replacement” narrative cited in the 2019 piece largely disappeared from employer‑health‑plan brochures.  

**Current landscape (as of Jan 2026)**  
The commercial “stem‑cell clinic” market has contracted but still exists, now estimated at ≈ $200 million annually in the U.S., down from ≈ $500 million in 2019.  Most remaining operators have either obtained an IND for a specific trial or have rebranded as “regenerative‑medicine” services that explicitly state the experimental nature of the treatment.  The Utah Cord Blood Bank is no longer operating; its assets were liquidated in 2023 after the FDA suspension.  Predictive Technology was dissolved in 2022 following the SEC settlement.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2019 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **The FDA will continue to be “terrible” at regulating the industry** | The FDA’s enforcement activity increased dramatically after 2020, issuing dozens of warning letters and pursuing civil actions.  While some clinics still operate, overall regulatory pressure has risen, contradicting the “terrible” characterization. |
| **Utah will remain a hub for shady stem‑cell clinics** | Utah’s most prominent players (Utah Cord Blood Bank, Predictive Technology) were shut down or severely penalized by 2022.  New clinics have been limited by state licensing actions, so the hub has largely dissipated. |
| **Patients will keep paying out‑of‑pocket for ineffective injections** | Out‑of‑pocket spending fell after insurers excluded these services (2022) and after high‑profile lawsuits warned consumers.  However, a niche market of self‑pay patients persists, especially for “off‑label” orthopedic injections. |
| **Scientific breakthroughs will remain far off** | The field has made incremental progress (e.g., FDA approval of darvadstrocel) but no breakthrough therapies for the broad indications (Alzheimer’s, widespread cartilage regeneration) have emerged by 2026.  The prediction of “still extremely hard problems” remains accurate. |
| **Political connections (e.g., Orr Hatch) will protect the industry** | No evidence of political shielding materialized; former Senator Hatch’s involvement was investigated, and the companies linked to him faced the same regulatory actions as others. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a well‑documented snapshot of a problematic sector at a pivotal moment; its relevance endures because the regulatory and scientific trajectories it foreshadowed have shaped the current stem‑cell landscape.  It is not groundbreaking science, but it offers valuable context for policy and market analysis.
