# GSK's Anti‑Doping Ad (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary by Derek Lowe (published 7 Aug 2012) shows a print advertisement that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) ran in the United Kingdom to promote its role in anti‑doping testing for the London 2012 Olympic Games. The ad depicts the word “blood” rendered as a stylised chemical formula, with two napthyl rings forming the double‑O. Lowe points out that the chemistry is nonsensical – the rings clash, the bonds are drawn incorrectly, and the overall “formula” bears no resemblance to any real molecular structure. He argues that, despite the scientific errors, the visual is likely to convey a “chemistry‑y” vibe to a lay audience and serve GSK’s public‑relations goal of associating the company with clean sport.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 anti‑doping activities**  
- **Continued partnership with WADA/IOC.** After the London Games, GSK remained a contracted supplier of analytical reagents and expertise to the World Anti‑Doping Agency (WADA). The company contributed to the development of mass‑spectrometry methods for detecting erythropoietin (EPO) and other blood‑doping agents, but these contributions were incremental rather than breakthrough technologies.  
- **Research funding.** GSK’s “Anti‑Doping Research Programme” (launched 2011) continued to fund academic labs working on biomarkers for blood‑doping and the Athlete Biological Passport. The programme’s budget stayed in the low‑tens‑of‑millions‑dollar range and did not expand into a major corporate initiative.  
- **No major product launches.** GSK never turned the anti‑doping work into a commercial drug or diagnostic kit that entered the market. The reagents supplied to WADA remained internal‑use items, and no FDA‑cleared test kits bearing the GSK name were released.  
- **Reputation impact.** The ad generated a brief wave of online commentary (mostly on chemistry blogs) criticizing its scientific inaccuracy, but it did not lead to any lasting reputational damage for GSK. The company’s broader brand continued to be shaped more by its vaccine and respiratory‑medicine pipelines than by the anti‑doping ad.  
- **Corporate restructuring.** In 2015 GSK spun off its consumer‑health division (later becoming Haleon) and in 2022 announced a strategic focus on specialty pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Anti‑doping work remained a peripheral, low‑profile activity within the larger R&D organization.  

**Overall impact** – The ad was a one‑off PR piece that succeeded in reminding the UK public that GSK was involved in Olympic anti‑doping testing, but it did not catalyse any lasting scientific or commercial shift in the anti‑doping field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *The chemically stylised ad will effectively communicate GSK’s anti‑doping commitment to a non‑expert audience.*  
  - **Outcome:** The ad was noticed by a niche audience (chemistry enthusiasts, blog readers) and sparked criticism for its inaccuracy. It likely succeeded in raising brand awareness among the general public, but the intended “scientific credibility” was undermined by the obvious errors.  

- **Prediction 2 (implicit):** *GSK’s involvement in Olympic testing will be a notable, ongoing partnership.*  
  - **Outcome:** GSK remained a supplier to WADA for several years after 2012, but the partnership never grew into a headline‑making collaboration. By the late 2010s the company’s anti‑doping role became a background activity, with no high‑profile announcements or new technologies directly attributed to GSK.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10**  
The piece is a quirky snapshot of corporate PR intersecting with chemistry, interesting to a niche audience (science bloggers, anti‑doping historians) but of limited broader relevance to biotechnology or drug development. It offers little lasting insight into scientific progress or market dynamics.
