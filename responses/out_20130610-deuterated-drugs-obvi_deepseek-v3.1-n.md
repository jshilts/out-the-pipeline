# Deuterated Drugs: An Obvious Idea? (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the emerging field of deuterated drugs and the patent challenges they face, particularly around the legal standard of "obviousness." The article notes that several deuterated compounds were already in clinical trials by 2013, with the first marketed deuterium-containing drug expected soon. 

The central concern is whether substituting hydrogen with deuterium in drug molecules would eventually be considered obvious to "one skilled in the art," which could threaten patent protection. The piece references the 2007 Supreme Court ruling in KSR v. Teleflex, which established that when there are a finite number of known, predictable solutions to a problem, pursuing those options may be deemed obvious. The author compares this to single enantiomer drugs, where resolving racemic mixtures eventually became considered obvious. However, deuterium substitution presents more complexity because the location and number of deuterium atoms matter significantly for pharmacological effects, and the synthetic chemistry can be challenging. The article anticipates future patent litigation as deuterated drugs become commercially successful.

## 2. HISTORY

The deuterated drug landscape has developed significantly since 2013:

**Approved Drugs**: The field achieved its first major success when **Austedo (deutetrabenazine)** received FDA approval in August 2017 for treating Huntington's disease chorea and tardive dyskinesia. This was followed by approval of **deucravacitinib** (marketed as Sotyktu by Bristol Myers Squibb) in September 2022 for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. These approvals demonstrated that deuterated drugs could successfully navigate the regulatory pathway and reach patients.

**Clinical Pipeline**: Multiple deuterated compounds have advanced through clinical development, including deuterated versions of known drugs across various therapeutic areas such as metabolic disorders, CNS conditions, and inflammatory diseases.

**Market Adoption**: Austedo has shown meaningful patient uptake in its approved indications, validating the commercial viability of deuterated pharmaceuticals. The successful launch and continued market presence of approved deuterated drugs has proven the concept that strategic deuteration can improve pharmacokinetic properties while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.

**Patent Landscape**: The anticipated patent litigation materialized as expected. Courts have generally recognized that deuterated compounds can be patentable when specific, non-obvious advantages are demonstrated, particularly when deuteration produces unexpected improvements in metabolic stability, safety profiles, or dosing regimens.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The time to the first marketed deuterium-containing drug is surely counting down"** - CORRECT. Austedo (deutetrabenazine) received FDA approval in 2017, just four years after this article was published.

• **"Another countdown that also must be ticking away is the one to the first lawsuit"** regarding patent obviousness - CORRECT. Patent litigation has occurred in the deuterated drug space, with courts generally finding that well-characterized deuterated compounds with demonstrated advantages can overcome obviousness challenges.

• **Courts will need to determine when deuteration becomes "obvious to try"** - CORRECT. The legal framework established by KSR v. Teleflex has indeed been applied to deuterated drug patents, with decisions depending on whether specific deuteration patterns produce unexpected benefits that wouldn't be obvious to those skilled in the art.

• **The complexity of deuteration (location, number of atoms) would differentiate it from simple racemate resolution** - CORRECT. Courts have recognized that strategic deuteration requires specific expertise and can produce non-obvious pharmacological improvements, supporting patentability when properly claimed.

• **Patent battles would be "fought out case by case" over time** - CORRECT. The patent landscape for deuterated drugs has evolved through case-by-case examination, with outcomes depending on the specific molecular modifications and demonstrated advantages.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article correctly anticipated both the successful development of deuterated drugs and the patent challenges they would face, making it prescient regarding a specialized but important area of pharmaceutical science and intellectual property law.
