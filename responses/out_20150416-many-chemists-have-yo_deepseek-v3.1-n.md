# How Many Chemists Have You Seen on a Team? (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 blog-style commentary reflects on team sizing in pharmaceutical medicinal chemistry, prompted by an anecdote about Merck's "Skolnik Unit" (defined as ~20 medicinal chemists). The author notes rarely seeing projects with 20+ discovery chemists; their personal maximum was around 16, and instances near 20 were peaks that did not last. The piece poses open questions about the largest team sizes readers have observed, how such large teams were organized, and whether the "era where scores (literally) of medicinal chemists were deployed against a given target" had already ended.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years after 2015, pharmaceutical R&D continued a broad shift toward smaller, more targeted discovery teams and greater reliance on external innovation and new therapeutic modalities. Several concrete trends reshaped team structure and resourcing:
- Rise of targeted protein degradation (PROTACs) and molecular glues reduced the need for massive parallel chemistry campaigns typical of high-throughput screening–era small-molecule programs.
- AI/ML-driven drug design and virtual screening increasingly guided smaller chemistry teams to higher-priority compounds, lowering the need for brute-force synthetic campaigns.
- Industry consolidation (Pfizer–Wyeth, Bristol-Myers Squibb–Celgene, AbbVie–Allergan, and later Pfizer–Seagen, Bristol Myers Squibb–Celgene, Amgen–Horizon) led to pipeline rationalization and leaner, restructured discovery units.
- Public policy initiatives such as the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and FDA expedited pathways (Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Priority Review, accelerated approval) incentivized smaller, faster programs with biomarkers and enriched populations, rewarding focused teams over large ones.
- Approved drugs emerging from smaller, focused programs include sotorasib (Lumakras, 2021, for KRAS G12C–mutated NSCLC), asciminib (Scemblix, 2021, for CML), and lerescatinib (Lorbrena, 2018/2021, ALK+ NSCLC). Concomitantly, large programs in Alzheimer's (e.g., β- and γ-secretase inhibitors, BACE programs) delivered clinical failures despite major resource commitments, underscoring that team size alone does not ensure success.
- Biotech funding boomed from 2020–2022, then contracted; many virtual or lean startup models proved viable for target validation and early discovery, often leveraging CROs rather than large internal teams.

The implied prediction—that the era of deploying "scores" of chemists on single targets was fading—largely held true. R&D became more decentralized, computationally guided, and modality-diverse, favoring nimble, multidisciplinary "biotech-style" teams over massive chemistry-centric initiatives for most targets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

I do not identify explicit quantitative predictions in this article beyond the closing question about whether large-team deployment was over. The article was an open-ended prompt for reader discussion rather than firm forecasts. The central implied suggestion—that very large medicinal chemistry teams might be a legacy approach—largely aligned with subsequent trends toward smaller, targeted discovery teams, computational design, and diversified therapeutic modalities.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: 4/10
The piece is an informal industry conversation-starter with limited empirical claims, but it captures a real shift in R&D resourcing that became clearer in subsequent years.
