# Heart-Warming Stories of Success (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques Geoffrey Rishton's list of productive small pharmaceutical companies, arguing that two examples—Neurogen and Sepracor—do not represent genuine success stories worth emulating. 

The author challenges Neurogen's inclusion by noting that despite 10-15 years in operation, the CNS-focused company had never brought a compound to market or turned a profit, with a success rate of "zero." While acknowledging that Neurogen managed to survive and attract investment, the author questions whether this constitutes the type of success worth celebrating.

Sepracor is presented as a "special case" that achieved success through questionable means—essentially "ripping off" or "piggybacking on" existing patents. The author specifically points to Lunesta (eszopiclone), which they describe as simply the S-enantiomer of Aventis's older drug zopiclone, suggesting this represents opportunism rather than innovative drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

**Neurogen**: The author's critique proved prescient. Neurogen continued to struggle after 2006 and never achieved commercial success with its pipeline. In 2009, the company terminated its drug discovery programs and shifted focus to drug development partnerships. By 2015, Neurogen was acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals for approximately $8.3 million—a modest exit that reflected the company's inability to translate research into marketable drugs. The company's CNS focus indeed proved to be the "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" the author mentioned.

**Sepracor**: The trajectory here was more complex. Lunesta (eszopiclone) was launched in 2005 and initially generated substantial revenue, reaching peak sales of around $800 million annually by 2008. However, the drug faced increasing generic competition and safety concerns. In 2009, Sepracor was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma for approximately $2.6 billion. By 2014, generic versions of eszopiclone were approved by the FDA, dramatically reducing Lunesta's market value. The author's skepticism about Sepracor's business model proved partially justified—while commercially successful temporarily, the company did not sustain independent success through innovation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Neurogen would continue to fail**: The author's implicit prediction that Neurogen's lack of commercial success would persist was accurate. The company never brought a drug to market and was eventually acquired at a relatively low valuation, confirming the author's assessment.

• **Sepracor's model was unsustainable**: While not explicitly stated as a prediction, the author's tone suggested Sepracor's patent-based strategy wasn't replicable long-term. This proved partially correct—the company achieved short-term commercial success but was acquired within three years of the article, and its flagship product faced generic competition within nine years.

• **CNS field remains challenging**: The "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" characterization of CNS drug development has remained accurate. CNS drug discovery continues to have one of the highest failure rates in the pharmaceutical industry, with many companies struggling to translate research into approved therapies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article demonstrates reasonable critical analysis of biotech success metrics but focuses on narrow case studies rather than broader industry trends. The author's skepticism was largely validated by subsequent developments, but the article's limited scope and reactive nature constrain its broader significance.
