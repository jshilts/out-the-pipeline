# More Worthless Press Releases (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article criticizes the proliferation of low-quality, automated biomedical press releases that flood journalists' inboxes with hyperbolic or irrelevant content. The author describes receiving numerous PR pitches that are clearly automated and poorly targeted—including pitches for dubious products like "all-natural coconut cure water"—sent even on major holidays like Thanksgiving. The piece references two contemporaneous collections highlighting the worst scientific press releases of 2013, characterizing this PR material as generally worthless and deserving only cursory attention before deletion. The author notes that personal, thoughtfully-targeted pitches receive more consideration, but automated list-based distributions rarely merit engagement.

## 2. HISTORY

The skeptical stance toward pharmaceutical and biotech press releases has proven prescient over the subsequent decade. Several major trends emerged:

**Increased scrutiny and fact-checking initiatives** (2014-2024): Organizations like HealthNewsReview.org (referenced in the original article) continued monitoring industry PR until it ceased operations in 2018, while new initiatives emerged. The systemic overstatement of benefits and understatement of risks in medical press releases has been documented in peer-reviewed studies, confirming the author's concerns were well-founded.

**Major clinical trial press release scandals**: Numerous instances validated the author's skepticism, including:
- Biogen's controversial Aduhelm (aducanumab) press campaign in 2019-2021, which aggressively promoted Alzheimer's efficacy claims despite mixed clinical data and weak FDA support, ultimately leading to very limited patient uptake and corporate restructuring
- The 2015-2016 Theranos scandal, where glowing press releases about revolutionary blood testing technology concealed fraudulent science
- Multiple COVID-19 therapeutic press releases (2020-2022) that promised breakthroughs but delivered disappointing real-world results

**Regulatory responses**: The FDA and FTC increased enforcement actions against misleading drug promotional materials, though systemic problems persisted. Companies like Valeant and Mallinckrodt faced criticism for aggressive PR tactics that outpace clinical evidence.

**Industry adaptation**: Some companies reduced automated PR distribution, while others continued the practices criticized in 2013, often with sophisticated targeting using journalist metadata, though efficacy remains questionable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made implicit predictions through its critical observations:

- **Automated PR would continue proliferating**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - The problem persisted and arguably worsened through 2024, with PR automation tools becoming more sophisticated and widespread across the biotech industry
- **Holiday timing cluelessness would continue**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Journalists continued reporting inappropriate holiday PR pitches throughout the 2010s and 2020s, indicating poor human oversight in automated systems
- **Quality publications would increasingly ignore such material**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Major science journalists developed refined filtering mechanisms, and credibility gaps between press-release-driven coverage versus investigative reporting widened significantly
- **Poor targeting (e.g., coconut water to chemists) would persist**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Examples of bizarre targeting mismatches continued appearing in journalist complaints through 2024

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This piece captured an enduring structural problem in science communication that worsened over the next decade while correctly predicting how serious journalists would respond to declining PR quality. The issues identified became more consequential as social media amplified both credible scientific communication and PR nonsense, making the filtering mechanisms described increasingly vital.
