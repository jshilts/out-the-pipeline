# The Worst Biotech CEO? (December 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Adam Feuerstein's first "Worst Biotech CEO" award at TheStreet.com, given to Kelly Martin of Elan Corporation. The selection stemmed from Elan's struggles with its anti-Alzheimer's antibody drug bapineuzumab (developed in partnership with Wyeth). Earlier in July 2008, pivotal trial results for the drug proved disappointing, causing Elan's stock to plummet significantly. The author notes that Martin's enthusiastic promotion of the drug had created unrealistic investor expectations, leading to substantial financial losses when the clinical data failed to meet those expectations.

The piece acknowledges that while biotech CEOs commonly advocate for their company's products, such cheerleading carries serious risks when it creates a disconnect from clinical reality. The author emphasizes that Alzheimer's research is inherently challenging, and investors should approach such investments with appropriate caution about the long odds of success. The article concludes with a call for transparency and accountability in biotech leadership.

## 2. HISTORY

**Bapineuzumab's Clinical Failure:** Following the 2008 disappointment, bapineuzumab continued through clinical trials but ultimately failed in Phase 3 trials completed around 2012. The drug did not show significant clinical benefit in treating Alzheimer's disease, leading to the termination of its development program.

**Corporate Changes:** Elan Corporation faced continued challenges. In 2013, the company was acquired by Perrigo in a deal worth approximately $8.6 billion. The company's assets and pipeline were restructured through various transactions.

**Alzheimer's Research Landscape:** The failure of bapineuzumab was part of a broader pattern of challenges in Alzheimer's drug development. The amyloid hypothesis—targeting amyloid beta proteins in the brain—continued to face skepticism as multiple high-profile trials failed despite promising early data.

**Regulatory and Market Impact:** The biotech sector's experience with bapineuzumab contributed to increasingly cautious investor sentiment toward Alzheimer's drug development. This created a more challenging funding environment for similar approaches in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in the Original Article:**
• **Risk of CEO cheerleading backfiring:** ✓ **ACCURATE** - The article warned that unrealistic promotion would damage investor trust and make it harder to raise future capital. Elan indeed faced continued challenges, and the broader biotech sector became more skeptical of Alzheimer's drug hype.

• **Alzheimer's as "tremendously difficult field":** ✓ **ACCURATE** - The prediction that Alzheimer's drug development would remain challenging proved highly accurate. Even as of 2024, the field has shown only modest advances with very high failure rates, confirming the author's caution about long odds.

• **No shortage of contenders for "worst CEO" award:** ✓ **ACCURATE** - The biotech sector has continued to see numerous examples of overpromotion and subsequent clinical failures, validating the prediction that such behavior would persist.

• **Investors learning to approach with caution:** ✓ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE** - While institutional investors did become more cautious about Alzheimer's drug investments, retail investor enthusiasm for "breakthrough" Alzheimer's treatments has persisted, with new companies frequently experiencing similar hype-disappointment cycles.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
The article remains relevant as a case study in biotech investment dynamics and executive accountability, especially given the continued challenges in Alzheimer's drug development and persistent patterns of overpromotion in biotechnology.
