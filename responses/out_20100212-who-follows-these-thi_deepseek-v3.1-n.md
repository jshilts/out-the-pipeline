# Who Follows These Things? (Feb 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article expresses skepticism about scientific journals adopting social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook in 2010. The author questions whether anyone actually finds value in following journals on these platforms, suggesting the adoption feels more like a bandwagon effect rather than genuine utility. The piece portrays an imagined editorial meeting where journals decide to join social media primarily because "everybody's doing it" and it costs nothing, rather than because of demonstrated scientific or professional value. The author admits to preferring RSS feeds and acknowledges they might be "set in their ways."

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following 2010, social media adoption by scientific journals and researchers expanded dramatically, though with mixed and contested outcomes. Twitter (now X) became a significant platform for scientific communication, with many journals, researchers, and institutions building substantial followings. The platform enabled rapid dissemination of publications, conference discussions, and scientific debates.

However, the utility remained controversial. Studies showed that highly tweeted papers didn't necessarily correlate with citation impact, though social media attention could increase article visibility and Altmetric scores. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital scientific communication but also highlighted problems - misinformation spread rapidly, and the pressure for "impact" through social metrics sometimes prioritized attention over scientific rigor.

By the late 2010s and early 2020s, many scientists had grown disillusioned with social media platforms due to harassment, politicization of science, and platform instability. Some migrated to alternative platforms like Mastodon or returned to more traditional communication methods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit predictions, but contained implicit skepticism about whether social media adoption by journals would prove valuable.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This piece captures an important moment of technological transition in scientific communication, though its scope is narrow. The underlying tension it identifies - between genuine utility and bandwagon adoption - remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade of social media's evolution in science.
