# Repurposing for Cervical Cancer (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses researchers at Manchester University exploring the repurposing of lopinavir, an existing HIV medication, as a therapy for HPV (human papillomavirus), which causes most cervical cancers. While an HPV vaccine exists, it doesn't benefit women already diagnosed with or suspected of having cervical disease. The Manchester team, collaborating with researchers in Kenya, conducted a preliminary trial that reportedly showed a very high response rate, and they were seeking funding for a larger trial involving up to 1,000 patients. The author notes that repurposing opportunities might be more numerous than initially thought, especially when new biology or target identification emerges.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2014 article, research continued on lopinavir's potential against HPV-related cervical disease, though progress has been measured rather than transformative. The Manchester group and collaborators pursued further clinical studies, including investigating topical lopinavir formulations. However, this approach has not led to widely adopted clinical practice or FDA approval for cervical cancer treatment. Lopinavir remains primarily an HIV medication used in combination antiretroviral therapy, with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.

HPV research and clinical practice moved in other directions: HPV vaccination programs expanded globally with Gardasil and Cervarix, and screening methods continued evolving with improved Pap smear techniques and HPV DNA testing. Therapeutic vaccines and immunotherapies for HPV-related cancers have been explored extensively, though most remain in development. Cervical cancer treatment still relies primarily on surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, with no major repurposed drug breakthrough emerging from the lopinavir approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions and observations:
- **That lopinavir therapy might provide significant benefit for HPV-related cervical disease**: This has not materialized as a standard treatment option. While research continued, it did not lead to approved therapies or widespread clinical adoption.
- **That HPV-driven disease would gradually disappear through vaccination**: This has shown progress but remains incomplete. HPV vaccination programs have reduced infection rates significantly in many countries, but global coverage remains uneven, and cervical cancer still affects hundreds of thousands annually.
- **That the larger trial would validate early promising results**: The subsequent research did not produce the breakthrough results that would have justified widespread clinical implementation.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an interesting concept (drug repurposing) and a devastating disease, but the specific intervention didn't translate into meaningful clinical impact. While well-intentioned and scientifically reasonable, this particular research direction didn't fulfill its early promise. Drug repurposing continues to be important in oncology, but this wasn't one of its landmark successes.
