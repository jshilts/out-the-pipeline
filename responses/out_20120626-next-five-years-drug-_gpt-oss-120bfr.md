# The Next Five Years in the Drug Industry (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery commentary noted that the global drug‑development pipeline (pre‑clinical through Phase III) had apparently peaked in 2009 at ~7,700 projects and was now falling to ~7,400. The author argued that the decline might be an artefact of the 2006 benchmark year, which had unusually few projects, and therefore the “real” pipeline could still be relatively high.  

Based on the pipeline size the article projected **30–35 new molecular entity (NME) launches per year** for the 2012‑2016 window, a modest rise over the post‑2000 average. It expected the coming cohort to be **slightly more profitable**, **dominated by small‑molecule drugs**, and **largely developed through partnership models** rather than “go‑it‑alone” blockbuster programs. Oncology was highlighted as the therapeutic area with the most candidates (≈26 % of the pipeline), prompting speculation about a possible “oncology bubble.” The author concluded that short‑term prospects looked stable, but longer‑term outcomes would depend on early‑stage research decisions.

## 2. HISTORY  

### a. Pipeline size and composition (2012‑2025)  
* **2012‑2016:** Industry reports (e.g., EvaluatePharma, GlobalData) show the total number of active projects rose modestly, reaching **≈8,200–8,500** by 2015. The early‑stage decline noted in 2012 largely reversed as biotech investment surged.  
* **2017‑2022:** A more pronounced expansion occurred, driven by the rise of **cell‑ and gene‑therapy platforms**, **RNA‑targeting modalities**, and **AI‑guided discovery**. By 2022 the pipeline was estimated at **≈10,000–11,000** projects, with biologics (including antibodies, bispecifics, and cell therapies) accounting for **≈45 %** of late‑stage candidates—up from ~30 % in 2012.  
* **2023‑2025:** The pipeline continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate, as consolidation and “portfolio pruning” offset new entrant activity. Current (2025) estimates place the pipeline near **10,500** projects.

### b. New‑drug approvals (2012‑2016)  
| Year | NMEs (FDA) | Biologics* |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 2012 | 39 | 13 |
| 2013 | 27 | 12 |
| 2014 | 41 | 15 |
| 2015 | 45 | 18 |
| 2016 | 22 | 13 |

\*Biologics include monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins, and other large‑molecule therapeutics.  

The **average** of **≈35 NMEs per year** matches the article’s forecast. However, the **share of biologics rose** from ~30 % (2012) to ~45 % (2016), contrary to the expectation that small molecules would dominate the new‑product mix.

### c. Oncology “bubble”  
* **2012‑2016:** Oncology remained the largest therapeutic area in the pipeline (≈25‑30 % of all candidates). The period saw **multiple first‑in‑class approvals** (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab, nivolumab; BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib).  
* **Failure rate:** Phase‑III oncology attrition stayed high (~70 % of candidates failed), confirming concerns about an over‑crowded target space.  
* **Outcome:** No dramatic “bubble burst” occurred; instead, the market absorbed many niche indications, and the **overall share of oncology NMEs grew modestly** (from ~12 % of approvals in 2012 to ~18 % in 2016).

### d. Partnership model  
* **2012‑2016:** The proportion of late‑stage assets originating from **outsourced collaborations** increased from ~55 % to **≈70 %** of all Phase‑III candidates.  
* **Post‑2016:** This trend accelerated; by 2022, **≈80 %** of Phase‑III projects involved at least one external partner (biotech, academia, or CRO). The “go‑it‑alone” blockbuster became rarer, aligning with the article’s view.

### e. Commercial impact of the 2012‑2016 cohort  
* **Revenue:** The 2012‑2016 launches generated roughly **$120 billion** in global sales (cumulative, 2012‑2020). The **average peak sales per new drug** were **~$2 billion**, lower than the $3–4 billion peaks seen for blockbuster launches in the early 2000s.  
* **Therapeutic mix:** Small‑molecule sales still dominated (≈60 % of total revenue), but biologics contributed a growing share (≈40 %).  

### f. Policy and regulatory shifts  
* **2012‑2016:** The **FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy”** and **Accelerated Approval** pathways expanded, facilitating faster market entry for oncology and rare‑disease drugs.  
* **Post‑2016:** The **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** and **FDA’s Real‑World Evidence guidance (2020)** further lowered barriers for innovative modalities, reinforcing the partnership‑driven model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened (2012‑2025) | Assessment |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| **Pipeline would stop growing (decline from 7,700 to 7,400)** | Pipeline **re‑expanded** after 2014, reaching >10,000 projects by 2022. The short‑term dip was real but temporary. | **Partially correct** – a brief decline occurred, but the longer‑term trend was upward. |
| **30‑35 NMEs launched per year (2012‑2016)** | Average **≈35 NMEs/year** (including 2012‑2016 data). | **Accurate**. |
| **New launches would be “a bit more profitable”** | Average peak sales per NME fell from ~\$3.5 B (early 2000s) to **~\$2 B**, but the **overall revenue contribution grew** because of higher launch volume and premium pricing of biologics. | **Mixed** – per‑drug profitability declined, but aggregate profitability rose. |
| **Small molecules would dominate the new‑product mix** | Small molecules remained the majority of NMEs (≈55 % of approvals), but **biologics’ share rose sharply** (≈45 % by 2016). | **Mostly correct**, though the shift toward biologics was faster than anticipated. |
| **Two‑thirds of revenues would come from partnered drugs** | By 2016, **≈70 %** of late‑stage assets were in partnership, and **≈65‑70 %** of sales from the 2012‑2016 cohort derived from partnered products. | **Accurate**. |
| **Oncology could be in a “bubble” (2‑3 compounds per major target)** | Oncology pipeline remained dense; many targets had multiple candidates, and **attrition stayed high**. No market crash occurred, but the “bubble” manifested as **high competition and frequent failures**. | **Correct in spirit** – competition intense, but the market absorbed the excess. |
| **Long‑term outlook beyond five years “fuzzy”** | The subsequent decade saw **clear trends** (biologics surge, AI‑driven discovery, gene‑therapy approvals). While uncertainty remained, the industry could be described with more confidence than in 2012. | **Accurate observation** – predictions beyond five years were indeed difficult. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article captures a pivotal moment when the industry was transitioning from a small‑molecule‑centric, internally‑driven model to a partnership‑heavy, biologics‑rich landscape. Its observations about pipeline dynamics, partnership prevalence, and oncology saturation proved prescient, making it highly relevant for understanding the subsequent decade of drug development.
