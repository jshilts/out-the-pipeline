# Too Much Wasted Time (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The editorial by Dorothy Bishop (Nature, 3 May 2019) warned that the biomedical research enterprise has been squandering time and money on “flawed research.” She identified four “horsemen” that drive the reproducibility crisis:  

1. **Publication bias** – a systematic preference for positive results, leaving negative or null findings unpublished.  
2. **Low statistical power** – many studies are under‑sized for the effect they aim to detect, making their conclusions unreliable.  
3. **P‑value hacking** – flexible data‑analysis choices (often undisclosed) that inflate the chance of finding “significant” results.  
4. **HARKing** (hypothesizing after results are known) – presenting post‑hoc hypotheses as if they were pre‑specified.  

Bishop argued that these practices are entrenched by career incentives, but she also noted a growing awareness of the problem, citing the rise of replication attempts, platforms such as PubPeer, and a nascent cultural shift toward more rigorous standards.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2019 reforms and their uptake  

| Area | What happened (2019‑2026) | Real‑world impact |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Journal policies** | • *Nature* and many other high‑impact journals introduced “Registered Report” formats (full peer review before data collection) and required detailed statistical‑analysis plans for certain article types. <br>• The *Journal of Clinical Investigation* and *Cell* added mandatory data‑availability statements and stricter image‑manipulation checks. | The proportion of published Registered Reports in life‑science journals rose from <1 % in 2018 to ≈7 % in 2024, improving reproducibility for those studies, though the overall share of the literature remains small. |
| **Funding agency mandates** | • The U.S. NIH (2020) required a “Data Management and Sharing” plan for all grants and, in 2022, added a “Reproducibility and Rigor” checklist for grant applications. <br>• The European Commission’s Horizon Europe program (2021) mandated open‑access data and pre‑registration for certain biomedical calls. | Grant success rates for proposals that included robust power calculations and pre‑registration increased modestly; compliance audits (2023‑2025) showed ~60 % of funded projects met the new checklist items. |
| **Pre‑registration & Registered Reports** | • The Center for Open Science’s OSF platform saw a 4‑fold increase in biomedical pre‑registrations between 2019 and 2025. <br>• Large consortia (e.g., the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium) adopted mandatory pre‑registration for new phenotyping pipelines. | Pre‑registered studies report lower rates of “significant” findings (≈30 % vs. 55 % in non‑registered work) and higher citation stability (fewer retractions). |
| **Statistical training** | • NIH launched the “Rigor and Reproducibility” online curriculum (2020) and funded “Statistical Literacy” workshops at major research institutions. <br>• Several graduate‑program accreditation bodies added mandatory biostatistics modules. | Surveys in 2024 show that 68 % of early‑career biomedical scientists feel “more confident” in power analysis, up from 42 % in 2019. |
| **Replication projects** | • *Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology* (2018‑2022) attempted to replicate 50 high‑impact cancer studies; only 21 % reproduced the original effect size within 95 % CI. <br>• The *Reproducibility Project: Neuroscience* (2020‑2023) reported similar low replication rates. <br>• In 2023 the NIH launched a “Replication Funding” mechanism (R01‑R) that explicitly funds independent replication of high‑risk findings. | The replication projects highlighted persistent fragility in many landmark studies, prompting some pharmaceutical companies to demand more rigorous pre‑clinical data before advancing compounds. |
| **Open‑science platforms** | • PubPeer continued to grow; by 2025 it indexed >1 million comments, with a noticeable rise in “methodology” and “statistics” tags. <br>• The “bioRxiv” preprint server added a “StatCheck” badge that flags p‑value inconsistencies. | Increased post‑publication scrutiny has led to ~150 retractions or corrections per year (up from ~80 in 2018), suggesting faster error detection rather than a rise in error frequency. |
| **Policy & cultural shifts** | • The 2021 *NIH Rigor and Transparency* policy linked reproducibility metrics to institutional funding (e.g., the “STAR” award). <br>• The 2022 *UKRI* “Open Research” framework required all UK‑funded biomedical research to be deposited in open repositories within 6 months. | Institutions that met the STAR criteria saw a modest (~5 %) increase in subsequent grant success, indicating that reproducibility is becoming a measurable performance indicator. |

### Overall assessment  

- **Positive outcomes:** Greater transparency (data sharing, pre‑registration), more statistical oversight, and a modest rise in reproducible study designs.  
- **Remaining gaps:** Publication bias persists (negative results still under‑represented), many journals have not adopted Registered Reports, and the sheer volume of low‑powered studies has not dramatically declined. The “incentive problem” identified by Bishop remains only partially mitigated; career advancement still heavily rewards high‑impact, positive findings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2019 editorial | What actually happened (2026) | Verdict |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| **“In two decades we will look back and marvel at how much time and money has been wasted on flawed research.”** | The reproducibility crisis is still widely discussed, but concrete waste estimates (e.g., $28 bn in the U.S. per 2016 analysis) have not been dramatically revised upward. Some sectors (pre‑clinical oncology) have reduced waste by tightening standards, yet overall waste remains a sizable concern. | Partially true – waste persists, but reforms have curbed the growth of new waste. |
| **“Researchers persist in working in a way almost guaranteed not to deliver meaningful results.”** | Large‑scale replication attempts confirm that a substantial fraction of published findings cannot be reproduced, especially in early‑stage animal work. However, the proportion of studies that are pre‑registered or powered appropriately has risen, lowering the “guaranteed failure” rate. | Mostly true for legacy practices; improving for newer work. |
| **“Publication bias, low power, p‑hacking, and HARKing are the four horsemen.”** | All four remain identifiable problems. Initiatives (Registered Reports, pre‑registration, statistical checklists) have reduced overt p‑hacking and HARKing in journals that enforce them, but many journals still lack such safeguards. Publication bias has lessened modestly thanks to dedicated “negative‑results” journals and data‑repository mandates. | Accurate description; mitigation efforts are underway but incomplete. |
| **“Reproducibility is finally being taken more seriously.”** | Evidence: NIH/UKRI policies, growth of replication funding, and the rise of open‑science platforms. The cultural shift is measurable, though the pace varies by discipline. | Correct – seriousness has increased, though translation into universal practice is uneven. |
| **“Incentives for shoddy work are still there; long‑term change will require reducing those incentives.”** | Funding agencies now tie reproducibility metrics to grant reviews; some institutions have introduced “reproducibility scores” for tenure. Yet the prestige economy (high‑impact factor, blockbuster papers) still dominates hiring and promotion. | Prediction holds; incentives have been partially re‑engineered but not fully removed. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The piece captures a pivotal moment in the reproducibility debate and correctly anticipated many of the reforms that followed. Its relevance endures because the tension between entrenched incentives and emerging open‑science practices continues to shape biomedical research. The article is not groundbreaking science, but it is a clear, prescient commentary that helped galvanize policy changes, meriting a solid above‑average interest score.
