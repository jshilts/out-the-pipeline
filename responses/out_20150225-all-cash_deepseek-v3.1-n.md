# All That Cash (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines the massive cash reserves held by large pharmaceutical companies and questions why relatively little of this capital flows into biotech startups. The author cites data from LifeSciVC showing the disparity between pharma cash balances and funding for new ventures. The piece explores various explanations for this phenomenon, including industry-specific factors like acquisition needs and legal risks, as well as broader trends in corporate cash accumulation. A key argument presented is that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are more attractive to executives and investors than internal R&D investment because acquisitions produce immediate, clearly visible outcomes on balance sheets. In contrast, investing in early-stage research requires explaining long-term, uncertain payoffs that may take a decade or more to materialize. The author suggests this creates a situation where big pharma companies prefer acquiring developed assets rather than growing the broader biotech sector through venture investment or direct funding of innovative startups.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015-2024 period witnessed significant shifts in pharmaceutical cash deployment and biotech funding patterns. The years immediately following the article saw substantial M&A activity, including major deals like **AbbVie's $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics (2015)**, **Pfizer's $14 billion purchase of Medivation (2016)**, and **Takeda's $62 billion takeover of Shire (2018)**—one of the largest pharma deals in history.

The biotech sector experienced dramatic changes. **From 2015-2021, biotech saw unprecedented funding growth**, with venture capital investment increasing from approximately **$8 billion in 2015 to over $36 billion in 2021**. This surge was driven by scientific advances in gene therapy, immuno-oncology, and mRNA technology. However, **the 2022-2023 period brought a severe market correction**, with biotech indices declining significantly and IPO activity dropping sharply.

Several major drugs that originated from smaller biotech companies during this period achieved blockbuster status and widespread patient uptake, including **Keytruda (Merck), which surpassed $20 billion in annual sales**, and the **mRNA COVID-19 vaccines** (Pfizer/BioNTech's Comirnaty and Moderna's Spikevax), demonstrating both the clinical and commercial potential of biotech innovation. The biotech sector also delivered breakthrough therapies for orphan diseases, rare conditions, and advanced cancer treatments.

Corporate venture capital did expand during this period, with **Pfizer Ventures, Novartis Venture Funds, and J&J Innovation** remaining active, though their scale remained modest compared to independent VC funds. The biotech ecosystem became increasingly reliant on **specialized crossover investors and dedicated healthcare funds** rather than corporate venture arms. Importantly, **many major pharma companies did begin returning substantial capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks**, with the sector consistently ranking among the highest for shareholder returns.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: A major wave of M&A deals would occur in 2015 driven by large cash reserves.
  - **Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. While there were significant deals in 2015-2016 (AbbVie/Pharmacyclics, Pfizer/Hospira, Teva/Actavis Generics), the predicted wave materialized more strongly in 2017-2019, with the $62 billion Takeda/Shire deal and Celgene's acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb as landmark transactions.

- **Prediction**: Large pharma companies would continue preferring M&A over internal R&D investment or seeding new companies.
  - **Outcome**: **Broadly accurate**. The preference for M&A persisted throughout the period, with major companies like Novartis, Roche, and AstraZeneca continuing significant acquisition strategies. However, internal R&D investment did increase modestly across the sector as companies recognized the need for innovation pipelines.

- **Prediction**: Corporate venture funds would remain relatively small and serve more for signaling than substantial investment.
  - **Outcome**: **Mostly accurate**. While corporate VC continued operating, they generally remained smaller than dedicated healthcare funds, with most major biotech funding coming from independent venture capital firms and specialized investors.

- **Prediction**: Shareholder pressure would eventually force companies to deploy cash reserves more productively.
  - **Outcome**: **Mixed**. While shareholder activism increased, particularly around drug pricing and strategic direction, major pharma companies maintained substantial cash positions throughout most of the period, with significant portions still being returned to shareholders rather than invested in early-stage innovation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article was prescient in identifying structural issues in biotech funding that became increasingly relevant as the sector grew and evolved over the subsequent decade. The core tension between M&A preferences and early-stage investment remained a defining characteristic of the industry, making the piece more insightful in retrospect than it might have appeared initially.
