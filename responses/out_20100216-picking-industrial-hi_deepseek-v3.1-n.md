# Picking Up Industrial Hires (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses St. Louis University's initiative to establish a research institute that would hire former Pfizer employees who had been laid off in the region. The effort was small-scale, starting with just 12 hires, but represented a strategy of academic institutions viewing displaced industry personnel as valuable resources worth retaining. The author speculated that this approach might help maintain research culture in areas experiencing workforce reductions, potentially leading to startup company formation once financial conditions improved. The piece also questioned whether Washington University, a larger institution in the same region, had made similar moves to absorb these experienced industry researchers.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2010 article, the St. Louis region did not emerge as a major biotechnology hub despite these early efforts to retain talent. St. Louis University's research enterprise has maintained steady but not exceptional growth in biomedical research, with their medical school continuing to receive NIH funding in the range of \$50-80 million annually through the 2010s, but without developing into a premier biotech cluster comparable to Boston, San Francisco, or San Diego.

The strategy of academic institutions hiring laid-off industry scientists did become more widespread nationally, with many universities establishing translational research programs and biotech incubators that incorporated former industry talent. However, the broader St. Louis region's biotechnology sector remained relatively modest compared to leading clusters. Major pharmaceutical companies continued restructuring throughout the 2010s, creating a consistent pool of experienced researchers that academic institutions could draw upon.

Washington University in St. Louis, which the author wondered about, did maintain its position as a leading research institution with substantial NIH funding (typically ranking in the top 5-10 recipients), but it did not lead to St. Louis becoming a dominant biotech destination. The region developed some biotech presence, particularly around agricultural biotechnology and medical devices, but failed to achieve the critical mass seen in established biotech hubs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Small-scale hiring (12 people initially) would have limited immediate impact
  - **Outcome**: Consistent with reality; SLU's biotechnology research did not dramatically transform the regional landscape

• **Prediction**: This approach could help maintain research culture in areas where it was being "thinned out"
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated - many regions did maintain research activity, but St. Louis specifically did not become a major biotech cluster

• **Prediction**: Maintaining research talent could lead to startup companies emerging when financial conditions improved
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated - biotech startup formation did increase nationally after 2010 as financial markets recovered, and some university-industry partnerships generated spin-offs, but St. Louis did not experience exceptional startup growth compared to established biotech hubs

• **Prediction**: Academic institutions would find value in hiring former industry employees
  - **Outcome**: Validated - this became a widespread practice, with universities actively recruiting industry-experienced scientists for translational research programs

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an interesting early strategy for talent retention during the pharmaceutical industry's restructuring period, but the specific case discussed had relatively limited broader impact, and the topic is fairly niche compared to other transformative biotechnology developments occurring simultaneously.
