I notice that the text you've provided appears to be a personal blog post about barbecue and cooking rather than an article about the biotechnology industry from Science Magazine. This seems to be a casual Fourth of July weekend post about preparing pork shoulder and lime sorbet, not a biotech industry analysis.

Could you please provide the correct article from Science Magazine that you'd like me to analyze? Alternatively, if you meant to share a different piece about biotechnology, I'd be happy to work with that material instead. Once I have the actual biotech article, I can provide the thorough analysis you're looking for with the four sections you outlined.
