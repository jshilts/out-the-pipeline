# Astellas Closing the OSI and Perseid Sites? (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article reported rumors that Astellas Pharma was closing two US facilities: the OSI Pharmaceuticals site in Farmingdale, New York, and the Perseid Therapeutics site in Redwood City, California. The author notes the information came from morning reports and indicates that more details would follow, with the expectation that readers with direct knowledge might contribute additional information in the comments section. The article appears to be what would now be considered a short-form industry blog post sharing developing news about pharmaceutical company site closures.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments confirmed and clarified these site closures within the broader context of Astellas' corporate restructuring and integration strategy:

**OSI Pharmaceuticals Acquisition and Closure:**
- Astellas had acquired OSI Pharmaceuticals in 2010 for approximately $4 billion
- The Farmingdale, NY site housed OSI's research and development operations
- Astellas completed the closure as part of consolidating R&D operations, centralizing research activities to reduce costs and eliminate redundancy
- OSI's flagship drug Tarceva (erlotinib) continued to be marketed by Genentech and OSI (later fully integrated into Astellas)
- The site closure resulted in significant job losses on Long Island

**Perseid Therapeutics Context:**
- Perseid Therapeutics was focused on autoimmune disease therapies
- Less public information is available about the Perseid closure, but it appears to have been part of broader portfolio optimization

These closures reflected pharmaceutical industry trends toward consolidation and R&D efficiency, with large companies like Astellas rationalizing their site footprint after major acquisitions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made no explicit predictions about future developments. It served as a news brief reporting current events rather than offering forward-looking analysis or forecasts about the biotechnology industry or pharmaceutical sector.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

The article ranks low in long-term interest as it primarily reported routine pharmaceutical industry restructuring news with limited broader scientific or technological implications beyond the immediate impact on affected employees and local communities.
