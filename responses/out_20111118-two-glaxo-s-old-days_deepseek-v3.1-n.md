# Two From Glaxo's Old Days (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief obituary-style commentary honors two recently deceased Glaxo scientists, chemist John Bradshaw and pharmacologist Sir David Jack. Bradshaw discovered Zantac (ranitidine) in 1976 and later contributed key insights that enabled the development of Salmeterol (a component of Advair). Sir David Jack, who joined the company earlier, was involved with at least seven marketed drugs including these projects. The article notes that even in retirement, Jack championed a compound called RPL554, then in clinical trials with Verona Pharma. The author emphasizes that major drug discoveries stem from specific talented individuals worth studying.

## 2. HISTORY

**Zantac (ranitidine)** was one of the most commercially successful pharmaceuticals in history, becoming the world's top-selling drug in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It faced patent expiration in 1997 in major markets, leading to generic competition. The drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in 2020 due to contamination concerns with the probable carcinogen NDMA detected in ranitidine products, and it remains unavailable.

**Salmeterol**, combined with fluticasone in **Advair**, became a blockbuster respiratory medication for asthma and COPD. Advair maintained multi-billion dollar annual sales through the 2000s and 2010s. Patent protection ended earlier in some markets (e.g., 2010 in the US for the Diskus device), and generics have since entered the market, though some variants faced legal challenges extending market exclusivity into the 2010s.

Regarding **RPL554**: The article mentioned Verona Pharma had this compound in clinical trials in 2011. RPL554 (ensifentrine) progressed through development for COPD and respiratory conditions. In 2023, Verona submitted an NDA to the FDA for ensifentrine as maintenance treatment for COPD, with PDUFA date in June 2024. However, in May 2024 the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter requesting additional data. The drug's investigational status thus extends well beyond 2011 when Jack was noted as its champion post-retirement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Reference to future potential of RPL554**: The article mentioned RPL554 was "even now in clinical trials" — this was descriptive rather than predictive, but the implication was that Jack's post-retirement influence might lead to another successful drug. This has not yet materialized as of 2024 (FDA approval not achieved).

- **Tacit prediction about learning from successful drug discoverers**: The article's closing statement suggests that studying people who've made multiple major discoveries could yield useful insights. This is methodological rather than testable through specific empirical outcomes.


## 4. INTEREST
**Decile Score: 4**

The article's primary contribution is documenting the careers of two influential drug discoverers immediately after their deaths, with an emphasis on human-driven discovery. However, the piece is brief and provides minimal analytical depth—essentially serving as an obituary notice rather than deep industry commentary.
