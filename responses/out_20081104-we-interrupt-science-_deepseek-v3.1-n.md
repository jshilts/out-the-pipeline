# We Interrupt This Science. . .For Some Politics (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a personal political commentary written on Election Day 2008 by a science blogger who typically avoids politics. The author identifies as an economic conservative—supporting capitalism, free markets, wealth creation, and minimal government intervention—while holding generally libertarian social views favoring wide personal freedoms as long as others aren't harmed. He expresses deep dissatisfaction with both major presidential candidates (John McCain and Barack Obama), finding both parties wanting. He criticizes McCain's economic statements as "disgraceful" while questioning Obama's Chicago political background. The author also disapproves of both vice-presidential picks, viewing Sarah Palin as unqualified and Joe Biden as a "blowhard hack." Living in Massachusetts where Obama is certain to win, he contemplates voting Libertarian as he did in 1992, but acknowledges the choice is largely symbolic. He concludes by apologizing for a rare political diversion and promising to return to science topics.

## 2. HISTORY

The article was published on November 4, 2008, the day Barack Obama was elected president. Obama did indeed win Massachusetts by a 26-point margin (62%-36%), as the author anticipated. What actually happened after this election:

**Obama Administration (2009-2017)**: Obama was inaugurated in January 2009 and served two terms. His administration implemented the Affordable Care Act (2010), which dramatically expanded healthcare access but also increased government spending and regulation—contrary to the author's small-government preferences. The stimulus package (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) also involved significant government spending.

**Science and Biotechnology Policy**: The Obama administration maintained strong support for science funding, including NIH budgets. The 21st Century Cures Act, which eventually passed in 2016 with bipartisan support, aimed to accelerate drug development and FDA approval processes—issues relevant to biotechnology.

**Sarah Palin's Trajectory**: Palin resigned as Alaska governor in July 2009, about seven months after the election. She became a prominent Tea Party movement figure and media personality but did not secure the Republican presidential nomination in subsequent cycles, though she remained influential in conservative politics.

**Joe Biden's Role**: Biden served as Vice President for eight years under Obama, playing a significant role in foreign policy and becoming a credible presidential candidate himself. In 2020, Biden was elected president.

The author's concern about Democrats controlling both the presidency and Congress materialized from 2009-2011, and again later.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains several implicit predictions or expectations:

- **"Obama will take this state even if an asteroid hits"** ✓ **CORRECT**. Obama won Massachusetts with 62% vs. McCain's 36%.

- **"It would do the Republicans a lot of good to be thoroughly out of power for a while"** - **PARTIALLY CORRECT**. Republicans lost the presidency and both houses in 2008. This did lead to internal party reflection and the rise of the Tea Party movement, which some argue strengthened conservative grassroots but also created internal divisions.

- **"Having the Presidency and both houses of Congress will tend to bring out the worst in the Democrats"** - **DEBATABLE**. Democrats did control both branches 2009-2011 and passed major legislation (ACA, stimulus). While this fulfilled liberal policy goals, it also triggered strong conservative backlash and Republican gains in 2010 midterms.

- **Sarah Palin as "rising star"** - **MIXED OUTCOME**. Palin did become (in)famous and influential in conservative media, but didn't achieve mainstream electoral success and eventually faded from presidential contention.

The author correctly anticipated some political dynamics but underestimated the lasting policy changes that unified Democratic control would achieve.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article has little relevance to biotechnology or science. While it provides insight into the political thinking of a scientist, it's primarily a dated political opinion piece that contains no scientific content, biotechnology analysis, or predictions relevant to the industry.
