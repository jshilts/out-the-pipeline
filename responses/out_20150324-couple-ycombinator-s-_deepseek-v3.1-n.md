# A Couple of Y Combinator's Startups (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary discusses Y Combinator's early entry into biotech through two notable startups from its cohort. The author identifies that most companies in YC's biotech batch focus on patient care or diagnostics, but highlights two exceptions with distinct technical approaches.

**20n** is engineering microbes to biologically produce pharmaceuticals and intermediates. The author questions the commercial rationale, noting the example given (acetaminophen) is already cheap and easy to manufacture industrially, while expressing uncertainty about the scientific claims behind their "map of every chemical that can be made biologically."

**Atomwise** aims to use supercomputing and machine learning for drug discovery—predicting which molecules will be effective medicines versus toxic compounds, and repurposing existing drugs. At the time, the company claimed to use cutting-edge algorithms on powerful supercomputers to analyze much larger databases than previous attempts. The author remains highly skeptical but open-minded, emphasizing that "arguments are settled by data." Atomwise's CEO Abraham Heifets commented that they were conducting a large-scale evaluation with Merck and invited the community to evaluate their predictive capabilities.

## 2. HISTORY

**20n's trajectory** reflects the broader synthetic biology landscape. The company, founded by geneticist Chris Voigt's lab members from MIT, focused on engineered microbes for chemical production. However, the business model faced challenges. The pharmaceutical synthesis space proved difficult to penetrate due to entrenched manufacturing processes and the economics Voigt identified. Synthetic biology companies more broadly had mixed success—while some achieved major milestones (like Ginkgo Bioworks going public through SPAC), many struggled with scale-up and commercialization. 20n itself appears to have had limited impact; there is no evidence it led to widely adopted pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The company's ambitious "map of every chemical" vision does not appear to have materialized as a practical tool.

**Atomwise's path** illustrates the maturation of AI drug discovery. Following the 2015 article, the company built partnerships and continued developing its technology. Rather than immediate transformational impact, Atomwise pursued a more gradual validation strategy. The Merck collaboration mentioned in 2015 represents an early pharma partnership. Over subsequent years, the company raised significant funding rounds and expanded partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. However, the field of AI drug discovery evolved more slowly than initial hype suggested. While computational methods became increasingly integrated into drug discovery workflows, they did not replace traditional methods as dramatically as hoped. Atomwise continued operating through 2025, but like many AI drug discovery companies, faced the fundamental challenge that successful drug development requires extensive experimental validation regardless of computational predictions. The company demonstrated proof-of-concept for specific targets but did not single-handedly transform drug discovery economics.

The timing is noteworthy: AlphaFold's protein structure breakthrough came in 2018 and 2020, significantly impacting computational biology, but post-dating this article. The broader AI drug discovery space saw increased investment and activity after Google DeepMind's protein folding advances.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: 20n's engineered microbe approach would enable biological production of pharmaceuticals including already-inexpensive drugs like acetaminophen.
  - *Reality*: The company pursued this direction but did not achieve widespread adoption. Commercial production of pharmaceuticals via engineered microbes remained limited, especially for commodity chemicals. The most successful synthetic biology companies pursued higher-value specialty chemicals and biologics.

• **Prediction**: Atomwise could dramatically reduce drug development costs ($1.8 billion and 15 years quoted in 2015) through supercomputer-powered machine learning predictions of drug efficacy and toxicity.
  - *Reality*: Atomwise demonstrated validation for specific drug discovery programs and maintained pharma partnerships. However, the overall promise of wholesale reduction in drug development timelines and costs did not materialize as envisioned. AI methods became valuable tools in drug discovery but did not fundamentally eliminate the need for extensive experimental validation, clinical trials, and safety testing.

• **Prediction**: Atomwise could "discover new uses for old medicines."
  - *Reality*: Drug repurposing based on computational predictions showed promise and continued development. However, realizing clinical success required extensive additional experimental and clinical work. Examples like baricitinib for COVID-19 highlighted repurposing potential, but computational discovery alone wasn't sufficient.

• **Implicit prediction**: That significant data from the Merck collaboration and other partnerships would settle the debate about computational drug discovery's effectiveness.
  - *Reality*: While Atomwise and others demonstrated positive results in specific contexts, applicability and real-world implementation varied substantially by target and therapeutic area. No single breakthrough eliminated skepticism about computational approaches, but AI tools became more accepted as part of integrated discovery approaches.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captured the early-phase optimism about Y Combinator's biotech pivot and the emergence of AI-driven drug discovery. Its moderate interest stems from documenting the moment when these concepts entered the startup ecosystem, but both highlighted companies had limited disruptive impact compared to the author's measured hope.
