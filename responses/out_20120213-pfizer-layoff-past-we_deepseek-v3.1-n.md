# Pfizer Layoff This Past Weekend? (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief blog post from Science Magazine reporting on rumors of another layoff at Pfizer, specifically affecting researchers at the company's Cambridge location. The author mentions hearing that employees were notified over the weekend, which was noted as unusual timing for such announcements. The post appeared to be seeking confirmation and additional details from readers who might have more information about the situation.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2012 layoff rumors reflected a broader pattern of restructuring at Pfizer during this period. In subsequent years, Pfizer continued significant restructuring efforts, including:

- **2012-2016**: Multiple rounds of layoffs across research sites, with major cuts to R&D operations in the UK (Sandwich, Kent) and continued downsizing in the US
- **2015**: Accelerated restructuring following failed acquisition attempts of AstraZeneca (2014), with thousands of research-related job cuts globally
- **2016**: Major reorganization of research divisions, shifting focus toward specific therapeutic areas while divesting from others
- **2019**: Layoff of approximately 200 employees from Pearl River, NY vaccine research facility
- **2020-Present**: COVID-19 vaccine development (Comirnaty/BioNTech partnership) led to enormous revenue ($36.8 billion in 2022), but the company then faced post-pandemic revenue declines
- **2023**: Announced cost-cutting program of $4 billion including unspecified job cuts due to declining COVID product revenues

The Cambridge site referenced in the article has remained an important location for Pfizer, though the exact impact of the specific 2012 layoff mentioned is not documented in public sources.
