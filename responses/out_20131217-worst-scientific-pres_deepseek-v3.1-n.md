# Worst Scientific Press Releases of 2013? (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Science Magazine's blog section references two other sources to invite nominations for "worst scientific press releases of 2013." It mentions Michael Eisen's blog post calling for submissions in categories like "Most Overhyped" and "Most Egregious Failure to Cite Earlier Work," while also referencing Adam Feuerstein's "Worst Biotech CEO" nominations. The article serves as a call for readers to submit examples of problematic scientific press releases that particularly bothered them during 2013.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2013, several developments have occurred that contextualize this blog post's focus on scientific press release hype:

**Evolving Media and Publishing Landscape**: The period following 2013 saw significant changes in scientific communication. Preprint servers like bioRxiv (launched 2013) grew substantially, social media platforms became major channels for scientific discourse, and concerns about reproducibility in science intensified with high-profile retractions and the "replication crisis."

**Press Release Practices and Criticism**: Criticism of hyped press releases continued and arguably intensified. Michael Eisen, one of the sources cited in the article, became increasingly prominent in advocating for open science and criticizing problematic scientific communication practices.

**Broader Institutional Changes**: Scientific institutions and journals began implementing more rigorous press release guidelines and policies to address concerns about overhyped research, though the effectiveness of these measures remains debated.

**Ongoing Tension**: The fundamental tension between scientific institutions wanting to communicate their work effectively and the tendency toward sensationalism in science communication has persisted and remains unresolved a decade later.

The blog post itself reflects early 2010s concerns about scientific hype that have evolved but not fundamentally changed in nature.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article does not contain explicit predictions about the future of scientific press releases or biotechnology communication. It is primarily retrospective, seeking examples from 2013 rather than forecasting future trends.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4/9**

While the topic of scientific press release quality and hype remains relevant and important, this particular blog post is very brief and primarily serves as a link aggregator pointing to other sources rather than providing original analysis or substantial content of its own.
