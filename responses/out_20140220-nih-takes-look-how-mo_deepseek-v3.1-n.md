# The NIH Takes a Look At How the Money's Spent (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses NIH's examination of research funding effectiveness by reviewing grant allocation outcomes. Michael Lauer at NHLBI analyzed citation records from nearly 1,500 grants awarded between 2001-2008 and made a striking discovery: projects with the poorest peer-review priority scores generated similar numbers of citations and publications as those with the best scores, despite receiving less funding. The piece also mentions discussions within NIH about using citation rates and journal impact factors to evaluate study section performance, potentially labeling panels as "hot" or "cold" based on whether they exceeded field norms. The author expresses skepticism about relying on citation metrics and impact factors as proxies for scientific importance, viewing them as potentially biased measures that don't capture real advancement of human knowledge.

## 2. HISTORY

The questions raised by Lauer's 2014 findings catalyzed significant changes in NIH's approach to research evaluation and funding allocation over the subsequent decade. In 2015, NIH implemented the "Next Generation Researchers Initiative" with new funding mechanisms designed to support early-stage investigators. By 2017, NIH began shifting away from over-reliance on citation-based metrics, partly influenced by growing concerns about metric manipulation and the reproducibility crisis in biomedical research.

The most concrete policy evolution was NIH's adoption of "Article-Level Metrics" in grant reviews starting around 2018-2019, which expanded assessment beyond simple citation counts to include factors like clinical implementation, data sharing, and public impact. Michael Lauer's research contributed to the broader scientific community's recognition that traditional peer review scores imperfectly predict research impact - a finding that gained empirical support from multiple studies published between 2015-2020 examining the correlation between peer review scores and downstream citation impact across various NIH institutes.

By 2022, NIH had integrated these insights into new review criteria emphasizing innovation, scientific rigor, and broader impacts rather than relying primarily on bibliometric proxies. The agency also increased funding for high-risk, high-reward research through mechanisms like the Director's Pioneer and New Innovator Awards, recognizing that conventional peer review might systematically undervalue transformative research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictive statements about future outcomes. Instead, it reported on contemporary findings about the disconnection between peer review scores and citation impact, while expressing concern about over-reliance on bibliometric measures.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article was prescient in highlighting critical flaws in research evaluation systems at a time when these issues were gaining broader recognition, and it documented early evidence that informed subsequent policy changes in major funding agencies. The methodological questions it raised about research assessment remain highly relevant to ongoing debates about scientific funding allocation and evaluation practices.
