# A Call For Academic Drug Companies (Feb 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

In February 2017, Derek Lowe responded critically to a Cell editorial proposing novel approaches to lowering cancer drug costs. The editorial suggested creating academic drug companies that could develop therapies outside traditional pharma structures, partnering with generic manufacturers and implementing price caps. Key arguments included: industry inefficiencies due to redundant clinical trials (800+ checkpoint inhibitor studies), lack of data sharing, and the belief that academic institutions could tackle high-risk targets like mutant KRAS and MYC that commercial companies avoid. The model proposed academic consortia that would de-risk drug candidates before commercialization, maintain societal responsibility by not selling to the highest bidder, and negotiate price caps with investors.

Lowe challenged this vision by highlighting the substantial gap between academic discovery and commercial drug development—emphasizing the critical roles of toxicology, pharmacokinetics, manufacturing quality control, clinical trial execution, and regulatory expertise that typically reside in industry. He questioned whether generic manufacturers would find truly innovative drugs "de-risked" enough for their business models and doubted that academic institutions would resist profit opportunities. The article essentially questioned the feasibility of expecting different economic behaviors from universities and investors than historically observed.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2017, the landscape has evolved significantly, though not entirely in directions predicted by either side:

**Academic Drug Development and Pricing:**
No major academic drug companies emerged as envisioned in the article. Academic institutions continued their traditional roles in early-stage research and target discovery, generally licensing promising candidates to pharmaceutical companies rather than developing them independently. Some academic medical centers expanded clinical trial capabilities, but full drug development—including manufacturing, regulatory approval, and commercialization—remained overwhelmingly industry-led.

Drug pricing controversies intensified rather than abated. High-profile cases included the $475,000 price tag for Novartis' CAR-T therapy Kymriah (approved August 2017), Spark Therapeutics' $850,000 gene therapy Luxturna (approved December 2017), and ongoing debates over cancer drug costs. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 granted Medicare limited drug price negotiation powers—concrete policy change addressing cost concerns, though implementation remains contentious.

**Checkpoint Inhibitor Clinical Trials:**
The redundant clinical trials issue persisted and likely worsened. By 2024, checkpoint inhibitor trials numbered in the thousands across PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, with extensive combination studies but limited head-to-head comparisons. This redundancy reflected both scientific necessity (different combinations, dosing, biomarkers) and competitive dynamics. The FDA approved numerous checkpoint inhibitors between 2017-2024, with Keytruda and Opdivo dominating market share—yet true direct comparisons remained limited due to different trial designs, patient populations, and biomarker assays.

**Target Drugging Progress:**
Significant breakthroughs occurred for the mentioned "undruggable" targets, contradicting claims that pharma avoided them:
- AMG 510 (sotorasib) became the first FDA-approved KRAS G12C inhibitor (May 2021) for non-small cell lung cancer, developed by Amgen following extensive industry investment
- Additional KRAS inhibitors (adagrasib, approved December 2022) and combination approaches entered the clinic
- Mutant p53 and MYC targeting remained challenging, but multiple companies advanced candidates through clinical trials using novel approaches (protein degradation, stapled peptides, combination therapies)

These successes came from traditional pharma/biotech, often through startups acquired by larger companies—the very pathway criticized in the original proposal. The notion that academic institutions could better drug these targets wasn't validated; instead, decades of industry R&D finally yielded fruit through sophisticated medicinal chemistry unlikely to emerge from academic labs.

**Clinical Trial Landscape:**
The article cited 803 checkpoint inhibitor trials with 166,000 patients in 2017. By 2024, registered cancer immunotherapy trials likely exceeded 5,000 globally, suggesting the redundancy concern actually worsened. However, FDA approvals increased, with dozens of checkpoint inhibitor indications approved 2017-2024—suggesting at least some efficiency in bringing therapies to market.

The biomarker challenge persisted. Despite widespread PD-L1 testing, predictive value remained imperfect (FDA approved some checkpoint inhibitors without requiring PD-L1 testing). Novel biomarkers emerged (tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability), but optimal patient selection remained elusive for many indications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**✓ Accurate Predictions:**
- **Generic manufacturers won't pursue innovative drugs:** Generic companies focused on biosimilars and complex generics, not novel drug development. They showed little interest in the high-risk discovery model proposed.
- **Academic institutions won't resist profits:** Universities continued maximizing licensing revenues. Major academic institutions (MIT, Stanford, Harvard, etc.) pursued aggressive IP strategies rather than price-capped models.
- **Drug pricing became politically targeted:** The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) implemented Medicare price negotiations over drug industry objections, validating concerns about political intervention.
- **True head-to-head trials wouldn't materialize:** Limited comparative effectiveness data emerged. Companies pursued market segmentation rather than direct competition.

**✗ Inaccurate Predictions:**
- **Academic drug companies would form:** No significant academic drug companies emerged. Academic medical centers expanded roles in early-phase trials but avoided full pharmaceutical development.
- **Industry wouldn't solve "undruggable" targets without academia:** KRAS G12C inhibitors succeeded through traditional industry pathways, not academic consortium models.
- **Redundancy would decrease with criticism:** Trial duplication increased dramatically post-2017, with thousands of overlapping immunotherapy studies launched.
- **De-risking would attract generic manufacturers:** Generic companies showed no interest in developing novel drugs regardless of perceived de-risking.

**Mixed Outcomes:**
- **Biomarkers would become standard:** PD-L1 testing became widespread but with imperfect predictive value; other biomarkers emerged slowly.
- **Combination therapy trials would improve efficiency:** Many trials combined checkpoint inhibitors, but often sequentially rather than systematically.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses persistent, structurally significant problems in drug development (trial redundancy, target drugging gaps, pricing models) with a provocative but ultimately unrealistic solution. Its interest lies in highlighting how difficult changing industry economics proves—even when inefficiencies seem obvious to outside observers. The discussion of undruggable targets aged particularly well, as breakthroughs did occur through traditional pathways. However, the piece slightly overestimates academic capabilities while underestimating industry transformation of novel science into medicines.
