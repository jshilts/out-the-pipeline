# Mylan Begins Harvesting the Crop It's Sown (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Mylan Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug manufacturer that became notorious for steep EpiPen price increases and faced widespread public outrage. The piece highlights the company's defiant corporate culture, exemplified by then-chairman Robert Coury's crude dismissal of criticism from employees, Congress, Wall Street, and FDA regulators. The article explains that while the FDA lacks direct authority to regulate drug prices, it could influence the market indirectly by promoting generic competition. The piece also notes Mylan's legal troubles, including a $465 million settlement with the government over Medicaid rebate classification issues, with potential additional liabilities of $1.27 billion identified by the HHS Inspector General. Finally, the article describes shareholder activism efforts to replace board members, bolstered by Institutional Shareholder Services recommending votes against ten directors and executive compensation plans.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Mylan's EpiPen controversy and broader industry issues evolved in several key directions:

**Legal and Regulatory Outcomes:**
Mylan's legal challenges continued beyond the settlements mentioned. The company faced numerous lawsuits and investigations related to its pricing practices and Medicaid rebate issues. However, no additional billion-dollar settlements of the magnitude suggested by the HHS findings materialized in the immediate years following 2017.

**FDA Policy Changes:**
The FDA did pursue policies aimed at increasing generic competition, particularly for complex drugs like EpiPen. In 2018, the FDA approved the first generic version of EpiPen from Teva Pharmaceuticals, followed by additional generic competitors entering the market in subsequent years. This competition did eventually put downward pressure on prices, though the transition took longer than advocates had hoped.

**Corporate Governance:**
Shareholder activism had mixed results. While some compensation packages were modified and board composition evolved over time, the fundamental leadership structure remained largely intact through the immediate aftermath. Robert Coury transitioned to executive chairman and later chairman emeritus, but significant board overhaul did not occur as dramatically as ISS had recommended.

**Industry Impact:**
The Mylan controversy became a prominent case study in the broader pharmaceutical pricing debate, contributing to sustained political pressure for drug price reforms. However, comprehensive federal legislation addressing drug prices remained elusive until much later, with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 containing some price negotiation provisions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions about potential outcomes:

• **Enhanced FDA generic competition leading to price relief:** This partially materialized but took longer than expected. The FDA did approve generic competitors (Teva's generic EpiPen in 2018, followed by others), but the impact on pricing was gradual rather than immediate, and brand-name EpiPen maintained significant market share for several years.

• **Significant financial penalties ($1.27 billion from HHS findings):** This prediction did not fully materialize. While Mylan continued to face legal challenges and settlements, no single penalty of the magnitude suggested by the HHS Inspector General's findings was imposed in the years immediately following 2017.

• **Major corporate governance changes through shareholder activism:** This occurred only partially. While ISS recommendations did influence some compensation and governance discussions, the wholesale board replacement suggested in the article did not happen as dramatically as predicted, and leadership continuity persisted.

• **FDA adopting price-focused regulatory authority:** This did not happen. The FDA's mandate remained focused on safety, efficacy, and approval pathways rather than direct price regulation, consistent with the article's acknowledgment that this was unlikely.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured an important moment in pharmaceutical industry accountability and pricing debates, documenting a significant corporate controversy with real regulatory and competitive implications. However, many of the most dramatic predicted outcomes (major governance overhaul, massive penalties, rapid generic competition effects) either didn't materialize or occurred more slowly than anticipated, limiting its long-term prescience.
