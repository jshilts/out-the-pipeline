# Amgen Claims It All (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the competitive landscape around PCSK9 inhibitors, a new class of LDL-cholesterol-lowering drugs that were advancing through clinical trials in 2014. Multiple companies including Amgen, Sanofi/Regeneron, and others were racing to develop PCSK9-targeting therapies, with at least five antibody-based approaches and one RNAi treatment in development. These drugs were entering a market dominated by cheap generic statins, but showed promising clinical data.

The central focus is Amgen's aggressive patent strategy - they were claiming intellectual property rights not just to their specific PCSK9 antibody, but broadly to antibodies targeting PCSK9, particularly those binding to a specific epitope. The article notes this as an unusually broad claim in biotechnology, comparing it to claiming "all inhibitors of enzyme X" in small molecule drugs. The author expresses skepticism that such broad antibody claims would hold up legally, given judicial trends against overly broad biomedical patents, and speculates that the competition would ultimately be decided by clinical effectiveness and market performance rather than patent litigation.

## 2. HISTORY

The PCSK9 inhibitor market developed into one of the most significant pharmaceutical launches of the following decade. Both Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) and Sanofi/Regeneron's Praluent (alirocumab) received FDA approval in 2015, followed by approvals in multiple other countries. The clinical data proved robust - these drugs typically reduce LDL cholesterol by 50-60% when added to statin therapy, representing the most effective LDL-lowering agents since statins themselves.

However, uptake was initially much slower than anticipated due to high pricing (approximately $14,000 per year initially) and payer restrictions. Clinical outcomes trials took several years to complete - the pivotal FOURIER trial for Repatha showed 15% reduction in cardiovascular events in 2017, followed by ODYSSEY Outcomes for Praluent in 2018 showing similar benefits. These outcomes data gradually expanded insurance coverage and physician adoption.

The patent litigation proved more consequential than the article anticipated. Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron engaged in extensive patent battles that lasted for years. A key 2021 Federal Circuit decision favored Amgen regarding certain epitope claims, and the companies eventually reached settlement agreements. The competition ultimately consolidated with Amgen and Sanofi dominating the market.

By 2023-2024, PCSK9 inhibitors had established themselves as standard of care for high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and those unable to reach LDL targets on statins alone, though cost and access barriers remained. The RNAi approach mentioned (Inclisiran) was approved in 2021 with a different dosing paradigm. Combined sales of PCSK9 inhibitors eventually reached several billion dollars annually.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that broad patent claims "don't stand up" and that judicial trends were against such broad biomedical patents**: This proved incorrect. While the litigation was prolonged, Amgen ultimately prevailed on key patent claims and reached favorable settlements, showing that broad antibody claims could be enforceable.

• **Prediction that the PCSK9 struggle would be "decided in the clinic, at the FDA, and especially out there in the real market" rather than by patent lawyers**: This was partially true but underestimated patent litigation's impact. While clinical data and market competition were crucial, patent outcomes significantly shaped market access, pricing strategies, and eventual market share distribution between competitors.

• **Implied prediction that multiple competitors would create intense market competition**: This was accurate. Multiple companies competed fiercely, leading to extensive clinical trials, marketing competition, and strategic pricing decisions that affected patient access for years.

• **Skepticism about broad antibody patent viability**: This proved too pessimistic about patent rights in the antibody space. The legal framework evolved to accommodate reasonably broad claims on functional antibody characteristics and epitope binding.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

The article captures a pivotal moment in the emergence of a major new drug class and correctly identifies the key industry dynamics at play. While underestimating patent law's eventual impact, it provides valuable insight into competitive strategies that shaped a multi-billion dollar market. The intersection of innovation, patent strategy, clinical development, and market access makes this a compelling case study in biopharmaceutical competition.
