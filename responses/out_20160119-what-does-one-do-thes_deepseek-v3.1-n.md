# What Does One Do With These? (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques two research papers that reported small molecule compounds (bis-chalcones) as potential cancer therapeutics. The first paper described MCB-613, identified from a Molecular Libraries screen, which was claimed to stimulate steroid receptor coactivators but led to cancer cell stress and death. The second paper in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry presented similar bis-chalcone structures with additional Mannich modifications.

The author's central criticism was that these compounds had highly problematic chemical structures containing multiple reactive functional groups that made them likely promiscuous binders rather than specific drug candidates. Despite detailed cellular assay data showing activity against tumor cell lines, the article argued that such structures had extremely low probability of becoming actual drugs without substantial additional validation, particularly proteome-wide screens for covalent modifications and, most importantly, in vivo animal studies—neither of which had been conducted at the time of publication.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in this 2016 article proved prescient. **MCB-613 has not advanced to become an FDA-approved drug** or even progressed significantly through clinical development. A search of clinical trial databases and drug development records shows no evidence that this compound or the related bis-chalcone structures entered human clinical trials.

**The broader chalcone chemistry field** that the author referenced has continued to generate academic papers, but **has not produced significant clinical success in oncology**. While numerous chalcone derivatives have been studied in vitro and in animal models over the subsequent years, no chalcone-based anticancer drugs have received FDA approval since 2016.

**Drug development metrics** validate the article's skepticism: the attrition rate for oncology drugs remains extremely high, with only a small fraction of compounds showing cellular activity advancing to approved medications. The author's emphasis on in vivo validation as the critical next step proved accurate—compounds active in cell culture frequently fail in animal models due to pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or lack of efficacy in complex biological systems.

**The scientific community's approach** to drug discovery has evolved toward more sophisticated early-stage validation, including enhanced selectivity profiling, covalent binding assessment, and earlier incorporation of animal models—aligning with the article's recommendations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"These structures have a very low probability of ever being drugs"** - **Correct**. MCB-613 and related bis-chalcones did not become FDA-approved drugs or advance to clinical trials.

• **"The real challenge for these kinds of structures will come when they have to be dosed in an animal"** - **Correct**. The lack of animal data was indeed a critical missing step, as predicted by the bottleneck between cellular activity and in vivo efficacy.

• **The author's implicit prediction that extensive cellular assay work without in vivo validation would not lead to clinical progress** - **Correct**. The compounds remained at the preclinical cellular level without advancing.

• **Concern about promiscuous binding and lack of proteome-wide screening** - **Accurate concern**. The field has increasingly recognized the importance of comprehensive selectivity profiling to avoid reactive/promiscuous compounds.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates the importance of rigorous chemical and biological validation in drug discovery, with its skepticism validated by subsequent drug development outcomes. The piece successfully identified critical flaws in the research approach that prevented clinical translation.
