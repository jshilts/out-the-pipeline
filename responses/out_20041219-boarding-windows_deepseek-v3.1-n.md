# Boarding Up the Windows (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Pfizer's predicament following safety concerns about its blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex. The author argues that despite public statements that Pfizer had "no plans to recall Celebrex," the company had almost certainly developed detailed contingency plans for a potential recall. The article suggests that losing Celebrex would severely damage Pfizer's strategic position, given the company's reliance on acquiring billion-dollar drugs to meet growth targets—a strategy the author views as unsustainable. The piece predicts that despite official denials, the regulatory and public climate made a Celebrex recall likely, with company teams already working on contingency plans.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this December 2004 article, the Vioxx and Celebrex situation became a landmark event in pharmaceutical regulation and drug safety:

**FDA Actions**: In April 2005, the FDA did request—but not mandate—that Pfizer include a "black box warning" on Celebrex about cardiovascular risks (UPDATE: The FDA added black box warnings for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks in early 2005 following advisory committee recommendations. Celebrex remained on the market.)

**Pfizer's Response**: Pfizer kept Celebrex on the market but substantially revised its marketing and labeling. The company did not initiate a full voluntary recall as the article suggested might happen.

**Market Impact**: While Celebrex remained available, its sales substantially declined from peak levels due to safety concerns and label restrictions.

**Regulatory Changes**: This period—including the Vioxx withdrawal in September 2004—led to significant FDA reforms, including the creation in 2005-2007 of more robust post-market surveillance systems and risk evaluation programs.

**Pfizer's Strategy**: The company's growth-by-acquisition approach faced challenges, but they continued this strategy with varying success through subsequent decades. However, the sustainability concerns raised in the article proved somewhat prescient as Pfizer constantly needs pipeline replenishment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Odds are better than even that [Celebrex] will be [recalled]"**: **Prediction largely failed**. Celebrex was never recalled. When evaluating drug withdrawal predictions, this was incorrect. **(0/1 correct)**

• **"Pfizer has definitely thought about [recall plans]"**: **Prediction likely correct**. Any responsible pharmaceutical company maintains detailed contingency plans for product withdrawals. This was an educated assumption about corporate preparedness. **(1/1 correct)**

• **Strategic sustainability concerns**: **Prediction directionally correct**. While the specific crisis discussed didn't result in Celebrex withdrawal, the article correctly identified systemic challenges in Pfizer's growth-by-acquisition strategy, which would continue to pressure the company in subsequent decades. The fundamental issue of needing billion-dollar launches remained valid. **(Partially correct)**

Specific predictions: 1.5/3 fully or directionally correct.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article demonstrated reasonable pharmaceutical industry insight but made an incorrect concrete prediction about Celebrex recall. It identified important systemic challenges in drug company strategy that remain relevant.
