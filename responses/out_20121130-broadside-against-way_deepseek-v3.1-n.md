# A Broadside Against The Way We Do Things Now (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques the pharmaceutical industry's shift toward target-based drug discovery, arguing that this approach has led to declining productivity despite appearing more "rational and scientific." The author highlights how the target-based paradigm became dominant because it presents drug discovery as an industrialized, process-driven activity that appeals to investors—creating a "Brute Force bias" where organizations prioritize hitting targets and optimizing screening cascades over understanding whole-organism disease biology. The central argument is that the industry shifted from a disease-focus to a process-focus, often requiring that projects conform to standardized target-validation workflows even when insufficient biological information existed to select good targets.

The article contrasts target-based approaches with phenotypic screening, noting that drugs discovered through phenotypic approaches historically showed higher approval rates despite lacking clear mechanistic understanding upfront. It questions whether knowing a drug's precise molecular mode-of-action should be a prerequisite for development, pointing out that the FDA primarily evaluates efficacy and safety rather than mechanistic understanding. The author suggests that the industry's dogmatic commitment to single-target mechanisms and detailed mechanistic validation has limited discovery of valuable drugs that work through complex or unknown pathways, while creating vast opportunities for mechanistic research that yields "precious little in the way of drugs."

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2012 critique was published, the pharmaceutical industry underwent a notable shift that aligned with several of the article's arguments. The "phenotypic renaissance" materialized substantively over the following decade, with phenotypic screening approaches gaining renewed respect and investment.

**Clinical Success Patterns:** The empirical observation that phenotypic screening outperformed target-based approaches in drug approval rates held up and became more widely acknowledged. Analysis published in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* in 2016 examined drugs approved between 1999-2008 and found that phenotypic screens produced first-in-class drugs at higher rates than target-based approaches (31% vs. 16% of analyzed approvals), even though target-based remained numerically more common. This reinforced Sams-Dodd's underlying statistics while the field increasingly recognized that complex diseases often require multi-target interventions that single-target approaches miss.

**Technological Enablers:** The article's reference to "automated imaging systems for in vivo models and complex cellular systems" proved prescient. High-content screening and advanced cell culture systems (organoids, 3D cultures, patient-derived cells) became mainstream between 2012-2020, enabling the combination of throughput with disease-relevant complexity that the author envisioned. CRISPR-based functional genomics also emerged as a powerful tool for target identification within phenotypic contexts.

**Industry Adoption:** Major pharmaceutical companies publicly rebalanced their strategies toward phenotypic approaches. Novartis, a notable example, explicitly incorporated phenotypic screening platforms and emphasized disease-relevant assays. Academic screening centers proliferated phenotypic approaches with funding from NIH programs. However, the shift wasn't wholesale—target-based discovery remains central to many companies, particularly for diseases with well-validated targets, while the industry moved toward a hybrid model where phenotypic screens feed into target identification rather than completely replacing reductionist approaches.

**Drug Development Outcomes:** Several blockbuster drugs emerging post-2012 reflected the phenotypic rationale. CAR-T cell therapies, while not traditional small molecules, exemplify therapeutic success without requiring complete mechanistic understanding of tumor biology—the "does it work?" question took precedence over detailed mode-of-action. Cancer immunotherapy more broadly succeeded through empirical observation of patient responses, with mechanistic understanding following therapeutic validation. For rare diseases, phenotypic zebrafish screens yielded clinical candidates that progressed to human trials.

**Policy and Regulatory Impact:** FDA thinking evolved to accommodate drugs with incomplete mechanistic understanding, particularly for breakthrough therapies and rare diseases. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and FDA's expanded use of accelerated approval pathways reflected increased willingness to approve based on efficacy signals rather than requiring exhaustive mechanistic data.

The fundamental tension the article identified—between investor-friendly process metrics and biologically meaningful discovery—persisted, but the industry landscape shifted toward pragmatic acceptance that multiple approaches must coexist. Target-based discovery remains dominant numerically, but phenotypic approaches gained institutional legitimacy and investment, validating the article's call for "disease-focus" over pure "process-focus."

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about how drug discovery might evolve:

- **That automated imaging and complex cellular systems would enable combining process-strengths of target-based approaches with disease-focus of physiology-based approaches** → **Largely accurate.** High-content screening, organoids, and multi-parameter imaging became standard tools. Companies did adopt hybrid strategies combining throughput with disease relevance.

- **That investors and shareholders would need to accept approaches that appear less "rational and systematic"** → **Partially accurate.** While phenotypic approaches gained acceptance, venture capital and corporate investment remained heavily focused on target-based platforms with "clean" mechanistic stories. The biotechnology funding boom post-2012 still favored projects with clear molecular targets and mechanistic hypotheses when seeking investment.

- **That understanding mode-of-action would remain secondary to empirical efficacy and safety** → **Accurate.** Regulatory approvals continued prioritizing clinical outcomes. The rise of biomarker-stratified populations didn't require complete mechanistic understanding—empirical correlations sufficed.

- **That focusing on diseases rather than targets would yield better outcomes** → **Mixed accuracy.** Disease-focused approaches (like phenotypic screens) produced some remarkable successes, but target-based approaches also delivered breakthrough drugs (e.g., KRAS inhibitors, BTK inhibitors). The prediction underestimated that both paradigms could coexist productively.

- **That the process-focused, six-sigma approach to drug discovery was ill-suited to biological complexity** → **Intellectually correct but incomplete.** While "process dogma" did constrain discovery, systematic approaches to quality, reproducibility, and data management proved essential as drug discovery became more data-intensive. The critique correctly identified misplaced priorities but underestimated how process discipline could enable complexity rather than constraining it.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article tackles a core tension in drug discovery that remained highly relevant for the decade following its publication, influencing academic and industry practices. While some of its strongest claims (target-based is "less successful") became nuanced rather than absolute truths, the fundamental critique of process-over-biology captured institutional dynamics that constrained pharmaceutical innovation. Its moderate-to-very-high interest derives from articulating principles that guided an important industry course correction, though the shift it described was evolutionary rather than revolutionary.
