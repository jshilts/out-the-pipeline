# Revenues From New Drugs – And Thoughts on Chance (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The IDEA Pharma analysis (as reported by Derek Lowe on Endpoints) compared the **revenues generated by drugs approved in the five years preceding 2019** with each big‑pharma company’s total R&D spend over the same period. Only firms that earned at least $5 billion from those “new‑product” revenues were included, to avoid distortion by tiny start‑ups that had just launched a first product.

Key observations were:  

* **Gilead** stood out as the only company whose recent‑product revenue exceeded its five‑year R&D outlay, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of spend.  
* **Bristol‑Myers Squibb (BMS)** was the only other firm whose recent‑product revenue was roughly equal to its R&D spend; **Biogen** was close but on the opposite side (slightly less revenue than spend) and also had the smallest total R&D budget of the group.  
* For the remaining majors (Roche, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, etc.) the revenue from the newest approvals was only **20‑40 %** of what they had spent on R&D, indicating a long lag between investment and payoff.  
* The analysis noted that the top‑performing companies tended to profit from **therapeutic areas in which they were not dominant a decade earlier**, suggesting that “leadership in a therapy area may actually lead to poorer decisions.”  
* The piece concluded with a tongue‑in‑cheek warning that corporate narratives about visionary leadership often mask the role of luck and “curve‑balls” (e.g., Merck’s acquisition of Keytruda, which was not part of its original strategic plan).

## 2. HISTORY  

### Overall industry trends (2019‑2025)  
* **R&D spending continued to rise** across the board, driven by biologics, cell‑therapy, and mRNA platforms. Global pharma R&D outlay grew from ≈ $180 bn in 2019 to > $210 bn in 2024.  
* **Revenue from “new‑product” launches remained a modest share** of total sales for most majors, typically 15‑30 % of total revenue in 2024, confirming the article’s point that recent approvals rarely cover R&D costs in the short term.  
* The **COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2022)** created a temporary distortion: companies that supplied vaccines (Pfizer‑BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson) saw a massive, short‑lived boost in new‑product revenue, but this was not reflected in the five‑year window used by the 2019 analysis.  

### Company‑specific outcomes  

| Company | What happened to recent‑product revenue vs. R&D spend? |
|---|---|
| **Gilead** | After 2019 the hepatitis‑C franchise waned, and the company’s **COVID‑19 antiviral (Veklury)** generated ≈ $1 bn in 2020‑21 before demand collapsed. R&D spend rose (≈ $6 bn/yr by 2024) while new‑product revenue fell to **≈ 30 % of R&D spend** by 2025, ending the outlier status. |
| **BMS** | The **Celgene acquisition (2019)** added several late‑stage assets (e.g., Revlimid, Opdivo). Combined with its own pipeline, BMS’s new‑product revenue grew to **≈ 45 % of R&D spend** by 2024, still below the 1:1 ratio seen in 2019. |
| **Biogen** | The **Aduhelm (aducanumab) approval (2021)** produced ≈ $1 bn in 2022 but was quickly pulled from many formularies. Overall, Biogen’s new‑product revenue stayed **well under 20 % of its R&D outlay**, and the company shifted focus to multiple‑sclerosis and rare‑disease biologics. |
| **Roche** | Continued strength in oncology (e.g., **Tecentriq, Polivy**) and diagnostics. New‑product revenue rose to **≈ 35 % of R&D spend** by 2025, still below the 20‑40 % range noted in the article but higher than many peers. |
| **Johnson & Johnson (J&J)** | The **Janssen** portfolio added **Darzalex** (multiple myeloma) and **Stelara** extensions, but the company’s massive R&D budget (≈ $12 bn/yr) kept the new‑product revenue share at **≈ 25 %**. |
| **Merck** | **Keytruda** exploded from a modest 2009‑ish “footnote” to a **> $20 bn annual blockbuster** by 2024, representing **≈ 50 % of Merck’s total R&D spend** in the 2019‑2024 window. This validates the article’s anecdote about Merck’s unexpected oncology leadership. |
| **Pfizer** | The **COVID‑19 vaccine (Comirnaty, with BioNTech)** generated > $30 bn in 2021, temporarily inflating new‑product revenue to **≈ 60 % of R&D spend** for that year. However, once the pandemic wave subsided, the share fell back to **≈ 30 %**. |
| **Novartis** | Introduced **Kymriah** (CAR‑T) and **Entresto** (heart failure) but overall new‑product revenue stayed at **≈ 30 % of R&D spend**. |

### Validation of the article’s “outlier” claim  
* By 2025 **only Merck** approached or exceeded a 1:1 ratio (thanks largely to Keytruda). Gilead’s earlier advantage evaporated, and BMS fell short. Thus the 2019 observation that **Gilead was the sole outlier** was **temporarily correct** but not durable.

### Shifts in therapeutic focus  
* The “therapeutic‑area‑switch” pattern described (companies succeeding in fields where they were not historically dominant) proved **real**:  
  * **Merck** moved from antibiotics/vaccines to oncology dominance.  
  * **Roche** expanded from diagnostics into immuno‑oncology (PD‑L1).  
  * **J&J** leveraged its surgical‑device heritage to become a major player in immuno‑oncology via **Stelara**.  

### Business‑model consequences  
* Companies that **leveraged in‑licensing and acquisitions** (e.g., BMS + Celgene, Merck + Keytruda) improved the ratio of new‑product revenue to R&D spend, confirming the article’s suggestion that “leadership” alone does not guarantee efficient pipelines.  
* The **rise of mRNA therapeutics** (Moderna, BioNTech) introduced a new class of “rapid‑turnaround” products, but these firms were **outside the “big‑pharma” cohort** used in the 2019 analysis, so the original ratios remain largely unchanged for the incumbents.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / explicit prediction from the 2019 piece | What actually happened (2020‑2025) |
|---|---|
| **Gilead would continue to out‑perform R&D spend** (revenues > R&D). | **False.** After the hepatitis‑C market saturated and Veklury demand collapsed, Gilead’s new‑product revenue fell to ~30 % of its R&D spend by 2025. |
| **BMS’s recent‑product revenue would be roughly equal to its R&D spend** (break‑even). | **Partially true early‑2020, but later false.** The Celgene acquisition boosted revenues, yet the ratio stayed around 45 % of R&D spend by 2024, not a true break‑even. |
| **Biogen’s low R&D spend would keep it near parity with new‑product revenue**. | **False.** Biogen’s R&D grew modestly, but new‑product revenue (Aduhelm) never matched spend; the ratio stayed below 20 %. |
| **Companies succeed when they enter therapeutic areas where they were not previously dominant**. | **Supported.** Merck’s oncology surge (Keytruda) and Roche’s PD‑L1 expansion illustrate this pattern. |
| **Leadership in a therapy area may lead to poorer decisions** (i.e., “success breeds complacency”). | **Mixed evidence.** Roche’s early dominance in oncology led to strong follow‑on assets, while BMS’s historic strength in hematology did not prevent the need for external acquisitions. The claim is not universally borne out. |
| **Merck could become an oncology powerhouse within ten years** (if you’d told them in 2008). | **True.** By 2024 Merck’s oncology sales (driven by Keytruda) exceeded $30 bn, making it one of the top three oncology‑focused pharma companies. |
| **Keytruda would remain a “footnote” and be off‑loaded**. | **False.** Keytruda became Merck’s flagship product, never divested, and generated > $20 bn annually. |
| **COVID‑19 would not dramatically alter the revenue‑vs‑R&D picture** (implicit). | **False.** The pandemic created a temporary spike in new‑product revenue for Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, and Gilead, skewing ratios for 2020‑2022. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article offers a concise, data‑driven look at R&D efficiency that remains relevant for understanding pharma business models, and its “luck vs. leadership” theme sparked a discussion that proved prescient for several companies. It is not groundbreaking, but its hindsight value is solid.
