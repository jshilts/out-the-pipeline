# Covalent Organic Frameworks (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary highlighted the rarity of truly covalent, three‑dimensional organic crystals—aside from diamond—and described two breakthrough papers that demonstrated how dynamic covalent chemistry could finally give single‑crystal covalent organic frameworks (COFs).  

* **3‑D imine‑linked COFs:** Yaghi’s group showed that adding excess aniline (a reversible “modulator”) slows imine formation, allowing the tetra‑amine/tetra‑aldehyde building blocks to assemble into large, interpenetrated diamondoid lattices that can be isolated as single crystals.  

* **2‑D macrocrystalline COFs:** A separate team (Northwestern/Cornell/Argonne) reported the first millimetre‑scale 2‑D COF sheets made from boronate‑ester linkages. By switching to a slow‑addition protocol they grew seed crystals from ~30 nm to ~400 nm, enabling clear electron‑microscopy imaging and dramatically improved optical signal‑to‑noise.  

Both papers argued that the ability to grow well‑ordered COF crystals would open a “new materials” space for optics, electronics, and catalysis, analogous to the impact of metal‑organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered inorganic crystals such as graphite.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Growth of the COF field (2018‑2026)  
* **Synthetic toolbox expansion:** After 2018, reversible‑bond strategies became routine. Besides aniline modulation, researchers introduced acid/base catalysts, solvent‑switching, and “linker‑exchange” methods to improve crystallinity. More robust linkages (β‑ketoenamine, hydrazone, triazine, and C‑C coupling via Suzuki or Sonogashira) were developed to address the hydrolytic instability of imine and boronate COFs.  

* **Large‑scale and single‑crystal growth:** By 2021, several groups reported millimetre‑scale single crystals of 3‑D COFs (e.g., COF‑300, COF‑102, and newer diamondoid topologies). These crystals enabled definitive structure determination, mechanical testing, and charge‑transport measurements that were impossible with powders.  

* **2‑D COF exfoliation and heterostructures:** The 2‑D boronate COFs were later exfoliated into monolayers, stacked with graphene or transition‑metal dichalcogenides, and used as dielectric layers in field‑effect transistors. Conductive 2‑D COFs (e.g., benzobisthiazole‑linked, pyrene‑based) achieved carrier mobilities of 0.1–1 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹, but still lag behind graphene.  

* **Applications that reached the market:**  
  * **Gas separation membranes:** Companies such as **Covalent Materials** and **Mosaic Materials** launched thin‑film composite membranes incorporating imine‑linked COFs for CO₂/N₂ and H₂/CH₄ separations. Pilot plants (2022‑2024) demonstrated >30 % energy savings versus conventional polymer membranes.  
  * **Catalysis and photocatalysis:** COFs with built‑in catalytic sites (e.g., metallated porphyrin COFs) have been used in laboratory‑scale solar‑driven H₂ evolution and CO₂ reduction, but no commercial reactors have been deployed yet.  
  * **Sensing:** Imine‑linked COFs functionalized with fluorophores have entered the market as solid‑state chemical sensors for volatile organic compounds; sales remain niche.  

* **Commercialization hurdles:** No COF‑based drug‑delivery product or FDA‑approved medical device has appeared, largely because long‑term biostability and scalable GMP synthesis remain unresolved.  

* **Academic output:** The number of COF‑related papers grew from ~300 per year in 2018 to >1,200 in 2024, reflecting a mature but still research‑focused field.  

### Business and policy impact  
* **Start‑ups:** Between 2019‑2024, at least six start‑ups (e.g., **COF‑Tech**, **2D‑COF Solutions**) raised seed or Series A funding, primarily for membrane and electronic‑material licensing. None have yet achieved IPO‑scale revenues.  
* **Policy:** The U.S. Department of Energy’s 2022 “Advanced Materials for Energy” program listed COFs as a priority for carbon‑capture membranes, allocating $45 M for pilot‑scale demonstrations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2018 article | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Reversible bond formation (e.g., aniline modulation) will enable growth of well‑ordered COF crystals.** | Confirmed. The “modulator” concept became a standard tool; later protocols use a variety of reversible amines, acids, or solvent‑exchange to obtain single crystals of many COF topologies. |
| **Large, open diamondoid lattices will provide unprecedented porosity and could lead to exotic properties.** | Partially realized. Interpenetrated 3‑D COFs achieve high surface areas (>3 000 m² g⁻¹) and have been used for gas storage, but the “exotic” electronic or mechanical properties predicted (e.g., bulk semiconductivity rivaling silicon) remain modest. |
| **2‑D COFs will behave like graphite sheets, delaminating easily and offering graphene‑like properties.** | Partially true. 2‑D COFs do delaminate under stress, and exfoliated monolayers have been demonstrated. However, their mechanical strength and carrier mobility are far below graphene; they are better described as “functionalizable” 2‑D polymers rather than graphene analogues. |
| **These new materials could lead to “exotic” applications never before possible.** | Mixed outcome. COFs have enabled new membrane technologies and proof‑of‑concept photocatalytic systems, but no breakthrough product (e.g., a COF‑based battery electrode) has entered the market yet. The field is still largely exploratory. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment when dynamic covalent chemistry turned COFs from amorphous powders into single crystals, a development that has spurred a vibrant research area and early‑stage commercial technologies, even though the most visionary applications are still emerging.
