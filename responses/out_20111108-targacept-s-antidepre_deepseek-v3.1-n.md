# Targacept's Antidepressant Fails, And How (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on the Phase III failure of Targacept's antidepressant drug TC-5214 (the S-enantiomer of mecamylamine), which was being developed in partnership with AstraZeneca. The trial involved 295 treatment-resistant depression patients in Europe who had not responded to standard therapies, and the drug missed its primary endpoints despite extraordinary Phase II results that had generated significant excitement in the biotech community.

The author notes that the Phase II data had been "extraordinary" and "stellar," creating high expectations for the compound's success. However, concerns emerged about the reliability of those earlier results because the Phase II trial was conducted in India, adding "an extra layer of can-we-trust-this-stuff" to the typical Phase II/III disconnects. AstraZeneca initially stated they remained committed to further studies of TC-5214, but the failure was described as potentially "catastrophic" for Targacept and problematic for both AstraZeneca and potentially for the reputation of Indian clinical research.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the November 2011 Phase III failure described in the article, subsequent developments unfolded rapidly and confirmed the compound's failure:

**Continued Clinical Failures**: In January 2012, just two months after the initial failure, Targacept announced that TC-5214 failed in a second Phase III trial, also missing its primary endpoints. By March 2012, AstraZeneca terminated its partnership with Targacept for TC-5214, effectively ending the drug's development program.

**Corporate Impact**: The failures had devastating consequences for Targacept. The company's stock price collapsed by over 60% following the initial announcement and continued to decline. The company, which had been valued at over $800 million before the trials, saw its market capitalization shrink dramatically. Targacept ultimately underwent a reverse stock split in 2015 and was acquired by Catalyst Biosciences in 2015 for approximately $121 million in stock - a fraction of its former value.

**No FDA Approval or Patient Uptake**: TC-5214 never received FDA approval and never reached the market, meaning no patients were ever treated with the drug outside clinical trials. The compound represents another example of promising early-stage data failing to translate into clinical efficacy.

**Scientific Implications**: The case contributed to ongoing discussions in the pharmaceutical industry about the challenges of drug development, particularly the reproducibility of clinical trial data across different geographic regions and the reliability of Phase II results as predictors of Phase III success. The Indian trial data concern mentioned in the article became part of broader industry conversations about trial site selection and data quality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article included several predictions and expectations:

- **AstraZeneca's continued commitment**: The article noted that "AstraZeneca says that they're committed to further studies of TC-5214"
  - **Outcome**: This proved false - AstraZeneca terminated the partnership within four months after additional trial failures.

- **"This is bad news for AZ, a company that needs all the help it can get"**: Referring to AstraZeneca's broader pipeline challenges
  - **Outcome**: Accurate in the short term, though AstraZeneca recovered and continued as a major pharmaceutical company, while the impact was far more severe for Targacept.

- **"Downright catastrophic news for Targacept, as I'm sure their stock price will reflect"**: 
  - **Outcome**: Highly accurate - the company's stock collapsed and it was eventually acquired at a small fraction of its previous valuation.

- **"It might even be bad news for India, and Indian clinical research"**: Regarding the geographic concerns about Phase II data
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate - the case contributed to discussions about regional data quality, though Indian clinical research has continued to expand, with ongoing scrutiny of data standards.

- **Implied prediction that earlier data might have confounding variables**: "It's possible that this latest study just had some confounding variable that messed up the numbers - but then, it's possible that the earlier one did, too, and that, sad to say, is probably the way to bet"
  - **Outcome**: Accurate - the subsequent Phase III failures confirmed that the Phase II data were not reliable predictors of efficacy.

## 4. INTEREST
**6/10**

This article serves as a valuable case study in the high failure rate of drug development, particularly the Phase II/III translation problem in CNS disorders and the geographic variability of clinical trial results, which continues to be relevant for understanding pharmaceutical R&D challenges.
