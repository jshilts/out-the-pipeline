# Analysis of "Always Insist on Error Bars" (Science Magazine, March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlighted a critical issue in biotechnology reporting: the tendency for companies—and investors—to present or interpret clinical trial results without proper statistical context. Using La Jolla Pharmaceutical's kidney drug GCS-100 as a case study, the piece demonstrated how a press release claiming "positive effects" could be misleading when examined more carefully.

The core problem illustrated was that initial presentations often used bar charts without error bars or appropriate statistical measures, making treatment effects appear more significant than they actually were. When proper error bars (showing standard deviations or standard errors) were applied, the apparent positive results diminished considerably, revealing what the author characterized as "statistical noise" rather than meaningful clinical benefit.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2014 analysis, La Jolla Pharmaceutical's trajectory provides a compelling validation of the article's skepticism:

**Immediate Aftermath (2014-2020):** GCS-100 continued to struggle in clinical development. The company faced numerous challenges with the galectin inhibitor approach, and by 2018, La Jolla shifted focus to other pipeline products. The drug never achieved meaningful clinical success or regulatory approval for kidney disease.

**Company Evolution:** La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (ticker: LJPC) eventually pivoted away from GCS-100, acquiring other assets and eventually developing GIAPREZA (angiotensin II) for distributive shock, which received FDA approval in 2017. However, even this success came with challenges—the company faced pricing controversies and struggled with commercial adoption.

**Industry Context:** The period following this article saw increasing scrutiny of biostatistical practices. The FDA and EMA implemented more rigorous statistical requirements, and investor sophistication regarding clinical trial data improved, partly driven by increased availability of detailed trial data through platforms like ClinicalTrials.gov.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions:**
- **Statistical rigor matters:** The article's central thesis—that insufficient statistical analysis leads to false optimism—was strongly validated. GCS-100's failure demonstrated that initial promising-looking data without proper error bars was indeed misleading.
- **Investor overreaction to press releases:** The tendency for biotech stocks to soar on statistically questionable data continued to be a problem, though regulatory bodies became more aggressive about requiring clear statistical disclosure.
- **Dose-response complexity:** The article noted the unusual binary dose-response pattern (low dose worked, high dose didn't), which should have raised concerns. This prediction was validated as such patterns often indicate problematic pharmacology.

**Inaccurate or Limited Predictions:**
- **Rate of industry improvement:** While practices have improved, the biotech industry continued to see similar issues through the late 2010s, suggesting the problem was more persistent than might have been hoped.
- **Scope of the issue:** The specific mechanism (galectin inhibition) was dismissed too quickly—while GCS-100 failed, galectin-3 inhibition has shown promise in other disease areas, such as cancer and fibrosis.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article earns a 6 for several reasons. As a piece of scientific journalism, it perfectly captured a persistent and important problem in biotechnology: the gap between statistical appearance and clinical reality. Its case study approach and clear pedagogical value make it genuinely useful and educational.

However, it falls short of the highest scores (7-9) because:
- The specific example was somewhat provincial (single small company)
- The broader point was already recognized by sophisticated practitioners
- While prescient about the specific case, it wasn't groundbreaking in its fundamental insight

The article represents strong scientific journalism—clear, well-argued, and validated by subsequent events—but doesn't achieve the transformative importance that would warrant the highest decile scores.
