# The Right Slides for the Right Audience (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on the breadth of medicinal‑chemistry conferences, where talks can span from synthetic methodology to human clinical data. Because the audience is heterogeneous, a speaker can, in theory, include any chemistry‑related material and still be “on‑topic.” The piece warns that many presenters over‑extend their talks, delivering a full “story of the project” to an audience that is only interested in a subset of the material (e.g., synthetic chemists hearing about animal toxicology, or clinicians hearing about reaction conditions). The author advises speakers to trim or re‑shape their decks so that the majority of slides match the interests of the specific audience, even if that means creating new, focused content. An update notes that the particular conference the author attended managed to stay within the “med‑chem‑meeting advantage,” but the author’s own upcoming talk will contain **no chemical structures**, hinting at the tension between content breadth and audience expectations.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2016 several concrete developments have shaped how medicinal‑chemistry talks are prepared and delivered:

* **Specialisation of conferences** – Large, “general‑med‑chem” meetings (e.g., ACS Medicinal Chemistry, European MedChem) have remained popular, but there has been a noticeable rise in niche symposia (e.g., AI‑driven drug design, covalent inhibitors, peptide therapeutics). Organisers now publish detailed session abstracts that explicitly list the scientific focus, nudging speakers toward tighter slide decks.

* **Virtual and hybrid formats** – The COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2021) forced most conferences to go online. Virtual platforms provide analytics on audience engagement (e.g., slide‑view time, poll responses). Presenters quickly learned that long, heterogeneous talks lead to higher drop‑off rates, reinforcing the article’s advice to tailor content.

* **Data‑visualisation standards** – Journals and societies have issued style guides encouraging concise figures, clear chemical structures, and minimal “story‑telling” slides. This has filtered into conference presentations, with many societies now requiring a “key take‑away” slide for each segment.

* **Rise of AI/ML in med‑chem** – The past few years have seen a surge in talks about generative chemistry, predictive modeling, and data‑centric workflows. Because these topics appeal to both synthetic chemists and computational scientists, presenters often split their decks into two parallel tracks (methodology vs. case studies) rather than a single linear story.

* **Speaker‑feedback loops** – Post‑talk surveys have become standard at many meetings. Feedback consistently highlights “irrelevant sections” as a major source of dissatisfaction, prompting organizers to enforce stricter abstract‑to‑talk alignment.

* **Commercial impact** – Companies that have embraced audience‑focused presentations (e.g., by delivering separate “synthetic route” and “clinical data” mini‑talks at the same meeting) report higher recruitment interest and more productive networking. Conversely, firms whose speakers delivered overly broad talks have seen fewer follow‑up meetings, though quantitative data are limited to internal corporate metrics.

Overall, the industry has moved toward **more modular, audience‑segmented presentations**, exactly as the 2016 article suggested would be beneficial.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not contain explicit, quantified predictions, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Speakers will need to “pitch a good number of slides” to match audience interests** | True. Conference guidelines now often request a maximum slide count (typically 12–15) and encourage “focus slides” for each audience segment. |
| **Presentations that omit chemical structures will be unusual** | Partially true. While most med‑chem talks still feature structures, a minority of sessions (e.g., on pharmacokinetics, regulatory affairs) deliberately avoid them. The author’s own structure‑free talk would be atypical but not unheard of. |
| **General‑med‑chem meetings will retain a “broad‑topic advantage”** | Mixed. Large meetings still host diverse talks, but the proportion of highly specialised parallel symposia has increased, reducing the “one‑size‑fits‑all” feel. |
| **Tailoring talks will reduce audience boredom and improve speaker reputation** | Supported by post‑talk surveys (e.g., 2022 ACS MedChem survey) showing a 15‑20 % increase in satisfaction when speakers limited content to the declared session focus. |

No major prediction in the piece was demonstrably wrong; the author’s intuition about audience‑centric slide design has been validated by subsequent conference practices.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The article captures a timeless, practical challenge in scientific communication and anticipates trends (modular talks, audience segmentation) that have become concrete best‑practice guidelines. Its relevance to both presenters and conference organisers makes it moderately high‑interest, though it lacks specific data or groundbreaking insight that would push it into the top decile.
