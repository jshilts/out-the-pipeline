# How Are Those Megamergers Working Out? (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques a McKinsey Consulting report titled "Why pharma megamergers work" that was published earlier in 2014. The McKinsey report argued that pharmaceutical megamergers create significant shareholder value and are critical for the long-term sustainability of acquiring companies, supporting this claim by analyzing returns over two to five years post-merger. The Science blog post author finds this analysis problematic, arguing that a 2-5 year timeframe is inadequate for assessing true long-term value in an industry where drug development takes 10-15 years from discovery to market approval. The article references GlaxoSmithKline's bad news from that day as timely evidence contradicting McKinsey's optimistic assessment of megamerger success.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2015-2024 period following the article's publication has been marked by continued pharmaceutical megamergers, though their outcomes have been mixed, largely validating the article's skepticism:

**Continued Merger Activity**: Major deals included Pfizer-Allergan (2015, ultimately abandoned due to tax inversion rules), Shire's acquisition by Takeda (2019, \$62 billion), Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition of Celgene (2019, \$74 billion), and Pfizer's acquisition of Seagen (2023, \$43 billion).

**Mixed Success Rates**: Studies have continued showing that 70-90% of mergers fail to deliver promised synergies, with pharmaceutical mergers having particularly poor track records for R&D productivity. The Bristol-Myers-Celgene merger faced significant challenges integrating pipelines and cultural differences. The AbbVie-Allergan merger (2020) saw AbbVie lose patent protection on Humira while struggling to integrate Allergan's diverse portfolio.

**R&D Productivity Concerns**: Post-merger R&D productivity has generally declined rather than improved, consistent with the article's concerns. Merged companies often reduced R&D spending and eliminated duplicate programs, sometimes cutting promising early-stage research. Large mergers have been associated with decreased innovation output among acquired companies.

**Shareholder vs. Patient Value**: While some mergers did create shareholder value through cost-cutting and tax optimization (particularly those involving tax inversions or moving headquarters), this often came at the expense of long-term R&D investment. Patient access to new medicines hasn't demonstrably improved through consolidation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article implied several predictions through its critique of McKinsey's analysis:

• **Prediction**: That looking at 2-5 year returns was inadequate for assessing pharmaceutical merger success given the industry's 10-15 year drug development timelines.
• **Outcome**: ✓ **CORRECT** - Subsequent research has confirmed the need for longer-term analysis. Studies now typically use 7-10 year windows to assess pharmaceutical merger success, and even then many appear successful only through financial engineering rather than therapeutic innovation.

• **Prediction**: That megamergers would not necessarily create sustainable value for acquirers.
• **Outcome**: ✓ **PARTIALLY CORRECT** - While many mergers created short-term shareholder value through cost-cutting, several large deals (like the failed Pfizer-Allergan attempt) faced regulatory and operational challenges that undermined their initial value propositions.

• **Prediction**: That focusing on shareholder returns ignored broader questions about R&D productivity and patient benefit.
• **Outcome**: ✓ **CORRECT** - Post-2014 research has increasingly focused on R&D productivity decline and questions whether consolidation serves patient interests, with some health economists arguing mergers reduce competition and innovation.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5**

This article occupies the middle deciles (5) because while it insightfully critiques a flawed consulting framework using reasonable arguments, it doesn't offer novel empirical evidence or make bold falsifiable predictions that would elevate it to higher interest levels. The McKinsey report it critiques was already questionable, making the refutation somewhat straightforward rather than groundbreaking.
