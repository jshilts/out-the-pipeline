# Podcast on Avastin (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article links to a podcast from November 2011 featuring the author and Paul Howard of the Manhattan Institute discussing the FDA's decision regarding Avastin (bevacizumab). The brief introduction suggests the conversation covered the FDA's controversial decision, with an implication that the Manhattan Institute's position might be more measured than the Wall Street Journal editorial page's stance, which was described as being "all worked up" about the issue. The podcast was released amidst ongoing debate about the FDA's regulatory approach to the breast cancer indication for Avastin.

## 2. HISTORY
In November 2011, the FDA revoked Avastin's accelerated approval for metastatic breast cancer following studies showing minimal survival benefit and significant toxicities including severe hypertension, bleeding, and perforations of the gastrointestinal tract. Subsequent developments confirmed the FDA's decision was sound:

- **Clinical evidence strengthened**: Multiple Phase III trials continued showing progression-free survival benefits of only 1-3 months without overall survival benefit, with increased serious adverse events
- **European Medicines Agency (EMA) diverged**: While the FDA withdrew breast cancer approval, the EMA maintained conditional approval with restrictions, but European oncologists increasingly limited use due to poor risk-benefit profile
- **Drug development impact**: The Avastin saga accelerated FDA's evolution toward more rigorous post-approval verification requirements, particularly for accelerated approval pathways in oncology
- **Patient access**: Medicare and private insurers continued coverage decisions varied, but evidence-based guidelines increasingly restricted Avastin use to specific subgroups
- **Alternative therapies**: The subsequent decade saw development of targeted breast cancer therapies (CDK4/6 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, immunotherapies) with superior efficacy and better safety profiles in appropriate patient populations

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The post does not contain specific predictions that can be clearly evaluated against subsequent developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3/9**

This brief podcast link serves primarily as a historical artifact documenting a specific moment in the ongoing Avastin controversy, offering minimal substantive content or analytical depth for retrospective evaluation.
