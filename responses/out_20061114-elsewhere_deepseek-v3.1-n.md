# Article Title (November 14, 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Isis Pharmaceuticals' positive cardiovascular clinical data for their antisense DNA therapy ISIS 301302, which showed strong LDL-lowering effects both as monotherapy and in combination with statins. The drug targets apoB-100, a key LDL-transporting lipoprotein that was considered "undruggable" through traditional medicinal chemistry approaches. The author notes that the liver and gut wall targeting is strategically sound for antisense and RNAi therapies, as these are the first tissues oral drugs encounter. The article also briefly mentions competing RNA-based approaches from companies like Santaris, and includes some blog housekeeping notes about new additions to the author's blogroll and the impending closure of the site.

## 2. HISTORY

The drug discussed, ISIS 301302 (later named mipomersen), had a complex development trajectory. The antisense approach did eventually gain FDA approval: mipomersen (brand name Kynamro) was approved by the FDA in January 2013 for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a rare genetic condition causing extremely high LDL cholesterol. However, the drug's uptake was limited due to significant side effects, including injection site reactions and concerns about liver toxicity. While it represented a validation of the antisense technology platform, mipomersen did not achieve blockbuster status or widespread clinical adoption even within its narrow indication. The antisense field more broadly has seen mixed success, with several FDA approvals but also numerous clinical failures, confirming the author's cautious optimism about the technical challenges of tissue targeting and delivery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in this article. The author provided restrained commentary on Isis's strategy rather than making forward-looking statements about outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

The article captures a meaningful moment in antisense drug development, but as a brief blog post during a site's closure phase, it has limited depth or long-term analytical value.
