# Not So Verily (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Stat piece collected complaints from seven former Verily employees about a gap between the company’s public hype and the reality of its three flagship programmes:  

* **The “Tricorder”** – a handheld diagnostic device named after the Star Trek gadget.  CEO Andrew Conrad claimed the underlying nanoparticle‑based sensing technology was already proven and that animal testing could be skipped, promising a consumer‑ready product within a few years.  
* **A smart contact lens** that would continuously read glucose levels in the tear film.  The article suggested the project was being pushed forward on the basis of optimism rather than solid data.  
* **The “Google Baseline” (later “Verily Baseline”) study**, a large‑scale longitudinal health‑monitoring cohort that would collect wearable, sensor and questionnaire data from thousands of volunteers.  

The author argued that Verily’s leadership, steeped in computer‑science thinking, was under‑estimating the biological complexity and regulatory rigour required for medical products.  Verily’s public response was to point to new hires with “seasoned” biotech experience and to describe the projects as “very early‑stage, ambitious and difficult.”

## 2. HISTORY  

### Tricorder / Study Watch  
* **2017‑2019:** Verily renamed the effort “Tricorder” to “Verily Tricorder” and later to the “Study Watch,” a wrist‑worn sensor platform for continuous physiological monitoring (heart rate, ECG, temperature, etc.).  
* **Regulatory status:** As of 2024 the Study Watch has **not received FDA clearance for diagnostic use**; it remains a research device used in clinical‑trial settings.  
* **Commercial outcome:** No consumer‑grade “Tricorder” has been launched. The hardware is being iterated for partner programmes (e.g., a collaboration with Novartis on a digital health platform for oncology trials).  
* **Key point:** The original promise of a handheld, instant‑diagnosis gadget has not materialised; the project pivoted to a more modest, data‑collection wearable.

### Smart Contact Lens (Glucose Monitoring)  
* **Partnership:** Verily teamed with Alcon (a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary) on a prototype lens embedding a glucose‑sensing chip and a wireless transmitter.  
* **2018:** Both companies announced a **pause** after internal testing showed the sensor’s accuracy and lag time were insufficient for safe diabetes management.  
* **2020‑2022:** The collaboration was formally **terminated**; Alcon shifted focus to other ophthalmic devices, and Verily redirected resources to its broader “smart‑lens” research portfolio (e.g., a lens for intra‑ocular pressure monitoring).  
* **Outcome:** The high‑profile glucose‑lens never reached the market, confirming the article’s skepticism.

### Baseline Study (Verily Baseline)  
* **Launch:** The cohort began enrolling participants in 2017, targeting ~10 000 volunteers in the San Francisco Bay Area.  
* **Data collection:** Participants wear a custom Study Watch, use a smartphone app, and provide periodic biospecimens.  
* **Progress:** By 2023 the study had amassed > 30 000 person‑years of data, which Verily has used to support internal research and external collaborations (e.g., with pharmaceutical companies for trial enrichment).  
* **Privacy & policy:** The study has faced scrutiny from privacy advocates, but no major regulatory penalties have been imposed.  
* **Impact:** While the Baseline cohort is scientifically valuable, it has not yet produced a breakthrough product or a widely adopted health‑monitoring service.

### Leadership & Organizational Changes  
* **CEO turnover:** Andrew Conrad stepped down as Verily CEO in early 2022 after internal disagreements and a board‑requested leadership review. He was succeeded by **Stephen Gillett**, a former Microsoft and Disney executive, signalling a shift toward more traditional corporate governance.  
* **Rebranding:** In 2020 the parent unit was renamed **Verily Life Sciences** (later simply **Verily**) to emphasize its broader health‑technology mission beyond the original “Google X” image.

### Overall Business Trajectory  
* **Revenue:** Verily’s reported revenue (primarily from partnership contracts and research services) grew from roughly **$100 M in 2017** to **~$300 M in 2023**, but it remains a loss‑making subsidiary of Alphabet.  
* **Product pipeline:** The most tangible commercial output to date is the **Verily Study Watch platform**, licensed to pharma partners for clinical‑trial monitoring. No consumer‑grade diagnostic device has been shipped.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 article or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Tricorder will be a consumer‑ready diagnostic device within a few years** | The device never reached the market; the effort pivoted to a research‑grade wearable (Study Watch) and remains unreleased for consumers. | **Incorrect** – timeline and product type both missed. |
| **Animal testing could be skipped because the medicines are “well known”** | Verily’s early statements about bypassing animal studies were contradicted by later regulatory filings that required standard pre‑clinical safety data for any new sensor‑drug combination. | **Incorrect** – regulatory reality forced conventional testing. |
| **Contact‑lens glucose monitor will become a viable commercial product** | The Alcon‑Verily partnership was halted in 2018; the lens never entered clinical use. | **Incorrect** – technical and accuracy hurdles proved insurmountable at the time. |
| **Baseline study will generate a massive, publicly useful health dataset** | The cohort has produced a sizable longitudinal dataset, but access is tightly controlled and has not led to a widely public health‑policy impact. | **Partially correct** – data exists, but public impact limited. |
| **Verily’s “big‑hype” projects will dominate the company’s success** | The smaller, less‑publicised projects (e.g., data‑analytics services for pharma, partnership on surgical robotics) have contributed more to revenue than the headline‑grabbing Tricorder or lens. | **Incorrect** – hype projects lagged behind quieter collaborations. |

## 4. INTEREST  

**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a useful early‑stage case study of how Silicon‑Valley optimism can clash with biomedical reality, and many of its concerns proved prescient.  Its relevance endures because Verily remains a high‑profile Alphabet health venture, but the piece is limited to a narrow set of projects and lacks broader industry context.
