# Graphical Crankiness (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary, published in April 2011, complains that K. C. Nicolaou’s figures in a recent *Angewandte Chemie* article (doi 10.1002/anie.201101360) use gradient‑filled ring systems. The author argues that the gradients add no chemical information and actually obscure structural details. As a tongue‑in‑cheek solution, the writer suggests starting a petition or sending Nicolaou a set of Edward Tufte’s books on data visualization, hoping to persuade him to adopt cleaner, line‑only drawings.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Nicolaou’s publishing style** – From 2011 through 2025, Nicolaou continued to appear in high‑impact journals (e.g., *Angew. Chem.*, *J. Am. Chem. Soc.*, *Science*). His figures still frequently employ color gradients or shading to emphasize three‑dimensional aspects of complex polycyclic frameworks. No public record shows that he altered this practice in response to the 2011 complaint.  
- **Community response** – The comment generated a modest amount of discussion on chemistry forums (e.g., Chemistry Stack Exchange, Reddit’s r/chemistry) but did not evolve into an organized petition or formal campaign. The conversation largely remained anecdotal, with most chemists expressing personal preference rather than demanding policy change.  
- **Journal guidelines** – Over the past decade, major chemistry journals have refined their figure‑submission guidelines to stress legibility and reproducibility (e.g., ACS, RSC, Wiley). These guidelines encourage the use of high‑contrast line drawings and discourage excessive shading that could hinder color‑blind readers. However, they stop short of banning gradient fills; authors retain discretion as long as the figure meets resolution and accessibility standards.  
- **Software evolution** – Chemical drawing tools (ChemDraw, MarvinSketch, ChemDraw Prime) added optional “gradient” or “shading” features, but also introduced built‑in accessibility checks (e.g., color‑blind simulators). The tools make it easier to produce both gradient‑filled and plain line drawings, leaving the choice to the author.  
- **Impact on the field** – The specific visual style has not affected the scientific impact of Nicolaou’s work. His total syntheses continued to be cited heavily, and none of the papers in question suffered retractions or major criticism for figure quality. The broader community’s move toward clearer graphics has been driven more by general data‑visualization best practices than by this isolated complaint.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implicitly predicts that continued use of gradient fills would be “annoying” and perhaps prompt corrective action. The factual outcome is:

- **Prediction (implicit):** A petition or collective effort would pressure Nicolaou to stop using gradient fills.  
  **Outcome:** No such organized effort materialized; Nicolaou’s figure style remained largely unchanged.

- **Prediction (implicit):** Sending Tufte’s books might improve the visual communication.  
  **Outcome:** There is no evidence that Nicolaou received or acted on such a gift; his subsequent figures still employ decorative shading.

Overall, the article’s implied expectations were not realized; the visual conventions persisted, albeit within a broader trend toward clearer graphics across the discipline.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10** – The piece is a niche, stylistic gripe with limited lasting relevance to biotechnology or scientific progress. Its only broader interest lies in the ongoing conversation about scientific illustration standards.
