# 23andMe (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes 23andMe's strategic pivot into drug discovery following their FDA regulatory challenges. In early 2015, the personal genomics company had been working to resolve FDA objections over reporting customer genetic information, having had services suspended in 2013. The company had built a valuable database of 800,000 genetic sequences, with over 80% of customers consenting to research use. 

The key development was 23andMe's decision to enter drug discovery directly, marked by hiring Richard Scheller, former head of drug discovery at Genentech. This represented a significant escalation from a consumer genetics service to building an R&D team capable of drug development. The article also noted Pfizer's research collaboration with 23andMe to leverage their genomics database, highlighting the commercial value of their accumulated genetic data.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 pivot, 23andMe has made significant progress in drug discovery while navigating ongoing regulatory challenges:

**FDA Resolution and Service Restoration**: 23andMe eventually reached resolution with the FDA, regaining the ability to provide health-related genetic reports to customers in 2015-2017, though under more stringent regulatory oversight.

**Therapeutics Development**: The company established a dedicated therapeutics division that has progressed multiple drug candidates. Notably, 23andMe has advanced programs for inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's disease, and other conditions, leveraging their genetic database to identify novel drug targets and patient populations.

**Clinical Progress**: By 2018-2022, 23andMe had advanced several programs to clinical development, including partnerships with established pharmaceutical companies. Their model focuses on using genetic insights to identify promising therapeutic targets with higher probability of success.

**Business Evolution**: The company went public via SPAC merger in 2021, providing capital for continued therapeutic development. However, maintaining both consumer genetics and drug discovery operations has required significant resources and strategic focus.

**Database Growth**: The genetic database has grown substantially beyond the 800,000 sequences mentioned in 2015, providing increased statistical power for genetic association studies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Building a drug company from scratch** - This has partially materialized. 23andMe did establish a therapeutics division with R&D capabilities, but has supplemented internal efforts with partnerships and collaborative agreements rather than pure vertical integration.

• **Great potential of using the database for drug discovery** - This has proven accurate. Large genetic databases have become a valuable tool for identifying novel drug targets and validating mechanisms of action. The approach has gained industry acceptance and shown promise for improving R&D success rates.

• **Need for significant outsourcing and expertise** - This was prescient. 23andMe has utilized partnerships and external collaborations to complement internal capabilities, recognizing the complexity of drug development requires diverse expertise beyond genetic analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article correctly identified the emergence of using large-scale genetic databases for drug discovery, a trend that has gained momentum and shown tangible progress with multiple programs advancing to clinical trials.
