# Safety Warning: Togni's Reagents (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on a newly identified explosive hazard associated with the "second Togni reagent" (a trifluoromethylating agent commonly used in organic synthesis). Researchers at Novasep in Leverkusen, Germany, published findings in *Organic Process R&D* demonstrating that this reagent undergoes powerful exothermic decomposition and has combustion properties comparable to black powder. The compound also exhibited variable sensitivity to impact and friction across different samples. Based on these findings, the reagent was classified as "dangerously explosive" requiring national authority approval for transport. The author notes that while these Togni reagents are useful synthetic tools, their explosive nature makes them potentially too dangerous for routine laboratory use without extensive safety precautions.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2013 warning, several developments occurred:

**Safety Classifications and Availability:**
- Both Togni reagents (Togni Reagent I and II) were reclassified by major chemical suppliers. Sigma-Aldrich and other vendors added prominent safety warnings and began offering these materials with stringent handling requirements
- Many institutions implemented additional safety protocols, requiring specialized training and safety equipment for researchers working with these compounds

**Alternative Reagents:**
- The safety concerns accelerated development and adoption of alternative trifluoromethylation reagents, including:
 - Umemoto's reagents (more thermally stable alternatives)
 - Langlois reagent (CF₃SO₂Na)
 - Various copper-mediated trifluoromethylation protocols
 - Photoredox-catalyzed trifluoromethylation methods

**Regulatory Impact:**
- The documented explosive hazard influenced how these reagents are regulated under international chemical safety protocols
- Shipping and storage became more restrictive, potentially limiting accessibility for some laboratories

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions Identified:**
• **Supplier Response:** The article predicted that Aldrich would likely change availability or handling of Togni Reagent I following safety revelations
• **Practical Usage:** Implicit prediction that safety concerns would limit routine laboratory use

**Outcomes:**

- ✓ **Correct:** Major suppliers did implement stricter controls, enhanced warnings, and modified distribution practices

- ✓ **Correct:** While both Togni reagents remain available, they became less favored for routine use due to safety concerns and the emergence of safer alternatives

- **Additional Context:** The safety concerns didn't eliminate use entirely—experienced research groups continued using these reagents with appropriate safety measures, but alternatives became increasingly preferred, especially in industrial settings where safety considerations are paramount

- **Broader Impact:** This incident contributed to increased awareness within the synthetic chemistry community about safety assessment of organic reagents, leading to more systematic evaluation of reactive intermediates

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article addresses important laboratory safety concerns while providing practical implications for synthetic chemistry. The intersection of reagent utility, safety hazards, and regulatory considerations gives this widespread relevance beyond a single compound class.
