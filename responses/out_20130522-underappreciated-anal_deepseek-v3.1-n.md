# Underappreciated Analytical Techniques (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses analytical methods in organic chemistry that the author considers underused despite their potential utility. The author notes that infrared (IR) spectroscopy has largely fallen out of routine use, with personal experience of taking only one or two IR spectra in the previous decade, primarily to confirm distinctive functional groups like alkynes or azides. The author suggests that carbon-13 NMR and various 2D NMR techniques are underutilized and invites readers to nominate other overlooked analytical methods.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication in 2013, analytical chemistry continued to evolve with significant developments:

**IR Spectroscopy**: IR never regained its former prominence in routine organic structure elucidation. While still taught in undergraduate curricula and used for specific applications (polymer analysis, atmospheric monitoring, quality control in pharmaceuticals), it remains secondary to NMR and MS for most synthetic organic chemistry workflows. Portable and ATR-FTIR systems found industrial applications, but research laboratories continued prioritizing NMR and mass spectrometry.

**NMR Technology**: Carbon-13 NMR and 2D NMR methods became more widespread as NMR instrumentation improved. The introduction of higher field instruments (400-1000 MHz NMR became more common), automated platforms, and the rise of LC-MS/MS for high-throughput analysis further marginalized classical wet-chemical methods.

**NMR Developments**: Carbon-13 NMR did not experience a dramatic resurgence for routine structure elucidation, though it remains essential for specific applications including metabolic profiling and materials characterization. 2D NMR techniques became increasingly automated and more accessible due to improved software and hardware, finding particular utility in pharmaceutical analysis (structure confirmation of complex natural products, drug metabolites, proteins). Cryogenic probes and micro-cryoprobes enhanced sensitivity, making previously challenging experiments more routine.

**Broader Analytical Trends**: Mass spectrometry, especially high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and hyphenated techniques (LC-MS, GC-MS), became the workhorse for structure confirmation and quantitative analysis in both academic and industrial settings. The biopharmaceutical industry's growth drove adoption of biophysical techniques (SPR, BLI, DSF) for protein characterization. Miniaturization and portable analytical devices gained traction for field applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article posed an open-ended question rather than making explicit predictions. When interpreted as implicit suggestions:

• **IR spectroscopy revival**: Not realized for routine organic structure elucidation. IR remains niche for specific applications but never regained widespread adoption among organic chemists for daily problem-solving.

• **Carbon-13 NMR expansion**: Modest success. C-13 NMR remains valuable for specific research applications but did not displace proton NMR or mass spectrometry as primary tools.

• **2D NMR broader adoption**: Partial success. 2D NMR became more routine in pharmaceutical and natural products research due to automation and improved accessibility, but remains primarily a specialist tool rather than a daily technique for most synthetic organic chemists.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
This is a brief opinion piece about laboratory techniques that invites reader participation but lacks broader scientific, clinical, or policy implications. While mildly interesting for laboratory chemists, it does not touch upon fundamental advances, therapeutic outcomes, or societal impact.
