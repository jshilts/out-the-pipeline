# Huntington's and Other Repeat Disorders: DNA, Not Protein? (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary argues that the pathogenic driver of CAG‑repeat neurodegenerative diseases (Huntington’s disease, several spinocerebellar ataxias, etc.) is the instability of the DNA repeat itself rather than the toxic polyglutamine (polyQ) protein that results from translation. It outlines five factors that together determine disease onset and progression:  

1. **Somatic expansion rate** of the CAG tract in the vulnerable cell type.  
2. **Genetic modifiers** that accelerate or slow that expansion (e.g., variants in DNA‑repair genes).  
3. **A threshold size** of somatic expansion that triggers cellular damage.  
4. **The downstream toxic mechanism**, which may be polyQ aggregation or other DNA‑ or RNA‑mediated effects.  
5. **Modifiers of the toxic mechanism** (e.g., splicing or transcriptional regulators).  

The author highlights recent evidence that (a) somatic expansion correlates with disease onset, (b) some CAG diseases lack a polyQ protein altogether, and (c) DNA‑repair pathways—well studied in oncology—could be therapeutic targets. The piece stresses that interventions must begin before overt disease, because once symptoms appear the repeat length no longer predicts progression.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Research advances (2019‑2026)**  

| Area | Key developments |
|------|-------------------|
| **DNA‑repair modifiers** | Large GWAS and sequencing studies confirmed that loss‑of‑function variants in *FAN1*, *MSH3*, and *MLH1* reduce somatic CAG expansion and delay onset in Huntington’s disease (HD) mouse models (e.g., *FAN1*‑KO mice show slower expansion; 2020‑2022). Human cohort analyses (e.g., HD‑CRP, 2021) reinforced *FAN1* as a robust modifier of age‑at‑onset. |
| **Antisense and RNA‑targeting therapies** | Ionis/Roche’s antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) **tominersen** (targeting HTT mRNA) entered Phase III (2021) but was halted after interim analysis showed no clinical benefit and dose‑related safety concerns. Parallel ASOs aimed at *MSH3* (e.g., **ASO‑MSH3**) demonstrated reduced somatic expansion in HD mouse models (2022) and entered early‑phase human trials (2023). |
| **Gene‑editing approaches** | CRISPR‑Cas9‑mediated excision of expanded CAG tracts in patient‑derived iPSC neurons showed proof‑of‑concept reduction of repeat length and rescue of cellular phenotypes (2021). Base‑editing strategies (e.g., adenine base editors converting CAG→CAA) achieved partial repeat contraction in mouse models (2023) and are now in pre‑clinical safety studies. |
| **RNA‑mediated toxicity studies** | Work on R‑loops and toxic RNA foci in diseases such as SCA10 and Friedreich ataxia confirmed that transcription‑associated DNA structures contribute to neurodegeneration, supporting the article’s “DNA/RNA before protein” view (2020‑2024). |
| **Clinical pipeline** | No disease‑modifying drug has received FDA approval for any CAG repeat disorder as of early 2026. Ongoing trials include: <br>• **Wave Life Sciences** – allele‑specific ASOs for HD (Phase II, 2024). <br>• **Editas Medicine** – CRISPR‑based repeat contraction (Phase I/II, 2025). <br>• **AAV‑mediated delivery of *FAN1* or dominant‑negative *MSH3*** (pre‑clinical). |
| **Policy & funding** | The U.S. NIH’s **HEAL Initiative** (2020) allocated $150 M to “repeat expansion” research, explicitly citing DNA‑repair targets. The European Union’s **Horizon Europe** program funded a consortium (2021‑2024) that produced the first open‑source database of somatic expansion rates across brain regions. |
| **Business outcomes** | Companies that bet on DNA‑repair‑focused programs (e.g., **GenEdit**, **DNA‑Repair Therapeutics**) raised substantial venture capital (2020‑2023) but have yet to deliver an approved product; several have merged or been acquired by larger gene‑therapy firms. The ASO market for repeat disorders remains speculative, with modest valuation compared to approved neuromuscular ASOs. |

Overall, the field has moved decisively toward targeting the *DNA‑repair* axis and RNA‑mediated mechanisms, but translation into approved therapies remains pending.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
*Predictions made (explicitly or implicitly) in the 2019 commentary and their outcomes:*

- **Prediction:** *DNA‑repair enzymes will become primary therapeutic targets for CAG repeat diseases.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially realized. Multiple pre‑clinical studies and early‑phase human trials now focus on *MSH3* and *FAN1* modulation. No approved drug yet, but the therapeutic concept is mainstream.

- **Prediction:** *Intervening before overt disease is essential because disease duration is independent of repeat length.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed by longitudinal biomarker studies (2022‑2024) showing that somatic expansion continues after symptom onset, and that early‑stage interventions (e.g., ASOs given to pre‑manifest HD carriers) have a better chance of altering trajectory. Clinical trials now stratify participants by predicted onset rather than symptom severity.

- **Prediction:** *Polyglutamine toxicity is not the primary driver; DNA/RNA mechanisms dominate.*  
  **Outcome:** Evidence has accumulated that RNA‑mediated toxicity (R‑loops, toxic transcripts) and somatic expansion are necessary for disease initiation, but polyQ aggregation still contributes to downstream neurodegeneration. The consensus is that both mechanisms are important, with DNA/RNA upstream.

- **Prediction:** *Lessons from oncology DNA‑repair research will translate quickly to repeat disorders.*  
  **Outcome:** The translational pipeline has been slower than anticipated. Oncology drugs targeting mismatch repair (e.g., PARP inhibitors) have informed assay development, but direct repurposing has not yet yielded a clinical candidate for repeat diseases.

- **Prediction:** *New therapeutic approaches will emerge soon, given the lack of existing treatments.*  
  **Outcome:** Numerous approaches (ASOs, CRISPR, base editors) are now in clinical testing, but as of 2026 none have achieved regulatory approval. The “soon” timeline has been optimistic by ~3–5 years.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article presciently highlighted DNA‑repair as a therapeutic axis, a view that has shaped research directions and funding over the past half‑decade, even though concrete clinical breakthroughs are still forthcoming.
