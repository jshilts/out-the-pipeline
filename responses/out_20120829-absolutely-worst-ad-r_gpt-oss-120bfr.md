# Absolutely The Worst Ad For a Rota‑Vap You Will See Today (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
Derek Lowe’s short blog post (published 29 August 2012) critiques a promotional video from IKA for its “magic distillation” rotary‑evaporator. He points out that the ad is awkwardly staged: a model chemist evaporates a bright‑green solution into a light‑blue receiving flask, then the commercial shifts into a hard‑sell that feels out of place for a scientific audience. Lowe’s tone is humorous and dismissive, emphasizing that the ad’s visual gimmicks and lack of authentic laboratory context make it “the worst” he’s seen for this equipment.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Product adoption:** IKA’s rotary evaporators (including the “Rota‑Vap” line) have continued to be widely used in academic and industrial labs. Sales have grown modestly, driven more by the instrument’s performance and reliability than by its 2012 video.  
- **Marketing evolution:** IKA refreshed its promotional materials in the mid‑2010s, moving toward more realistic laboratory footage and customer testimonials. The 2012 video remains available online but is now often cited as a cautionary example of poor scientific advertising.  
- **Industry impact:** The ad itself did not influence any regulatory or policy changes, nor did it affect the scientific community’s adoption of rotary evaporation technology. The technique remains a standard work‑horse for solvent removal.  
- **Derek Lowe’s commentary:** The post generated a modest amount of discussion on the “In the Pipeline” blog and on social media, but it did not lead to any notable shifts in IKA’s branding strategy beyond the later marketing updates mentioned above.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article contains no explicit future‑looking statements from Lowe or IKA. Implicitly, the criticism suggests that the ad would be poorly received and perhaps prompt IKA to improve its marketing. The subsequent reality aligns with that implication:

- **Prediction (implicit):** The ad would be mocked and seen as ineffective.  
  - **Outcome:** The video became a meme within the chemistry‑blogosphere; IKA later produced more conventional marketing videos.  

No other concrete forecasts were made, so there is nothing further to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10**  
The piece is a brief, humorous critique of a niche marketing video; it offers limited scientific insight and has had minimal lasting impact on the biotechnology field.
