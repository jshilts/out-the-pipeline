# "Your Huddled Pharmas Yearning to Breathe Free" (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article, appearing as a commentary in January 2004, reports on a speech by Rolf Krebs, chairman of German pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim, addressing the widening gap between pharmaceutical research and development in Europe versus the United States. Krebs highlighted concerning trends: Germany's pharmaceutical export-import ratio had turned negative for the first time, only four of seven major German pharma firms doing R&D remained, and just ten of the world's 185 industry research centers were located in Germany—with twenty research centers closed across Europe in six years. 

The speech identified root causes in Europe's regulatory landscape: heavy state intervention in drug pricing and reimbursement policies, an overabundance of regulations that stifled innovation and risk-taking, and difficult access to venture capital. Krebs contrasted this with the United States, where less regulatory interference allowed prices based on therapeutic quality and cost-benefit analysis to prevail. The implications were clear: European pharma firms were cutting back operations at home while expanding in the U.S., and the economic incentives increasingly favored locating innovation, research, and investments outside of Europe.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends documented in the 2004 article continued and deepened in the subsequent two decades. Europe's share of global pharmaceutical R&D has steadily fallen, while the United States consolidated its position as the leading destination for biopharmaceutical investment. Many major European companies expanded their U.S. research presence significantly, and several blockbuster drug launches became heavily weighted toward the U.S. market. Reimbursement constraints and pricing pressures within individual European countries remained a persistent challenge compared to the more flexible U.S. system. 

However, some mitigation efforts did emerge. Initiatives like the European Medicines Agency's efforts to harmonize regulatory pathways and various national programs to boost biotech ecosystems have had mixed but non-transformative results. The core dynamic described by Krebs largely persisted: drugs often achieved higher revenue potential and faster market access in the U.S., reinforcing the relative attractiveness of investing in U.S.-based operations and research facilities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The commentary made several implicit predictions through Krebs' analysis:

- **Europe will continue losing pharmaceutical R&D investment and facilities**: This prediction largely materialized. Major European firms diversified R&D footprints toward the U.S., and Europe's share of global biopharmaceutical research continued to shrink relative to the U.S. and Asia-Pacific.

- **European companies will increasingly build research centers in the U.S., not Europe**: This trend continued. Many large European pharma companies expanded U.S. research facilities over the following decade, while reducing or consolidating some European operations.

- **U.S. market dynamism and pricing freedom will outperform Europe**: This remained true through the subsequent period. The U.S. continued to offer higher pricing flexibility and faster market access compared to state-regulated European health systems.

- **Innovation will shift to environments with fewer regulatory barriers and better risk-taking culture**: The U.S. generally maintained an innovation advantage over Europe in pharmaceutical and biotech development through the period, with more startups, greater venture funding, and higher success rates.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides a historically important snapshot of the mid-2000s pharma landscape and accurately diagnosed structural factors driving R&D location decisions, making it a useful case study in industry dynamics.
