# Article Title (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from November 17, 2009 serves as a memorial notice for Warren DeLano, the developer of the open-source PyMOL molecular visualization program. The author notes DeLano had "passed away suddenly earlier this month" at age 37. The piece characterizes DeLano as "another unfortunate loss of a scientist who had done a lot of fine work and was clearly on the way to doing much more." The memorial highlights DeLano's creation of PyMOL as "excellent open-source" software. The author mentions having a PyMOL window open while writing, stating regular use of the program to examine protein structures, and closes with the Latin phrase "Si monumentum requiris, circumspice" (If you seek his monument, look around).

## 2. HISTORY

After 2009, PyMOL continued to grow in adoption and impact within structural biology, drug discovery, and biochemistry. In 2010, Schrödinger acquired the commercial rights to PyMOL, and in 2017 they released PyMOL 2.0 with enhanced performance and features. The open-source version remained available, with maintained academic and open-source editions supporting broad access. Over the subsequent years, PyMOL evolved into a near-ubiquitous tool in structural biology laboratories, used for protein structure visualization, figure generation for publications, educational instruction, and drug design workflows. The software saw iterative updates improving rendering, computational efficiency, and interoperability with other computational biology tools. The dual-licensing model (open-source and commercial) reportedly supported both accessible academic use and enterprise adoption in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. PyMOL was and remains particularly prominent for producing high-quality molecular graphics for scientific publications, with numerous citations attributing figure preparation to PyMOL. The sustained development and widespread adoption retroactively underscore the enduring significance of DeLano's work as foundational infrastructure in the field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit forward-looking predictions appear in this particular article. The piece is entirely retrospective and commemorative in nature, focusing on honoring DeLano's contributions rather than forecasting future developments. Consequently, there are no predictions to evaluate against subsequent outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While poignant as a memorial for a creator of influential scientific software and a reflection on loss in the scientific community, the article consists primarily of a brief obituary notice without substantive analysis of biotechnology developments. It offers limited broader impact discussion or forward-looking content suitable for deep retrospective evaluation.
