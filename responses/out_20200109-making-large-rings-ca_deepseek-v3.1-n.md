# Making The Large Rings Catalytically (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a new paper from the Gellman group at the University of Wisconsin presenting an ingenious catalytic approach to synthesizing large ring compounds (macrocycles) using foldamers. The researchers developed polyamide chains that adopt helical conformations, with strategically placed primary and secondary amine functional groups that react with long-chain dialdehydes to form 14- to 22-membered rings in remarkably high yields (55-95%). This contrasts sharply with traditional methods using simple amines (like pyrrolidine and ethylamine), which produce mostly intermolecular aldol products with very low macrocycle yields (~3%). The foldamer's success demonstrates enzyme-like spatial control, positioning reactive groups at precise distances and angles to overcome the entropic penalty of ring closure. The work represents progress in biomimetic catalysis, showing how engineered secondary structures can direct chemical reactivity in ways similar to natural enzymes.

## 2. HISTORY
Follow-up research built significantly on the Gellman group's foldamer-catalyzed macrocyclization strategy. The group and others extended this approach to increasingly complex ring systems and demonstrated its utility in natural product synthesis and drug discovery contexts. The foldamer platform proved adaptable for forming various ring sizes and incorporating diverse functional groups.

This catalytic methodology found application in synthesizing macrocyclic compounds relevant to pharmaceutical development, particularly for difficult-to-access ring systems. Several research groups adopted similar foldamer-based strategies for ring-closing reactions, expanding beyond aldol chemistry to other bond-forming processes. The modular nature of polyamide foldamers enabled systematic optimization of catalytic performance through iterative design.

However, the broader impact remained primarily within academic synthetic chemistry rather than industrial pharmaceutical manufacturing. While the yields were impressive in academic settings, scaling such catalytic systems for commercial production faced challenges related to foldamer synthesis cost, substrate scope limitations, and competing industrial methods. No major pharmaceutical products emerged that specifically relied on this foldamer-catalyzed macrocyclization as their manufacturing route. The approach demonstrated proof-of-concept for enzyme-mimetic catalysis but faced the practical hurdles common to biomimetic systems: achieving the robustness, substrate breadth, and cost-effectiveness needed for widespread industrial adoption.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit timeline-based predictions about this specific foldamer-catalyzed macrocyclization approach. However, it made several implicit predictions and general observations about the field:

• **Implicit prediction about foldamer mechanism validation**: The spatial dependence results strongly supported the proposed bifunctional mechanism, and subsequent research did confirm and elaborate on this mechanistic understanding through additional stereochemical and kinetic studies.

• **Broader expectation about enzyme-mimetic catalysis progress**: The article's optimistic tone about "the sort of thing that an enzyme does" reflected the field's general trajectory toward more sophisticated biomimetic catalysts. The subsequent years did see continued advances in foldamer catalysis, though widespread industrial enzyme-like catalysis for pharmaceutical synthesis remained incremental rather than revolutionary.

• **Implicit prediction about modular construction**: The observation that "modular construction of these polyamide chains makes that quite feasible" proved accurate, as subsequent work leveraged this modularity to optimize catalytic foldamers for various transformations.

• **Enzyme evolution analogy**: The remark about "if one were common this is one of the reactions you might see evolution finding a use for" reflected accurate understanding of evolutionary catalytic principles, though this remained a conceptual framework rather than a testable prediction about future discoveries.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article covers an important advance in synthetic catalysis methodology with relevance to pharmaceutical synthesis and enzyme mimetics. The work demonstrates genuine conceptual innovation in controlling molecular reactivity, though its practical applications remain specialized within academic chemistry rather than broadly transformative for industrial processes.
