# Rimonabant Bangs Into. . .Something (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
This February 2006 commentary discusses Sanofi-Aventis's obesity drug Acomplia (rimonabant), which had just received an "Approvable, But..." letter from the FDA. The author expresses long-standing concerns about rimonabant dating back to 2004, noting that the drug targets the endocannabinoid receptor—a relatively poorly understood central nervous system pathway. The article highlights the inherent risks of CNS drugs, particularly those with novel mechanisms of action targeting large patient populations with heterogeneous responses.

The author's main worries stem from experience in CNS drug discovery, emphasizing that brain chemistry is not sufficiently understood to predict unexpected side effects, especially for a new drug targeting a novel pathway with massive market potential. The piece speculates that the FDA's action may reflect safety concerns or possibly just disagreements over aggressive labeling proposals, with the prediction that Sanofi-Aventis would need to clarify the situation quickly to maintain credibility.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this article, rimonabant's story unfolded dramatically. The drug was approved in the European Union in 2006 under the name Acomplia, becoming available in several European countries for obesity treatment. However, the FDA's concerns proved prescient.

In 2007, an FDA advisory committee voted against approving rimonabant for the U.S. market, citing safety concerns, particularly regarding psychiatric side effects including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The drug was never approved by the FDA.

By 2008, accumulating post-marketing data in Europe revealed significant psychiatric adverse events. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended suspension of Acomplia's marketing authorization in October 2008, with Sanofi-Aventis withdrawing the drug from all markets in 2009.

The rimonabant experience marked a major setback for endocannabinoid receptor antagonists as an obesity treatment strategy. Clinical trials for similar CB1 receptor antagonists were largely abandoned or terminated, representing a significant therapeutic class failure. The case also influenced regulatory approaches to obesity drugs, with increased emphasis on psychiatric safety monitoring.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Target validation concerns**: The author expressed skepticism about targeting the relatively unstudied endocannabinoid receptor. **Actual outcome**: These concerns were validated, as psychiatric side effects emerged as the primary reason for the drug's failure and withdrawal.

- **CNS drug unpredictability**: The article predicted "interesting surprises" from CNS drugs acting on brain chemistry. **Actual outcome**: This prediction proved accurate, with severe psychiatric side effects (depression, suicidal ideation) emerging that were not adequately predicted during development.

- **Heterogeneous patient response**: The author noted that CNS drugs show highly variable responses between patients. **Actual outcome**: While true generally, rimonabant showed consistent enough psychiatric risks across populations to be deemed unsafe for broad use.

- **FDA approval timing**: The author speculated Sanofi would need to provide details "by Wednesday." **Actual outcome**: The broader FDA concerns ultimately prevented U.S. approval entirely, making this timeline prediction too optimistic for the drug's prospects.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about drug development risks, accurately identifying the specific vulnerabilities that led to rimonabant's failure. The author's CNS expertise and understanding of regulatory challenges made this analysis particularly insightful well before the clinical outcomes became clear.
