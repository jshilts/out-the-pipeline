# Ambition From Recursion (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Recursion Pharmaceuticals, a startup out of the University of Utah that announced plans to develop 100 drugs in 10 years. Their approach involved drug repurposing through computational phenotypic screening, particularly targeting rare diseases where they claimed their computational algorithms gave them an edge over traditional target-based discovery. The company had some leads for cerebral cavernous malformation, a condition their lab had studied for about a decade. The author characterizes the plan as "naïve" given the well-known challenges of drug discovery, but acknowledges that the approach itself isn't unreasonable—many others have tried drug repurposing—and appreciates the company's nerve while remaining skeptical about their understanding of the real-world difficulties ahead.

## 2. HISTORY

Recursion Pharmaceuticals went on to become one of the more successful AI-driven drug discovery companies. They went public through a SPAC merger in 2021 at a valuation of approximately $6.2 billion (though their valuation has since fluctuated significantly). The company has several drugs in clinical trials, including treatments for cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) and neurofibromatosis type 2. In 2024, Roche partnered with Recursion in a deal potentially worth up to $2 billion for an oncology drug candidate, and Bayer signed a collaboration worth up to $1.5 billion. Recursion has also expanded through acquisitions, including Cyclica and Valence. While they have not achieved the original goal of 100 approved drugs (few companies have), they have built a substantial pipeline and demonstrated commercial viability. Major partnerships with pharmaceutical companies suggest their computational approach has shown enough promise to attract significant investment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Explicit predictions**: The article did not make explicit predictions about whether Recursion would succeed or fail.
- **Implicit skepticism**: The author expressed strong doubt about the feasibility of developing "100 drugs in ten years" and characterized the plan as naïve. However, the article was more commentary on the company's ambitious claims rather than specific predictions about outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article captured a representative moment in the emergence of AI-driven drug discovery companies and provides valuable historical context for understanding this sector's development. Recursion's subsequent trajectory—going public, entering major partnerships, and building a pipeline—makes this early skepticism noteworthy, as it contrasts with the company's eventual achievements even if they fell short of the original audacious goal.
