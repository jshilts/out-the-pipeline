# What Would You Put In a Med-Chem Textbook? (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a reader's inquiry about writing an introductory medicinal chemistry textbook and what topics should be emphasized or de-emphasized compared to existing texts. The author specifically notes that many current textbooks contain substantial sections on combinatorial chemistry (combichem), but questions whether these sections are disproportionately large relative to the technique's current importance in the field. The article poses the question to readers about what they would include or exclude when writing a modern medicinal chemistry textbook.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2014, combinatorial chemistry has continued its decline in prominence within medicinal chemistry, validating the author's observation. The field has shifted toward more targeted approaches including structure-based drug design, fragment-based drug discovery, DNA-encoded libraries (DEL), and computational/AI-driven methods. Major pharmaceutical companies have largely moved away from large-scale combichem screening toward more rational design approaches. DNA-encoded library technology, while conceptually related to combichem in terms of generating molecular diversity, represents a more sophisticated evolution that allows screening of much larger compound collections (billions of compounds) with better efficiency.

Several companies commercialized DEL technology during this period, including X-Chem (acquired by Dassault Systèmes), Nuevolution (acquired by Amgen), and Ensemble Therapeutics, leading to drug discovery collaborations and clinical candidates. However, combichem as traditionally practiced—large parallel synthesis of compound libraries with limited structural intelligence—has become a niche technique rather than a central methodology in drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction about combichem's declining importance**: The article questions whether combichem sections in textbooks are "out of proportion to the technique's current importance." ✓ Accurate - combichem has continued to decline as a primary drug discovery approach

• **Implicit prediction about the need for textbook updates**: The article suggests that medicinal chemistry education should better reflect contemporary practice rather than historical methods. ✓ Accurate - more recent textbooks place greater emphasis on structure-based design, computational methods, and newer technologies

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article identifies an important educational challenge in keeping scientific curricula current with rapidly evolving technological realities, specifically capturing the transition away from combichem toward more structure-guided approaches.
