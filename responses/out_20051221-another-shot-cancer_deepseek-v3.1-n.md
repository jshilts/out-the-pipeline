# Another Shot at Cancer (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the FDA approval of Bayer's new cancer therapy, which the author identifies as part of a "wave of multiple-kinase inhibitors." The article highlights the significant gap between hope and reality in cancer drug development, noting that only 1 in 20 prospective cancer cures reaches the market—the worst record of any medical category. According to the piece, among cancer drugs approved in the previous 20 years, fewer than 1 in 5 had been shown to extend lives, with life extensions typically measured in weeks or months rather than years.

The author quotes an FDA medical officer, Dr. Steven Hirschfeld, who challenges several myths about cancer drugs: that they're highly targeted (when most hit multiple targets), that they're nontoxic (when they have their own side effects), and that they're cures (when they're not). The article frames this new Bayer compound as an interesting test case that would reveal how multiple-kinase inhibitors perform compared to the earlier generation of more narrowly targeted therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

The approval referenced in this December 2005 article was almost certainly **Nexavar (sorafenib)**, Bayer's multi-kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA in December 2005 for advanced renal cell carcinoma.

**Clinical Impact:** Nexavar went on to achieve broader success than many expected. It received additional approvals for hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in 2007 and for differentiated thyroid carcinoma in 2013. While not a "cure," sorafenib became a standard treatment option in these indications, with survival benefits typically in the range of several months to over a year depending on the cancer type and stage.

**Validation of Multi-Kinase Approach:** The multi-kinase inhibitor strategy proved successful and led to numerous other approvals in subsequent years, including:
- **Sutent (sunitinib)** - approved 2006 for renal cell carcinoma and GIST
- **Sprycel (dasatinib)** and **Tasigna (nilotinib)** - second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors for CML
- **Ibrance (palbociclib)** - approved 2015 for breast cancer targeting CDK4/6
- **Afinitor (everolimus)** and other mTOR inhibitors

**Business Outcomes:** Bayer's oncology franchise grew significantly. Nexavar became a blockbuster drug, generating several billion dollars in annual revenue at its peak. However, it eventually faced competition from newer immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors and more selective kinase inhibitors.

**Regulatory Evolution:** The 2005-2020 period saw the FDA adopt more flexible approval pathways for cancer drugs (accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation), partly in response to the recognition that traditional endpoints were inadequate for targeted therapies. Biomarker-driven approvals became more common.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Prediction:** That multiple-kinase inhibitors would perform differently than earlier targeted therapies
  **Reality:** ✓ **Accurate.** Multi-kinase inhibitors did indeed show a different efficacy and toxicity profile. They proved more effective in certain solid tumors than the highly selective single-target drugs, but with broader side effect profiles.

• **Prediction:** That it would be "very interesting to see how these molecules work"
  **Reality:** ✓ **Validated.** The subsequent 15+ years revealed that multi-kinase inhibitors work through hitting multiple pathways simultaneously, which can prevent rapid resistance development but also causes more diverse side effects.

• **Prediction:** Implicit expectation that targeted therapies wouldn't live up to the "targeted, nontoxic, curative" mythology
  **Reality:** ✓ **Accurate assessment.** While targeted therapies have transformed cancer treatment, they rarely provide cures as single agents, have significant toxicities, and resistance inevitably develops. Combination strategies and immunotherapies have shown more durable responses.

• **Prediction:** The article implicitly questioned whether this new wave would overcome the dismal statistics (1 in 20 success rate, limited survival benefit)
  **Reality:** ✓ **Mixed but leaning accurate.** Multi-kinase inhibitors improved success rates somewhat through better target selection and combination strategies, but cancer drug development remains challenging. The fundamental issue of limited survival extensions for most metastatic cancers persisted, though some targeted therapies did achieve multi-year survival benefits.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrated prescient skepticism about cancer drug hype while accurately identifying an important therapeutic class at its inflection point. The contextualization of success rates and the challenge to prevailing myths gave it lasting relevance as the multi-kinase inhibitor era unfolded.
