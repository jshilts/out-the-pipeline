# The Terrifying Cost of a New Drug (Feb 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article summarizes Forbes analysis from 2012 examining pharmaceutical R&D productivity by analyzing 15 years of financial statements from major drug companies and correlating R&D spending with FDA approvals. The data revealed astonishing costs: AstraZeneca spent nearly $12 billion per approved drug, while GSK, Sanofi, Roche, and Pfizer averaged around $8 billion per drug. Amgen performed best at $3.7 billion per drug.

The article contextualizes these figures against two competing estimates that were circulating at the time: the $43 million per drug figure from Light and Warburton (which the author dismisses as "nonsense") and the approximately $1 billion per drug estimate from Tufts/diMasi. The author argues that the massive discrepancy between the Forbes data ($3.7-12B per drug) and earlier estimates stems primarily from accounting for failure rates—the Tufts figure represents cost for a single successful drug, while the Forbes analysis captures the full R&D budget spread across both successes and failures.

The central argument is that these high costs, combined with declining success rates and rising R&D expenses, explain why pharmaceutical companies were laying off thousands of researchers and why drug prices were rising—creating what the author calls an unsustainable business model.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2012 article struck at a critical inflection point for pharmaceutical R&D productivity, and the subsequent decade revealed the accuracy of its concerns while also showing how the industry adapted:

**R&D Productivity Evolution**: In the years following 2012, R&D productivity remained challenged but showed modest improvement. Analysis by Deloitte and other industry observers showed that despite continued R&D investment growth, the number of new drug approvals remained relatively flat through much of the 2010s. The companies mentioned faced mixed fortunes: AstraZeneca underwent massive restructuring under CEO Pascal Soriot beginning in 2012, eventually recovering through targeted oncology investments; Pfizer continued struggling with patent cliffs but maintained strong vaccine development; Amgen maintained relatively stable R&D efficiency throughout the period.

**FDA Approval Rates**: The period from 2012-2022 showed variable but generally increasing FDA approval rates, with 2018 marking a 22-year high in new drug approvals. However, this improvement occurred alongside significant consolidation in the industry and continued outsourcing of R&D to smaller biotech companies.

**Cost Evolution**: The Tufts estimate referenced in the article evolved, with their 2016 update showing that post-approval costs and inflation adjustment pushed the "cost per new drug" to over $2.8 billion in 2016 dollars, confirming the article's concerns about rising costs being accurate.

**Business Development Shifts**: The "frantic firing" mentioned accelerated, with major companies including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi undertaking massive layoffs throughout the 2010s. This period saw dramatic restructuring, with companies closing major research sites and increasingly relying on external innovation through acquisitions rather than internal drug discovery.

**Policy Impact**: The high costs documented contributed to ongoing policy debates about drug pricing, leading to various legislative proposals for price controls, though major federal action remained limited until the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which included provisions for Medicare drug price negotiation.

**Pandemic Effect**: The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically reshaped industry economics. The successful development of mRNA vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna showcased unprecedented speed but also highlighted the extraordinary resources required for rapid drug development under emergency conditions. Vaccine revenue temporarily offset some productivity concerns, but the fundamental R&D efficiency challenges persisted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit and explicit predictions proved remarkably accurate:

• **"Unsustainable" business model**: ✓ **Accurate**. Throughout the 2010s, traditional pharmaceutical R&D models continued struggling, leading to massive restructurings, site closures, and a fundamental shift toward acquiring innovation rather than building it internally.

• **Continued drug price increases**: ✓ **Accurate**. Drug prices rose consistently throughout the 2010s, becoming a major political issue and leading to consumer outrage over specific medications (like Martin Shkreli's Daraprim and EpiPen pricing controversies).

• **Rising R&D costs**: ✓ **Accurate**. Multiple analyses confirmed costs continued rising, with expanded clinical trial requirements, regulatory complexity, and the challenges of drug development for complex diseases.

• **If $43 million figure were true, people would be "lining up to start drug companies"**: ✓ **Accurate logical assessment**. The biotech boom began almost immediately after this article, with venture capital investment in biotech doubling from $4.5B in 2012 to $9.4B in 2014, and continuing to grow through the 2010s—but these companies still faced the same underlying cost structure.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article ranks in the top decile for its prescient analysis of pharmaceutical R&D economics. It correctly identified that published cost estimates dramatically understated actual drug development costs and foresaw the industry restructuring that dominated the next decade. The piece anticipated major policy debates about drug pricing and provided a framework that remains central to understanding pharmaceutical industry dynamics today.
