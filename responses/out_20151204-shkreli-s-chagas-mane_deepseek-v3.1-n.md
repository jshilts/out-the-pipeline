# Shkreli's Chagas Maneuver (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article describes Martin Shkreli's controversial acquisition of KaloBios, a nearly defunct biotech company, immediately after gaining national notoriety for price-gouging on Daraprim. Shkreli purchased 70% of KaloBios at rock-bottom prices after the company had announced it was shutting down following failed clinical trials and inability to raise funds. The article focuses on Shkreli's subsequent move to acquire benznidazole, an established Chagas disease treatment that had been used for decades internationally but was not FDA-approved in the US. The author characterizes this as a "loophole-seeking exercise" designed to exploit the FDA's Priority Review Voucher program, where Shkreli could run low-risk trials on an already-proven therapy and obtain a valuable voucher that could be resold for profit. The article portrays Shkreli as unrepentant about his pricing strategies and unusually skilled at regulatory arbitrage.

## 2. HISTORY
Within days of this article's publication, Martin Shkreli was arrested by the FBI on December 17, 2015 on securities fraud charges unrelated to drug pricing, stemming from his management of hedge funds and Retrophin. KaloBios filed for bankruptcy on December 22, 2015, just weeks after Shkreli's acquisition and subsequent arrest. The company's stock, which had surged from $0.44 to over $40 during Shkreli's brief involvement, collapsed back to virtually worthless levels.

The Chagas disease strategy never materialized as planned. KaloBios emerged from bankruptcy under new ownership and eventually pivoted entirely different directions, ultimately merging with Humanigen and focusing on lenzilumab for COVID-19 and cancer indications.

In July 2017, Shkreli was convicted on multiple counts of securities fraud and conspiracy. He was sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million. The Priority Review Voucher program continued, with various pharmaceutical companies successfully obtaining and selling vouchers, but Shkreli's specific benznidazole maneuver never progressed beyond the announcement stage.

Meanwhile, Chagas disease treatment remained an area of concern, with benznidazole eventually receiving FDA approval in 2017 through different pathways, not through Shkreli's proposed mechanism.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction that Shkreli would successfully exploit the Priority Review Voucher loophole**: This did not happen due to his arrest and KaloBios's bankruptcy, both occurring within weeks of the article.

• **Suggestion that the Chagas strategy represented a viable business model**: The complete collapse of the plan demonstrated that such regulatory arbitrage depended heavily on execution capability, which was eliminated by legal and financial realities.

• **Implication that Shkreli's pattern of controversial pharmaceutical strategies would continue**: His legal troubles ended his pharmaceutical career abruptly, though his public notoriety continued.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Score: 7**

The article captures a pivotal moment showing how financial engineering and regulatory gaming intersected with public health policy, providing prescient analysis of loophole exploitation, though the scheme's immediate collapse makes it more of a cautionary footnote than a sustained impact story.
