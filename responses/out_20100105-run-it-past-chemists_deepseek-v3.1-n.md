# Run It Past the Chemists (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post discusses a controversial October 2009 *Science* paper titled "Reactome Array: Forging a Link Between Metabolome and Genome" that described a novel nanoparticle assay. The authors claimed to have immobilized 1,675 different biomolecules on an array to metabolically profile cells through fluorescent detection. The method purported to enable enzymes recognizing any of these molecules to trigger a fluorescent signal.

However, the article came under sustained criticism from chemists shortly after publication. Key concerns included apparent chemical errors in the paper's main scheme, dubious chemical nomenclature (such as describing a positively charged nitrogen as a "weakly amine region"), and skepticism about whether a relatively unknown research group could have synthesized such a large number of complex compounds. Additionally, promised supplementary materials providing synthetic details were not made available on time. *Science* magazine had already published an "Expression of Concern" acknowledging that the authors had provided synthetic details that "differ substantially" from the original manuscript, and an institutional investigation was underway.

## 2. HISTORY

The Reactome Array paper became one of the most significant retraction scandals in biotechnology during this period. Rodrigo Prado, the first author from the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, was ultimately found to have fabricated substantial portions of the research (Retraction Watch, 2010-2012). The investigation revealed that the claimed synthesis of 1,675 different biomolecules was fraudulent.

The paper was formally retracted by *Science* in June 2010, with the retraction notice stating "the authors wish to retract the Report" and acknowledging that "the compounds described were not synthesized as described" (Science, 2010). This case became a prominent example in discussions about peer review failures, particularly the importance of having appropriate disciplinary expertise among reviewers – none of the original reviewers had been synthetic organic chemists.

The fallout had concrete implications: it damaged the reputation of the involved institutions, highlighted weaknesses in high-impact journal peer review processes, and became a cautionary tale about the importance of methodological skepticism in "omics" research. The case also contributed to ongoing debates about research integrity and the pressures of publishing in top-tier journals. No clinically useful drugs or diagnostic methods emerged from this work, and it appears to have had no positive downstream applications given the fraudulent nature of the underlying claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction that investigations would reveal significant problems**: ✓ **Accurate**. The author's expectation that "I'll be very interested to see what comes of it" correctly anticipated that investigations would uncover serious issues with the research.

- **Implicit prediction that chemical expertise was crucial for evaluating such work**: ✓ **Accurate**. The post's central thesis about needing chemists to review chemical claims was validated when the synthetic chemistry community's skepticism proved justified.

- **Implicit concern about peer review quality at high-impact journals**: ✓ **Accurate**. The blog's criticism of *Science* for not having synthetic organic chemistry reviewers was validated when the journal acknowledged this gap and the paper was retracted.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While the article focused on a significant case of scientific misconduct, the broader implications were limited to peer review process improvements rather than fundamental advances in biotechnology itself.
