# Defending Drug Synthesis (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article responds to a Science paper that argued for the continued importance of synthetic chemistry in pharmaceuticals. The author acknowledges that modern synthetic techniques—including late-stage functionalization, photoredox chemistry, enzyme engineering, and high-throughput experimentation—are advancing rapidly and being deployed at scale. However, they challenge the framing of chemistry as a core bottleneck in drug discovery, noting pushback in the field (e.g., criticisms of photoredox as an academic toy) and a wider anxiety tied to decades of industry consolidation and job losses. The key claim is that while chemistry tooling improves, the primary failure mode in drug R&D remains clinical trial results driven by poor target selection and unexpected toxicity—neither of which synthetic chemistry directly solves. In this view, faster synthesis alone does not resolve the underlying biological uncertainties, and chemistry is not the rate-limiting step.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article’s 2019 publication, several trends continued: synthesis methods advanced further, industry efficiency rose, and companies adapted to an R&D landscape where chemistry execution is not the main constraint.
- **Continued adoption of modern synthetic tools**: Photoredox chemistry moved from niche to mainstream in both discovery and process chemistry, including scale-up, supporting bond formations that classical routes could not achieve.
- **Automation and HTE expansion**: High-throughput experimentation for reaction discovery and optimization became widespread, enabling faster analog synthesis and library production, yet clinical attrition persisted.
- **Clinical success drivers remained biological**: Breakthrough approvals from 2019 onward (e.g., in oncology, rare diseases, immunology) continued to pivot on target validation, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles shaped more by biology than by chemistry deliverability.
- **Platform shifts toward biologics and modalities beyond small molecules**: Biologics (antibodies, bispecifics), cell therapies (CAR-T), and nucleic acid–based modalities grew, shifting resources and focus toward biology, manufacturing, and delivery challenges rather than traditional small-molecule synthetic speed.
- **R&D productivity and attrition**: Overall drug development success rates remained low, with Phase II/III failures still primarily due to efficacy shortfalls and safety issues. Synthetic chemistry capability did not correlate strongly with pipeline success rates.
- **Industrial consolidation and outsourcing**: Pharmaceutical chemistry departments continued to shrink or be outsourced, reinforcing the sense that chemistry execution is mature and that strategic value lies elsewhere (target discovery, translational biology, clinical insight).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **“Photoredox chemistry... will never be actually useful”**: This characterization was already being disproven by 2019. Thereafter, photoredox saw broad adoption at discovery and manufacturing scale, enabling routes (e.g., C–H functionalization, decarboxylative couplings) impractical with classical methods.
- **“Synthetic advances... are for naught when... the mechanism of action isn’t actually enough to provide a clinical benefit”**: This is not a prediction but a diagnosis that subsequent data reinforced. Clinical attrition stayed high, with failures driven by efficacy gaps and toxicity, not synthesis speed.
- **“Better, cleaner, faster ways to produce... new chemical matter” will continue**: True. The next years brought wider deployment of catalysis, automated synthesis, and rapid analog generation. However, these gains did not by themselves solve the rate-limiting challenge of choosing the right biological target.
- **Employment anxiety connected to new chemistry techniques**: This perception persisted. Chemistry roles in pharma continued consolidating, while growth shifted to biology, data science, and large-molecule manufacturing roles.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

A clear-eyed commentary with solid insight into why clinical, not synthetic, bottlenecks dominate attrition. It avoids both hype and nostalgia, and its core thesis was broadly consistent with later outcomes, though it offered limited forward-looking discussion about modality diversification (biologics, cell therapy) or data/AI-driven target selection trends.
