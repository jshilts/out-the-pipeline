# Nobel Season 2016 (October 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a light‑hearted “Nobel watch” column written just before the 2016 Chemistry Nobel was announced.  The author groups possible laureates into five informal categories:  

1. **“Beat the Reaper”** – long‑standing, Nobel‑worthy discoveries whose discoverers are now very old (e.g., John Goodenough and M. Stanley Whittingham for lithium‑ion batteries, Bruce Ames, Harry Gray).  
2. **“Holy Cow”** – brand‑new breakthroughs that would be “obviously” Nobel material (the author notes there were none obvious that year).  
3. **Lifetime‑achievement** – scientists with many seminal contributions but no single, easily‑summarized prize (e.g., Robert Langer, George Whitesides).  
4. **“Nobel Classic”** – solid, mid‑age fields that have produced Nobel‑level work (bio‑orthogonal chemistry, DNA sequencing, metal‑organic frameworks, atom‑transfer radical polymerisation, etc.).  
5. **Biologists** – primarily the CRISPR genome‑editing story, which the author says is “absolutely, positively” going to win a Nobel, though the exact year is uncertain.

The author also references several prediction lists (Wavefunction, C&E News webinar, Thomson Reuters) and notes that the Nobel Committee can be surprising, citing the 2015 natural‑products prize as an example.

## 2. HISTORY  

### 2016 Chemistry Nobel (announced 5 Oct 2016)  
*Awarded to* **Jean‑Pierre Sauvage**, **Sir J. Fraser Stoddart**, and **Bernard L. Feringa** for the design and synthesis of molecular machines.  None of the names mentioned in the article were on the shortlist, and the prize fell outside any of the five informal categories the author described.

### Subsequent laureates relevant to the article’s categories  

| Category (as described) | Later Nobel outcome (2016‑2024) | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| **Beat the Reaper** – Goodenough & Whittingham | **2019 Chemistry Nobel** (Goodenough, Whittingham, Akira Yoshino) for lithium‑ion batteries. | Both survived to receive the prize; Goodenough was 97 at the ceremony. |
| **Lifetime‑achievement** – Robert Langer | **2018 Chemistry Nobel** (Langer, Frances Arnold, George Smith) for directed evolution of enzymes. | Langer finally received a Nobel, though for a different area than the author highlighted. |
| **Lifetime‑achievement** – George Whitesides | No Nobel (as of 2024). | Continues to be a highly cited, influential chemist but has not been honoured with a Nobel. |
| **Nobel Classic** – DNA sequencing, bio‑orthogonal chemistry, MOFs, AT‑RP, photoredox | No Chemistry Nobel to date for any of these specific fields.  DNA sequencing (next‑gen sequencing) has transformed biology but has not yet been recognised by the Nobel Committee.  Photoredox catalysis remains a vibrant research area but has not crossed the Nobel threshold. |
| **Biologists – CRISPR** | **2020 Chemistry Nobel** (Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier) for the development of CRISPR‑Cas9 genome editing. | The author’s confidence was correct; the prize arrived four years later, with the third “CRISPR” pioneer, Feng‑Zhang, still not a laureate. |
| **Other biology candidates** – unfolded protein response, nuclear receptors, optogenetics | No Chemistry Nobel yet.  Optogenetics received a **2021 Physiology/Medicine Nobel** (David Julius, Ardem Patapoutian) for sensory receptors, not for optogenetics itself.  Unfolded protein response and nuclear‑receptor biology have not been honoured. |

### Real‑world impact of the highlighted fields  

* **Lithium‑ion batteries** – The 2019 Nobel highlighted the technology’s central role in portable electronics and electric‑vehicle adoption; the industry has grown from a few billion USD in 2016 to > $100 billion annual sales by 2024.  
* **CRISPR** – Following the 2020 Nobel, CRISPR‑based therapeutics (e.g., exa‑cel, Editas, Intellia) have entered Phase III trials; the first CRISPR‑in‑vivo therapy (Luxturna) received FDA approval in 2017, and the first in‑body gene‑editing drug (CTX001 for sickle‑cell disease) received FDA approval in 2023.  
* **Molecular machines** – The 2016 laureates’ work spurred a surge in molecular‑machine research, leading to prototype nanorotors and the 2022 Nobel‑winning “molecular‑machine‑based drug delivery” concept (though not yet a commercial product).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Goodenough & Whittingham will win a Nobel for lithium‑ion batteries**  
  *Outcome:* Correct. Both received the 2019 Chemistry Nobel (with Yoshino).  

- **CRISPR will definitely win a Nobel, timing uncertain**  
  *Outcome:* Correct. The 2020 Chemistry Nobel went to Doudna and Charpentier. The author’s “when” (2016‑2020) was a reasonable estimate.  

- **Bob Langer will eventually be honoured**  
  *Outcome:* Correct. Langer shared the 2018 Chemistry Nobel (directed evolution of enzymes).  

- **No “Holy Cow” breakthrough this year** (i.e., no brand‑new discovery that would be an obvious prize in 2016)  
  *Outcome:* Accurate. The 2016 prize went to a field (molecular machines) that had been developing for decades, not a brand‑new breakthrough.  

- **Photoredox chemistry will become a Nobel‑class field in a few years**  
  *Outcome:* Not yet realized. Photoredox remains influential but has not produced a Nobel laureate as of 2024.  

- **Metal‑organic frameworks (MOFs) will lead to a Nobel**  
  *Outcome:* No Nobel to date; MOFs are widely used in gas storage and catalysis but have not crossed the Nobel threshold.  

- **Bio‑orthogonal chemistry will be recognised**  
  *Outcome:* No Nobel yet; the field continues to be important for chemical biology.  

- **Optogenetics will win a Nobel**  
  *Outcome:* Not yet; the related sensory‑receptor work won the 2021 Physiology/Medicine Nobel, but optogenetics itself remains unawarded.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a concise snapshot of the speculative culture surrounding Nobel predictions and, in hindsight, it correctly identified several future laureates (Goodenough/Whittingham, Langer, CRISPR).  Its limited depth and reliance on informal categories keep it interesting but not essential reading for a specialist.
