# The NIH's Drug Repurposing Program Gets Going (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the NIH's NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) drug repurposing initiative, which was launching with $12.7 million split across nine grants to test abandoned pharmaceutical compounds for new indications. The author expresses skepticism about the program's prospects, particularly questioning the limited funding and challenging disease targets selected.

Key details highlighted include AstraZeneca's failed cancer drug saracatinib being repurposed for Alzheimer's disease by Yale researcher Stephen Strittmatter, with trials planned for 24-person safety studies followed by 159-person Phase IIa studies measuring glucose metabolism as a secondary marker. The author acknowledges the logic of leveraging compounds with established safety profiles but questions whether Alzheimer's—with its history of expensive Phase III failures—was the wisest choice given the limited resources, and suggests the program would be better served targeting diseases with shorter, more definitive clinical readouts. Other compounds mentioned include drugs being tested for schizophrenia, smoking cessation, alcoholism, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, peripheral artery disease, and aortic valve stenosis.

## 2. HISTORY

NCATS' drug repurposing program continued beyond these initial nine grants, expanding to include additional compounds and partnerships. However, the specific outcomes for the compounds mentioned varied considerably:

**Saracatinib (AZD0530) for Alzheimer's**: The Yale trial referenced in the article proceeded as planned. A 2018 Phase II study involving 159 patients with mild Alzheimer's showed that while saracatinib appeared safe and well-tolerated, it failed to demonstrate efficacy on the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints, showing no significant difference from placebo in cognitive or functional measures. No larger Phase III trials were launched, and development for Alzheimer's appears to have been discontinued.

For other early compounds in the program, outcomes were mixed: some progressed to larger studies, others were discontinued at Phase II stages, and a few remained in development for their original or alternative indications. The NCATS program itself continued but faced ongoing scrutiny about its impact and cost-effectiveness, with debates continuing about whether it delivered sufficient clinical or economic value.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author made several predictions and assessments:

• **Prediction that saracatinib's Phase I success wouldn't be impressive** - **ACCURATE**: As expected, the drug passed safety studies but failed in Phase II efficacy testing.

• **Skepticism about the 159-person, 1-year Phase IIa trial's adequacy** - **NOT DIRECTLY VALIDATED BY FAILURE**: The trial proceeded as designed, but its failure doesn't prove whether the design was inadequate or if the drug simply didn't work.

• **Concern that glucose metabolism wouldn't be a useful surrogate marker** - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**: The field's confidence in this biomarker has declined, though this specific prediction wasn't explicitly validated by the trial outcome.

• **Prediction that securing funding for larger Alzheimer's trials would be difficult after limited Phase II results** - **N/A**: The drug failed before this became a practical question.

• **Assessment that other diseases would offer better success probability than Alzheimer's** - **DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE**: Alzheimer's has continued to be extremely challenging clinically, but it's hard to know if the money would have succeeded elsewhere.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

High interest because it captures early-stage translational medicine policy and funding decisions, with the added benefit of knowing the outcomes years later. Provide useful insight into why even well-intentioned translational programs can fail to deliver therapies to patients despite promising theoretical frameworks.
