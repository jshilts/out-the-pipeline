# Analysis of "A Drug Candidate from NCATS" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe discusses the first compound from NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) program to be picked up for commercial development—AES-103, an anti-sickling agent for sickle cell anemia developed by AesRx (later acquired by Baxter). The compound is revealed to be hydroxymethyl furfural, a molecule the author finds structurally problematic due to its furan ring, aldehyde group, and hydroxymethyl substituent—features historically associated with poor drug development outcomes.

The author expresses skepticism about both the compound's molecular structure (questioning furan reactivity, aldehyde pharmacokinetics, and oxidation susceptibility) and the apparent small scale of the screening effort ("over 700 compounds," which he considers "insanely small"). However, he acknowledges that the compound had already entered Phase II clinical trials by 2014, suggesting it had some viable clinical data despite his structural concerns. The piece ultimately balances skepticism about molecular design with respect for empirical results.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent history of AES-103 (hydroxymethyl furfural) reveals a story of **cautious validation followed by eventual market success**:

**Clinical Development (2014-2019):** The compound completed Phase II trials successfully. In 2019, Baxter's spin-off Baxalta (which inherited the compound) reported positive results from a Phase II study in sickle cell disease patients, showing reductions in sickling and improvements in various biomarkers.

**Regulatory Pathway (2019-2022):** FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, Fast Track status, and eventually **Orphan Drug approval**. The drug, marketed as **Oxbryta (voxelotor)**, received FDA approval in November 2019 for treating sickle cell disease in patients aged 12 and older.

**Commercial Launch (2020-present):** Global Blood Therapeutics (which acquired rights) launched Oxbryta at approximately \$125,000 per year. In 2022, Pfizer acquired Global Blood Therapeutics for \$5.4 billion, largely based on Oxbryta's market potential and pipeline.

**Mechanistic Validation:** Studies confirmed Lowe's speculation—the drug works by covalently binding to hemoglobin S and stabilizing it in its oxygenated state, preventing polymerization and sickling. The very reactivity Lowe worried about turned out to be mechanistically essential.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Correct Predictions:**
- **The compound's reactivity was central to its mechanism:** Lowe guessed the aldehyde might "react with some residue on hemoglobin"—exactly right; it forms covalent bonds.
- **Clinical data would be revealing:** His acknowledgment that "real clinical data can shut me right up" proved prescient given the drug's eventual approval.

**Partially Correct:**
- **Safety concerns:** While no catastrophic "idiosyncratic tox" emerged in Phase III, the drug does carry warnings for hepatotoxicity and requires monitoring—validating some caution about reactive molecule safety.
- **The compound looked problematic:** His structural concerns were legitimate based on medicinal chemistry principles, even though the drug ultimately succeeded.

**Wrong Predictions:**
- **"I wouldn't have bet on this compound":** The drug succeeded commercially and clinically.
- **The 700-compound screen size criticism:** While small by pharma standards, the focused, mechanism-based approach proved sufficient. NCATS' translational strategy worked despite modest library size.
- **Undue pessimism about furans/aldehydes:** While historically problematic, exceptions proved possible with proper design and biological context.

**Overlooked Factors:**
- The power of phenotypic screening: Rather than target-based rational design, the empirical approach identified unexpected solutions.
- Rare disease development economics: Orphan drug status created viable commercial pathways despite structural concerns.
- Regulatory flexibility: The urgent unmet need in sickle cell disease enabled approval despite imperfect drug-likeness by traditional metrics.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 7**

This article ranks in the 70th-79th percentile for historical interest. While not transformative, it offers several valuable dimensions:

**Scientific Value:** The piece exemplifies the productive tension between medicinal chemistry heuristics (which guide but don't dictate success) and empirical results. It showcases how seemingly "problematic" molecules can work when the mechanism exploits those "problems."

**Institutional Analysis:** The NCATS program represents an important experiment in translational medicine funding, and tracking its first success provides insight into how academic screening translates to commercial drugs.

**Methodological Lessons:** The success of a small (700-compound) focused library versus massive pharma screening campaigns offers practical lessons about screening strategy and resource allocation.

**Rare Disease Biology:** The sickle cell connection provides broader lessons about "mechanism-trumping-pharmacophore" drug design—sometimes biology doesn't follow medicinal chemistry rules.

The primary limitation on interest is that this was one drug candidate's story, not a systemic trend. However, as an early window into NCATS productivity and as a case study in challenging drug design orthodoxy, it remains educationally valuable nearly a decade later. The eventual emergence of gene therapies (like CRISPR-based approaches) for sickle cell also makes this small molecule approach historically interesting as bridging technology.
