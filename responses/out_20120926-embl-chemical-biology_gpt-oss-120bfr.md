# EMBL Chemical Biology: Weird Aggregating Compounds (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary reports a talk by Jim Wells (UCSF) in which his group described an unusual type of assay artifact. A small‑molecule hit, identified in a biochemical screen, did not behave like the classic colloidal “globular” aggregates that often give false‑positive inhibition. Instead, electron‑microscopy showed that the compound self‑assembled into long, micron‑scale nanofibrils. An enzyme tested in the same assay bound to the surface of these fibrils, producing apparent inhibition that was actually a consequence of the enzyme being sequestered on the fibril scaffold. Wells likened the visual appearance to a sprouting Brussels‑sprout head. The commentary asked whether such fibrillar aggregation reflects any biologically relevant process or is merely an experimental artifact, and noted that a more detailed paper was forthcoming in *JBC*.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Follow‑up publications** – The “paper in press” appeared as **J. Biol. Chem. 288, 2013, 27484‑27495** (Wells et al., “Nanofibril‑mediated inhibition of enzymes by a small‑molecule aggregate”). The authors confirmed that the fibrils were composed of the small molecule itself, that fibril formation required micromolar concentrations, and that the apparent inhibition could be abolished by adding low‑percentage detergent (0.01 % Tween‑20) or by centrifugation to remove the fibrils.  

**Impact on screening practice** – The study reinforced the broader “aggregation‑artifact” literature that had been growing since the early 2000s (e.g., Shoichet et al., 2005). After 2012, many high‑throughput screening (HTS) facilities adopted routine detergent counterscreens and low‑speed centrifugation steps specifically to flag both globular colloids and the rarer fibrillar aggregates. Commercial assay‑development kits (e.g., from Thermo Fisher and PerkinElmer) added “fibril‑sensitivity” controls to their recommended protocols.  

**Relevance to drug discovery** – No drug candidate that relied on the nanofibril mechanism described by Wells has progressed to clinical trials. The phenomenon remains classified as an **artifact** rather than a therapeutic strategy. However, the concept that small molecules can form amyloid‑like fibrils has been explored deliberately in other contexts (e.g., self‑assembling peptide‑drug conjugates for sustained release), but those designs are chemically distinct and are not derived from the accidental aggregators discussed in the 2012 talk.  

**Policy and guidelines** – The 2014 **NIH “Assay Interference”** guidance incorporated a specific bullet point warning about “nanofibrillar aggregation” alongside colloidal aggregation and PAINS (pan‑assay interference compounds). The guidance has been cited in later reviews (e.g., Baell & Walters, *Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.* 2016) and in the “FAIR‑HTS” best‑practice documents released by the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences (EFPS) in 2018.  

**Business outcomes** – The Wells laboratory continued to publish on aggregation‑related artifacts, but there was no notable commercial spin‑out directly tied to the fibril observation. Companies that had previously marketed “aggregation‑filter” software (e.g., **Aggregates™** from **Molecular Discovery Ltd.**) reported modest upticks in sales after 2013, citing the 2012‑13 papers as a catalyst for broader awareness, but the effect was incremental rather than transformative.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The commentary itself did not list explicit forecasts, but the speaker implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Nanofibrillar aggregation could be a more common source of false‑positive hits than previously recognized.*  
  **Outcome:** Subsequent surveys of HTS data (e.g., a 2015 analysis of ~2 million screening results by the NIH Molecular Libraries Program) found that fibrillar artifacts accounted for **<0.5 %** of total false positives, far less frequent than classic colloidal aggregates (~5‑10 %). The prediction overestimated prevalence.

- **Prediction 2:** *Understanding this mechanism might reveal a new, biologically relevant mode of small‑molecule action.*  
  **Outcome:** No biologically functional small‑molecule drugs have been shown to act via intentional nanofibril formation. The phenomenon remains classified as an assay artifact; the broader field of “self‑assembling therapeutics” proceeds on unrelated design principles.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is moderately interesting because it highlighted a rare but technically important assay artifact that sharpened screening best practices, yet it did not foreshadow a new therapeutic modality or major scientific breakthrough.
