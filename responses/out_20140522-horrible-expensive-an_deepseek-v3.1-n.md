# A Horrible, Expensive, and Completely Avoidable Drug Development Mixup (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a critical structural misassignment error in drug development that became public in May 2014. Researchers at Penn State led by Wafik El-Deiry had characterized a compound called TIC10 as a stimulator of the TRAIL pathway, potentially useful against glioblastoma and other cancers. They licensed their patent to Oncoceutics, which began preparing the compound (renamed ONC201) for clinical trials.

However, Kim Janda's group at Scripps discovered that when they resynthesized TIC10, their material was completely inactive. Further investigation revealed that the original Penn State team had incorrectly assigned the chemical structure. The actual active compound was a different isomer, while the structure published and patented by El-Deiry/Oncoceutics had no biological activity. Janda's group licensed their corrected structure to Sorrento Therapeutics, creating a complex patent dispute. The author criticized the inadequate chemical characterization and lack of medicinal chemistry oversight in the original work.

## 2. HISTORY

**ONC201/TIC10 Development Despite Structural Error:**
The compound ONC201 (based on the corrected structure) actually progressed through clinical development successfully despite this early controversy. Fast forward several years, ONC201 (dordaviprone) received FDA orphan drug designation for glioblastoma and showed clinical activity. Oncoceutics continued development with the correct compound structure.

**Oncoceutics Acquisition:**
In August 2020, Chimerix acquired Oncoceutics for up to $123.5 million, specifically noting ONC201's potential in recurrent glioblastoma and other cancers. This acquisition occurred six years after the structural misassignment controversy, indicating the company successfully navigated the patent and development issues.

**Clinical Progress:**
ONC201 advanced to Phase III clinical trials for recurrent glioblastoma. The compound demonstrated efficacy in certain patient populations, particularly those with H3 K27M-mutant gliomas. Clinical data showed durable responses in some patients, establishing the TRAIL pathway mechanism as clinically relevant.

**Patent Resolution:**
While the article suggested potential patent invalidation, Oncoceutics apparently maintained intellectual property rights sufficient to attract significant investment and ultimately a nine-figure acquisition. The exact resolution of patent disputes between Oncoceutics and Sorrento Therapeutics is not publicly documented in detail.

**Broader Industry Impact:**
This case became a widely cited example in medicinal chemistry education and industry training, emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous structural characterization and resynthesis validation before advancing compounds to development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Patent Rights Concerns**: The article predicted major problems with Oncoceutics' patent estate, stating "I don't see any way around it: the El-Deiry patent unambiguously claims the use of one particular compound, and it's the wrong compound." **Outcome**: This prediction proved overly pessimistic. Oncoceutics successfully navigated the patent issues, continued development, and ultimately achieved a $123.5 million acquisition, suggesting they maintained defensible intellectual property.

• **Clinical Consequences**: The article questioned "Plans for the clinical trials of TIC10 are moving forward. I don't see how." **Outcome**: Clinical trials did proceed successfully, with ONC201 reaching Phase III trials and showing clinical efficacy in glioblastoma patients.

• **Company Viability**: The author's tone suggested Oncoceutics faced existential threats from this error. **Outcome**: Despite the serious early misstep, Oncoceutics proved viable enough to advance their compound through clinical development and achieve significant commercial success through acquisition.

• **Sorrento Therapeutics Position**: The article noted uncertainty about Sorrento's licensing position. **Outcome**: Oncoceutics clearly maintained primary development rights, suggesting Sorrento's involvement was either resolved favorably for Oncoceutics or was subsidiary to Oncoceutics' primary position.

• **Methodological Lessons**: The implicit prediction was that this case would serve as a cautionary tale. **Outcome**: Accurate - this case became a well-known example emphasizing rigorous chemical validation in drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addresses a critically important but often overlooked aspect of drug discovery - structural misassignment errors that can derail years of work and millions in investment. While such errors occur more frequently than acknowledged publicly, this case gained unusual visibility and had a surprisingly positive resolution, ultimately validating both the biological mechanism and commercial viability despite the early misstep.
