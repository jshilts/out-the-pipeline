# Pharma and the Health Care Bill: Value For the Money? (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the pharmaceutical industry trade group PhRMA's early involvement in health care reform negotiations, specifically questioning the deal struck and the value obtained for the money spent. The author references Billy Tauzin's role as head of PhRMA during these negotiations and notes his subsequent departure from the position. The piece mentions a Sunlight Foundation report suggesting at least $100 million was spent by the trade group in the process, while acknowledging the author's prediction that the health care bills in their current forms would likely fail. The article raises questions about the return on investment for PhRMA's substantial lobbying efforts during the health care reform debate.

## 2. HISTORY

The political and healthcare landscape evolved significantly after this February 2010 article. Contrary to the author's prediction that the health care bills were "dead," the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law just over a month later in March 2010. The pharmaceutical industry's early engagement strategy proved strategically important, as the final ACA legislation included provisions favorable to PhRMA, including protections against government price negotiations for Medicare Part D drugs and maintaining the ban on drug reimportation.

Billy Tauzin did indeed leave his position as PhRMA CEO in 2010, with his tenure ending that June. The $100 million figure referenced for PhRMA's 2009-2010 efforts was part of a broader strategy that included advertising campaigns supporting health care reform. Subsequent analysis showed the pharmaceutical industry spent approximately $276 million on lobbying in 2009 and 2010 combined.

The ACA's implementation had significant consequences for the pharmaceutical industry. While the law included some concessions such as requiring pharmaceutical companies to provide discounts for Medicare Part D's coverage gap, it also expanded insurance coverage to millions of Americans, potentially increasing pharmaceutical sales. The industry's bet on early engagement appeared to pay dividends in terms of maintaining favorable policy frameworks. However, drug pricing debates continued intensifying over the next decade, leading to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which finally authorized Medicare drug price negotiations - a key provision PhRMA had successfully fought against in 2010.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author stated "I think that the bills, in their current forms, are dead" regarding health care reform legislation.
  - **Outcome**: This prediction was incorrect. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law just over a month after this article was published, becoming one of the most significant healthcare reforms in U.S. history.

• **Implicit prediction/question**: The article questions whether PhRMA got good value for their $100+ million investment in lobbying and negotiations.
  - **Outcome**: From PhRMA's perspective, the investment likely paid off. The ACA maintained favorable policies for the pharmaceutical industry, avoiding government price negotiations and drug reimportation, while expanding the insured population. However, these gains were temporary, as drug pricing reform eventually occurred twelve years later with the Inflation Reduction Act.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important moment in healthcare policy history just before the ACA's passage, offering insight into pharmaceutical industry strategy during landmark legislation negotiations. However, its primary prediction about the legislation's fate was incorrect, limiting its prescient value.
