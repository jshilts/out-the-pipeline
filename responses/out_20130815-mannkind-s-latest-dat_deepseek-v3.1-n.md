# Mannkind's Latest Data (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Mannkind Corporation's latest Phase III clinical trial data for Afrezza, an inhaled insulin delivery system released in August 2013. At the time, Mannkind had been developing this product through a "long, expensive saga" that had consumed billions of dollars without delivering commercial success. The piece notes that while the new data appeared positive and caused a temporary stock price jump, skepticism remained regarding the product's efficacy compared to injected insulin competitors. The author highlights concerns about potential lung function effects (specifically FEV1 measurements and coughing side effects) and questions about whether the HbA1c and fasting glucose results demonstrated clear superiority over existing injected insulin treatments. The article reflects a cautious, wait-and-see attitude, noting that even if approved, the product might face challenges in the marketplace and in securing a major pharmaceutical partner.

## 2. HISTORY

**FDA Approval and Commercial Launch (2014-2015):** Afrezza received FDA approval in June 2014 for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, marking a significant milestone after years of development. Sanofi entered into a licensing agreement with Mannkind in August 2014, with high commercial expectations and substantial upfront payments.

**Commercial Failure and Partnership Collapse (2015-2016):** Despite the approval and Sanofi partnership, Afrezza experienced extremely poor market uptake. Sales remained minimal, failing to gain traction among patients and physicians. The collaboration with Sanofi was terminated in January 2016, just over a year after launch, with Sanofi returning all rights to Mannkind.

**Ongoing Market Challenges (2016-2024):** Mannkind continued marketing Afrezza independently but struggled with persistently low sales and market penetration. The company faced ongoing financial challenges, consistent quarterly losses, and continued cash burn from operations. While Afrezza remained on the market, it failed to capture significant market share or achieve commercial viability as originally envisioned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **FDA Approval vs. Commercial Success:** The article correctly anticipated that Afrezza might gain regulatory approval while facing marketplace challenges. This prediction proved accurate - the drug was approved but failed commercially due to poor market adoption.

• **Lung Function Safety Concerns:** The concerns about pulmonary safety and FEV1 effects did not prevent FDA approval, but contributed to physician hesitancy and limited market acceptance in clinical practice.

• **Partnership Difficulties:** The prediction about potential difficulties finding major partners was partially accurate. Mannkind did secure Sanofi as a partner initially, but the partnership's rapid failure validated the underlying concern about commercial viability.

• **Comparison with Injected Insulin Competitors:** The article's skepticism about Afrezza's competitive positioning against injectable insulin was validated. Superior efficacy was never clearly demonstrated, and physicians largely remained with established injection therapies.

• **Investor Outcome Concerns:** The implied concern about investor returns proved prescient. Despite the 2014 approval creating temporary optimism, the commercial failure led to continued financial struggles and poor long-term returns for investors beyond Al Mann's continued involvement.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates strong analytical foresight regarding the challenges facing novel drug delivery systems even after regulatory approval, accurately predicting the gap between clinical trial success and commercial viability.
