# Why Pfizer?
6 Jan 2009

## 1. SUMMARY

The article argues that Pfizer exemplifies fundamental problems plaguing the pharmaceutical industry, particularly around research productivity at scale. The author contends that massive size correlates negatively with innovation output, noting that Pfizer's internal labs have been "notoriously unproductive" despite the company's resources. The piece critiques Pfizer's reliance on mergers and acquisitions to acquire innovation rather than generate it internally, arguing this approach eliminates productive research organizations and reduces therapeutic diversity. Additionally, the author points to Pfizer's marketing-driven culture as problematic, exemplified by the Exubera inhaled insulin disaster where the company's marketing power led to overconfidence in a product that missed sales targets by roughly 98%. The central thesis is that smaller, competing companies would be more innovative and that Pfizer's strategy of growing through acquisition represents the "opposite of what we need."

## 2. HISTORY

**Pharmacia and Other Acquisitions Era**: In the years following this article, Pfizer's acquisition strategy continued to shape its trajectory. The company had previously acquired Pharmacia in 2003 and Warner-Lambert in 2000, consolidating resources but not necessarily boosting productivity.

**Wyeth Acquisition (2009)**: Just months after this article, Pfizer announced its $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in January 2009, demonstrating continued reliance on the criticized M&A strategy. This acquisition brought some significant products (including Enbrel and Prevnar), but also led to substantial R&D restructuring.

**Lipitor Patent Cliff (2011)**: Pfizer faced the massive revenue loss when Lipitor lost patent protection in 2011, validating the article's concern about "massive coming troubles." The drug had peaked at ~$13 billion annually. The company's response leaned heavily on cost-cutting rather than internal innovation breakthroughs.

**Internal R&D Reorganization**: Throughout the 2010s, Pfizer significantly restructured its R&D operations multiple times, closing several research sites and narrowing therapeutic focus areas, suggesting acknowledgment that scale alone wasn't delivering productivity.

**Successful External Innovation**: Pfizer's most notable recent success came through partnership rather than internal discovery—the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, developed externally and later partnered/commercialized by Pfizer, became one of the highest-revenue pharmaceutical products ever.

**Industry Trends**: The broader pharmaceutical landscape saw continued M&A activity, validating concerns about industry consolidation reducing research diversity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Size vs. Productivity Correlation**: The article predicted that Pfizer's massive size would continue hampering research productivity rather than enhancing it. **Verdict: Largely accurate.** Pfizer's most significant 2010-2020 innovations were largely acquired (Ibrance from Pharmacia, Xeljanz from internal but benefited from earlier acquisitions) or partnered (COVID vaccine), with internal productivity remaining challenging. The company continued restructuring R&D operations through closures and focus-area narrowing.

• **Mergers as Problematic Growth Strategy**: The piece predicted that buying other companies to "work their way out of their troubles" was misguided. **Verdict: Mixed to accurate.** While Pfizer's acquisitions brought important products (Enbrel from Wyeth, oncology drugs from various deals), the fundamental challenge persisted—R&D productivity remained a concern, and patent cliffs (Lipitor, Viagra) continued creating "troubles" that M&A couldn't fully solve.

• **Marketing Overconfidence Leading to Failures**: The Exubera example was presented as evidence that marketing power could lead companies "right over the cliff." **Verdict: Accurate pattern recognition.** While not specific to Pfizer, the broader pattern of marketing-driven overconfidence in pharmaceutical pipelines has remained an industry issue. Pfizer itself avoided another Exubera-scale disaster, but marketing considerations have continued influencing pipeline decisions.

• **Industry M&A Ecosystem Damage**: The prediction that continued M&A would harm industry "ecology" by eliminating productive research organizations and reducing approach diversity. **Verdict: Accurate.** The 2010s saw continued pharmaceutical consolidation reducing the number of independent research entities, though the biotech boom partially offset this by creating new, smaller innovative companies.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient analysis of structural pharmaceutical industry challenges that remained relevant for over a decade. The core thesis—that scale doesn't guarantee research productivity and that M&A can mask rather than solve innovation deficits—aged well and captured enduring tensions between size and nimbleness in drug development.
