# Don't Learn to Science? (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary draws an analogy between Jeff Atwood's "Please Don't Learn to Code" argument and the question of how much science the general public should learn. The author notes that while programming is valuable for some people in specific contexts, it's not universally necessary for everyone—just as most people don't need to become professional plumbers, even if basic awareness is helpful.

The article extends this thinking to chemistry and biology education, questioning the appropriate level of scientific literacy for the average person. While acknowledging that more science knowledge would help people avoid scams and understand health claims better, the author observes that existing basic science education doesn't seem particularly effective. The piece concludes that while extensive chemistry knowledge may not be essential for every citizen, learning science and math builds valuable "mental muscle"—strengthening reasoning abilities that apply broadly, much like physical exercise prepares the body for various daily tasks beyond specific gym routines.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2014 timing of this article predates significant shifts in how society views coding and science education. In the subsequent decade, several contradictory trends emerged:

**Coding Education Growth**: Despite Atwood's warning, the "learn to code" movement expanded substantially. Hour of Code initiatives spread widely in schools, bootcamps proliferated, and many educational institutions integrated coding into standard curricula. However, by 2024, the tech industry experienced significant layoffs and market corrections, suggesting that coding alone wasn't the guaranteed career path it appeared to be during the mid-2010s tech boom.

**Science Education Challenges**: Traditional science education continued facing the same struggles the author identified. Standardized test scores showed persistent gaps in scientific literacy, and surveys still revealed widespread confusion about basic scientific concepts. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2024) highlighted both the critical importance of scientific literacy and the deep inadequacies in public understanding of epidemiology, virology, and statistics.

**Digital Literacy vs. Programming**: Basic digital literacy indeed became more essential than coding proficiency for most people, aligning with the article's suggestion. The ability to navigate technology, evaluate online information, and use productivity software became fundamental life skills.

**Science Communication Evolution**: The need for better public understanding of science became more urgent, driving growth in science communication as a field, though translating complex topics for lay audiences remained challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: More code is not necessarily what the world needs, and coding isn't the solution to many problems
  - **Reality**: While coding skills proliferated, the value proposition proved more nuanced. Many learned coding without becoming professional developers, and low-code/no-code platforms emerged to serve those who needed functionality without deep programming expertise

- **Prediction**: Focus should be on general Internet proficiency before jumping into coding
  - **Reality**: This largely manifested, with digital literacy becoming recognized as essential while specialized coding remained important but not universal

- **Prediction**: Basic science education needed significant improvement before expanding advanced topics
  - **Reality**: This arena saw continued struggle, with foundational gaps persisting despite various reform efforts, culminating in pandemic-era revelations about public scientific understanding limitations

- **Prediction**: Science and math build mental "muscle" much like physical exercise
  - **Reality**: The cognitive benefits of STEM education remained supported by educational research, though debates continued about the most effective pedagogical approaches

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article thoughtfully bridges technology and science education debates, aged relatively well with its moderate stance, and identified persistent challenges in scientific literacy—making it above-average interesting, though not transformative or predictive of the major educational and technological shifts to come.
