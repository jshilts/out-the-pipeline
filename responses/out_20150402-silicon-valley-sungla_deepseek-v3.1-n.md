# Silicon Valley Sunglasses (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the "Silicon Valley mindset" when applied to biotechnology and drug discovery. The author defines the "productive" intersection between tech and biotech as companies like 23andMe and Google's Calico hiring experienced pharmaceutical veterans (Richard Scheller, Robert Gentleman, Art Levinson) who have actually developed drugs before.

The central argument is that drug discovery operates on fundamentally different principles than software development, but Silicon Valley entrepreneurs often mistakenly treat biology as just another optimization problem. This manifests as:

- **The Andy Grove fallacy**: The assumption that understanding human disease should work like designing chips or writing apps
- **The "smart person" fallacy**: The belief that success in tech automatically translates to expertise in biopharma
- **Wrong time horizons**: Expecting biopharma breakthroughs to happen at software-industry speed

Examples cited include:

- **Emerald Therapeutics**: An outsourced lab assay company backed by Peter Thiel that asked why drug development couldn't be as fast as app development, fundamentally misunderstanding that the difficulty of biological experiments isn't just a process issue - the real bottlenecks are "figuring out what assay to run, and what to do with the data once you have it"
- **TechCrunch genomics coverage**: Characterized as having a "1999 vibe" with excessive hype about genomics "killer apps" and unrealistic timelines

The author argues that biology is an "away game" - the inner workings of cells are alien compared to human-designed systems. Expecting software-style exponential growth curves and optimization techniques to apply is "an expensive accident waiting to happen."

## 2. HISTORY

**23andMe**: The drug discovery efforts mentioned did materialize, but with mixed and slower-than-predicted results. 23andMe did develop drug candidates and formed partnerships (notably with GlaxoSmithKline in 2018), but by the mid-2020s hadn't produced any FDA-approved drugs. The company's therapeutic development faced the exact challenge the article predicted: biological complexity and long timelines. Richard Scheller did lead therapeutics R&D, but success remained elusive.

**Google Calico**: Under Art Levinson, Calico did forge partnerships (including with Broad Institute and AbbVie) but took a much more patient, long-term approach than typical Silicon Valley ventures. By the mid-2020s, Calico hadn't produced any FDA-approved drugs targeting aging, though it did advance scientific understanding in aging biology. The company's deliberate, research-heavy approach validated the article's argument that biopharma requires different timelines.

**Emerald Therapeutics (now Emerald Cloud Lab)**: The company persisted but pivoted focus. While it developed automated laboratory capabilities, the outsourced assay business proved harder than anticipated. The "bottlenecks" the article identified - scientific insight rather than assay execution - proved correct. The company's trajectory showed slower growth than the typical tech startup curve.

**Genomics "killer app"**: The TechCrunch prediction didn't materialize quickly. While genomics did produce important developments (CRISPR gene editing, liquid biopsies, improved sequencing costs), the revolution was evolutionary rather than the explosive "killer app" moment predicted. Most genomics applications by the mid-2020s came through painstaking scientific work, not Silicon-Valley-style scaling.

**Policy and investment**: The biotech industry did see continued venture investment, but the article's central warning proved prescient: numerous companies founded by tech entrepreneurs without deep biological expertise failed spectacularly (e.g., Theranos being the most infamous, though not mentioned in article). Many companies learned the hard way that biology really is different from software.

**Clinical outcomes**: Drugs targeting pathways identified through genomics mostly progressed through traditional pharmaceutical channels, with major successes coming from established players who understood the regulatory and clinical trial complexity the article described. While companies like Alnylam (RNAi) and CRISPR Therapeutics achieved breakthroughs, these took 10-20 years, not the quick timelines imagined in 2015.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Silicon Valley's expectation that biopharma would produce "wildly and constantly improving" capabilities at rapidly falling costs following Moore's Law patterns
  - **Outcome**: **Partially correct direction, wrong magnitude and timeline**. While sequencing costs did fall dramatically (following something like Moore's Law), drug development costs actually *increased* from 2015-2025. The median cost to develop a new drug reached over $1 billion, and timelines remained stubbornly long (10-15 years). No biopharma equivalent of Moore's Law emerged.

• **Prediction**: Emerald Therapeutics and similar approaches would find that "it may yet be harder than they're thinking" because "the real bottlenecks are figuring out what assay to run, and what to do with the data once you have it. Can't outsource those."
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. Lab automation companies found scientific insight remained the limiting factor. While cloud labs improved operational efficiency, they didn't solve the core challenge the article identified. Companies that succeeded in drug discovery (like Recursion Pharmaceuticals) paired automation with sophisticated scientific expertise.

• **Prediction**: Genomics wouldn't produce "killer apps" with the explosive pace imagined in the TechCrunch article, and the "wonders-of-the-genome" hype would resemble 1999 dot-com excess
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. While genomics produced valuable tools (liquid biopsies, polygenic risk scores, personalized cancer vaccines), there was no singular "killer app" that instantly transformed medicine. Most applications required years of careful development and validation. The genomics revolution was real but gradual.

• **Prediction**: "Expecting the sorts of behavior that you get from human-built technologies, and expecting the same effects from the techniques that work to optimize them, is an expensive accident waiting to happen"
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. Numerous examples proved this prediction brutally accurate:
    - **Theranos** (2015-2018 collapse): Attempted to treat blood testing like a tech platform and failed spectacularly
    - **Multiple AI drug discovery companies**: Underestimated biological complexity and overpromised timelines
    - **Direct-to-consumer health tech**: Many products failed because biology is harder to "hack" than software

• **Prediction**: Drug discovery requires listening to "people who've done it before" rather than assuming tech success translates to biotech
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. Successful biotech companies generally combined Silicon Valley approaches (data science, automation) with deep pharmaceutical expertise. Companies that failed typically lacked biological domain knowledge, validating the article's emphasis on experience.

• **Prediction**: Biology is an "away game" where human-designed optimization techniques often don't apply
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. Major advances in understanding cellular complexity revealed even more layers of biological sophistication that resist simple engineering approaches. Systems biology, epigenetics, and microbiome research all demonstrated that reductionist "app-like" approaches to biology often fail.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article proved remarkably prescient about the cultural clash between Silicon Valley and biotech. Its specific predictions about Emerald Therapeutics' challenges, the absence of genomics "killer apps" happening quickly, and the general difficulty of applying software-style optimization to biology were all validated by subsequent events. The piece identified fundamental misunderstandings that led to real-world failures (Theranos being the most dramatic example), making it both analytically sharp and practically significant. The article's core insight - that biology is an "away game" requiring different approaches than human-designed systems - became increasingly relevant as more tech entrepreneurs entered biotech, and most learned this lesson the hard way.
