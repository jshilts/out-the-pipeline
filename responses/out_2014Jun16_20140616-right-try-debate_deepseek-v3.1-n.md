# Retrospective Analysis: "Right to Try" - 2014

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine piece by Derek Lowe (from his "In the Pipeline" blog) was a brief commentary on the emerging "Right to Try" debate in the biopharmaceutical industry. The article served primarily as a pointer to BioCentury TV programming that featured both pro and con perspectives on proposed legislation that would allow terminally ill patients to access unapproved experimental medications outside of clinical trials.

The author's main observations were that (1) opinions were sharply divided on this issue, and (2) he didn't foresee these opposing views converging anytime soon. The article was more of a journalistic heads-up about an important industry debate rather than an in-depth analysis of the policy or scientific implications.

## 2. HISTORY

The "Right to Try" movement achieved remarkable legislative success in the years following this 2014 article, though with controversial outcomes:

**Legislative Timeline:**
- **2014-2017:** Forty-one states passed Right to Try laws at the state level
- **2018:** President Trump signed the federal Right to Try Act into law (May 30, 2018)
- **2019-2024:** The law remained in effect, though with limited practical implementation

**Key Implementation Details:**
The federal law allows patients with life-threatening conditions to request access to investigational drugs that have completed Phase I safety testing but have not yet received FDA approval. However, manufacturers are not required to provide these drugs, and the FDA's role was significantly reduced in the approval process.

**Usage Data:**
According to multiple investigative reports and academic analyses, the federal Right to Try law has been used by extremely few patients - estimates suggest only dozens of patients nationwide have accessed drugs through this pathway, far below the hundreds of thousands of terminal patients who theoretically qualify.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions:**
- **"Opinions divide sharply":** ✓ Correct. The debate remained intensely polarized, with patient advocacy groups generally supporting Right to Try while most medical ethicists, FDA officials, and pharmaceutical companies expressed significant reservations about bypassing established safety protocols.
- **"I don't see them converging any time soon":** ✓ Largely correct. Even after federal passage, the fundamental disagreements about patient autonomy versus protection from unproven therapies persisted.

**What the Article Missed:**
- **The rapid legislative success:** The 2014 article appeared during early state-level efforts. The speed and breadth of both state-level adoption (41 states) and federal passage (just 4 years later) was remarkable and perhaps underestimated the political momentum behind patient advocacy groups.
- **The implementation paradox:** While legislative success was swift, actual patient access remained minimal. Pharmaceutical companies proved reluctant to provide investigational drugs outside of clinical trials due to liability concerns, manufacturing constraints, and the potential to complicate ongoing research programs.
- **The complexity of drug access:** The article didn't deeply explore why experimental drugs might not be available - manufacturing limitations, company risk calculations, and the reality that many investigational drugs simply don't work as hoped.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 6/9**

**Rationale:** While the specific "Right to Try" debate was timely and illustrative of broader tensions in drug development, it represents a **mid-to-high interest** topic (60-70th percentile) rather than transformative biotechnology.

**Where it ranks:** This falls in the 6th decile - above routine industry news but below fundamental scientific breakthroughs or transformative technologies. The Right to Try debate was important for understanding the political economy of drug development and patient advocacy, but it didn't fundamentally change the underlying science of drug discovery or the reality that most experimental drugs fail.

**Long-term importance:** Moderate. The debate illuminated enduring tensions between patient autonomy and evidence-based medicine, but the actual Right to Try laws had limited practical impact on most patients or on the biopharmaceutical industry's R&D practices. The story is more significant for what it reveals about political advocacy and regulatory processes than for its direct impact on biotechnology outcomes.

**Interesting, but not revolutionary:** This was an important policy debate that clarified stakeholder positions and revealed the gap between legislative aspirations and practical implementation - valuable lessons, but not paradigm-shifting for biotechnology itself.
