# All Fixed Up (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses the FDA's new programs targeting prescription drug counterfeiting and connects this to the broader debate over drug reimportation from Canada. The author acknowledges that counterfeit drugs containing inert substances like confectioner's sugar are a serious problem that deserves effective solutions.

However, the article's main critique focuses on the pharmaceutical industry trade association PhRMA's strategy of opposing drug reimportation primarily on safety grounds—warning about "contaminated drugs" from Canada. The author argues this approach has two fundamental weaknesses: it avoids addressing the real issue of research costs and the need for pharmaceutical companies to generate sufficient revenue to fund R&D, and it creates a strategic vulnerability. If someone were to "fix" the safety concerns around reimportation, the industry would be left without a persuasive argument, having treated safety as merely an "unfortunate side problem" rather than addressing the economic core of their position.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2004 article, several key developments occurred:

**Drug Reimportation Policy Evolution**: The debate over drug reimportation continued for years. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 had already established the framework, but safety concerns remained a central issue. Major legislative efforts like the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act were proposed multiple times but never passed.

**Safety vs. Cost Focus**: The pharmaceutical industry's safety argument did indeed face the weakness the author predicted. Over time, discussions increasingly acknowledged that both safety concerns and economic considerations were legitimate factors, rather than treating safety as the sole barrier.

**Drug Price Debates Intensified**: In subsequent years, prescription drug costs became an even more prominent political issue. By 2010-2020, drug pricing debates focused more directly on R&D costs, marketing expenses, and international price differences.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"What happens if someone actually fixes it? What's my industry going to be able to say then?"** - This prediction proved prescient. Over time, regulatory discussions evolved to separate safety concerns from economic arguments. When safety measures improved or became better understood, the debate shifted toward more direct discussions of R&D funding and pricing models, exactly as the author anticipated would leave the industry exposed.

• **"There will be more next week on drug costs and research spending"** - This indicated an expectation that the cost vs. research spending relationship would remain a contentious issue. Indeed, this became an increasingly central debate in healthcare policy over the following two decades.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article provides a thoughtful industry insider's perspective on the strategic framing of drug reimportation debates, but its scope is relatively narrow and focused on messaging tactics rather than broader scientific or technological developments.
