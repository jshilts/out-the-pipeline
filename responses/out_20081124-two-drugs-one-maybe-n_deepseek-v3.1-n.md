# Two Drugs in One? Maybe Not. (Nov 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses CombinatoRx, a Cambridge-based company pursuing a "combination therapy" strategy of formulating two existing drugs into a single pill with synergistic effects greater than either drug alone. The company's lead candidate was Synavive (CRx-102), combining low-dose prednisolone (a corticosteroid) with dipyridamole (an anti-clotting agent). CombinatoRx hypothesized this combination could treat osteoarthritis while minimizing prednisolone's blood pressure side effects.

However, the Phase IIb trial definitively failed—Synavive missed its endpoints, showing no statistical advantage over either prednisolone alone or placebo. The failure caused CombinatoRx's stock to drop 72% and triggered layoffs of 65% of its workforce.

The author also raises post-success concerns: even if approved, convincing payers to cover a premium-priced combination of two generic drugs would face reimbursement challenges, similar to Nitromed's experience. A head-to-head trial against separate generic pills might be needed to prove value.

## 2. HISTORY

**Company trajectory**: CombinatoRx's struggles continued after the 2008 failure. In 2010, the company merged with Neuromed Pharmaceuticals, rebranding as **Celator Pharmaceuticals**. This new entity shifted focus to hematologic cancers, particularly developing liposome-encapsulated combination therapies rather than simple dual-drug pills.

**Celator's path**: Celator advanced CPX-351 (Vyxeos), a liposomal formulation combining cytarabine and daunorubicin in a fixed 5:1 ratio for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This represented a more sophisticated formulation strategy than CombinatoRx's original single-pill approach—using liposomes to control drug ratios and pharmacokinetics.

**Approval and acquisition**: CPX-351 received FDA approval in August 2017 for adults with therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. While technically "two drugs in one," this success came from advanced formulation science rather than simple combination therapy. In June 2016, **Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired Celator for approximately \$1.5 billion**, validating the reformulated combination approach—but only after the company had refocused completely and used much more sophisticated delivery technology.

**Market reality**: Vyxeos demonstrated moderate uptake in its niche AML population but didn't achieve blockbuster status, facing competition from venetoclax-based regimens and other therapies. The combination therapy concept succeeded only when it offered clear clinical advantages through sophisticated delivery systems rather than mere convenience.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author suggested convincing insurers to pay premium prices for generic drug combinations would be very difficult (Nitromed comparison)

*Reality*: **Partially validated but nuanced**. CPX-351 successfully commanded premium pricing because it represented genuine innovation—the liposomal formulation provided different pharmacokinetics and improved outcomes rather than just convenience. However, simpler "two in one" combinations without sophisticated delivery systems generally failed to justify premium pricing. The broader prediction about payer pushback proved economically sound.

• **Prediction**: A head-to-head trial against separate generic pills would be required

*Reality*: **Validated for competitive positioning, but not always required for approval**. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly recognized this challenge. When AbbVie developed the triple-combination HCV therapy Viekira Pak, they conducted extensive comparative effectiveness studies against competitors. For CPX-351, the sophisticated delivery system provided a technological moat that justified the combination approach without requiring direct comparison to manually-combined generics.

• **Prediction**: CombinatoRx would face long-term business challenges even if trials succeeded

*Reality*: **Completely validated**. CombinatoRx's entire business model collapsed, leading to merger, name change, and strategic pivot. The company's original thesis of simple drug combinations proved insufficient for commercial success. Only after completely reinventing their approach with advanced delivery technology did they achieve eventual success and acquisition.

• **Implicit prediction**: The "greater-than-sum-of-parts" combination approach faces fundamental scientific and commercial challenges

*Reality*: **Broadly validated**. Most combination therapy success stories post-2008 involved either sophisticated delivery mechanisms (liposomes, nanoparticles) or combinations addressing multi-pathway diseases (cancer, HIV, HCV). Simple combinations of approved drugs largely failed unless they demonstrated clear synergistic mechanisms supported by strong clinical data.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article scores moderately for presciently identifying combination therapy's reimbursement challenges, but its limited scope and company-specific focus reduce broader significance—the core insight applies mainly to the specific case rather than the field's larger evolution.
