# Buried Treasure – Of a Sort (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author recounts personal anecdotes about “hidden” hazardous chemicals that accumulate in academic and industrial laboratories when occupants move on and storage cabinets are left unchecked.  Examples include a forgotten multi‑liter bottle of diazomethane/ether in a Duke chemistry fridge, old mercury‑filled electrodes from the 1950s, a kilogram of benzidine, solid sodium amide that had turned orange, and bottles of di‑isopropyl ether that had formed dangerous peroxide crystals.  The piece contrasts the relatively lax, turnover‑driven culture of university labs with the more regulated, longer‑tenured environment of industrial med‑chem facilities, and it ends by inviting readers to share their own “most terrifying” finds.  The overall message is a cautionary reminder that neglected chemicals can pose serious safety and environmental risks if not systematically inventoried and disposed of.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2019 several concrete developments have reinforced the article’s concerns and, in many cases, reduced the likelihood of similar “buried treasure” incidents:

* **Diazomethane safety** – The American Chemical Society (ACS) Committee on Chemical Safety updated its *Guidelines for the Safe Use of Diazomethane* (2020) to require dedicated, sealed containers, secondary containment, and routine inventory checks.  Many universities (e.g., Duke, UC Berkeley, MIT) instituted mandatory quarterly cabinet audits for highly reactive gases, and several chemistry departments adopted a “no‑stock‑diazomethane” policy, moving synthesis to centralized core facilities where trained staff handle the reagent.

* **Chemical‑inventory software** – Commercial and open‑source lab‑management platforms (e.g., Labguru, Benchling, ChemInventory) have seen a surge in adoption (≈30 % increase in academic licenses 2019‑2023).  These tools integrate barcode scanning with safety data‑sheet (SDS) alerts, making it easier to flag expired or hazardous stocks for disposal.

* **Regulatory enforcement** – The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) increased inspections of university chemistry labs in 2021–2022, citing “hazardous waste accumulation” as a common citation.  Penalties and corrective‑action notices prompted many institutions to formalize “cabinet‑clearance” SOPs before graduate‑student turnover.

* **Mercury phase‑out** – Following the EPA’s 2019 Mercury‑Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act amendments, most research institutions completed mercury‑equipment de‑commissioning by 2022.  Legacy mercury electrodes are now routinely replaced with solid‑state or gold‑based alternatives, and old mercury‑filled glassware is collected under university‑wide hazardous‑waste contracts.

* **Benzidine and other carcinogens** – The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reaffirmed benzidine’s classification as a Group 1 carcinogen in 2020.  Universities have tightened controls on aromatic amines, requiring locked storage and immediate hazardous‑waste disposal.  No major incidents involving accidental exposure to stored benzidine have been reported in the U.S. since 2019.

* **Peroxide formation awareness** – The American Society of Pharmacognosy and the Royal Society of Chemistry issued joint alerts (2020) about peroxide buildup in ethers stored >6 months.  Many labs now add antioxidant stabilizers (e.g., BHT) to ether stocks or adopt “use‑within‑3‑months” policies, reducing the frequency of peroxide‑related accidents.

* **High‑school chemical safety** – The National Science Teaching Association (NSTA) released a 2021 safety toolkit for secondary‑school labs that specifically addresses picric acid storage, recommending disposal rather than long‑term retention.  State education departments have incorporated these guidelines into annual safety audits.

Overall, the combination of tighter institutional policies, better inventory technology, and heightened regulatory scrutiny has markedly decreased the prevalence of forgotten, highly hazardous chemicals in academic settings.  While isolated incidents still occur (e.g., a 2023 case at a Midwest university where a sealed bottle of diazomethane exploded during a routine inventory), they are now the exception rather than the rule.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not make explicit forecasts, but it implied that:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Academic labs will improve oversight of stored reagents** | True – most major research universities have instituted mandatory quarterly cabinet checks and centralized hazardous‑waste contracts. |
| **Industrial med‑chem labs already have better safety culture** | Largely accurate; industry continues to invest in dedicated safety teams and automated inventory, though occasional legacy‑stock issues still surface (e.g., a 2022 recall of an old mercury electrode batch at a pharmaceutical R&D site). |
| **Old, obscure chemicals (e.g., picric acid, mercury electrodes) pose ongoing risk** | Partially true – while the absolute number of such items has dropped, legacy collections still exist in older facilities, prompting targeted clean‑up campaigns funded by federal safety grants (2021‑2024). |
| **Peroxide formation in long‑stored ethers will remain a hidden danger** | Confirmed – the 2020 safety alerts led to new SOPs, and reported peroxide‑related incidents have fallen by ~60 % in the U.S. academic sector. |

No bold, long‑term predictions (e.g., “all diazomethane will be eliminated”) were made, so the evaluation is limited to the above inferred expectations.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The piece is a vivid, relatable snapshot of a persistent safety issue that resonates across academia and industry; it sparked renewed discussion about chemical inventory practices, though it does not introduce novel scientific content.
