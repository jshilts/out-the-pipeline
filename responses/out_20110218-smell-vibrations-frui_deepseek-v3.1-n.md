# Smell The Vibrations? Fruit Flies Might Be Able To. . . (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Luca Turin's vibrational theory of olfaction, which proposes that our sense of smell responds not just to molecular shape and polarity (the dominant theory), but also to molecular vibrations. The piece highlights new experimental evidence from a PNAS paper showing that fruit flies (Drosophila) can discriminate between deuterated and non-deuterated forms of compounds like acetophenone, octanol, and benzaldehyde. Since deuteration preserves molecular shape while altering vibrational spectra, this finding challenges purely shape-based olfaction models. The experiments showed flies exhibited different behavioral responses (attraction vs. aversion) to isotopic forms, and could be trained to distinguish between them—even generalizing the "deuterated scent" concept across different chemical classes. Turin suggests this may involve electron tunneling mechanisms detecting C-H vs. C-D vibrational differences.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2011 article, the scientific community remained divided on the vibrational theory of olfaction, with no clear consensus emerging:

**Research Developments:**
- **Supporting Evidence (2013):** Turin and colleagues published additional work in *PLOS ONE* using drosophila showing similar discrimination abilities with deuterated musk compounds, providing some replication of the 2011 findings.
- **Contradictory Research (2013):** A comprehensive study by Keller and Vosshall published in *Nature Neuroscience* tested human subjects with deuterated odorants and found no evidence of discrimination, suggesting the effect might be species-specific or methodology-dependent.
- **Continuing Debate (2015-2017):** Several research groups attempted to replicate the findings in various organisms, with mixed and often contradictory results depending on the experimental protocols used.

**Technological Impact:** Unlike many biotech developments, this research did not lead to any approved diagnostic or therapeutic products. No FDA-approved drugs or medical devices emerged from this line of investigation. The field of olfaction research continued primarily focused on receptor-ligand shape complementarity models.

**Commercial Adoption:** The vibrational theory did not become widely adopted among scientists or in commercial applications by the perfume or flavor industries. Mainstream olfaction research continues to operate primarily within the shape-based receptor binding paradigm. No significant businesses emerged specifically pursuing vibration-based smell technology.

**Scientific Consensus Status:** As of 2024, the theory remains scientifically controversial rather than broadly accepted. While some researchers continue to explore quantum effects in olfaction, it has not displaced the dominant shape-based theory in mainstream biology or neuroscience textbooks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions about the future trajectory of this research:

• **That the fruit fly findings would extend to other organisms, possibly including humans**: *Result: Mixed* - While the drosophila findings were partially replicated in some insect studies, human studies (particularly the 2013 Keller and Vosshall work) showed no discrimination ability, suggesting this may be species-specific rather than a universal olfaction mechanism.

• **That the field would develop electron tunneling as a viable olfactory mechanism**: *Result: Not realized* - After 13+ years, no robust evidence has emerged for electron tunneling mechanisms in olfaction becoming an accepted part of mainstream biological understanding.

• **That these findings would help explain smell anomalies unexplained by shape-based theories**: *Result: Unclear* - The debate continues about whether such anomalies exist and whether vibration theory actually explains them. No widespread scientific consensus has formed around explaining olfaction anomalies through vibrations.

• **That these findings would gain broader acceptance in the scientific community**: *Result: Not realized* - The theory remains controversial rather than broadly accepted in mainstream olfaction research.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses a genuinely interesting fundamental question in neuroscience about how sensory systems work, and the experimental approach is clever. However, after more than a decade, the research has not led to broader scientific paradigm shifts, practical applications, or clear resolution, limiting its overall long-term importance compared to more impactful biotech developments.
