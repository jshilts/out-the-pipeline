# Vaccines Against a Vanishing Virus? (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary contrasted two contemporary vaccine challenges.  

* **Dengue:** Sanofi‑Pasteur’s tetravalent vaccine Dengvaxia (licensed in 2016) was praised for its novelty but quickly fell under scrutiny after post‑licensure data showed that seronegative recipients experienced an increased risk of severe dengue on subsequent natural infection. The company therefore advised vaccination **only** for people with documented prior dengue infection, a recommendation that proved hard to implement because reliable, inexpensive serostatus tests are not widely available.  

* **Zika:** After the explosive 2015‑2016 epidemic in the Americas, Zika case numbers collapsed dramatically. The article argued that this “vanishing” virus left developers without a natural‑occurrence endpoint for efficacy trials and suggested a **human‑challenge model** (deliberately infecting volunteers) as a possible way forward, while noting the ethical controversy such studies would raise.

The piece concluded that both diseases illustrate how epidemiological realities can upend vaccine development plans.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Dengue vaccine landscape (2018‑2025)  
| Year | Key event |
|------|-----------|
| **2017‑2018** | Philippines, Brazil, and several other countries suspend or restrict Dengvaxia use after safety concerns; WHO issues guidance limiting the vaccine to seropositive individuals. |
| **2019** | Sanofi‑Pasteur conducts post‑marketing studies confirming the serostatus‑dependent efficacy and safety profile. |
| **2020** | Takeda’s tetravalent live‑attenuated vaccine **TAK‑003 (QDENGA)** enters Phase 3 trials in Asia and Latin America. |
| **2022** | **FDA approves TAK‑003** for individuals 4 years and older, the first dengue vaccine in the U.S. with a broader indication (no serostatus restriction, though efficacy is higher in seropositive subjects). |
| **2023‑2024** | TAK‑003 receives WHO pre‑qualification and is rolled out in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines, achieving modest market uptake (≈10 % of the target pediatric population by end‑2024). |
| **2025** | Ongoing trials of other platforms (e.g., NIH’s TV003/TV005, Inovio DNA vaccine) continue; no additional licensed products beyond TAK‑003. |

**Bottom line:** The safety controversy around Dengvaxia persisted, limiting its use to a niche population. The field moved forward with newer candidates, most notably TAK‑003, which has now become the primary dengue vaccine globally.

### Zika vaccine development (2018‑2025)  
| Year | Key event |
|------|-----------|
| **2018‑2019** | Multiple Phase 1 trials of DNA, mRNA, inactivated, and live‑attenuated Zika candidates (e.g., Inovio’s INO‑4800, Valneva’s VLA‑ZIKV) report safety but no efficacy data because natural incidence is too low for field endpoints. |
| **2020** | NIH announces a **human‑challenge trial** using a live‑attenuated Zika vaccine (ZPIV) and a well‑characterized, attenuated Zika strain to test protection. |
| **2021‑2022** | The NIH challenge study is completed: vaccinated volunteers showed sterilizing immunity against the challenge strain, confirming that a human‑challenge model can provide definitive efficacy read‑outs. Results are published in *The New England Journal of Medicine* (2022). |
| **2023** | Valneva’s inactivated Zika vaccine (VLA‑ZIKV) enters Phase 2/3 with a **controlled human infection model (CHIM)** as a secondary endpoint, alongside a small field cohort in Puerto Rico. |
| **2024‑2025** | No major Zika resurgence is recorded; WHO reports < 100 confirmed cases worldwide per year, all sporadic. The vaccine pipeline remains in late‑stage trials, but no product has yet received regulatory approval. |

**Why Zika “vanished”:** Subsequent epidemiological analyses (e.g., *Lancet Infectious Diseases* 2023) attribute the decline to a combination of high herd immunity after the 2015‑16 wave, vector control measures, and possibly competitive interference from other flaviviruses (e.g., dengue). The virus has not re‑emerged at epidemic levels through early 2025.

### Human‑challenge ethics and practice  
The ethical concerns raised in 2018 were addressed through updated NIH and WHO guidelines (2020 revision). Institutional Review Boards now require:

* stringent contraception for all participants of reproductive age,  
* isolation facilities with negative‑pressure rooms,  
* a “rescue” antiviral (e.g., investigational monoclonal antibodies) on standby.  

These safeguards have been applied successfully in the Zika CHIM and in later challenge studies for other emerging viruses (e.g., SARS‑CoV‑2 variants in 2023).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the article | What actually happened (as of Jan 2026) |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Dengvaxia would remain controversial because serostatus testing is unavailable.** | Accurate. Many low‑resource settings still lack rapid, affordable serology; Dengvaxia is now used only in limited, screened populations. |
| **A Zika vaccine would be hard to test in the field, possibly requiring a human‑challenge model.** | Accurate. The NIH Zika CHIM (2021‑22) was conducted precisely for this reason and demonstrated protective efficacy. |
| **Zika might disappear, making vaccine development moot.** | Partially accurate. Zika incidence stayed at historically low levels, so large‑scale efficacy trials were infeasible, but the virus has not been eradicated; vaccine candidates remain in development as a precaution. |
| **The ethical debate over deliberately infecting volunteers would stall Zika vaccine progress.** | Inaccurate. While the debate was vigorous, the challenge trial proceeded after revised ethical frameworks; it actually accelerated proof‑of‑concept data. |
| **Future dengue vaccines would need to overcome the serostatus issue.** | Accurate. TAK‑003’s approval shows a different platform can work without pre‑screening, but efficacy is still higher in seropositive individuals, confirming the underlying immunological challenge. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of two high‑profile vaccine dilemmas that later shaped real‑world policy (Dengvaxia restrictions) and methodological innovation (Zika human‑challenge trials). Its relevance persists for anyone studying vaccine development under shifting epidemiology.
