# Natural Products Continue to Weird Me Out (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights the structural novelty of a natural product called Ivorenolide A, isolated from mahogany tree bark. The compound features an unusual 18-membered ring containing conjugated acetylenes, resulting in a nearly flat three-dimensional structure. The article notes that this compound demonstrates immunosuppressive activity, specifically inhibiting T-cell and B-cell proliferation in vitro. The author emphasizes how such exotic structures from natural sources differ dramatically from typical synthetic compound libraries, illustrating the continued potential of natural products to provide novel chemical scaffolds.

## 2. HISTORY

Ivorenolide A, first reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society in 2013 (not 2012 as the blog post timing suggests - the article was likely discussing a just-published or about-to-be-published paper), was indeed isolated from Khaya ivorensis (African mahogany) bark. Subsequent research has focused primarily on understanding its biosynthesis and exploring its pharmacological potential, particularly its immunosuppressive properties.

However, there is no evidence that Ivorenolide A has progressed to clinical trials or FDA approval in the decade-plus since its discovery. While academic research has continued to investigate macrolide natural products with immunosuppressive activity (such as various compounds in the tacrolimus/rapamycin structural family), Ivorenolide A itself does not appear to have translated into a therapeutic drug. The compound's structural complexity and the well-established challenges of natural product drug development (supply, synthesis, optimization) likely hindered its advancement beyond basic research. The field of immunosuppressants has instead been dominated by better-characterized drugs like tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and newer biologics targeting specific immune pathways.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about the future of Ivorenolide A or natural product research.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3**

This represents a moderately interesting but fairly routine example of natural product discovery - structurally novel compounds with interesting biological activity are regularly discovered from natural sources, and most do not progress to clinical utility. The compound's unusual structure is scientifically noteworthy but not revolutionary.
