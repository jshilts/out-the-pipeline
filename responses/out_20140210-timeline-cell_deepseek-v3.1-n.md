# Cell's 40th anniversary timeline highlights (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an interactive timeline published by the journal *Cell* to mark its 40th anniversary, which presents key papers from the journal's history up through the early 1980s. The posts references several landmark discoveries published in *Cell* that underscore how recently some foundational concepts of molecular and cell biology were established, including the post-translational phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on proteins (1979), the identification of Ras as involved in human cancer (1982), and the discovery that telomeres contain repetitive sequence units (1982). The overarching message is that these sciences are remarkably young, with seminal discoveries occurring relatively recently.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this article's publication, these foundational discoveries catalyzed transformative developments in biotechnology and medicine:

- **Tyrosine phosphorylation (1979)**: This discovery laid the groundwork for understanding cellular signaling networks and led directly to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a major class of targeted cancer therapies. Drugs like imatinib (Gleevec), gefitinib (Iressa), and erlotinib (Tarceva) have become standard treatments for various cancers, generating billions in revenue and dramatically improving patient outcomes. The field of kinase biology expanded into a major therapeutic area with over 50 FDA-approved TKIs as of 2024.

- **Ras oncogene (1982)**: Ras became recognized as the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers (occurring in ~20-30% of all tumors). Despite decades of research, direct Ras inhibitors remained elusive until recently. In 2021, the FDA approved sotorasib (Lumakras), the first direct KRAS inhibitor, representing a major breakthrough after nearly 40 years of effort. Additionally, indirect targeting strategies yielded approved therapies like cetuximab and panitumumab for Ras-pathway related cancers.

- **Telomere function (1982)**: Telomere biology led to the identification of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomeres, discovered by Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984 (Nobel Prize 2009). This work revolutionized understanding of cellular aging, stem cells, and cancer biology. Telomere length emerged as a biomarker for aging and disease risk. The Geron Corporation and other companies explored telomerase-based therapies, with some anti-cancer approaches entering clinical trials.

- *Cell* **journal itself**: The journal maintained its position as a premier venue for high-impact biological research, with its timeline project highlighting the historical importance of rigorous peer-reviewed publication in advancing scientific knowledge.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific predictions, as its primary purpose were retrospective historical documentation of seminal discoveries. The author's implicit message about the youth of molecular and cell biology correctly anticipated that these fields would continue producing major therapeutic advances and scientific breakthroughs well beyond 2014.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

Provides useful historical perspective on foundational biology discoveries, but the article itself lacks forward-looking analysis or novel insights beyond summarizing existing knowledge about well-known scientific milestones.
