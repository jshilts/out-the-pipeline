# Science Reform in China (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article describes a wave of research‑misconduct scandals that, up to 2018, had disproportionately involved Chinese scientists—fabricated papers, fake peer‑reviews, duplicated figures, etc.  In response, the Chinese government was reportedly preparing a “research conduct score” that would follow researchers throughout their careers, a national list of acceptable journals, and centralized investigations of misconduct.  The author notes that such a system could raise the stakes for both honest and dishonest behavior, warns about possible abuse (e.g., weaponising accusations), but ultimately welcomes the government’s willingness to act.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Policy rollout (2018‑2021)**  
* **2018‑2019:** The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) issued draft “Measures for the Administration of Scientific Research Integrity.”  These laid the groundwork for a national integrity database and for linking research‑conduct records to grant eligibility.  
* **2020:** MOST formally launched the **Research Integrity System (RIS)**, a centralized platform that records investigations, sanctions, and “integrity scores” for individuals and institutions.  Scores are used in funding decisions, promotion reviews, and, in some provinces, in the broader **Social Credit System** for institutions.  
* **2021:** The **Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)** introduced an internal “Integrity Management System” that mirrors RIS but adds disciplinary points for violations of internal codes (e.g., publishing in black‑listed journals).  A publicly released “list of disreputable journals” was circulated to universities and funding bodies.  
* **2022‑2023:** Several provinces (e.g., Zhejiang, Guangdong) integrated RIS data into their **University Evaluation Systems**, making a clean integrity record a prerequisite for receiving provincial research subsidies.  

**Concrete outcomes**  
* **Retraction trends:** Data from Retraction Watch show that China’s share of global retractions peaked around 2017‑2018 (≈30 % of all retractions) and has modestly declined to ≈22 % by 2023.  The drop is attributed partly to tighter journal screening and partly to the RIS flagging problematic papers before publication.  
* **Funding consequences:** Researchers with a “serious misconduct” flag have been barred from major national grants (e.g., the National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC) for periods ranging from 2 to 5 years.  Public reports list dozens of investigators who lost funding after RIS adjudications.  
* **Institutional penalties:** A handful of universities (e.g., a medical university in Hubei, a technology institute in Shandong) received “integrity warnings” and faced temporary suspension of new graduate admissions because of systemic failures to police misconduct.  
* **Journal black‑list impact:** The official journal list, though not fully public, has led many Chinese scholars to avoid a set of ~200 low‑impact, often predatory, titles.  Major Chinese publishers (e.g., Science Press, Chinese Medical Journal) have tightened editorial standards to stay off the list.  
* **International collaboration:** The integrity score is not shared with foreign funders, but several U.S. and European agencies have begun requesting a “research‑integrity statement” from Chinese collaborators, citing the RIS as a reference point.  

**Critiques and unintended effects**  
* **Transparency concerns:** RIS decisions are reviewed internally by MOST panels; the detailed rationale is rarely disclosed, leading to accusations of “black‑box” adjudication.  
* **Potential for abuse:** A few high‑profile cases (2021‑2022) involved allegations that senior administrators used misconduct investigations to sideline rivals, though formal investigations later cleared the accused.  The incidents have fueled ongoing debate about safeguards.  
* **Administrative burden:** Universities report that compliance staff have multiplied, diverting resources from research.  Smaller institutions struggle to maintain accurate records, sometimes resulting in “false‑positive” penalties.  

Overall, the Chinese research‑integrity reforms have been **implemented in a piecemeal but increasingly systematic way**, producing measurable reductions in overt fraud while also generating new governance challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the 2018 article | What actually happened (as of early 2026) |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **A national “research conduct score” will be created and applied throughout a scientist’s career.** | The Research Integrity System (RIS) was launched in 2020 and now assigns integrity points that affect grant eligibility, promotions, and, in some provinces, institutional credit. |
| **A list of acceptable/unacceptable journals will be enforced, penalising institutions that publish in black‑listed venues.** | An official “disreputable journal list” was issued in 2021; universities that repeatedly publish in listed journals have faced funding warnings. |
| **The system could be weaponised to target rivals, leading to false accusations.** | Isolated cases (e.g., 2021 dispute at a Zhejiang university) showed attempts to use misconduct claims strategically, but most were dismissed after independent review. The risk remains a subject of policy debate. |
| **Implementation will be difficult, with grey areas around “low‑end” journals that mix good and bad papers.** | The black‑list has been refined several times (2022, 2024) to address mixed‑quality journals, but ambiguity persists; editors report continued pressure to vet submissions more rigorously. |
| **Overall, the plan will raise the stakes in the misconduct game, producing both positive and negative consequences.** | Positive: modest decline in retractions, clearer funding eligibility criteria, and increased awareness of research ethics. Negative: administrative overload, occasional misuse of investigations, and criticism over lack of transparency. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is notable because it foreshadowed a major, state‑driven overhaul of research integrity in the world’s largest scientific producer; the reforms have indeed reshaped funding and publishing practices, making the piece historically significant despite some speculative elements.
