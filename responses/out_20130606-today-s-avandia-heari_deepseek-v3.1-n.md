I appreciate your interest in having me analyze historical biotechnology articles. However, this prompt template describes a very specific analytical task that requires:

1. **Access to the referenced article content** - The template shows only the preface and metadata ("Today's Avandia Hearing at the FDA, 6 Jun 2013") but not the actual article text that would appear after "--- The article ---"

2. **Historical fact-checking and research** - The template explicitly asks me to "research what happened subsequent to the article being published" and evaluate predictions against actual outcomes, which requires real-time access to current medical database, FDA records, and clinical trial results.

3. **Accurate historical analysis** - To properly evaluate what happened with Avandia after June 2013, I would need verified information about:
   - FDA regulatory decisions
   - Subsequent clinical trial outcomes
   - Market impact and patient outcomes
   - Long-term drug safety data

**Without the actual article content and without reliable access to verify historical developments**, I cannot provide the accurate, evidence-based analysis this template requests. Giving speculative responses about medical and regulatory outcomes would risk spreading misinformation, which contradicts both the template's instructions and my design principles.

If you have the complete article text and would like me to help structure an analysis framework or discuss the analytical approach, I'd be happy to assist. Otherwise, I should defer to sources that can provide properly researched historical context.
