I need to clarify that while I'd be happy to analyze a Science Magazine article about the biotechnology industry, the text you've provided appears to be a blog post or commentary about Vani Hari ("Food Babe"), not an actual Science Magazine article about biotechnology. 

What you've shared seems to be from a chemistry blog discussing:
- A "Food Babe" who acts as a menu consultant for Chick-Fil-A
- Her alleged chemistry misunderstandings
- A fundraising campaign to send her to chemistry classes
- General frustration about anti-science messaging in food discourse

This doesn't appear to be a Science Magazine article about biotechnology industry developments, predictions, or analysis.

Could you please:
1. Share the actual Science Magazine article you'd like me to analyze, or
2. Clarify if you'd like me to analyze this specific blog post about Food Babe instead?

I want to make sure I'm analyzing the content you intended rather than proceeding with the wrong assumption about what needs to be evaluated.
