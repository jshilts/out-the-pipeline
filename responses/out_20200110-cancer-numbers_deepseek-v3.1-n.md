# Cancer By the Numbers (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes a comprehensive NEJM paper examining 40 years of cancer incidence and mortality data across multiple cancer types. The article highlights how different cancers show distinct patterns when comparing how often they occur versus how often they kill patients.

Key patterns identified include: Hodgkin's lymphoma (steady incidence, declining mortality indicating better treatment); CML (steady incidence with abrupt mortality decline after Gleevec's introduction in late 1990s); lung cancer (declining both incidence and mortality, tracking smoking reduction with ~30 year lag); stomach cancer (both rates declining due to decreased H. pylori infections and lifestyle changes); cervical and colorectal (both declining for mixed reasons including screening).

The article identifies thyroid cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma as showing sharply rising incidence rates but stable mortality - suggesting substantial overdiagnosis rather than real increases. Breast and prostate cancer present complex patterns mixing true incidence, overdiagnosis from screening (mammography and PSA testing respectively), and therapeutic advances.

The author emphasizes that while overall cancer incidence data can be misleading due to overdiagnosis, mortality has been consistently declining since 1990 across all categories - a reliable endpoint since death is unambiguous.

## 2. HISTORY

**Imatinib (Gleevec) Evolution**: The 1990s mortality drop for CML that the article celebrates continued. Imatinib revolutionized CML treatment, transforming a previously fatal disease into a chronic condition managed with daily oral medication. Long-term follow-up data (2011, 2018) confirmed sustained efficacy with 10-year survival rates exceeding 80%, compared to historical 5-year survival around 30%. This success validated kinase inhibitor approaches and spawned subsequent generations of more potent BCR-ABL inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) for resistant cases or improved tolerability.

**Lung Cancer Advances**: Additional therapies beyond smoking reduction that were hinted at in the article became more concrete. Immunotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors like pembrolizumab) and targeted therapies (EGFR inhibitors, ALK inhibitors, ROS1 inhibitors) for molecularly-defined subsets changed advanced lung cancer management, leading to sustained improvements in mortality beyond what incidence decline alone would predict. These were complemented by improved staging, surgical techniques, and radiation oncology advances.

**Thyroid, Kidney, and Melanoma Overdiagnosis**: Recognition of overdiagnosis in these cancers grew within professional communities. For thyroid cancer, active surveillance for low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinomas became an accepted alternative to immediate surgery among endocrinologists and surgeons. For kidney cancer, understanding of indolent small renal masses led to increased use of active surveillance or thermal ablation rather than radical nephrectomy. For melanoma, improved understanding of biopsy interpretation reduced but did not eliminate overdiagnosis, particularly for borderline lesions.

**Screening Debates and Revisions**: PSA screening recommendations were de-emphasized or discouraged by major guideline organizations (USPSTF 2012, reversed somewhat in 2018 for shared decision-making). Data showed PSA screening reduced prostate cancer mortality modestly but at high cost of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Mammography age-specific and frequency recommendations evolved toward more nuanced approaches recognizing competing risks, with some organizations suggesting biennial rather than annual screening and later starting ages for average-risk women.

**Colorectal Screening Technology**: Colonoscopy uptake increased. Non-invasive screening options expanded beyond colonoscopy to include FIT testing at home. Liquid biopsy approaches for early cancer detection grew, with DNA-based blood tests for multiple cancer types undergoing prospective clinical trials, though with ongoing concerns about false positives and appropriate follow-up.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made the following implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"New therapies seem to be making lung cancer mortality decrease even more than the incidence rates would have predicted"** - **PREDICTION SUPPORTED**: Immunotherapy and targeted therapies for lung cancer became standard of care and unequivocally improved survival beyond smoking reduction effects alone. Multiple drugs received FDA approval post-2020 with demonstrated survival benefits in randomized trials.

• **"Arguing about these matters has been intense [...] but there seems little room to argue that both breast cancer and prostate cancer are indeed overdiagnosed"** - **PREDICTION SUPPORTED**: Overdiagnosis of both cancers became more widely accepted in the medical community. Formal quantification studies showed 15-25% of screen-detected breast cancers and roughly 20-50% of PSA-detected prostate cancers represent overdiagnosis. This led to revised screening guidelines emphasizing shared decision-making and less aggressive approaches.

• **"There are an awful lot of people in the business trying to make sure that [mortality] goes down even further"** - **PREDICTION SUPPORTED**: Cancer mortality continued its downward trend across major categories due to combination of prevention (particularly continued smoking reduction), earlier detection where appropriate, and therapeutic advances including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and improved supportive care enabling more intensive treatment.

• **Implicit: Screening-driven incidence artifacts will continue complicating interpretation** - **PREDICTION SUPPORTED**: Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) blood tests emerged as a major new screening paradigm with similar concerns about overdiagnosis and appropriate management of screen-detected findings. Liquid biopsy technologies advanced but faced questions about lead-time bias, cost-effectiveness, and appropriate use in average-risk populations.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrated sophisticated understanding of cancer epidemiology and provided durable insights about how to interpret incidence versus mortality data - lessons that remained relevant and became even more important as multi-cancer screening technologies emerged. The caution about overdiagnosis was prescient and increasingly validated by subsequent research, though this remains an underappreciated problem in public understanding.
