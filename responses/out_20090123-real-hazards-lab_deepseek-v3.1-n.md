# The Real Hazards of the Lab (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses two laboratory fatalities that occurred around early 2009. The first incident, widely covered at UCLA, involved a research assistant who died after a fire caused by tert-butyllithium (t-BuLi), a pyrophoric reagent that ignites spontaneously in air, while wearing flammable clothing. The second fatality, mentioned with limited detail, involved inhalation exposure to trimethylsilyl diazomethane—a reagent whose hazards can be delayed, with severe lung injury developing hours after exposure despite minimal initial symptoms. The author emphasizes that such accidents are largely preventable through rigorous safety planning: rehearsing emergency responses (locating safety showers and appropriate fire extinguishers), using proper ventilation, and maintaining respect for hazardous materials. The piece argues that while lab work carries inherent risks, informed preparation and strict protocols can dramatically reduce preventable incidents.

## 2. HISTORY
**UCLA fatality specifics:** The victim was Sheri Sangji, a 23-year-old research assistant, fatally injured on December 29, 2008, when air-exposed t-butyllithium ignited her synthetic sweater, causing severe burns over nearly half her body; she died 18 days later. The case triggered extensive investigations, criminal charges, and regulatory reforms:
- **Criminal charges:** Chemistry professor Patrick Harran faced felony charges (after plea negotiations, charges were dropped in 2014 upon satisfying community service and financial conditions).
- **OSHA penalties:** UCLA was initially fined nearly $32,000; it settled with Cal/OSHA in 2012, agreeing to expand lab safety programs.
- **UCLA response:** The university implemented comprehensive reforms, significantly strengthening laboratory safety infrastructure, training, and oversight.
- **Broader impact:** Heightened national attention to academic lab safety led to increased scrutiny by funding agencies (NIH, NSF), tightened lab safety standards at many institutions, and greater emphasis on personal protective equipment (PPE) policies (including restrictions on flammable clothing) and mandatory safety training.
- **diazomethane hazards:** Trimethylsilyl diazomethane and diazomethane itself remain recognized inhalation hazards with delayed toxicity; safe-handling protocols (e.g., dedicated containment and ventilation) are now standard in labs using diazo compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"always think 'OK, what's the worst thing that can go wrong with this reaction?'"**: This advice remains foundational in lab safety culture, codified through Hazard Risk Assessments and Job Safety Analyses in industrial, academic, and government labs.
- **"know where the nearest appropriate [fire extinguisher] is"**: Institutional safety programs now mandate training on extinguisher locations and classes, as well as hands-on training with safety showers/eyewashes.
- **"rehearse what to do beforehand"**: Standard practice today through routine drills and scenario-based training.
- **Dangerous reagents remain dangerous**: t-BuLi still requires careful handling under inert atmosphere, while diazo compounds require specialized containment and ventilation—no breakthrough has eliminated these inherent hazards.
- **Policy emphasis**: Regulatory and institutional emphasis is now much stronger on PPE policies, training requirements, and documented hazard reviews, partially in response to incidents like those described.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article directly catalyzed major reforms in academic laboratory safety, influenced criminal proceedings against a principal investigator, and sparked lasting changes in regulatory oversight and institutional safety cultures. Its relevance extends beyond chemistry to broader EHS practices in research environments.
