# GlaxoSmithKline's CEO on the Price of New Drugs (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses GlaxoSmithKline CEO Andrew Witty's 2013 remarks challenging the "$1 billion per drug" cost myth. Witty argued that this figure represents an industry average inflated by the high cost of drugs that fail in late-stage development, particularly the burden of paying for failed candidates. He claimed GSK had improved R&D efficiency—reducing late-stage failures and boosting returns by about 30% over the preceding 3-4 years through research reforms—and suggested this efficiency gain could enable lower drug pricing.

The piece also references supporting analyses (from Forbes and a Deloitte/Thomson Reuters study) that estimated the average cost at roughly $1.1 billion when accounting for failures, with the industry barely covering its cost of capital (an IRR of around 7.2% in 2012). The author remains cautious, questioning both whether GSK has genuinely turned a corner and whether efficiency gains would actually lead to lower prices. He notes that the pharmaceutical market lacks classical price sensitivity due to few competitors in therapeutic niches, non-negotiable demand from patients and healthcare systems, and government price controls. He also points out that GSK's large investment in Sirtris appears to be headed for the "sunk cost" pile.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication in March 2013, subsequent events tempered Witty's optimistic framing:

- **Industry R&D returns continued to stagnate or decline**: The trend of marginal returns persisted in the following years. Later analyses (including subsequent Deloitte studies and reports from groups like the Centre for the Study of Drug Development) showed that average capitalized costs per approved drug generally remained high and often exceeded the figures cited in 2013.

- **GSK's pipeline and performance mixed**: GSK experienced both successes and significant setbacks in the years immediately following 2013. The touted efficiency gains did not immediately translate into a sustained surge in approvals or pricing reductions. The Sirtris investment referenced in the article proved to be largely written off, underscoring the persistent risk of costly late-stage failures. By the mid-2010s, GSK faced criticism over productivity, leading to pipeline reshaping and restructuring of R&D activities.

- **Political and market pressures on pricing intensified**: Instead of broad price reductions driven by R&D efficiency, the subsequent decade saw escalating political and payer scrutiny over drug prices, especially in the United States, alongside the rise of high-cost specialty medicines and biologics. Pricing became increasingly tied to outcomes and value frameworks (e.g., ICER assessments), rather than cost-plus models.

- **No widespread downward price trend from efficiency**: The broader industry did not see aggregate drug prices fall as a result of measured R&D efficiency improvements. Instead, prices for many new therapies—particularly in oncology, rare diseases, and immunology—rose, often substantially, partly because the underlying science advanced into modalities with higher marginal production costs and greater complexity.

- **Emergence of high-cost therapies and gene/cell therapies**: Post-2013 witnessed the arrival of ultra-high-cost curative or durable therapies (e.g., CAR-T, gene therapies), where pricing often exceeded $1 million per patient, further anchoring high-price expectations and shifting payer and policy focus toward reimbursement models and outcomes-based agreements rather than simple cost-driven price cuts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article includes several explicit or implied predictions and assessments. Here is how they compared to subsequent developments:

- **Prediction**: Andrew Witty's assertion that improved R&D efficiency could and would lead to lower drug prices.  
  **Outcome**: Not realized. R&D costs and returns remained a major challenge, and industrywide average prices did not decline due to efficiency gains; instead, prices for many new therapies increased.

- **Prediction**: Witty's claim that GSK had improved late-stage failure rates and therefore could reduce development costs.  
  **Outcome**: Mixed. While some individual programs succeeded, GSK's overall R&D productivity faced ongoing scrutiny; the Sirtris example highlighted that costly failures continued. Efficiency gains were partial, inconsistent across therapeutic areas, and did not fundamentally alter the risk profile of drug development.

- **Prediction**: The author's caution that the innovative drug market lacks price sensitivity and that companies have limited incentive to cut prices.  
  **Outcome**: Broadly accurate. Payers and patients remained willing to pay high prices for meaningful health gains, and government interventions (e.g., Medicare negotiation, international price referencing) did not lead to substantial across-the-board price decreases in the innovative sector.

- **Prediction**: The author's suggestion that low-hanging fruit in drug discovery was diminishing and that harder targets would make it difficult to sustain or improve success rates.  
  **Outcome**: Largely accurate. As drug discovery moved toward more complex diseases and targets (e.g., neurodegeneration, fibrosis, and novel oncology pathways), attrition rates remained stubbornly high, despite advances in translational science and trial designs.

- **Prediction**: The Deloitte/Thomson Reuters observation that industry R&D was barely covering its cost of capital.  
  **Outcome**: Continued relevance. Numerous follow-up studies in the subsequent decade reinforced that many large pharma R&D portfolios delivered returns near or below the cost of capital, keeping pressure on portfolio prioritization and external innovation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This piece reflects a recurring debate about R&D costs and pricing in pharma, but it did not anticipate the subsequent rise of curative therapies, escalating political scrutiny, or sustained high prices. The central efficiency-versus-pricing argument proved largely academic, as the market evolved toward value-based pricing and high-cost modalities rather than lower prices from improved success rates.
