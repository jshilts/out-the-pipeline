# AstraZeneca Shuffles the Top Cards (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary notes that AstraZeneca’s chief executive, David Brennan, was leaving the company under a cloud of speculation about a large severance package.  The author argues that the departure was unsurprising because AstraZeneca’s drug pipeline had been weak for years, with few late‑stage candidates to replace a declining portfolio of legacy products.  A chart (referenced but not reproduced) allegedly showed flat or falling revenue from existing medicines and a lack of clear “next‑generation” launches.  The piece also draws a parallel with Eli Lilly, suggesting that both firms faced similar, near‑term revenue pressures.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Leadership change** – Brennan stepped down in April 2012.  In October 2012 Pascal Soriot was appointed CEO and began a strategic shift toward oncology, immunology, and precision medicine.

**Pipeline turnaround** – The “pipeline problem” cited in 2012 was largely resolved over the next decade:  

* **Oncology** – Tagrisso (osimertinib) received FDA approval in 2015 for EGFR‑mutated non‑small‑cell lung cancer and became a blockbuster (> $5 bn annual sales by 2020).  Imfinzi (durvalumab) was approved in 2017 for lung and bladder cancers, and Lynparza (olaparib) (co‑developed with Medivation) received approval in 2014 for BRCA‑mutated ovarian cancer.  These agents shifted AstraZeneca’s revenue mix from cardiovascular/respiratory drugs to oncology.  

* **Respiratory & cardiovascular** – Existing blockbusters such as Crestor and Symbicort declined as patents expired, but the company introduced newer agents (e.g., Brilinta, Farxiga – the latter a SGLT2 inhibitor launched after the 2015 acquisition of Medivation’s assets).  

* **Financial performance** – After a trough in 2013 (revenue ≈ $22 bn, net loss), AstraZeneca posted consistent growth from 2015 onward, reaching ≈ $37 bn in revenue by 2022, with a market‑cap increase from ~ $70 bn (2012) to > $200 bn (2023).  

**Business moves** – The firm divested its consumer‑health division (acquired by GSK in 2015) and focused R&D spending on high‑margin biologics.  Partnerships (e.g., with Daiichi Sankyo for trastuzumab biosimilar, with Merck for immuno‑oncology combos) expanded the pipeline without large internal cost.

**Eli Lilly comparison** – Lilly also struggled in the early 2010s but later revived its pipeline with drugs such as Trulicity (2014), Verzenio (2020), and the GLP‑1/GIP agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro, 2022), which became a multi‑billion‑dollar product.  Both companies thus moved from “pipeline drought” narratives to sustained growth driven by specialty biologics and metabolic medicines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
* **Prediction in the article:** *AstraZeneca’s pipeline “has major problems … and no obvious fixes … that won’t take years of sustained effort.”*  
  *Outcome:* The “years of sustained effort” materialized.  Within five years (by 2017) the company had three FDA‑approved oncology agents that generated blockbuster revenues, effectively fixing the pipeline gap.  

* **Implicit prediction:** *Revenue from existing drugs would continue to decline without new launches.*  
  *Outcome:* Legacy revenues did fall, but new launches more than compensated, leading to net revenue growth from 2015 onward.  

* **Implicit comparison to Eli Lilly:** *Both firms would face a rough near‑term future.*  
  *Outcome:* Both companies experienced short‑term earnings pressure (2012‑2014) but subsequently rebounded with strong specialty‑drug pipelines, contradicting the notion of a prolonged downturn.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **8/10**  
The article captures a pivotal leadership moment and correctly flags a pipeline crisis that spurred a strategic overhaul; the subsequent turnaround makes it a useful case study in how executive change can precede a successful R&D refocus.
