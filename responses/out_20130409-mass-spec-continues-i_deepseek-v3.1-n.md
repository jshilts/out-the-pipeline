# Mass Spec Continues Its Conquests (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary highlights the expanding applications of mass spectrometry in drug discovery, focusing on a 2013 *Angewandte Chemie* paper demonstrating label-free MALDI-based screening for protein post-translational modifications. The researchers developed an assay for SIRT1 deacetylase activity using a 16-mer histone H4 peptide substrate, detecting deacetylation directly without fluorescent labels—addressing known artifacts in fluorescence-based sirtuin assays. The team screened ~5,500 natural product compounds (pooled 5-30 compounds per well) and identified several micromolar SIRT1 inhibitors, primarily useful as tool compounds. The assay could also run in reverse to detect acetylation inhibitors. The author notes that while similar mass spec approaches existed in patents and prior literature (including Sirtris patents from 2009 and earlier Northwestern work), this paper demonstrated practical throughput and reproducibility on realistic substrates, advancing label-free screening technology.

## 2. HISTORY

Mass spectrometry has indeed continued expanding in drug discovery since 2013, though with mixed outcomes in the specific areas discussed:

**SIRT1/Sirtuin Drug Development**: The field experienced significant turbulence. Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, acquired by GSK in 2008 for $720M, focused heavily on SIRT1 activators including resveratrol derivatives. However, subsequent clinical trials largely failed to demonstrate efficacy, and GSK essentially shut down Sirtris's research programs by 2013-2015 amid reproducibility concerns and lack of clinical benefit. 

**Drug Approvals**: No SIRT1-targeting drugs have achieved FDA approval for the metabolic or aging-related indications originally envisioned. Some sirtuin research shifted toward oncology applications, but clinical success remains limited.

**Mass Spectrometry Adoption**: MALDI and other mass spec techniques became increasingly standard in drug discovery workflows, particularly for label-free screening and post-translational modification analysis. Fragment-based drug discovery using mass spec grew significantly post-2013, with companies like Astex, Vernalis, and others employing similar approaches.

**Industry Impact**: While the specific natural product hits described likely didn't advance to drugs, the broader approach of label-free mass spec screening gained traction. Companies increasingly adopted mass spec for fragment screening, especially for protein-protein interactions and challenging targets where traditional assays struggled.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's prediction that "this might be a very useful technique for screening a fragment library"**:
- **Correct direction**: Fragment-based drug discovery using mass spectrometry did expand significantly after 2013
- **Implementation**: MALDI-based fragment screening became one of several mass spec approaches (along with native MS, HDX-MS) adopted by pharmaceutical companies
- **Reality**: While useful, it didn't become the dominant fragment screening method—surface plasmon resonance, NMR, and crystallography remained more common for primary screening

**Authors' speculation that assay conditions would be "useful for a whole range of protein-modifying targets"**:
- **Confirmation**: Mass spec-based assays for PTMs (phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation) became standard tools
- **Limitation**: Throughput and cost kept many applications in specialized rather than high-throughput settings

**Implicit prediction that SIRT1/Sirtuin field would advance significantly** (given the prominent role of Sirtris and the assay's context):
- **Contrary outcome**: Instead of breakthrough drugs, the field saw clinical failures, reproducibility issues, and decreased investment
- **Broader mechanism**: Sirtuin modulation as therapeutic strategy largely failed to deliver on early promise

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article demonstrates solid technical foresight about mass spec methodology advancement, and the SIRT1/assay context provides cautionary historical value from an industry perspective that invested heavily but saw limited returns.
