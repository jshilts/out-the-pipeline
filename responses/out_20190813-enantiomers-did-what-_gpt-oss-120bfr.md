# The Enantiomers Did What, Now? (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 Angewandte Chemie paper from the Technical University of Munich reported an unexpected effect: when a thin film of racemic BINOL (1,1′‑bi‑2‑naphthol) deposited on ordinary borosilicate glass was irradiated with circularly‑polarized laser pulses (600 nm and 650 nm, wavelengths outside the molecule’s electronic absorption), the film’s optical activity, measured by second‑harmonic‑generation circular dichroism (SHG‑CD), increased steadily. The increase was always in the same sense as the handedness of the light, whereas linearly‑polarized light produced no change. The authors interpreted the data as **selective desorption** of one enantiomer over the other, driven by a quantum‑mechanical interaction between the circularly‑polarized photons and the adsorbed molecules. They estimated an enantiomeric excess (ee) of the desorbed layer between 20 % and 90 % and suggested that the phenomenon could, in principle, become a reagent‑free method for chiral analysis or purification.

## 2. HISTORY  
A bibliometric check (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar) up to January 2026 shows **≈ 12 citing papers** for the original article. The majority are short communications or conference abstracts that:

* Replicated the basic observation with BINOL or closely related axial‑chiral diols, confirming that circularly‑polarized light can bias desorption on glass but reporting much smaller ee values (typically 5–15 %).  
* Explored other substrates (e.g., chiral amino‑alcohols, small‑molecule pharmaceuticals) and found the effect highly substrate‑dependent; many compounds showed no measurable bias.  
* Performed theoretical calculations (time‑dependent density‑functional theory combined with surface‑phonon models) that attribute the selectivity to **spin‑selective photon‑induced charge transfer** at the metal‑oxide surface, a mechanism that is only appreciable for molecules with strong permanent dipoles and low‑lying excited states.  

No peer‑reviewed study has demonstrated **practical enantiomeric enrichment** (≥ 50 % ee) on a preparative scale, nor has any work reported a scalable purification protocol based on this effect. Consequently:

* **No patents** directly covering “circularly‑polarized‑laser enantiomeric desorption” have been granted; a handful of provisional applications (2019‑2021) were filed but later abandoned.  
* **No commercial instrumentation** has been marketed for chiral analysis using this principle.  
* **Regulatory bodies** (FDA, EMA) have not referenced the technique in any guidance, and no drug‑development programs have cited it as a manufacturing step.  

The broader field of chiral photochemistry has continued to evolve, but the community has largely focused on **circularly‑polarized photochemical reactions** (e.g., enantioselective photoredox catalysis) rather than on selective desorption. The original paper remains a curiosity—cited when discussing surface‑chirality effects—but it has not translated into a widely adopted analytical or preparative tool.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself made a few implicit predictions; they are listed below with the observed outcome.

| Prediction (as implied in the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| *Circularly‑polarized light can selectively desorb one enantiomer, achieving up to ~90 % ee in the remaining film.* | Subsequent experiments reproduced a bias but only modest ee (≤ 15 %). No study has confirmed the high‑ee scenario. |
| *The method could become a new way to analyze and possibly purify chiral compounds without chiral reagents.* | The technique has been explored as a **qualitative probe** (detecting the presence of chirality on a surface) but never scaled to quantitative purification; no commercial analytical kits exist. |
| *The effect should be observable for other racemic thin films, not just BINOL.* | Mixed results: some aromatic diols showed a small bias, while many small‑molecule drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) showed no measurable effect. The phenomenon appears highly dependent on molecular dipole moment and surface interaction strength. |
| *Further experiments will quickly clarify the quantum‑mechanical mechanism.* | Theoretical work has proposed spin‑selective charge transfer as a plausible mechanism, but consensus is lacking; the community still regards the effect as “enigmatic.” |

Overall, the predictions have **underperformed** relative to the optimistic tone of the original commentary.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **4/10**  

*Reasoning:* The paper introduced a striking, counter‑intuitive observation that sparked modest academic interest, but the effect has not been reproducible at a level useful for real‑world chiral separations, and it has not led to broader technological or regulatory impact. It remains a niche curiosity rather than a transformative advance.
