# Today We Have Naming of Parts (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This Science Magazine blog post recommends and discusses a C&E News article by Carmen Drahl about disputes among chemists over scientific nomenclature. The author highlights various types of disagreements: competing terms for identical concepts, overlapping but distinct terminology, different measurement standards, and ambiguous terms that some argue should be eliminated entirely.

The core argument is that nomenclature debates are not necessarily petty or irrational, as humans have a tendency toward "reification" - turning abstract concepts into named "things" that can be discussed as if they were concrete objects. While well-chosen names are crucial for intellectual discourse and scientific progress, poorly fitting terminology can cause real harm by obscuring valuable insights and leading thinking in unproductive directions.

The author provides the example of using "agonist" and "antagonist" terminology for nuclear receptor ligands, arguing this borrowing from GPCR pharmacology is actively harmful to understanding nuclear receptor function. The post extends beyond chemistry to criticize vague language like "taken to the next level" and references Wittgenstein's philosophical warning about being cautious with language usage.

## 2. HISTORY

This blog post was published in Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" column, which has continued running at Science Magazine through the present day, becoming one of the most widely-read chemistry and pharmaceutical industry blogs. Lowe's sustained focus on scientific precision and clear thinking has maintained relevance.

The specific nomenclature issues discussed have shown mixed evolution:

**Nuclear Receptor Terminology**: The agonist/antagonist framework for nuclear receptors remains standard in pharmacology and drug development, despite the author's objections. This terminology is embedded in FDA classification systems and clinical practice. Drugs like tamoxifen (estrogen receptor modulator) continue to be described using this framework in clinical literature through 2024.

**General Nomenclature Trends**: Efforts to standardize chemical nomenclature have continued through organizations like IUPAC, but disputes persist, particularly with emerging fields like PROTACs, molecular glues, and other protein degrader technologies where terminology is still evolving. The COVID-19 pandemic brought renewed attention to nomenclature issues when WHO implemented systematic naming conventions for SARS-CoV-2 variants to avoid geographic stigmatization.

**Industry Impact**: The broader point about careful language usage has gained rather than lost relevance, particularly in pharmaceutical regulation where FDA guidance documents increasingly emphasize precise terminology for drug classification and mechanism of action descriptions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It was primarily a commentary piece discussing ongoing issues rather than forecasting specific outcomes. The implicit hope for more careful language usage and better nomenclature practices has seen partial realization in some domains (like systematic naming for viral variants) while other areas (like nuclear receptor terminology) remain unchanged.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article addresses a persistent, genuine issue in scientific communication, but as a commentary on nomenclature debates rather than a forward-looking analysis of biotechnology developments, its long-term importance is moderate. The philosophical concerns about precise language remain relevant, but the post lacks the concrete industry or scientific breakthrough focus that would give it broader lasting significance. It serves as a thoughtful reflection on scientific communication practices rather than a pivotal analysis of biopharma trends.

## 5. RELATED ARTICLES

Similar thematic articles by the same author include the author's earlier "Block That Metaphor" post about misuse of pharmacological terminology across different receptor classes, demonstrating sustained interest in precision of scientific language.
