# Just Build The Thing (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 blog post discusses a JACS paper on a novel prostate cancer imaging approach that targets GPR receptors overexpressed in prostate tumors. The key innovation was using a polyproline scaffold to simultaneously present both bombesin peptide agonists and antagonists at systematically varied spacings (achieved via "click" Huisgen triazole linkages, using azidoproline to control inter-ligand distance). The authors found that a spacing of approximately 20Å between the two ligands produced greater tumor uptake and longer half-life compared to using either peptide alone. The article emphasizes how modern synthetic tools—especially click chemistry (credited to Barry Sharpless) and well-understood scaffolds like polyproline—enable researchers to rapidly prototype complex, hybrid molecules and test their central hypotheses without getting bogged down in bespoke synthetic challenges.

## 2. HISTORY
The article highlights two main threads—click chemistry's broad adoption and the idea of multivalent/multifunctional imaging agents like dual agonist–antagonist ligands. Click chemistry has indeed become ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry, diagnostics, and chemical biology, enabling modular assembly of probes, bioconjugates, and PROTACs. Many imaging and therapeutic platforms now use click handles for late-stage functionalization and target validation. However, the specific approach in this JACS paper—co-displaying bombesin agonists and antagonists on a polyproline scaffold for prostate cancer imaging—does not seem to have translated into an FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical or widespread clinical adoption. Radiolabeled PSMA-targeted PET agents (e.g., Ga-68 PSMA-11, F-18 DCFPyL/Piflufolastat) later became the dominant clinical paradigm for prostate cancer imaging, and GPR/bombesin-based imaging agents have remained largely in the research/non-clinical realm, with limited commercial pipeline presence. The "just build the thing" ethos—rapidly prototyping and testing using modular chemistry—clearly influenced the broader field's toolkit, but this particular proof-of-concept did not mature into a product or major therapeutic axis for prostate cancer.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction that the dual agonist–antagonist scaffold concept would be extended to other oncology ligands and enter diagnostics/therapeutics**: While similar multifunctional targeting strategies (e.g., bispecifics and multivalent nanobodies/antibodies) now exist, the specific GPR/bombesin approach did not become a major diagnostic or therapeutic modality. Radiolabeled PSMA agents instead became the standard for prostate cancer imaging.  
- **That "universal connector reactions" like click chemistry would massively accelerate preclinical discovery and keep yielding utility**: This prediction aged well—click chemistry is now standard across chemical biology, radiochemistry, bioconjugation, and drug discovery. Many imaging probes and targeted therapeutics are assembled via click or related bioorthogonal reactions.  
- **Implied faster translation of complex chemical designs "these days"**: Rational design and modular assembly using click handles have shortened some discovery timelines; however, clinical translation remains protracted. This specific GPR/bombesin approach has not reached patients at scale.  

## 4. INTEREST
**6/9**  
An interesting case study in how modular chemistry accelerates preclinical ideas, and a useful retrospective on a concept that succeeded chemically but did not translate clinically—reflecting how dominant alternative targets (PSMA) and clinical/regulatory paths shape outcomes.
