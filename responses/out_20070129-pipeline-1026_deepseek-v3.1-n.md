# Blogroll Update (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article from January 2007 announced an update to the blogroll (a list of recommended blogs) on the author's site. The author explained that they had reorganized the blogroll by separating chemistry and drug industry sites, and added several new chemistry and pharmaceutical-related blogs that were emerging at the time. The piece reflects the growing landscape of chemical and pharmaceutical blogging in 2007, showcasing the community's expansion with both new and previously overlooked chemistry-focused blogs getting recognized.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2007 article saw significant evolution in science and chemistry blogging. The chemical blogging community continued to grow through the late 2000s, but the broader landscape shifted dramatically with the rise of social media platforms. Many standalone blogs from this era either became inactive, merged into larger platforms, or transitioned to different formats. The Royal Society of Chemistry's Chemistry World Blog mentioned in the article maintained its presence and evolved with the digital landscape. The broader trend saw science communication moving from individual blogs toward centralized platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and specialized scientific communities. Many of these early chemistry blogs represented a grassroots movement that predated today's more institutional science communication approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No specific predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical development were made in this article. The piece was purely focused on documenting the growing chemistry blogging community of January 2007.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This article is essentially a blogroll update announcement with no substantive content about biotechnology developments, scientific discoveries, or industry analysis. While historically interesting as a snapshot of early chemistry blogging culture, it lacks any meaningful scientific or biotechnology content to evaluate.
