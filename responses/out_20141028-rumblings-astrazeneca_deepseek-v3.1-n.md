# Rumblings About AstraZeneca and Antibiotics (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on persistent rumors that AstraZeneca was planning to exit antibiotics research in late 2014. The author cites pharmaceutical industry blogger David Shlaes as the source, with additional confirmation from AstraZeneca's non-committal corporate statement to the Wall Street Journal's Pharmalot blog. The company's language about taking an "opportunity-driven approach" in non-core therapeutic areas (infection and neuroscience) was interpreted as typical corporate code signaling an impending exit from the field, despite antibiotics being a critical area of medicine and growing concern about antimicrobial resistance.

## 2. HISTORY

The rumors proved accurate. In 2015, AstraZeneca announced it would spin off its small molecule antibiotics business, which was completed in 2016 with the creation of a new company called **Entasis Therapeutics**. AstraZeneca retained equity in Entasis and certain rights to future products, effectively offloading most of the antibiotics R&D risk while maintaining some upside potential. 

Entasis Therapeutics became an independent publicly-traded company focused on developing antibiotics to combat drug-resistant infections. The company advanced several candidates, including sulbactam-durlobactam (targeting Acinetobacter infections) and zoliflodacin (for gonorrhea). In May 2022, Entasis reported positive Phase 3 results for sulbactam-durlobactam. However, by August 2022, Entasis was acquired by Innoviva for approximately $113 million, with Innoviva subsequently taking the antibiotic program forward. The FDA approved sulbactam-durlobactam (brand name Xacduro) in May 2023 for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex.

This trend was not unique to AstraZeneca. Throughout the 2010s, most large pharmaceutical companies scaled back or exited antibiotic research, including Novartis, Allergan, Sanofi, and others, largely due to challenging economics: antibiotics typically offer lower profit margins than chronic disease drugs, must be used judiciously (limiting sales volume), and face shorter patent exclusivity periods. This industry-wide retreat created what became known as the "antibiotic void," where major companies abandoned the field while antimicrobial resistance continued to grow, leading to increased policy attention and some public-private partnership initiatives to incentivize antibiotic development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Getting rid of the rest of its antibiotics research"** - This proved accurate. Within two years, AstraZeneca had spun off the antibiotics division into Entasis Therapeutics.

• **"Sauve qui peut [everyone for themselves] is the usual reaction to this sort of statement"** - The general concern about industry abandonment of antibiotics proved well-founded. The following decade saw continued consolidation and exit of major pharmaceutical companies from antibiotic R&D, validating the author's interpretation of the corporate-speak as signaling retreat.

• **Implicit prediction of negative impact on antibiotic pipeline** - While the field didn't collapse entirely, it did become increasingly reliant on smaller biotech companies and public-private partnerships rather than big pharma investment, creating ongoing challenges for antibiotic development that persist today.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a significant early signal of a major structural shift in pharmaceutical R&D that had far-reaching implications for public health and drug development strategy. The antibiotics exit trend that AstraZeneca exemplified became a defining feature of pharmaceutical industry dynamics in the following decade.
