# And Thee, O Time (1 Nov 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses resveratrol, a natural product identified in 2003 as an activator of the sirtuin deacetylase pathway—suggested as the potential mechanism connecting life-extending genes and caloric restriction. The author notes that resveratrol was being studied as a prototype sirtuin activator, and predicts that medicinal chemists would develop optimized analogs and that animal studies would test lifespan effects. The author highlights new 2006 findings from David Sinclair's group showing that resveratrol improved glucose/insulin levels, liver function, and lifespan in high-fat-diet mice, while preserving motor abilities. The piece also reports that Sinclair's company (Sirtris Pharmaceuticals) had developed improved molecules based on resveratrol, with SRT501 entering clinical development.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication, Sirtris Pharmaceuticals advanced SRT501 into clinical trials for type 2 diabetes. The company was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million, reflecting substantial commercial interest in sirtuin activators. However, clinical development faced significant setbacks:
- SRT501 was discontinued after Phase II trials showed limited efficacy and safety concerns
- Subsequent sirtuin activator programs struggled with target engagement, off-target effects, and translation from preclinical models to humans
- The "caloric restriction mimetic" hypothesis proved more complex than initially hoped, with sirtuins playing roles beyond simple lifespan extension
- Some foundational studies in the field were later subject to replication concerns and image manipulation investigations, though not specifically tied to the resveratrol mouse studies cited here

While resveratrol and sirtuin biology remain active research areas, they have not delivered the hoped-for anti-aging therapies or diabetes treatments that prompted the 2008 acquisition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: Resveratrol would be optimized by medicinal chemists, and improved molecules would enter clinical development
  - **Outcome**: Partially correct. Sirtris did develop analogs and advanced SRT501 into clinical trials for diabetes. However, these programs failed in Phase II trials, and no sirtuin-based drugs have received FDA approval for aging or metabolic diseases.
  
- **Prediction**: Long-term resveratrol mouse studies would be conducted and would extend lifespan
  - **Outcome**: The 2006 Nature study cited in the article did show lifespan effects in high-fat-diet mice. However, subsequent studies produced mixed results, with some failing to replicate lifespan extension in healthy mice. The therapeutic mechanism did not translate robustly to humans.
  
- **Prediction**: "You're going to be hearing about [SRT501] again"
  - **Outcome**: SRT501 did receive attention, entering clinical trials and representing one of the more visible sirtuin programs. However, it was ultimately discontinued without regulatory approval, and the compound code is now associated with a promising but ultimately unsuccessful drug development effort.

- **Prediction**: Improved molecules would show effects in higher animals and potentially humans
  - **Outcome**: Clinical trials proceeded but failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy and safety. The pathway's therapeutic potential remains unproven in humans despite early promise.
  
- **Bigger picture**: The sirtuin/caloric restriction paradigm generated significant commercial investment but has not produced approved drugs. The complexity of aging biology and translation from model organisms proved more challenging than anticipated in 2006.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment when a compelling biological mechanism attracted major commercial interest and investment. The subsequent clinical failures and scientific controversies surrounding sirtuin research make this historical snapshot particularly valuable for understanding hype cycles, translational challenges, and the difficulties of targeting aging biology.

The high score reflects the article's prescience about commercial development and the enduring scientific and commercial importance of understanding why this promising pathway failed to deliver therapies, which remains relevant to current geroscience and metabolic disease research.
