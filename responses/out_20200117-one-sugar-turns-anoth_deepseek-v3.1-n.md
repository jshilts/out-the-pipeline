# One Sugar Turns Into Another (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a groundbreaking Nature paper from the Wendlandt group at MIT that demonstrated the ability to epimerize (convert one sugar stereoisomer into another) completely unprotected sugar systems using photoredox catalysis. The author explains that carbohydrate chemistry has historically been dominated by extensive use of protecting groups due to the multiple reactive hydroxyl groups present, making synthesis of rare sugars both difficult and expensive. The new method uses a hydrogen abstraction/donation mechanism that selectively targets specific hydroxyl groups for epimerization, working even on complex systems like disaccharides, nucleosides, and C-glycosides. The reaction shows intriguing selectivity patterns (alpha-methyl glycosides reacting at C3, beta-methyl at C2) that aren't yet fully understood. The author expresses amazement that such chemistry is possible at all on unprotected substrates and speculates this could make rare sugars much more accessible.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2020 publication, the Wendlandt group's photoredox epimerization approach has gained significant traction in carbohydrate chemistry. The method represents a paradigm shift away from traditional protecting-group-heavy synthesis. However, the technology has faced the typical challenges of scaling photoredox reactions for industrial production. While academic adoption has been strong with numerous follow-up studies exploring expanded substrate scope and mechanistic understanding, commercial implementation by pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies has been limited. No major drug development programs have publicly centered on this specific epimerization technology, though several preclinical efforts have explored accessing rare sugar building blocks through such methods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Rare sugars might become less rare**: **Partially accurate**. The methodology has indeed made certain rare sugars more accessible in academic research settings, with improved routes to allose, gulose, talose, and their derivatives. However, widespread commercial availability and dramatic price reductions haven't materialized to the extent implied.

• **Mechanistic understanding will improve**: **Accurate**. Subsequent research by Wendlandt and others has provided deeper understanding of the kinetic vs. thermodynamic control factors and has expanded the range of hydroxyl groups that can participate in these reactions.

• **Other hydroxyl groups might be "dragged into participating"**: **Accurate**. Follow-up work has demonstrated expanded scope, including reactions at additional positions beyond the initially observed C2 and C3 selectivities, with modified reaction conditions and catalysts.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses a genuinely important advance in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry with broad implications for accessing bioactive molecules and drug development. While the technique hasn't transformed biotechnology in the dramatic ways initially suggested, it represents meaningful progress toward sustainable and efficient synthesis.

## 5. DISCUSSION

This commentary correctly identified a significant methodological advance in carbohydrate chemistry. The photoredox epimerization approach has indeed proven valuable for academic synthesis, though industrial impact remains limited. The article's enthusiasm was justified by the technical achievement, even if the long-term transformational effects have been more modest than implied.
