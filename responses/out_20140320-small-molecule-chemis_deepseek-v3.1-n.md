# Small Molecule Chemistry's Aging Workforce (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Jonathan Montagu's guest post at LifeSciVC about the future of small molecule drug discovery. The central argument is that traditional small molecule chemistry has "limited utility in today's world" and that medicinal chemists need to expand into biomolecule/small molecule hybrids and explore broader chemical spaces. Key themes include: moving beyond conventional small molecules, exploiting natural-product-like chemical space, working with unusual mechanisms like allosteric sites and covalent inhibitors, and figuring out why some large molecules can still have good pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.

Derek Lowe (the article's author) largely agrees with Montagu's perspective, noting that this aligns with his own presentations about the state of drug discovery. Lowe suggests that while Montagu's assertion about traditional small molecule chemistry's limitations may not be fully true at that moment, it's likely to become increasingly correct in the future, requiring medicinal chemists to "stretch our definitions" and embrace new approaches.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2014 saw significant evolution in drug discovery, though not necessarily the wholesale abandonment of small molecules that Montagu's strong statement might suggest.

**Continued small molecule success**: Small molecules remained dominant in drug approvals. The majority of FDA new drug approvals between 2014-2024 continued to be small molecules, particularly for established therapeutic areas like oncology, cardiovascular disease, and CNS disorders.

**Rise of biomolecule therapeutics**: The 2014-2024 decade did see substantial growth in biologics, with monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and other large molecule therapeutics gaining market share. ADC therapeutics like Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) demonstrated the hybrid approach mentioned in the article.

**Covalent inhibitors breakthrough**: Covalent inhibitors, mentioned as an "unusual mechanism" in 2014, became more mainstream with significant successes. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors like ibrutinib (approved 2013) and acalabrutinib (approved 2017) demonstrated the viability of strategic covalent modification. Notably, KRAS G12C covalent inhibitors like sotorasib (Lumakras, approved 2021) and adagrasib (Krazati, approved 2022) addressed what was once considered an "undruggable" target, validating this approach.

**Natural product inspiration**: While direct natural product drug discovery didn't dominate, natural product-inspired approaches continued to influence drug design. The concept of exploring "natural-product-like chemical space" evolved toward fragment-based drug discovery and structure-based design leveraging structural biology insights.

**Structural biology impact**: Structure-based drug discovery, which Montagu was "sanguine" about, became increasingly powerful due to advances in cryo-EM and computational methods, enabling better targeting of difficult protein classes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Montagu's central prediction**: *"Small molecule chemistry, as traditionally defined and practiced, has limited utility in today's world" and will become "more and more correct in the future"*

- **Outcome**: Partially accurate in direction but overstated in magnitude. Small molecules didn't become "limited in utility" - they remained the workhorse of pharmaceutical pipelines and approvals. However, the field did expand significantly beyond traditional small molecule paradigms toward hybrid approaches and more sophisticated targeting strategies.

**Prediction that medicinal chemists need to "stretch definitions" into biomolecule/small molecule hybrids**

- **Outcome**: Validated, particularly for ADCs and PROTACs. The ADC field grew substantially with multiple approvals (Kadcyla 2013, Adcetris 2011, Enhertu 2019, Trodelvy 2020). PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras) emerged as a major new modality, combining small molecule binders with E3 ligase recruiters to achieve targeted protein degradation. The first PROTACs entered clinical trials around 2019-2020.

**Need to work with "unusual mechanisms" like allosteric sites and covalent inhibitors**

- **Outcome**: Strongly validated. Allosteric modulators became increasingly important, particularly in fields like GPCR drug discovery. Covalent inhibitors proved highly successful for targets like BTK and KRAS, with multiple FDA approvals demonstrating this "unusual mechanism" had become mainstream.

**Exploring natural-product-like chemical space**

- **Outcome**: Moderately validated. While direct natural product discovery remained challenging, the principles influenced fragment-based approaches and library design. The prediction was directionally correct but the implementation evolved toward more sophisticated computational and structural approaches rather than direct natural product screening.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article identified important trends in drug discovery's evolution, particularly the need for hybrid approaches and innovative mechanisms like covalent inhibitors. While overly pessimistic about traditional small molecules, it correctly anticipated major shifts toward more sophisticated therapeutic modalities and targeting strategies.
