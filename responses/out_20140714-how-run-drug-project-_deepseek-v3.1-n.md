# How to Run a Drug Project: Are There Any Rules at All?
**(July 2014)**

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the fundamental challenge in pharmaceutical drug development: determining when to terminate a failed project versus when to persevere through difficulties. The author examines two opposing organizational approaches - the small-company model where experienced, motivated teams make their own calls on project viability, versus larger organizations with separated execution teams and management decision-makers. Both approaches carry risks: teams too close to projects may continue failed efforts far too long due to emotional investment and the natural tendency to keep trying "one more experiment," while distant managers may make poor decisions due to distorted reporting in "Dog-and-Pony-itis" meetings where teams present overly optimistic assessments. The article acknowledges that nearly every successful drug faced existential crises during development, making the decision to terminate exceptionally difficult. The author expresses personal preference for the small-company approach with motivated teams willing to "try anything," but only for high-payoff projects, while maintaining some independent oversight for objectivity.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this article's publication, the pharmaceutical industry's productivity challenges continued largely unchanged, though some trends emerged. Clinical trial attrition rates remained persistently high, with approximately 90% of drugs entering clinical trials still failing to reach approval, though oncology drugs showed somewhat better success rates (around 5-7% versus 10-12% overall). 

The industry saw significant consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, with major deals like Bristol-Myers Squibb's $74 billion acquisition of Celgene (2019) and AbbVie's $63 billion purchase of Allergan (2019), though these haven't fundamentally solved productivity issues. Virtual drug development models gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially offering alternatives to traditional organizational structures.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning emerged as potential tools to improve drug development decision-making, with companies developing predictive models for success, though definitive evidence of improved success rates remains limited. The FDA approved record numbers of new drugs in recent years, suggesting some improvement in development efficiency, but R&D productivity as measured by output per dollar invested hasn't dramatically improved. Notable successes included breakthrough therapies in oncology and rare diseases, while some high-profile failures (such as Alzheimer's disease programs) reinforced the article's core message about the difficulty of predicting success.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't contain explicit forward-looking predictions about specific technologies or drugs, but rather described ongoing structural challenges in drug development organizational management. The implied predictions within the discussed approaches were:

• **Small-company model effectiveness**: The article suggested small, focused teams with decision-making authority could effectively manage projects. In practice, this model continued to show mixed results - while some biotech startups succeeded spectacularly (Moderna, BioNTech), others failed despite talented teams, validating the author's caution about context dependency.

• **Large-organization decision-making problems**: The "Dog-and-Pony-itis" concern remained highly relevant, as evidenced by continued industry struggles with project portfolio management and the persistence of high failure rates despite decades of process improvement efforts.

• **Persistent difficulty in early termination decisions**: The core challenge identified - determining when to terminate projects - remained largely unsolved. Most companies continued struggling with this balance, as evidenced by ongoing high clinical trial attrition rates.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article addresses enduring structural problems in pharmaceutical R&D that remain largely unchanged, but offers primarily familiar observations about organizational challenges rather than novel insights or solutions. The described tensions between different management approaches continue to be relevant, but the discussion lacks actionable frameworks or evidence-based recommendations for improvement, limiting its long-term impact on the field.
