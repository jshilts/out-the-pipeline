# A New Look at Clinical Success Rates (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes a landmark 2018 paper by Andrew Lo and colleagues at MIT that conducted the largest investigation of clinical trial probability-of-success (POS) rates to date. The study analyzed over 400,000 data points from 185,994 unique trials involving 21,143 compounds from 2000-2015, using an automated pathway-tracing algorithm to track individual drug development projects.

The paper found an overall 13.8% success rate—higher than the standard 10% estimate—largely due to improved Phase II-III transition rate calculations and better coverage of missing trials. Most significantly, the study revealed a stark divergence between therapeutic areas: oncology trials had a meager 3.4% POS compared to 20.9% for all other therapeutic areas combined. Biomarker-guided patient selection nearly doubled POS in oncology, but broader biomarker evaluation trials showed no significant improvement overall. Oncology trials also took remarkably longer (median 13.1 years) compared to non-oncology trials (5.9-7.2 years). The research also noted overall success rates declined from 2005-2013 before rebounding in 2014-2015, coinciding with early immuno-oncology approvals.

## 2. HISTORY

The Lo et al. paper became highly influential in both academic and industry contexts, establishing a new benchmark for clinical development analytics. Pharmaceutical companies began using these more granular pathway-based methodologies to inform portfolio decisions, though oncology's high failure rates remained a persistent challenge. The finding that biomarker-guided patient selection significantly improved oncology outcomes (doubling POS) provided quantitative support for precision medicine investments and partially explained the subsequent emergence of basket trials and molecularly-defined patient populations that accelerated through 2018-2023.

The rebound in success rates noted in the 2014-2015 data intensified through 2015-2020, largely driven by immuno-oncology. Drugs like Nivolumab (highlighted in the article) and Pembrolizumab continued expanding into multiple indications through 2016-2020, and CAR-T therapies received several FDA approvals starting in 2017. However, the 20.9% non-oncology POS figure and 3.4% oncology POS remained roughly reflective of industry realities through 2018-2022, though several high-profile immuno-oncology and targeted therapy approvals during 2018-2023 likely improved oncology's cumulative record somewhat.

Critically, the paper's finding of 13.1-year median durations for oncology trials provided a data-driven explanation for the difficulty in oncology drug development, while the 1.2% POS for orphan oncology indications contrasted sharply with the perception that rare disease development had inherently higher success rates due to smaller, faster trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction cited/implied in article**: The authors noted that 2014-2015 showed improved success rates reversing prior declines, with immuno-oncology driving early gains.

- **Actual outcome**: This trend substantially accelerated through 2018-2023, though success rates remain highly dependent on therapeutic area. PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitors expanded to dozens of indications, resulting in major clinical and commercial successes that aligned with the paper's observation that oncology comprised 50% of drug development activity.

**Prediction cited/implied in article**: Biomarker-guided patient stratification nearly doubled oncology POS, suggesting continued investment would drive improved outcomes.

- **Actual outcome**: This held true and expanded significantly. Precision oncology, liquid biopsies, companion diagnostics, and molecularly-defined patient populations became increasingly widespread and were incorporated into many regulatory pathways. However, overall oncology POS remains dramatically lower than other therapeutic areas.

**Prediction cited/implied in article**: The pathway-based methodology would provide more accurate understanding of clinical development than phase-by-phase approaches.

- **Actual outcome**: Adoption of pathway or cohort-based analytics became increasingly common in pharmaceutical portfolio management, though both methodologies continue to be used depending on context.

**Prediction cited/implied in article**: Collaboration with non-industry partners improved success rates (though with likely selection bias).

- **Actual outcome**: Public-private partnerships, academic-industry collaborations, and foundation-supported trials remained important, though the causality versus selection bias question persisted as an active area of research and debate.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article analyzes what became a foundational and widely-cited study that reshaped understanding of clinical development probability-of-success rates, particularly the quantified evidence of oncology's uniquely high failure rates and long development cycles, which remained relevant for understanding pharmaceutical industry performance through subsequent years.
