# Cutbacks at Merck Serono (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The February 2015 blog post reported that Merck KGaA was implementing cutbacks at its US research site in Billerica, Massachusetts, following a series of setbacks in their multiple sclerosis R&D programs. The company confirmed that "a limited number of discovery positions have been impacted" but declined to specify the exact scale of the layoffs. This announcement reflected broader struggles at the company, which had previously closed Serono's Swiss research facility, concentrating their R&D operations primarily in Billerica and Darmstadt. The downsizing appeared to be part of a strategic reorganization as Merck KGaA worked to reorient their research pipeline after clinical disappointments.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2015 restructuring, Merck KGaA's pharmaceutical division underwent significant transformation with mixed outcomes:

- In May 2016, Merck acquired Versum Materials, and in September 2017, the company completed the acquisition of MilliporeSigma, expanding their life science business significantly.
- The company continued to face challenges with Bavencio (avelumab), their immunotherapy drug. While approved by the FDA in March 2017 for Merkel cell carcinoma and later for bladder cancer, Bavencio faced intense competition from other PD-L1 inhibitors from Merck & Co (Keytruda), Bristol-Myers Squibb (Opdivo), and Roche (Tecentriq).
- Merck KGaA's multiple sclerosis portfolio saw modest success with Mavenclad (cladribine), approved in Europe in 2017 and by the FDA in 2019 for relapsing forms of MS. However, uptake was limited compared to established MS therapies like Biogen's Tysabri and Roche's Ocrevus.
- By 2022, the company's pharmaceutical R&D spending remained substantial (approximately $2.4 billion annually), but their late-stage pipeline showed limited blockbuster potential compared to rivals. The company increasingly focused on oncology and immuno-oncology while maintaining some neurology programs.
- Merck KGaA's Billerica site continued operations but with more strategic focus on leveraging the Boston biotech hub for partnerships and collaborations rather than solely internal discovery efforts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about the future state of Merck KGaA or the biotechnology sector following the 2015 cutbacks.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

The article documents a fairly routine corporate restructuring in the pharmaceutical industry that, while notable at the time, did not have sufficient later significance or broader industry impact to rank highly in terms of long-term importance. Such organizational adjustments are common consequences of pipeline failures in drug development.
