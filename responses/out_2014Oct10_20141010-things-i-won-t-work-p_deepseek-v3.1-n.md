# Things I Won't Work With: Peroxide Peroxides - A Hindsight Analysis

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article from Science Magazine's "Things I Won't Work With" series is a humorous yet technically serious warning about the dangers of working with concentrated peroxides and their even more unstable analogs. The author explains that while 30% hydrogen peroxide is manageable and 70% requires extreme caution, the real concern lies with poly-peroxides—compounds with multiple oxygen-oxygen bonds in sequence.

The piece highlights recent research into dihydrogen trioxide (HOOOH) and the peroxone process (ozone + peroxide), which generates species like the HOOO⁻ anion with five consecutive oxygen atoms. While acknowledging legitimate industrial applications for waste water treatment, the author's primary message is one of extreme caution: these materials are fundamentally unstable due to weak O-O bonds, and attempts to concentrate or purify them are invitations to disaster.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade since publication, the landscape of high-oxygen chemistry has evolved significantly, though largely confirming the author's cautious approach:

**Synthetic Chemistry Progress:** Researchers have indeed developed more controlled routes to poly-oxygen species. The 2014 JACS paper's platinum-complex route to HOOOH represented just the beginning—subsequent work has explored these compounds as short-lived intermediates in oxygen-atom transfer reactions, particularly in atmospheric chemistry and advanced oxidation processes. However, **no one has successfully isolated concentrated HOOOH or longer poly-peroxides in pure form**, confirming the author's skepticism about purification attempts.

**Industrial Applications Expanded:** The peroxone process has seen continued use in water treatment, particularly for destroying persistent organic pollutants like PFAS "forever chemicals" and pharmaceutical residues. Municipal water systems increasingly adopted peroxone and related advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) when conventional methods failed. The technology proved particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic for disinfecting wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

**New Research Areas:** Interest in atmospheric poly-oxygen chemistry grew, with HOOOH and related species being identified as important intermediates in ozone chemistry and atmospheric oxidation cycles. Computational studies of these species advanced significantly with improved quantum chemical methods.

**Safety Incidents:** Tragically, the period saw several accidents involving concentrated peroxides, most notably the 2020 Beirut port explosion involving ammonium nitrate contaminated with sodium peroxide. While not directly involving HOOOH, these incidents reinforced the article's underlying message about respecting the energetic nature of oxygen-rich compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Matched Reality:**

- **Stability concerns were prescient:** The author's assessment that no one would successfully purify HOOOH to high concentrations proved entirely correct. A decade later, it remains a laboratory curiosity studied only in dilute solution or as short-lived intermediates.

- **Industrial applications would be limited to dilute systems:** The peroxone process did expand in water treatment but remained exclusively in carefully controlled, dilute aqueous systems—exactly as predicted.

- **Organic synthesis applications wouldn't materialize:** The author's skepticism about using peroxone chemistry in organic synthesis was justified. The field largely abandoned such approaches due to poor selectivity and safety concerns, favoring more controlled oxidants like oxone or catalytic oxidation systems.

**Predictions That Were Partially Wrong:**

- **Research interest would remain minimal:** Contrary to the implicit assumption that these compounds were too dangerous to study seriously, research interest actually **increased** in specialized areas. Atmospheric chemists, environmental engineers, and computational chemists all developed focused research programs, though always working with these species under carefully controlled conditions.

- **The "liberating thought" of systematic extension:** The author's humorous suggestion that adding more peroxide units always makes things worse proved an **oversimplification**. While HOOOH is indeed more reactive than HOOH, longer poly-peroxides can actually be **less reactive** in some contexts due to thermodynamic factors—though they're still explosively unstable.

**Hindsight Clarifications:**

The most important missed nuance was that **concentration isn't the only danger factor**—context matters enormously. The Beirut explosion demonstrated that even relatively dilute peroxide contaminants in bulk materials can cause catastrophic accidents when mishandled, while laboratory quantities of more concentrated materials remain manageable with proper safety protocols.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5/9**

This ranks in the 50-59th percentile for interest and importance—above average but not transformative.

**Strengths:**

The article successfully illuminated important principles about chemical stability and risk assessment that remain relevant. Its predictive insights about industrial applications proved accurate, and the safety warnings were validated by subsequent incidents. The piece also highlighted a genuine niche area of chemistry that, while not earth-shattering, developed into meaningful research domains.

**Limitations:**

The subject matter remains a somewhat specialized corner of chemistry rather than a transformative technology. Unlike articles about CRISPR, battery technologies, or quantum computing from the same era, this piece addressed concerns that, while important, didn't fundamentally change how chemistry is practiced. The "won't work with" framing, while entertaining and educationally valuable, didn't stop legitimate research in these areas—it just ensured that research proceeded with appropriate caution.

**Long-term Significance:**

The article's lasting value lies not in its specific predictions about HOOOH, but in its broader lesson about **respecting fundamental chemical properties when assessing technological risk**. This principle has become increasingly important as chemists work with ever-more-energetic materials for applications from rocketry to waste treatment to pharmaceutical manufacturing.
