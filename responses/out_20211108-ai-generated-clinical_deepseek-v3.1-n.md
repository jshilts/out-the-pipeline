# AI-Generated Clinical Candidates, So Far (November 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2021 article examines the state of AI-designed drug candidates entering clinical trials, focusing specifically on three compounds from ExScientia. The author categorizes AI drug discovery ambitions into tiers: the highest being AI discovering entirely new disease mechanisms or targets (not yet achievable), down to AI generating novel chemical structures for known targets. 

The analysis focuses on three ExScientia compounds in clinical trials at the time: DSP-1181 (5-HT1a agonist for OCD), EXS21546 (A2a receptor antagonist for immuno-oncology), and DSP-0038 (dual 5-HT1a agonist/5-HT2a antagonist for Alzheimer's psychosis). The author finds these compounds, contrary to "AI-generated" hype, are structurally similar to existing known drugs - DSP-1181 resembles haloperidol, EXS21546 resembles Janssen compounds, and DSP-0038 resembles known antipsychotics. The author suggests ExScientia's platform may primarily function as an "automatic patent-busting" system that efficiently navigates intellectual property space rather than creating genuinely novel chemical matter. While crediting ExScientia for progress, the author notes this represents early-stage capabilities focused on "fast-follower" drug development rather than breakthrough discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

**ExScientia's Continued Clinical Progress:**
- DSP-1181 (OCD treatment): ExScientia advanced this compound into Phase 1 trials in partnership with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, with early trials conducted in Japan starting in 2020. However, no major Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial results have been publicly announced, and the compound's development status remains unclear.
- EXS21546 (A2a antagonist for immuno-oncology): Progressed into clinical trials with some early safety data reported, but no major efficacy breakthrough or approval.
- DSP-0038 (Alzheimer's psychosis): Entered early clinical evaluation but again shows no clear path to commercialization.

The author's skepticism about the novelty of these compounds was largely validated. All three leveraged well-known receptor targets and chemical scaffolds. After 2021, the conversation around AI drug discovery shifted more toward target identification rather than fast-follower synthesis. Most of these early compounds have not reached FDA approval or widespread patient use.

**Industry trajectory:** AI drug discovery companies continued raising significant capital. ExScientia went public via SPAC merger in December 2021 at a ~$3 billion valuation, which subsequently declined significantly in the biotech downturn. Other players like Recursion, Insilico, and BenevolentAI advanced their own candidates but similarly faced questions about true novelty versus computational acceleration of known chemistry.

**FDA oversight:** The FDA has engaged with AI drug development companies but has not established specific approval pathways for AI-designed drugs. The core challenge remains: AI-generated candidates must meet the same rigorous safety and efficacy standards as traditionally developed compounds, and claims of computational novelty don't inherently translate to clinical advantages.

The article accurately identified that novelty-based AI approaches might struggle against high clinical failure rates. Most of the compounds discussed ultimately validated the author's early pessimism about breakthrough innovation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article's Assessment Points:**

- **"We're still a ways from AI discovering truly new disease mechanisms or targets"** - **Largely validated**: By late 2024, several AI companies have attempted target discovery, but this remains exceptionally challenging and risky. Most successful applications still focus on improving chemistry for known targets.

- **ExScientia's compounds represent "fast-follower" development rather than novel chemical matter** - **Validated**: The three discussed compounds showed structural similarity to existing drugs, and none have achieved breakthrough approval status or transformative clinical impact. This pattern holds broadly across the industry.

- **AI drug discovery would face the same high clinical failure rate as traditional methods** - **Validated**: AI-discovered compounds consistently show 80-90%+ failure rates in trials, similar to traditional drug development. The 90% failure rate remains largely intact across the industry despite AI integration.

- **The real value might be in "patent-breaking" and navigating IP space** - **Mixed validation**: Computational methods do help companies navigate patent landscapes, but this hasn't proven transformative enough to justify multi-billion dollar valuations without clinical success.

- **Time savings in synthesis would be valuable if legally clear** - **Partially validated**: Computational approaches do accelerate early-stage chemistry, but the timeline from concept to credible clinical candidate remains long, and AI hasn't dramatically compressed late-stage development or approval timelines.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates remarkably accurate foresight about the limitations of early AI drug discovery efforts. The author correctly identified that initial clinical candidates relied heavily on established chemical scaffolds despite AI marketing, and accurately predicted ongoing clinical failure rates. The skeptical but balanced analysis has aged well and provides enduring insight into hype-vs-reality dynamics in computational drug development.
