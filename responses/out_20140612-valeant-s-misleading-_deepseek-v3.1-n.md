# Valeant's Misleading Case (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary article critiques Valeant Pharmaceuticals' hostile takeover bid for Allergan, specifically challenging Valeant's arguments about pharmaceutical R&D productivity. The author disputes Valeant's selective use of data from Richard Evans that only included the largest pharma companies, thereby excluding Allergan (which had an 8% R&D return), Gilead (21%), and Celgene (32%). The article also criticizes Valeant's claim that only four of the fifty best-selling drugs were developed internally at big pharma, pointing out that Valeant achieved this artificially low number by excluding drugs from companies that underwent mergers (such as counting Plavix as not invented at Sanofi because Hoechst merged into Sanofi, or Gleevec as not invented at Novartis because Ciba-Geigy became Novartis). The author characterizes Valeant as a "parasite on the research-driven drug industry" that largely avoids R&D spending while benefiting from the innovation ecosystem it criticizes.

## 2. HISTORY
After this June 2014 article was published, Valeant Pharmaceuticals faced significant developments that ultimately validated many of the concerns raised:

**The Allergan acquisition failed**: Valeant's hostile bid for Allergan was ultimately unsuccessful. Instead, in a dramatic turn of events, Actavis (later renamed Allergan) acquired the original Allergan in 2015 for approximately $70 billion, rejecting Valeant's lower offer.

**Valeant's business model unraveled (2015-2016)**: Valeant faced multiple crises including:
- Severe scrutiny over drug price increases (notably for heart drugs Isuprel and Nitropress, whose prices increased by 525% and 212% respectively)
- Investigation by Congress over pricing practices
- Questions about its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services
- Major stock decline of over 90% from its peak

**Executive consequences**: CEO J. Michael Pearson stepped down in 2016, and activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, which had backed the Allergan bid, sold its entire Valeant stake at a significant loss.

**Corporate transformation**: In 2018, Valeant changed its name to Bausch Health Companies and shifted its business model away from the acquisition-driven approach that characterized Pearson's tenure.

**R&D productivity trends**: In subsequent years, concerns about pharmaceutical R&D productivity persisted across the industry, though companies with strong innovative pipelines like Gilead and Celgene (mentioned positively in the article) generally maintained better performance, while companies pursuing Valeant's model of acquisitions without significant internal R&D remained controversial.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained these implicit predictions and evaluations:

- **Prediction**: Valeant's hostile bid for Allergan would not succeed because Allergan's investors were "suspicious of them, and rightly so."
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. The bid failed, and Allergan ultimately merged with Actavis instead.

- **Prediction**: Allergan would likely perform better in the future rather than worse, given its strong R&D track record.
  - **Outcome**: **Partially correct**. While Allergan was acquired (not by Valeant), its innovative assets and pipeline were valued by the market, leading to a premium acquisition by Actavis.

- **Prediction**: Valeant represented a parasitic business model that was fundamentally flawed.
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. Valeant's model collapsed spectacularly within 2-3 years, leading to massive shareholder losses, regulatory investigations, and ultimately a forced corporate transformation and name change.

- **Prediction**: Companies like Gilead and Celgene with strong R&D returns (21% and 32% respectively) represented better models than Valeant's approach.
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. Both companies generally maintained stronger performance and market position in subsequent years compared to Valeant, with Gilead's hepatitis C franchise becoming a blockbuster and Celgene maintaining strong growth.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article demonstrated prescient critical analysis of Valeant's unsustainable business model at a time when its stock was near peak levels, correctly identifying fundamental flaws that would lead to the company's dramatic collapse within two years.
