# The Other COX-2 Shoe Drops (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from December 2004 reflects on concerning safety news from Pfizer regarding COX-2 inhibitors. The author references previous coverage from October 2004 that had questioned the safety profile of this class of drugs. Like several COX-2 inhibitor commentaries of the mid-2000s, the piece follows accumulating signals that existing publications and data might not have fully captured the cardiovascular risks of these medications.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this article saw major developments for COX-2 inhibitors:

- **Vioxx (rofecoxib) withdrawal**: Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx from the market in September 2004 after the APPROVe trial showed increased cardiovascular risk with long-term use. This withdrawal prompted intense scrutiny of the entire COX-2 class.

- **FDA regulatory actions**: In February 2005, an FDA advisory panel reviewed the cardiovascular risks and recommended continued marketing of Celebrex and Bextra with stronger warnings. The FDA added black box warnings about cardiovascular risks to all prescription NSAIDs in April 2005.

- **Bextra withdrawal**: Pfizer withdrew Bextra (valdecoxib) in April 2005 at the FDA's request due to cardiovascular risks and rare but serious skin reactions.

- **Legal consequences**: Merck faced thousands of Vioxx lawsuits, ultimately settling for approximately $4.85 billion in 2007. The litigation and regulatory scrutiny reshaped drug safety oversight.

The key real-world impact was a dramatic shift away from COX-2 selective inhibitors toward traditional NSAIDs, with significantly reduced prescribing of the remaining COX-2 inhibitor (Celebrex) due to ongoing safety concerns.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Concern about further bad news from Pfizer**: The article's title suggests anticipation of negative developments beyond what had already emerged. This indeed materialized, as Bextra was withdrawn approximately four months after this article was published, representing the "other shoe" dropping for Pfizer's COX-2 franchise.

• **Safety concerns will have broader impact**: Implicit in articles of this era was that emerging cardiovascular safety signals would affect the entire COX-2 class, not just Vioxx. This proved correct—regulatory action, label warnings, and clinical practice changes extended across all COX-2 inhibitors, leading to sustained reductions in their use.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

## REASONING

This article captures a pivotal moment in drug safety history when COX-2 inhibitors faced intense scrutiny, but the analysis remains narrowly focused and lacks comprehensive detail—the brief format limits its long-term analytical value compared to more substantive treatments of the topic.
