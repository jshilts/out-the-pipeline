# The Mysterious Origins of the Quinolones (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a historical review by Gregory Bisacchi at AstraZeneca examining the murky origins of quinolone antibacterials. The conventional narrative holds that nalidixic acid (1962, Sterling) emerged from an impurity during chloroquine synthesis, but the article highlights that this account lacks solid historical foundation.

The research reveals forgotten early work: ICI filed three patents on quinolone antibacterials that almost certainly influenced Sterling's research, yet Sterling's patents never cited this prior art. There were also earlier Australian academic papers on quinolone compounds (without biological activity mentions) and intermediary Indian publications that did cite the ICI patents. The article suggests Sterling's shift from quinolone structures to the 1,8-naphthyridone structure of nalidixic acid may have been an attempt to circumvent ICI's earlier patents. The author reflects on how difficult it is to reconstruct accurate histories of drug discovery programs, as decisions made with limited data become hard to understand retrospectively, and documentation is often incomplete or self-serving.

## 2. HISTORY

The central historical claim examined—that quinolones originated from a chloroquine synthesis impurity—has remained the dominant narrative in pharmacology textbooks and medical literature. Bisacchi's research appears to have been the most comprehensive attempt to date to clarify these origins.

**Publication impact**: The 2015 article brought attention to Bisacchi's paper in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, which would have been read primarily by medicinal chemists and pharmaceutical historians rather than having broad clinical impact.

**ICI's missed opportunity**: The revelation that ICI had early quinolone patents but never pursued them commercially represents a significant "what if" in pharmaceutical history. ICI's pharmaceutical division eventually became part of AstraZeneca through various mergers, explaining Bisacchi's access to those archives.

**Broader context**: The theme of "lost" or overlooked drug discovery opportunities is common in pharmaceutical history. Other examples include the delayed recognition of penicillin's potential, the accidental discovery of cisplatin's anticancer properties, and numerous cases where companies abandoned promising compounds that competitors later developed successfully.

The article itself sparked some discussion in medicinal chemistry circles about the importance of thorough literature searching and proper citation of prior art, particularly relevant given increasing patent litigation in the pharmaceutical industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no explicit predictions about future developments, focusing entirely on historical reconstruction rather than forward-looking statements about quinolone development, market dynamics, or clinical applications.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article ranks highly interesting as it reveals the surprisingly murky origins of one of medicine's most important antibiotic classes and demonstrates how historical narratives in science can be incomplete or misleading. The detective story aspect—sifting through patents and forgotten publications—combined with the broader philosophical questions about reconstructing scientific history, makes it compelling reading for anyone interested in drug discovery, scientific methodology, or pharmaceutical history.
