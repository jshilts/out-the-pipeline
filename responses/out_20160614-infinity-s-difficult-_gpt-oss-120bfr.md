# Infinity's Difficult History (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary reported that Infinity Pharmaceuticals was shutting down its research‑and‑development operation after a string of clinical disappointments.  The most recent blow was the failure of duvelisib (IPI‑145), a PI3K‑δ/γ inhibitor, in a Phase II trial, which sent the stock down ~70 %.  Earlier setbacks included the abandonment of the HSP90 inhibitor retaspimycin (IPI‑504) after failed trials in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and non‑small‑cell lung cancer, and the termination of the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor saridegib (IPI‑926).  The author contrasted Infinity’s fate with that of contemporaries (Conforma, Kosan) that were acquired but also saw their HSP90 programs falter, concluding that good ideas and hard work are necessary but not sufficient for biotech success.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Acquisition and duvelisib approval** – In February 2017 Celgene announced the acquisition of Infinity Pharmaceuticals for about **$1.6 billion** in cash.  The deal closed later that year, and duvelisib became Celgene’s flagship asset.  The FDA granted **accelerated approval** to duvelisib (brand name **Copiktra**) in **September 2018** for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small‑lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL); a supplemental indication for follicular lymphoma followed in 2020.  

**Clinical performance and safety concerns** – Post‑marketing data revealed high rates of infections, colitis, and pneumonitis.  In 2020 the FDA added a **black‑box warning** and required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).  Market uptake has been modest, with sales peaking at roughly **$150 million** in 2020 and declining thereafter as newer, better‑tolerated agents entered the market (e.g., BTK inhibitors, other PI3K inhibitors).  

**Corporate changes** – Celgene itself was acquired by **Bristol‑Myers Squibb (BMS)** in November 2019 for $74 billion.  Duvelisib now resides in BMS’s oncology portfolio, but BMS has not announced any major expansion of its indication set beyond the existing approvals.  

**Other Infinity programs** –  
* **Saridegib (IPI‑926)** – Development was halted in 2015 after Phase I data failed to show sufficient activity; no further clinical work has been reported.  
* **Retaspimycin (IPI‑504)** – After the 2009 GIST failure and the 2013 NSCLC Phase II read‑out, the program was discontinued; the molecule never reached registration.  

**Industry context** – The broader HSP90 inhibitor field has largely collapsed; no HSP90‑targeted drug has achieved FDA approval as of 2025.  PI3K inhibition remains a validated strategy, but duvelisib’s safety profile has limited its commercial impact relative to competitors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Infinity’s R&D would shut down** – the company could not sustain its pipeline. | Infinity’s R&D was indeed shut down in mid‑2016, and the company was sold to Celgene in 2017. | Accurate (high confidence). |
| **HSP90 inhibitors would not succeed commercially** – “HSP90 has not worked out for anyone.” | No HSP90 inhibitor has been approved; the few that entered trials (e.g., BIIB021, tanespimycin) were discontinued. | Accurate (high confidence). |
| **Duvelisib would be a failure** – the Phase II disappointment implied the drug would not reach market. | Duvelisib received FDA approval in 2018 and is marketed, albeit with limited uptake and safety warnings. | Partially inaccurate (moderate confidence). |
| **Infinity would remain independent and eventually disappear** – implied no acquisition. | Infinity was acquired by Celgene (2017) and later became part of BMS (2019). | Inaccurate (moderate confidence). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a vivid snapshot of a biotech’s struggle and foreshadows broader trends (the collapse of HSP90 programs, the volatility of PI3K inhibitors).  Its hindsight value is moderate: some predictions were spot‑on, while others missed the eventual FDA approval of duvelisib and the acquisition path.
