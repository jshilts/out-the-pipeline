# Analysis of “Dosing by Body Surface Area” (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 article critiques a widely cited 2008 *FASEB Journal* paper that advocated for body surface area (BSA) normalization as the superior method for scaling drug doses—especially resveratrol—from animals to humans. The author highlights a striking contradiction: the FASEB paper cites references that actually argue *against* BSA-based dosing, calling it a “relic with little scientific foundation” and recommending its gradual discontinuation in clinical practice. The Science Magazine piece also notes ongoing controversy around BSA dosing in oncology—its primary domain—including debates about whether body weight might be more appropriate, particularly for obese patients, and points to an active PubPeer discussion questioning the FASEB paper’s conclusions.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade since this article, the BSA debate has evolved but not reached universal resolution:

- **Oncology practice shifted toward flat dosing and pharmacokinetics-guided dosing** for many drugs (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab), moving away from BSA for targeted therapies and immunotherapies, though BSA remains entrenched for older cytotoxic agents.
- **Obesity-adjusted dosing gained clinical traction**, with guidelines increasingly recommending capped doses or weight-based adjustments for obese patients to avoid overdosing.
- **Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics** have become the gold standard for dose individualization, particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows, sometimes rendering BSA obsolete.
- **Regulatory guidance evolved**: FDA and EMA began favoring physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling for first-in-human dose selection, reducing reliance on simple BSA extrapolation.
- **Evidence-based challenges mounted**: the oncology literature continued documenting BSA’s shortcomings, and proposed alternatives (e.g., lean body weight, fixed dosing) gained support for specific drug classes.
  - Some trials and guidelines now explicitly abandon BSA for drugs where PK/PD data show no dose–toxicity relationship tied to BSA.
  - Pediatric dosing increasingly uses allometric scaling based on weight rather than BSA.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Correct**:
  - The practice of BSA-based dosing faced continued scrutiny and gradual abandonment in subfields where evidence showed it was inappropriate.
  - The obesity-related dosing controversies persisted and led to changes in standard practice and guidelines.
  - The FASEB paper’s methodological flaws and overstated conclusions were largely validated by subsequent community discussion and research, aligning with the article’s skepticism.

- **Wrong/Mixed**:
  - BSA dosing did not disappear entirely; it remains prevalent for legacy cytotoxic agents in oncology, particularly carboplatin dosing (where BSA plus Calvert formula is standard).
  - The “relic” label was not universally adopted, and BSA continues to be taught and used in specific contexts where empiric evidence supports it or where alternatives have not been prospectively validated.

- **Nuanced Developments**:
  - The anticipated PubPeer debate likely contributed to a shift in consensus, but BSA’s role was refined rather than eliminated.
  - The rise of targeted therapies and immunotherapies made BSA less relevant, indirectly confirming the article’s implied critique.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 6**

- **Rationale**: The article addresses a durable, clinically important debate with real dosing implications for thousands of patients and billions in healthcare costs. It demonstrates critical scientific literacy by exposing citation malpractice and methodological flaws in a highly cited paper. Although it did not single-handedly end BSA dosing, it contributed to a gradual, evidence-driven evolution of clinical pharmacokinetics. The topic intersects with broader issues of research integrity, reproducibility, and translation of preclinical data. However, the impact was not transformative, as BSA persists in niches, and the article focused more on debunking than proposing alternatives.
