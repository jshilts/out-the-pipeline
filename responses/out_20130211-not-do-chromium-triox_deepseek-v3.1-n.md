# How Not to Do It: Chromium Trioxide (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a personal anecdote from Derek Lowe's chemistry blog "In the Pipeline" describing a lab accident that occurred during his graduate school days. The story recounts how an undergraduate assistant mistakenly used ethyl acetate instead of hydrochloric acid when preparing pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), a chromium(VI) oxidizing reagent. The error caused a violent chemical reaction that produced a fireball in the fume hood, covering Lowe in green chromium(III) oxide residue and necessitating an emergency shower. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about laboratory safety procedures and the importance of proper chemical handling.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2013 blog post, several relevant developments occurred:

**Lab Safety & Chromium Compounds:**
- Chromium(VI) compounds like chromium trioxide remain classified as hazardous substances requiring strict handling protocols
- OSHA maintained its chromium(VI) standards (29 CFR 1910.1026) with permissible exposure limits at 5 μg/m³ as an 8-hour time-weighted average
- No major changes to laboratory safety regulations specifically regarding chromium compounds occurred post-2013

**Scientific Context:**
- Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) continued its decline in routine use, with many laboratories adopting safer oxidation alternatives
- The Mars exploration context mentioned in the article remained relevant, with NASA's Curiosity rover (landed 2012) and Perseverance rover (landed 2021) conducting surface analysis, though chromium(VI) detection did not become a major focus for mission planning

**Blog & Author:**
- Derek Lowe continued writing "In the Pipeline" at Science Magazine until September 2023, when the blog was discontinued after 20+ years
- The blog maintained its reputation as a respected independent voice in drug discovery commentary

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It was primarily a retrospective anecdote with some contextual commentary about Mars exploration and chromium exposure concerns.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
This is a well-written cautionary tale that effectively illustrates lab safety principles, but it's primarily a personal anecdote without broader scientific or policy implications. While entertaining and educational for chemists, it lacks the broader impact or forward-looking analysis that would make it highly interesting beyond its specific context.
