# Selling It, And Selling It Hard (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a Bloomberg article detailing massive fines imposed on major pharmaceutical companies—Pfizer, Lilly, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, and Schering-Plough—for off-label promotion of prescription drugs. The author's key argument is that these companies treat billion-dollar fines as a calculable "cost of doing business" rather than a deterrent, because the profits from illegal off-label marketing exceed the financial penalties. The article frames this as a fundamental ethical and reputational problem for the pharmaceutical industry, questioning whether companies have adequately weighed the long-term cost of lost public trust and respect against short-term financial gains from non-compliant marketing practices.

## 2. HISTORY

The pattern of large pharmaceutical settlements for off-label promotion continued and intensified in the years following this 2009 article:

**Major Settlements (2010-2016):**
- **GlaxoSmithKline** paid $3 billion in 2012 for off-label promotion of antidepressants Paxil and Wellbutrin, among other violations
- **Johnson & Johnson** paid $2.2 billion in 2013 for off-label promotion of antipsychotic Risperdal 
- **Abbott Laboratories** paid $1.6 billion in 2012 for off-label marketing of Depakote
- **Novartis** paid $390 million in 2020 for off-label promotion of cancer drugs

**Regulatory and Policy Developments:**
- The FDA expanded warning letters and enforcement actions
- Corporate Integrity Agreements became more stringent, requiring extensive compliance monitoring
- Some prosecutions began targeting individual executives, not just corporations
- Increased whistleblower rewards under the False Claims Act incentivized internal reporting

**Industry Impact:**
- Most major pharmaceutical companies established enhanced compliance programs
- Sales representative training programs were significantly strengthened
- Physician payment transparency increased through the Sunshine Act (2013)
- Marketing practices became more conservative overall, though enforcement continued

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Off-label promotion would remain profitable despite fines**
- **Outcome: Mixed** - While settlements continued through the mid-2010s, the combination of larger fines, individual prosecutions, and strengthened compliance programs did lead to more cautious industry behavior. However, the fundamental financial calculation remained that for some blockbuster drugs, illegal marketing could still be profitable even after penalties.

**Prediction: Industry reputation would suffer long-term damage**
- **Outcome: Validated** - Public trust in pharmaceutical companies remained low, with numerous surveys showing the industry ranking among the least trusted. High-profile cases continued to generate negative media coverage and public skepticism about drug safety claims.

**Prediction (Implicit): Current enforcement approach wouldn't effectively deter violations**
- **Outcome: Partially accurate** - Larger settlements and individual prosecutions did create more deterrent effect than existed in 2009, but enforcement remained challenging and resource-intensive, with some companies still willing to risk violations for blockbuster drug revenues.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article proved prescient in highlighting a structural conflict between pharmaceutical profitability and regulatory compliance that persisted for years. Its analysis of "fines as business expense" was empirically validated by subsequent major settlements. The piece captured a critical moment when off-label promotion enforcement was escalating, making it historically significant for understanding pharmaceutical industry regulation and ethics debates through the 2010s.
