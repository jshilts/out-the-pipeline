# Terra Slightly Less Incognita (Sep 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post argues that the chemical space surrounding the steroid nucleus is vastly under‑explored because many hetero‑atom‑substituted analogues are synthetically difficult. The author cites abiraterone—a CYP17 inhibitor derived from a “slightly modified” steroid—as a rare example of a hetero‑atom‑rich steroid that reached the market (FDA approval in 2011 for metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer). The piece muses that, with far more powerful synthesis (even jokingly “alien” technology), a library of such modified steroids could be generated and screened for drug activity. An update mentions Cortistatin A, a highly functionalised steroid‑like natural product, as another illustration of the concept.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Abiraterone (Zytiga®)  
* **Regulatory outcome** – FDA approval was granted on 29 Apr 2011 for mCRPC; the same year the article was written.  
* **Clinical uptake** – By 2023 the drug had generated > $5 billion in worldwide sales, becoming a standard of care together with prednisone. Real‑world data show a median overall‑survival benefit of ~ 4 months versus placebo.  
* **Patent & generics** – Patents expired in the U.S. in 2022; generic abiraterone acetate entered the market in 2023, expanding patient access.  
* **Combination strategies** – Clinical trials have combined abiraterone with androgen‑receptor antagonists (e.g., enzalutamide) and with novel agents (e.g., PARP inhibitors). Some combinations showed additive benefit, but increased toxicity limited widespread adoption.  

### Other steroid‑derived CYP17 inhibitors  
* **Orteronel (TAK‑700)** – Reached Phase III but failed to meet overall‑survival endpoints in 2015; development discontinued.  
* **Seviteronel** – Showed modest activity in early trials; as of 2024 it remains in Phase II for breast and prostate cancer, with no FDA approval.  

### Synthetic advances in steroid diversification  
* **Late‑stage C–H functionalisation** – Since 2012, methods such as palladium‑catalysed C–H amination, copper‑mediated fluorination, and photoredox C–H alkylation have been applied to steroid cores, lowering the barrier to hetero‑atom insertion.  
* **Biocatalysis** – Engineered cytochrome P450s and ketoreductases have enabled regio‑selective oxidation and amination of sterols, producing analogues that were previously inaccessible.  
* **Flow chemistry & telescoped sequences** – Several academic groups (e.g., Baran, Ley) reported continuous‑flow routes that assemble complex steroidal scaffolds in fewer steps, but these have not yet translated into commercial drug pipelines.  

### Cortistatin A  
* **Biological profile** – Discovered as a potent inhibitor of HIV‑1 replication and as a selective modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor.  
* **Development status** – No clinical trials have been launched; the molecule’s size, metabolic instability, and synthetic complexity have limited its progression beyond a chemical‑probe.  
* **Synthetic work** – Total syntheses were published in 2012 (Totally Synthetic blog) and later streamlined in 2018 using a convergent approach, but the routes remain multi‑step (> 20 steps) and are not amenable to large‑scale manufacturing.  

### Overall impact on the “unexplored steroid space”  
* The success of abiraterone validated that modest hetero‑atom modifications of steroids can yield marketable drugs, but the broader chemical space remains sparsely populated.  
* No other hetero‑atom‑rich steroid has reached FDA approval as of early 2026.  
* Research interest persists, especially for steroid‑based epigenetic modulators and selective nuclear‑receptor ligands, but commercial pipelines have not expanded dramatically beyond the few examples above.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** “If intelligent (and oddly motivated) aliens landed tomorrow … I might ask them … to scatter basic amines, ethers, sulfonamides … around the steroid nucleus.”  
  - **Outcome:** No alien technology, but modern synthetic methods have indeed increased the ability to install such functionalities. The impact has been incremental rather than revolutionary; only one drug (abiraterone) emerged, and no large‑scale “hit‑rate” libraries of steroid analogues have been reported.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The author implied that many more steroid‑derived drugs could appear if synthetic barriers were lowered.  
  - **Outcome:** While C–H functionalisation and biocatalysis have lowered barriers, the pipeline has not produced additional FDA‑approved steroid drugs with hetero‑atom substitutions beyond abiraterone. The field remains niche, with most new androgen‑axis drugs (enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide) being non‑steroidal.  

- **Mention of Cortistatin A as a “more highly modified” steroid:** The author suggested it as another proof‑of‑concept.  
  - **Outcome:** Cortistatin A remains a research tool; no clinical candidate has emerged, and its synthetic difficulty continues to limit broader exploration.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a concise, historically interesting snapshot that correctly identified a rare success (abiraterone) and anticipated synthetic advances, but the broader predictions have not materialised into a wave of new steroid drugs. It is moderately engaging for readers interested in medicinal chemistry trends.
