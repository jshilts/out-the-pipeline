# Novartis Closing Horsham (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2013 blog post reported that Novartis appeared to be closing its Horsham, UK site, citing reports of a sudden managers' meeting where staff were informed the entire facility would be shuttered. The author noted the company had previously discussed "redeveloping" the site, but this announcement appeared to come as a worst-case surprise to those involved.

## 2. HISTORY
Novartis did indeed close its Horsham research facility in 2014, completing the shutdown over an 18-month period that resulted in approximately 400 job losses at the site. This closure was part of broader global restructuring within Novartis; the company invested £50 million to expand its other UK facility in Grimsby around the same period. In the years following 2013, Novartis continued major portfolio realignments, including the $16 billion acquisition of The Medicines Company in 2019 and various divestments of assets, while shifting research priorities toward oncology and specialized therapies. The Horsham site's closure reflected industry-wide consolidation trends in pharmaceutical R&D infrastructure.
