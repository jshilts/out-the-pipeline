# Zafgen's Epoxide Clears A Hurdle (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Zafgen's weight loss drug beloranib, a covalent Met-AP2 inhibitor with an epoxide warhead, which had just successfully completed its first Phase II trial. The trial showed impressive efficacy with severely obese patients losing an average of 22 pounds in 12 weeks. While acknowledging the strong efficacy results, the author expresses caution about potential long-term toxicity concerns that would only be fully addressed in Phase III trials. The article notes that beloranib has an advantage toxicologically because it would be used for relatively short courses of therapy rather than lifelong treatment. The author also defends the pharmaceutical industry against criticism about preferring chronic treatments over cures, arguing that patent lifetimes naturally limit monopoly periods regardless of treatment duration. The piece expresses optimism about the potential for epoxide-based drugs and suggests this mechanism (metabolic approach to obesity) may be more promising than appetite-suppressant approaches.

## 2. HISTORY
Beloranib's subsequent development trajectory was dramatically different from the initial optimism. While the drug continued to show impressive weight loss efficacy, **it was never approved and ultimately failed due to safety concerns**:

- **Phase IIb trial (2014-2015)**: Continued to demonstrate strong weight reduction in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and hypothalamic obesity
- **Clinical holds and deaths**: The FDA placed beloranib on clinical hold in **December 2015** following two patient deaths in the Prader-Willi syndrome trial due to blood clots (venous thromboembolism)
- **Company impact**: Zafgen's stock plummeted, and the company underwent major restructuring, pivoting to a different compound (ZGN-1061) with a different mechanism
- **Drug development failure**: Beloranib was **never approved by the FDA** and development was ultimately abandoned
- **Epoxide covalent drugs**: While beloranib specifically failed, covalent drugs with other warheads continued to succeed (e.g., various kinase inhibitors), so this didn't represent a categorical failure of the covalent approach
- **Obesity drug landscape**: The field moved toward GLP-1 agonists rather than metabolic approaches like Met-AP2 inhibition, with semaglutide (Wegovy) becoming the dominant approved treatment

The safety concerns that the author worried about ("some sort of funny longer-term toxicity") proved prescient, though the issue was thromboembolic events rather than general long-term effects.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions, both implicit and explicit:

• **"Phase III will be the big one, because the worry here will be some sort of funny longer-term toxicity"** → **ACCURATE**: This prediction proved entirely correct. While the specific issue wasn't general long-term toxicity but rather acute thromboembolic events, the safety concerns that would emerge in later phase trials were indeed the downfall of the drug.

• **"I'd bet on beloranib going fine through the rest of Phase II"** → **ACCURATE**: The drug did successfully complete additional Phase IIb trials before the safety issues emerged.

• **Implicit prediction that beloranib would reach approval and clinical use** → **INACCURATE**: Despite strong efficacy, the drug never reached the market due to the safety issues that became apparent in later-stage trials.

• **"I'll be glad to see an epoxide-based drug prove itself in the clinic"** → **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**: While beloranib specifically failed to prove itself, covalent drugs with other warhead chemistries continued to succeed in the clinic.

## 4. INTEREST
**Decile Score: 4**

This article represents a fairly routine commentary on Phase II results that reveals the inherent uncertainty in drug development—the safety concerns the author expressed proved prescient when beloranib ultimately failed due to thromboembolic events despite strong efficacy. While it captures an interesting moment in obesity drug development, it doesn't address fundamentally transformative developments or have exceptional long-term importance, falling in the middle range of interest.
