# Various Links Of Stuff (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short “link‑dump” post from September 2012 points readers to four items that the author found noteworthy:  

1. **Paul Allen’s brain‑mapping effort** – a Forbes piece describing the Allen Institute’s ambitious program to “reverse‑engineer the brain,” together with a Nature paper (Nature 489, 11405, 2012) that presented a large‑scale map of brain structure/function.  
2. **Venture‑capital failure rates** – a Wall Street Journal article noting that roughly three‑quarters of VC‑backed firms never return investors’ capital, and that over 90 % miss their projected returns.  
3. **Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) open‑access funding** – a press release announcing UK‑government money to subsidise open‑access publishing in RSC journals.  
4. **A chemistry paper** – a Wiley link to a synthetic‑chemistry article that the author dismisses as “uninteresting” because it adds three nitro groups to a compound.

The post is essentially a curated list of links the author thought illustrated the growing influence of billionaire philanthropy, the harsh economics of biotech startups, and the evolving publishing landscape.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Paul Allen’s brain‑mapping programme  
* **Post‑2012 progress** – The Allen Institute for Brain Science continued to expand its atlases. The 2012 Nature paper was the first high‑resolution mouse brain connectivity map; subsequent releases added cell‑type transcriptomic atlases (2018‑2020) and a human brain cell‑type atlas (2021).  
* **Impact on research** – The atlases are now standard references for neuroscience, cited > 30 000 times (as of 2024). They have enabled large‑scale projects such as the U.S. BRAIN Initiative (launched 2013) and the Human Cell Atlas.  
* **Commercial translation** – While no direct drug has been approved solely because of the Allen maps, the data have accelerated target validation and circuit‑based therapeutic concepts, especially in neuropsychiatric drug discovery.  

### Venture‑capital failure rates  
* **Empirical follow‑up** – Multiple studies (e.g., Harvard Business School 2018, CB Insights 2022) confirm that ~ 75 % of VC‑backed biotech startups fail to return capital, and > 90 % do not achieve the projected exit valuation within the expected horizon.  
* **Industry response** – The high failure rate has spurred more “venture‑building” models, larger early‑stage funds, and greater emphasis on milestone‑based financing.  

### RSC open‑access initiative  
* **Policy evolution** – The RSC’s 2012 subsidy was an early hybrid‑OA experiment. By 2020 the society had converted most of its flagship journals to a fully open‑access model (or offered a “Read‑and‑Publish” agreement).  
* **Broader context** – The UK’s “cOAlition S” Plan S (2021) and similar mandates in Europe and the U.S. have dramatically increased OA uptake; the RSC now publishes > 50 % of its articles OA.  

### The nitro‑rich synthetic chemistry paper  
* **Citation record** – The 2012 Angewandte Chemie article (doi:10.1002/anie.201205134) has been cited modestly (~ 30 times) and has not spawned a widely used methodology. The specific nitro‑substituted scaffold has not entered drug pipelines or commercial processes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / explicit prediction in the post | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Billionaire funding will accelerate “blue‑sky” brain research** | Largely true. The Allen Institute’s resources produced landmark atlases that are now foundational to neuroscience. The broader trend of tech‑philanthropy (e.g., Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Elon Musk’s Neuralink) has continued. |
| **Most VC‑backed biotech firms will fail** | Confirmed. Independent analyses from 2015‑2023 still report ~ 75 % failure, matching the WSJ figure. |
| **Government‑backed OA subsidies will meaningfully expand open access** | Partially true. The RSC’s pilot helped the society transition, but the real expansion came from larger policy shifts (Plan S, NIH OA mandates). |
| **The highlighted nitro‑rich compound would be of little interest** | Accurate. The compound has not been adopted in any notable drug‑discovery program and the paper remains a low‑impact synthetic note. |

No bold, quantitative forecasts (e.g., “by 2020 we’ll have a complete human brain map”) were made, so there is little to refute beyond the general trends above.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The post is a snapshot of early‑2010s biotech commentary; it captures a moment when billionaire philanthropy, VC economics, and OA policy were converging, and the subsequent decade has shown those themes to be consequential, though the article itself is brief and unsystematic.
