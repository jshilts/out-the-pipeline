# The Small Drug Companies And the Big Ones (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 post by Bruce Booth highlighted the stark disparity between research‑and‑development (R&D) spending of the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms and that of the entire venture‑backed biotech sector. Using publicly available budget data, Booth estimated that the top 20 pharma companies collectively spent about **26 times** more on R&D than all privately‑financed biotech startups combined. By isolating Pfizer’s R&D budget, he argued that a single large‑pharma company could fund roughly **1,000** small biotechs—more than twice the number of such companies that existed at the time. Booth also noted that, when facility‑related costs are included, big‑pharma’s utility and maintenance expenses alone could cover the whole VC‑backed biotech universe. The post framed this as a classic power‑law distribution and asked whether the “bang‑for‑buck” from small companies might be higher than that from the giants.

## 2. HISTORY  
**R&D spending trends (2011‑2024)**  
- **Big‑pharma**: The combined R&D outlay of the top 20 companies grew from roughly **$70 billion** in 2011 to **≈ $200 billion** in 2023 (EvaluatePharma, BCC reports). The growth rate slowed after 2015, and many firms announced “R&D efficiency” initiatives, but absolute spend continued to rise.  
- **Venture‑backed biotech**: VC‑funded biotech R&D funding rose sharply, peaking at **≈ $30 billion** in 2021 (PitchBook, BCC). After the 2022‑23 market correction, annual funding fell back to **≈ $20 billion**. The number of active venture‑backed biotech companies increased from ~800 in 2011 to > 1,200 by 2023, though many are “pre‑clinical” or “early‑stage” and do not yet have products in the clinic.

**Drug approvals and pipeline impact**  
- **Small‑company breakthroughs**: Since 2011, biotech‑originated drugs have accounted for an increasing share of FDA approvals. In 2022, **≈ 55 %** of new molecular entities (NMEs) received at least one FDA approval were biotech‑originated, many stemming from venture‑backed firms (e.g., CAR‑T therapies Kymriah, Yescarta; gene‑therapy Zolgensma; RNA‑based Onpattro).  
- **Acquisitions**: Large pharma has increasingly relied on external innovation. Between 2011 and 2023, the top 10 pharma companies completed **≈ 150** acquisitions of biotech firms, spending **>$150 billion** in total. Notable deals include Gilead’s purchase of Kite (2017), Roche’s acquisition of Spark Therapeutics (2019), and Pfizer’s purchase of Seagen (2023). These deals illustrate that the “small‑company” R&D engine has become a primary source of new assets for the majors.  

**Productivity and “bang‑for‑buck”**  
- **Success rates**: Clinical‑phase transition probabilities for biotech‑originated programs have been modestly higher than for large‑pharma internal pipelines (≈ 10 % vs ≈ 7 % from Phase I to approval, per a 2022 Tufts Center analysis).  
- **Cost per approved drug**: Estimates of the average out‑of‑pocket R&D cost per FDA‑approved drug have narrowed the gap. A 2020 Deloitte study placed the median cost for a biotech‑originated drug at **≈ $2.5 billion**, versus **≈ $3.5 billion** for a large‑pharma internally developed drug, suggesting a modest efficiency advantage for the smaller players.  

**Policy and ecosystem shifts**  
- **Regulatory incentives**: The FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” designation (launched 2012) and the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) have accelerated review timelines, benefitting many small‑company programs.  
- **Funding mechanisms**: The NIH’s “Accelerating Medicines Partnership” (AMP) and the FDA’s “Rare Pediatric Disease” voucher program have provided additional non‑VC capital to biotech firms, further diversifying the funding landscape.  

Overall, the power‑law disparity noted in 2011 persists—big pharma still dwarfs the sector in absolute R&D dollars—but the relative productivity of venture‑backed biotech has improved, and the small‑company pipeline now supplies a substantial fraction of innovative medicines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original article did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Small biotech firms deliver more R&D efficiency (“bang‑for‑buck”) than large pharma.*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially validated. Independent analyses (e.g., Tufts, Deloitte) show modestly higher success rates and lower median cost per approved drug for biotech‑originated programs. However, the absolute number of approvals still heavily favors large pharma because of their larger pipelines and broader therapeutic breadth.  

- **Prediction 2:** *The sheer scale of big‑pharma R&D could, in theory, fund the entire VC‑backed biotech universe.*  
  - **Outcome:** Numerically still true. In 2023, the top 20 pharma companies’ combined R&D spend (~$200 B) exceeds the total venture‑backed biotech R&D funding (~$20 B) by a factor of **≈ 10**. The earlier 26× estimate was based on 2011 numbers; the ratio has narrowed but remains an order of magnitude.  

No other concrete forecasts were made, so no further comparison is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece is a concise, data‑driven snapshot of the biotech‑pharma funding landscape that foreshadowed the growing importance of venture‑backed innovation—a theme that has shaped the industry over the past decade. Its relevance endures, though the raw numbers have shifted, making it a solid but not groundbreaking historical commentary.
