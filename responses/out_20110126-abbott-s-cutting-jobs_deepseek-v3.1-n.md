# Article Title (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post reported on Abbott Laboratories announcing 1,900 layoffs (approximately 2% of the company's workforce) in January 2011. These cuts were in addition to 3,000 layoffs that had been announced the previous fall. The author noted that sources indicated research positions were affected in this latest round, though specific numbers were not yet available.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2011 layoff announcement was part of broader restructuring trends in the pharmaceutical industry during that period. In the subsequent years:

**Company Developments**: Abbott underwent significant corporate restructuring. In 2012-2013, Abbott split into two separate companies: Abbott Laboratories (focusing on medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products) and AbbVie (a research-based pharmaceutical company). This corporate separation likely influenced the job restructuring patterns.

**Research and Development Impact**: The layoffs in research did not prevent Abbott/AbbVie from continuing drug development. Notably, AbbVie went on to develop and receive FDA approval for key drugs including humira (adalimumab), which became one of the world's best-selling drugs, and later treatments like venetoclax and others in their pipeline.

**Industry Context**: These layoffs reflected broader pharmaceutical industry trends in the early 2010s, where many large companies were streamlining operations and focusing R&D investments more selectively, often after patent cliffs or in preparation for strategic repositioning.

The company ultimately maintained its position as a major player in both pharmaceuticals (through AbbVie) and medical devices/diagnostics (through Abbott).

Rating: **3/10**

This was essentially routine industry news about corporate restructuring, with limited long-term analytical value or broader scientific implications beyond the immediate employment impact.
