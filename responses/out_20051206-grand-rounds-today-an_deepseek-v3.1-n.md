# Grand Rounds Today, and Next Week (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief announcement blog post from December 6, 2005, informing readers about Grand Rounds, which was a weekly blog carnival featuring curated medical blog posts. The author notes that the current edition is available at Dr. Charles's blog and announces that they will be hosting the next installment the following week. The post includes a call for submissions, inviting readers to send links to medical blog posts for inclusion in the upcoming Grand Rounds edition.

## 2. HISTORY

Grand Rounds was a real medical blog carnival that ran weekly from roughly 2004 to approximately 2018-2019, featuring curated collections of medical blog posts from physicians, nurses, patients, and healthcare professionals. These roundups served as important community-building and educational tools in the early medical blogging era, helping to highlight quality medical writing and foster connections within the healthcare blogging community.

However, by the late 2010s, medical blogging largely migrated to other platforms, and Grand Rounds gradually ceased regular publication as the medical social media landscape evolved toward platforms like Twitter, specialized medical forums, and professional networks. The blog carnival format itself became less common across all niches as social media aggregation changed how curated content was shared and consumed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This particular post does not contain predictions about biotechnology or medical science. It is purely an administrative announcement about a blog carnival schedule. The author simply announces hosting duties and requests blog post submissions for the next edition.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

While this post documents a real historical phenomenon in medical blogging and online medical community building, it is primarily an administrative announcement rather than substantive commentary about biotechnology, medical science, or healthcare policy. It lacks analytical content or forward-looking insights that would be valuable for retrospective analysis. The post serves mainly as documentation of a blog scheduling matter.

The content is of limited long-term importance for understanding biotechnology developments, though it does capture a snapshot of early medical blog community practices that were significant for their time but have since been largely superseded by modern social media platforms.
