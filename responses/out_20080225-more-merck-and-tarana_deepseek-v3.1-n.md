# More On Merck and Taranabant (February 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on Merck's reputation following the Vioxx controversy and expresses concern about the company's new drug taranabant, a cannabinoid CB-1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist for obesity. The author acknowledges Merck's continued scientific excellence and innovative drug development capabilities, while arguing that Vioxx itself was not necessarily a bad drug but was oversold by marketing to an excessively broad patient population, leading to the revelation of cardiovascular side effects that destroyed Merck's reputation and triggered expensive litigation.

The author worries that Merck is repeating this pattern with taranabant, which targets the same CB-1 receptor pathway as Sanofi's rimonabant (which faced safety issues). While acknowledging potential differences in selectivity and mechanism (inverse agonist vs antagonist), the author expresses concern about discovering CNS functions "while a bunch of lawyers watch" and fears another reputational disaster that could further damage the company.

## 2. HISTORY

**Taranabant's Development and Failure:**
Taranabant progressed into Phase 3 clinical trials for obesity but was terminated in 2008 due to psychiatric side effects, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation - similar problems that led to the failure of rimonabant. The CB-1 receptor antagonist mechanism proved to have unacceptable CNS side effects across multiple compounds.

**Rimonabant's Fate:**
Sanofi's rimonabant (Acomplia) was approved in Europe in 2006 but was never approved by the FDA due to safety concerns. The European Medicines Agency suspended it in 2008, and it was withdrawn globally in 2009 due to the same psychiatric adverse events that plagued taranabant.

**CB-1 Receptor Field Collapse:**
The entire class of centrally-acting CB-1 receptor antagonists was abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry following these failures. No CB-1 antagonist has achieved regulatory approval for obesity or metabolic disease, representing a major setback for this therapeutic approach.

**Vioxx Litigation Resolution:**
Merck settled Vioxx litigation for approximately $4.85 billion in 2007-2008, resolving most claims. The company maintained that it acted responsibly and that the settlement reflected the costs of prolonged litigation rather than admission of wrongdoing.

**Merck's Subsequent Performance:**
Despite these setbacks, Merck remained a major pharmaceutical company. The company continued to face challenges in drug development, and the author's broader concern about drug safety scrutiny and litigation risks became a persistent theme in the industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Taranabant Safety Concerns**: The author expressed concern about taranabant's safety profile and the wisdom of testing CNS compounds under intense legal and regulatory scrutiny. **Outcome**: This concern was prescient - taranabant failed in 2008 due to psychiatric side effects, validating the worry about discovering "new things about human CNS functions while a bunch of lawyers watch."

• **Potential for "Another Vioxx Path"**: The author worried that taranabant could lead to another reputational and financial disaster similar to Vioxx. **Outcome**: While taranabant did fail, it did not create the same level of litigation or reputational damage as Vioxx, partly because the drug was terminated before reaching the market. The prediction of trouble was correct, but the scale was smaller than feared.

• **CB-1 Receptor Mechanism Uncertainty**: The author noted uncertainty about whether inverse agonism vs antagonism would make taranabant safer than rimonabant. **Outcome**: This mechanism difference proved irrelevant - both drugs failed due to psychiatric side effects, suggesting the CB-1 receptor pathway itself was problematic for obesity therapy.

• **General Concern About Drug Development Under Legal Scrutiny**: The broader worry about discovering CNS mechanisms while lawyers watch reflected the post-Vioxx environment. **Outcome**: The pharmaceutical industry did become more risk-averse in drug development, with increased focus on safety and greater regulatory scrutiny, particularly for chronic therapies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates strong predictive insight about drug development risks in the post-Vioxx era, correctly anticipating taranabant's failure while providing thoughtful analysis of pharmaceutical industry challenges. The piece captures an important moment in drug safety awareness and industry accountability. However, the assessment conservatively focuses mainly on one company and one drug rather than broader transformation of pharmaceutical R&D.
