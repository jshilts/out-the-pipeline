# Pharma and Ebola (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the pharmaceutical industry's response. It argues that accusations of Big Pharma negligence for not developing an Ebola vaccine are misplaced, explaining that Ebola had historically caused fewer than 1,600 deaths between 1976-2012, making it economically unviable for private companies to invest hundreds of millions in vaccine development. The piece notes that immune-system therapies (antibodies and vaccines) rather than small-molecule drugs are the most promising approach for Ebola, highlights existing NIH research programs, and mentions GSK's recent acquisition of Okairos which was working on an Ebola vaccine with NIH. The author contends that until the 2014 outbreak, diverting significant resources to Ebola would have been questionable given far larger public health problems in Africa like malaria and other infectious diseases that kill many more people.

## 2. HISTORY

The biomedical response to Ebola evolved dramatically after 2014:

**Vaccines**: The experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (developed by Merck and NewLink Genetics, originally from Canadian government research) underwent accelerated clinical trials and demonstrated high efficacy. It received FDA approval in December 2019, European Commission approval in November 2019, and WHO prequalification in November 2019. The vaccine has been deployed in outbreak responses in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries, with real-world effectiveness confirmed during subsequent epidemics.

**Therapeutics**: The 2014 outbreak spurred development of antibody-based treatments. The monoclonal antibody cocktail mAb114 (developed from a 1995 Ebola survivor) and the triple-antibody REGN-EB3 showed efficacy and were granted FDA approval in 2020. These therapies demonstrated that Ebola mortality could be substantially reduced when administered early.

**Public Health Infrastructure**: CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) was established in 2017, funded by foundations and governments, creating a new model for preparing vaccines against emerging diseases before outbreaks occur. The Ebola crisis highlighted weaknesses in global response systems and led to WHO reforms and strengthened emergency response frameworks.

**Business Realities**: The economics of Ebola vaccines remain challenging; deployment occurs primarily through government and humanitarian purchases rather than commercial markets, confirming the original article's analysis. However, the 2014 outbreak created sufficient political will to justify public investment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Immune-system therapies are a better bet"** - **ACCURATE**: Confirmed by the success of both rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (high efficacy in preventing disease) and monoclonal antibody therapies that reduce mortality.

• **"Small-molecule therapies [can be] crossed off"** - **LARGELY ACCURATE**: No small-molecule antiviral has achieved wide success against Ebola. Favipiravir was tested but showed limited efficacy. Treatment advances came primarily from biologics (vaccines and antibodies).

• **Economic unviability for private development** - **FUNDAMENTALLY CORRECT BUT OUTDATED**: The prediction that market economics wouldn't support Ebola vaccine development proved right. However, the emergence of new funding mechanisms (CEPI, government emergency funds) created alternative pathways that led to successful vaccine development and regulatory approval.

• **The broader concern about airborne transmission** - **NEVER MATERIALIZED**: Ebola remained primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, and no airborne-transmissible mutations emerged to date.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article represents an unusually clear-eyed analysis that correctly identified both the scientific realities and economic constraints of Ebola treatment development, contrasting sharply with contemporaneous media coverage that often misunderstood pharmaceutical economics. Its reasoned assessment of what was scientifically achievable versus economically viable proved prescient.
