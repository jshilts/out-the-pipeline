# Fear Of Academic Chemistry? (Nov 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's commentary examines a cultural tension in medicinal chemistry between academic synthetic chemistry training and industrial drug discovery practice. He observes that many medicinal chemists come from academic labs where they performed complex natural product total syntheses—"glass-filament spiderweb-sculpture work"—which was traditionally valued as preparation for industry roles because it builds resilience and independent problem-solving skills.

However, Lowe suggests that industrial chemists may have developed a counter-bias: having endured arduous multi-step syntheses in academia, they resolve never to get stuck in such situations again. While avoiding 20-step syntheses in drug discovery is rational, Lowe worries this aversion extends too far, causing chemists to resist adopting newer, more efficient synthetic methods. He cites palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions as an example: many industrial chemists stick with outdated 1990s conditions, accepting 50% yields and cleanup problems as normal, rather than adopting improved protocols that could increase efficiency and compound output.

The underlying tension Lowe identifies is that drug discovery prioritizes making compounds quickly over elegant chemistry ("chemistry is not an end in itself"). This creates pressure to use familiar, though suboptimal, methods rather than investing time to learn academic innovations. Yet Lowe cautions against reflexive dismissal of academic advances, noting that even now-mainstream Pd couplings were once considered "out-there."

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following Lowe's 2009 commentary, several developments reshaped pharmaceutical chemistry and validated aspects of his analysis.

First, the practice of medicinal chemistry evolved significantly away from complex natural product synthesis toward more practical synthetic strategies. Drug discovery timelines compressed, with combinatorial chemistry and parallel synthesis becoming standard for library generation. Small molecule drug discovery increasingly favored building-block approaches over lengthy linear syntheses.

Palladium-catalyzed coupling continued to dominate pharmaceutical chemistry and became even more prevalent. However, Lowe's criticism about outdated methods persisted. Academic labs continued developing improved Pd catalysts—such as BrettPhos, XPhos, RuPhos, and other bulky, electron-rich phosphine ligands—giving superior yields with lower catalyst loadings and broader substrate scope. Articles throughout the 2010s in *Organic Process Research & Development* frequently highlighted gaps between academic advances and industrial practice.

By the mid-2010s to 2020s, many pharmaceutical companies established dedicated catalysis groups and technology development teams to bridge this gap. Process chemistry groups increasingly adopted newer ligands and conditions. For example, Buchwald-Hartwig amination with modern ligands largely displaced older methods like Pd(dba)₂/dppf protocols. Suzuki-Miyaura couplings evolved from simple Pd(PPh₃)₄ or Pd(PPh₃)₂Cl₂ systems to metal-free conditions, photoredox methods, and continuous-flow systems.

The 2010-2025 period also saw:

1. **Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD)** grew substantially, emphasizing more modular synthetic routes and simpler synthetic targets rather than complex natural product-inspired molecules.

2. **Late-stage functionalization (C-H activation, C-H functionalization)** emerged as an academic field offering attractive strategies to derivatize complex molecules without multi-step sequences. Industry adoption varied: some companies embraced these methods for diversifying lead series, while others found selectivity and scalability challenges limited utility.

3. **High-throughput experimentation (HTE), design of experiments (DoE), and machine learning** infiltrated reaction optimization. Automated platforms for exploring reaction space reduced the inertia Lowe described by systematically evaluating conditions rather than relying on heuristic choices.

4. **Photoredox catalysis and electrochemistry** gained attention from 2012 onward, with industrial labs testing whether these could solve problems inaccessible to traditional methods. Novartis, Merck, and others published successful applications in drug synthesis, though routine adoption remained limited due to infrastructure needs.

5. Several newly approved drugs exemplified these trends. For example, many kinase inhibitors (e.g., ibrutinib, acalabrutinib) rely heavily on Pd couplings, though their syntheses often use standard conditions rather than newest academic methods. Complex polycyclic drugs requiring multi-step synthesis generally faced harsher development scrutiny due to cost and scalability concerns.

However, Lowe's core concern remained relevant: many drug discovery labs still defaulted to familiar methods rather than continuously adopting academic innovations. Process chemistry groups, which handle later-stage development and manufacturing, proved more aggressive adopters of new methods than discovery chemistry groups facing acute time pressure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2009 article itself did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather diagnosed an ongoing cultural phenomenon. In authorial tone, Lowe suggested:

- **That many medicinal chemists would persist in using outdated conditions** unless organizational and cultural practices changed.
- **That newer academic methods eventually filter into industry**, as Pd couplings did, but adoption would likely lag unless efficiency benefits became undeniable.

Comparing to subsequent developments:

• **Persistence of method inertia**: This prediction largely held true. Through the 2010s and into the 2020s, pharmaceutical discovery chemists continued relying on familiar, if suboptimal, conditions. Adoption of new catalytic systems (e.g., photoredox, C-H activation) proceeded slowly, with many companies only exploring these when traditional approaches repeatedly failed. The core driver Lowe identified—discovery timelines prioritizing "enough" over "optimal"—persisted.

• **Selective adoption of academic advances**: Pd couplings did become even more dominant in pharmaceutical synthesis, but adoption of specific improvements to Pd catalysis remained uneven. Academic labs developed dozens of improved ligands (e.g., SPhos, XPhos, BrettPhos, RuPhos, tBuBrettPhos) with documented superiority for many transformations, yet discovery labs often continued using older systems like Pd(PPh₃)₄, Pd(OAc)₂/dppf, or standard Pd₂(dba)₃/ligand combinations. Reasonable justification existed—familiarity, existing inventory, broader screening in discovery—but Lowe's concern about missed opportunities proved valid.

• **Evolution away from complex synthesis**: While Lowe did not explicitly predict this, drug discovery further deemphasized complex natural product-like targets in favor of synthetically accessible scaffolds. Fragment-based approaches, macrocycles, and simpler heterocyclic frameworks became increasingly common. The "two yields" concept remained operative: "enough" generally meant 5-20 mg for screening, and synthetic tractability became a key criterion in target selection.

• **Infrastructure-driven change**: Lowe did not anticipate how automated platforms and HTE would alter the adoption equation. Companies investing in HTE (AbbVie, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, GSK, and others) found they could rapidly evaluate new conditions, partially overcoming the inertia he described. However, this required capital investment and organizational will, and many smaller companies and academic drug discovery consortia lacked such resources.

In summary, Lowe's diagnosis proved prescient regarding persistent cultural and practical barriers to adopting academic synthetic advances, though he may not have foreseen how automation and analysis platforms would partially mitigate these obstacles.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

The article captures enduring tensions between academic innovation and industrial practice that remain relevant 15+ years later. While focused specifically on synthetic chemistry rather than broader drug discovery, it diagnoses a persistent cultural phenomenon with concrete impact on productivity and efficiency. Lower than top tier because it addresses methodology rather than fundamental science or breakthrough therapies, but insightful in identifying non-obvious barriers to technology transfer.
