# TauRx's Funding Is Odd (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights the unusual funding structure of TauRx Pharmaceuticals, an Alzheimer's disease drug development company. The author notes that TauRx had just received a $10.5 million follow-on investment from Dundee Corporation, a Canadian asset management company focusing on resources, real estate, and infrastructure - sectors quite distant from biotechnology. Additionally, TauRx's major funding came from Genting Berhad, a Malaysian conglomerate whose core business involves casinos, resorts, and hospitality rather than pharmaceutical development. The author expresses puzzlement at why these non-biopharma investors with no apparent expertise in drug development would invest heavily in Alzheimer's research, an area notorious for high failure rates and major financial losses. The piece was written shortly after TauRx had entered Phase III clinical trials for their Alzheimer's treatment, with the author questioning the strategic rationale behind such unconventional investor composition.

## 2. HISTORY

TauRx's lead compound, LMTX (leuco-methylthioninium), continued through Phase III clinical trials after the article's publication. The company presented results from two Phase III trials in 2016, which showed mixed and ultimately disappointing outcomes. While TauRx claimed some positive signals in certain patient subgroups, the trials failed to meet their primary endpoints for the full study populations. 

The company's unusual funding pattern continued through subsequent years, with their investor base remaining largely non-traditional for biotech. Despite the clinical setbacks, TauRx has continued development efforts and maintains operations. However, as of 2024, LMTX has not received FDA approval and has not become a widely adopted Alzheimer's treatment. The tau protein aggregation hypothesis that underlies TauRx's approach has remained an active area of Alzheimer's research, with mixed results across different programs targeting tau pathology. Several other tau-targeting approaches have also faced clinical challenges, suggesting fundamental difficulties in translating tau biology into effective therapeutics. TauRx's continued funding from non-traditional sources has enabled the company to persist despite not achieving the breakthrough success that was hoped for when this article was written.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions and outcomes:**

• **That non-biopharma investors would struggle in Alzheimer's drug development**: While not explicitly stated, the author's skepticism about Dundee Corporation and Genting Berhad's ability to succeed in biotech was warranted. Alzheimer's has indeed remained extremely challenging, with numerous high-profile failures across the industry from 2013-2024, including many from experienced pharmaceutical companies.

• **That Alzheimer's field had "pent-up demand getting worse every year"**: This prediction was accurate - by 2024, the global burden of Alzheimer's disease has continued to grow substantially, with over 55 million people worldwide affected by dementia (the majority Alzheimer's), creating even greater unmet medical need and market demand.

• **Implicit expectation that TauRx's approach might fail**: The article's skeptical tone about the funding structure indirectly suggested concerns about the company's prospects. This skepticism proved justified - while TauRx has not completely failed, they have not achieved the breakthrough success that would have validated their unconventional approach.

• **That Alzheimer's investment carries high risk of losing "your shirt"**: This prediction was accurate across the broader field. Between 2013-2024, numerous Alzheimer's programs from major pharmaceutical companies have failed in late-stage trials, resulting in billions of dollars in losses and multiple companies abandoning their Alzheimer's programs entirely.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article raises interesting questions about investment patterns in high-risk biotech sectors, and the TauRx case study proved prescient in highlighting how unconventional funding structures can persist even without achieving clinical success. However, the scope is somewhat narrow, focusing mainly on one company's unusual funding rather than broader industry trends or scientific developments.
