# The Chemistry Jobs Market (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2013 blog post references a Chemjobber blog analysis of the chemistry jobs market, describing it with the phrase "interesting, amusing, frustrating quotes." The post indicates that the chemistry job market situation was concerning enough that Chemjobber noted feeling like he "could press KBr pellets with his jaws" after writing about it—a reference to the frustrating and grinding nature of the employment situation for chemists at that time. The article serves as commentary linking to a more detailed analysis of employment challenges in the chemistry field, suggesting a difficult job market for chemists in 2013.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 commentary, the chemistry job market experienced mixed trends over the subsequent decade. The pharmaceutical industry, a major employer of chemists, underwent significant consolidation and restructuring throughout the 2010s, with major companies like Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis continuing layoffs and site closures. However, the biotech sector expanded considerably, particularly in areas like gene therapy, CRISPR technology, and antibody-drug conjugates, creating new opportunities for chemists with relevant expertise.

The chemical industry faced challenges from increased automation, outsourcing to lower-cost regions, and a shift toward specialized expertise areas like process chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and analytical chemistry. By the mid-to-late 2010s, employment prospects for chemists became increasingly dependent on sub-specialization, with synthetic organic chemists, chemical engineers, and those with pharmaceutical industry experience generally faring better than general chemistry graduates.

The COVID-19 pandemic created both challenges and opportunities—while some chemical manufacturing sectors faced disruptions, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors saw substantial growth, particularly in vaccine development, therapeutic drug development, and diagnostic chemistry. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and increased focus on domestic manufacturing also influenced chemistry employment trends in the United States.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in this brief commentary article—it primarily served as a link post to a more detailed analysis with the author providing minimal original content beyond noting the frustrating nature of the chemistry job market at that time.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article provides minimal original analysis (serving mainly as a link post) and does not contain substantial insights relevant to the biotechnology industry's actual trajectory. While the general topic of chemistry job markets is relevant to biotech workforce dynamics, this specific article lacks the depth, scope, or long-term importance to merit a higher score.
