# Controlling Proteins, One by One (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a new method called "genetically directed bioorthogonal ligand tethering" (BOLT) and its application for selective protein inhibition (iBOLT), developed by researchers at MRC Molecular Biology labs in Cambridge. The technique involves engineering proteins to incorporate an unnatural cyclooctyne-containing amino acid, then using complementary tetrazine-tagged inhibitors that rapidly and selectively bind to only the engineered proteins. 

The paper demonstrates this approach on MEK kinases, showing that tagged inhibitors work rapidly and potently on engineered MEK variants while remaining inactive against wild-type proteins. The method achieved selective inhibition of MEK isozymes, which had not been possible before. The authors then extended this to create "photo-BOLT" by incorporating azobenzene photoisomerizable linkers, enabling reversible optical control of protein activity using different light wavelengths (360nm and 440nm) to switch between cis and trans conformations. The approach was also tested with sunitinib-conjugated inhibitors on engineered LCK variants, potentially opening pathways to target proteins lacking good small-molecule ligands through the affinity boost provided by tethering.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following publication, the BOLT methodology and related bioorthogonal tethering approaches have seen significant development but remain primarily research tools rather than clinical therapeutics.

**Scientific Development and Adoption**: The bioorthogonal chemistry underlying BOLT has become well-established in chemical biology research. Tetrazine-trans-cyclooctene ligation (the inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction) is now widely used for live-cell imaging and protein labeling studies. However, the specific BOLT approach for therapeutic protein inhibition has not led to FDA-approved drugs or major clinical programs.

**Optogenetics and Photopharmacology Growth**: The optical switching concept (photo-BOLT) aligns with the broader emergence of optogenetics and photopharmacology, which have grown into active research areas. Optical control of protein function remains an important goal for basic research into signaling networks, but practical therapeutic applications remain limited by tissue penetration issues with light and delivery challenges.

**Spatiotemporal Control Applications**: The goal of achieving spatiotemporal control of protein function has advanced significantly, particularly in neuroscience research where optogenetic tools are now standard. However, the specific approach of using small-molecule tethers with photoisomerizable linkers has not become a mainstream therapeutic strategy.

**MEK Inhibitor Development**: While the article focused on MEK as a proof-of-concept, several MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) received FDA approval between 2013-2018 for BRAF-mutant melanoma. These drugs work without requiring protein engineering - they directly inhibit wild-type MEK in patients. The BOLT approach's need to genetically engineer the target protein before inhibition makes it impractical for most therapeutic applications.

**Broader Impact**: The work contributed to methodological advances in chemical biology but did not translate into clinical therapeutics. The inconvenience of requiring protein engineering limits practical applications, though similar bioorthogonal approaches are used in research contexts including targeted protein degradation (PROTACs) and antibody-drug conjugates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions about future developments:

• **"Building in the tethering, and that extra kick of affinity that it gives, might point the way to [affecting] a variety of proteins that don't necessarily have good small-molecule ligands"**: This prediction has seen partial but limited success. While tethering strategies have expanded, most pharmaceutical development has focused on conventional small molecules or alternative modalities (peptides, antibodies, PROTACs, molecular glues) rather than approaches requiring genetic protein modification.

• **"The optical switching is another area with a lot of promise"** for **"spatiotemporal control of protein function"**: Optical control of proteins has indeed grown significantly, particularly in neuroscience (optogenetics using microbial opsins) and basic research. However, clinical therapeutic applications remain limited - light delivery challenges and the complexity of requiring genetic modification have prevented widespread clinical adoption.

• **Implicit prediction that this could lead to therapeutic protein targeting**: This has not materialized in clinical practice. While the underlying chemistry is sound, the requirement to genetically engineer target proteins makes this approach impractical for treating patients.

• **"The only way we're going to unravel a lot of these networks"**: While spatiotemporal control remains important for basic research, BOLT specifically did not become a dominant methodology. Alternative approaches including conventional pharmacology combined with genetic tools (CRISPR, RNAi) have proven more versatile and scalable for network analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article describes solid chemical biology work that contributed to methodological advances, but the approach's requirement for genetic engineering limited its broader therapeutic impact. While the underlying bioorthogonal chemistry proved valuable for research applications, this specific method did not translate into practical clinical tools, placing it in the above-average but not transformative category.
