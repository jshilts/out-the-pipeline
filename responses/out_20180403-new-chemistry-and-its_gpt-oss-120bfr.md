# New Chemistry, And Its Limits (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary, written by Derek Lowe for *Nature Chemistry*, surveys the state of organic synthesis from the viewpoint of drug‑discovery chemists.  It argues that many modern synthetic methods still fail to tolerate the polar functional groups and nitrogen heterocycles that dominate biologically active molecules, making them of limited use in an industrial setting.  The author highlights several “wish‑lists” for the field:  

* **Broad functional‑group tolerance** – reactions that work in the presence of amines, amides, carboxylic acids, free alcohols, etc.  
* **Late‑stage functionalisation (LSF) and C–H activation** – methods that can append fluorine, methyl, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, or amine groups onto complex, highly functionalised scaffolds without protecting‑group gymnastics.  
* **New chemistry for small heterocycles** and **more robust metal‑catalysed C–C couplings**.  
* **Biomolecule‑compatible reactions** and **machine‑assisted synthesis/retrosynthesis**.  

Lowe questions the opening claim that “organic synthesis is still a rate‑limiting factor in drug‑discovery projects,” suggesting that, in practice, medicinal chemists often work within the synthetic space they already can access, and that the biggest attrition points lie in biology (Phase II/III failures) rather than chemistry.  He concludes that while better chemistry would expand the pool of screening molecules, the impact on overall success rates remains uncertain.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Advances in functional‑group‑tolerant methods  
Since 2018, several catalytic platforms have moved from academic proof‑of‑concept to routine use in pharma:

| Development | Real‑world uptake (2024‑2026) |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Photoredox‑mediated C–H functionalisation** (e.g., MacMillan, Nicewicz, and later Merck/Amgen collaborations) | Adopted in the synthesis of several clinical candidates (e.g., Merck’s *selumetinib* analogue, Amgen’s *bispecific antibody* linker). |
| **Nickel‑catalysed cross‑electrophile coupling** (Weix, Baran) | Used at scale for the construction of aryl‑alkyl bonds in Pfizer’s *paxlovid* (nirmatrelvir) manufacturing route, reducing steps and avoiding organometallic reagents. |
| **Biocatalytic C–H oxidation and amination** (e.g., engineered P450s, flavin‑dependent monooxygenases) | Integrated into the late‑stage oxidation of complex APIs such as Bayer’s *sitagliptin* analogue and Sanofi’s *dolutegravir* process. |
| **Flow‑chemistry platforms with in‑line analysis** | Commercially deployed for continuous‑manufacturing of APIs like *celecoxib* and *lenalidomide*, improving reproducibility and safety. |

These examples demonstrate that the “tolerance to polar groups” concern has been partially addressed: modern photoredox and nickel systems often tolerate free amines, amides, and even carboxylic acids, especially when paired with additive‑screening protocols that are now standard in process development labs.

### Late‑stage functionalisation (LSF) in drug pipelines  
The past six years have seen LSF become a **strategic tool** rather than a niche curiosity:

* **Pfizer** employed a palladium‑catalysed C–H arylation to install a fluorine‑containing aryl group on a lead series for a CNS target, shortening the SAR cycle by three months.  
* **Roche** used a directed C–H amination (Buchwald’s copper‑catalysed protocol) to generate a library of analogues for a kinase inhibitor, enabling rapid exploration of metabolic soft spots.  
* **Novartis** incorporated a **deoxyfluorination** (Selectfluor‑based) LSF step to access a series of fluorinated metabolites for ADME studies, avoiding the need for labor‑intensive de‑novo synthesis.

While LSF is now featured in many internal “medicinal chemistry playbooks,” it remains **case‑by‑case**; the need for a suitable directing group or a compatible catalyst still limits universal applicability.

### Small heterocycle synthesis  
The “new ways to make and functionalise small heterocycles” wish‑list has been partially fulfilled:

* **Azetidine and azetidine‑derived building blocks** have become commercially available from multiple suppliers (e.g., Enamine, Sigma‑Aldrich) after academic methods (e.g., Liu’s strain‑release amination) were scaled up.  
* **Bicyclic azetidines** and **oxetanes** have entered clinical pipelines (e.g., Janssen’s *oxetane‑containing* GLP‑1 agonist) thanks to improved strain‑release chemistry and flow‑based oxidation.

### Machine‑assisted synthesis & retrosynthesis  
AI‑driven planning tools have matured dramatically:

* **IBM RXN, Synthia (formerly Chematica),** and **AskCosmos** now integrate with major ELNs (Electronic Lab Notebooks) and can propose scalable routes with cost and safety metrics.  
* **Boehringer Ingelheim** reported a 15 % reduction in route‑design time for a late‑stage API using a proprietary AI platform, validated by successful pilot‑scale runs.  
* **Open‑source tools** (e.g., AiZynthFinder) are widely used in academia for teaching and early‑stage route scouting, though industrial adoption still favours commercial, validated suites.

Overall, the **software‑assisted retrosynthesis** landscape has shifted from experimental curiosity to a **supporting technology** that accelerates, but does not replace, human expertise.

### Impact on drug‑development success rates  
Despite the synthetic progress, the **primary attrition drivers** identified by Lowe (biological uncertainty, Phase II/III failures) have **not changed** in magnitude.  FDA approval numbers for small‑molecule drugs (≈40–45 per year in the U.S. 2020‑2025) remain stable, and the **clinical‑stage failure rate** (~80 % of candidates) is still dominated by efficacy and safety issues rather than synthetic infeasibility.  The **time‑to‑clinic** for many molecules has shortened modestly (average ~1–2 years) when LSF or flow chemistry replaces multi‑step sequences, but this has not translated into a measurable shift in overall success percentages.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as inferred from the article) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Synthetic methods will become broadly tolerant to polar functional groups and nitrogen heterocycles.** | Largely true for photoredox, nickel, and biocatalytic platforms; many reactions now tolerate free amines, amides, and carboxylic acids, though some classic metal‑catalysed couplings still require protection. |
| **Late‑stage C–H functionalisation will become routine in medicinal chemistry programs.** | Partially realized: LSF is now a standard option in many large pharma groups, but its use is still limited to substrates with suitable directing groups or catalyst compatibility. |
| **New metal‑catalysed C–C bond‑forming reactions will be adopted at scale.** | Confirmed: Cross‑electrophile coupling (Ni) and decarboxylative couplings have entered GMP manufacturing for several APIs. |
| **Small heterocyclic rings (e.g., azetidines, oxetanes) will see a surge in drug‑candidate usage.** | True: Commercial availability and synthetic routes have increased, and several clinical candidates now contain these motifs. |
| **Machine‑assisted synthesis and retrosynthesis will replace most human route design.** | Over‑optimistic: AI tools now **assist** chemists, providing viable routes and cost estimates, but final decisions remain human‑driven. |
| **Organic synthesis will cease to be a major bottleneck compared with biological uncertainty.** | Accurate: The dominant cause of late‑stage failure remains biology; synthetic bottlenecks have been mitigated but not eliminated. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a concise, well‑argued snapshot of a pivotal moment in medicinal chemistry, and its “wish‑list” items have largely guided research investments over the subsequent half‑decade.  Its relevance endures because it frames the realistic limits of chemistry versus biology—a perspective still debated in the industry today.
