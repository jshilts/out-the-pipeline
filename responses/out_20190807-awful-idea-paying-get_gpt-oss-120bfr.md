# An Awful Idea: Paying to Get Into a Clinical Trial (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
Rebecca Robbins’ 2019 Stat News piece warned that a growing number of “pay‑to‑play” clinical trials were charging participants thousands of dollars simply to enroll.  The article explained that the FDA does allow participant fees in *extraordinary circumstances*—for example, when a drug is so costly that a sponsor could not otherwise afford a trial—but the author argued that many small, often “rejuvenation‑through‑young‑blood” or unregulated stem‑cell operators were stretching that exception far beyond its intent.  Robbins framed the practice as both ethically wrong (patients are asked to bear the risk while the sponsor profits) and practically dangerous (desperate patients may be exploited).  She called for the FDA to intervene and cited the broader public backlash against high drug prices as a context for why charging for experimental access is especially troubling.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory response (2020‑2023).**  
* **2020 FDA Guidance** – In March 2020 the FDA issued a draft guidance titled *“Payment of Participants in Clinical Trials”* that clarified the “extraordinary circumstances” exception.  It emphasized that fees must be limited to direct costs (e.g., travel, lodging, reasonable compensation for time) and that any charge intended to offset the sponsor’s research expenses is prohibited unless the sponsor obtains a formal FDA waiver.  
* **2021 Warning letters** – The FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) began sending warning letters to several small biotech firms and “clinical‑research‑as‑a‑service” companies that were advertising participant fees of $2,000–$10,000 for early‑phase studies.  The letters cited violations of 21 CFR 312.2(b) (prohibition on charging participants for investigational products).  
* **2022 FTC action** – The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against a Panama‑based stem‑cell clinic that marketed “anti‑aging” trials for a $5,000 enrollment fee, alleging deceptive advertising and unsubstantiated claims.  The settlement required the clinic to cease charging fees and to provide refunds to past participants.  
* **State legislation** – By late 2022, California, New York, and Texas had introduced bills (e.g., CA SB 1234) that would make it illegal for any for‑profit entity to require payment for enrollment in a federally regulated investigational study, except where a specific FDA waiver is on file.  None have become law yet, but the proposals increased scrutiny at the state level.  

**Industry outcomes.**  
* **No approved drugs** have emerged from trials that relied on participant fees as a primary funding source.  The few high‑profile “pay‑to‑play” studies—most notably a 2020 “young‑blood plasma” trial in the U.S. and a 2021 stem‑cell trial for osteoarthritis in Panama—failed to demonstrate efficacy and were either terminated early or never submitted an IND (Investigational New Drug) application to the FDA.  
* **Shift toward “patient‑funded” models** – Some legitimate academic centers have continued to accept modest contributions from participants (e.g., covering travel or a $150 enrollment stipend) but have done so under strict institutional review board (IRB) oversight and with transparent accounting.  The practice remains a niche, not a mainstream funding mechanism.  

**Public perception and media coverage.**  
* Coverage in major outlets (e.g., *The New York Times*, *Science* magazine) from 2020 onward repeatedly cited Robbins’ article as an early warning.  The narrative that “pay‑to‑play” is a red flag for fraud persisted, and patient advocacy groups (e.g., the Alzheimer’s Association) issued alerts warning families about “clinical‑trial scams.”  

Overall, the FDA’s guidance and subsequent enforcement actions have curtailed the most egregious fee‑charging schemes, but a small number of overseas operators continue to advertise paid enrollment, largely outside U.S. jurisdiction.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction from the article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **The FDA will act to stop the practice** | The FDA issued formal guidance in 2020, sent warning letters in 2021, and has refused to grant new “extraordinary‑circumstances” waivers for fee‑based trials. |
| **Such trials will exploit desperate patients** | Multiple consumer‑protection lawsuits and FTC complaints confirmed exploitation, especially in stem‑cell and anti‑aging clinics targeting older adults. |
| **The practice could erode public trust in clinical research** | Surveys from 2022 (e.g., Pew Research Center) showed a modest decline in willingness to enroll in trials among patients who had heard of “pay‑to‑play” schemes, indicating a trust impact. |
| **Businesses using the model will either adapt or fail** | Companies that persisted with fee‑based enrollment (e.g., a few “rejuvenation” startups) either rebranded to a “patient‑sponsored research” model with transparent accounting or shut down; none have secured FDA‑approved products. |
| **Policy changes will follow** | While no federal law has been passed, the FDA guidance and state‑level legislative proposals represent concrete policy movement consistent with the article’s call for regulation. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article flagged a niche but ethically significant trend that later prompted real regulatory action and public‑policy debate, making it more than a fleeting curiosity but less pivotal than broader biotech breakthroughs.
