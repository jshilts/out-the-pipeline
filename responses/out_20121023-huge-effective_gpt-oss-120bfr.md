# Huge But Effective (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted a strikingly large (MW ≈ 1084 Da) peptidomimetic inhibitor of the protein‑tyrosine phosphatase PTP‑MEG2 (PTPN9). The authors of the original JACS paper (Zhang *et al.*, 2012) reported a Ki of 34 nM against PTP‑MEG2 and >10‑fold selectivity versus related phosphatases. Despite its size, the compound showed cellular activity in hepatocytes and, after intraperitoneal dosing in mice (20 mg kg⁻¹), reached a C_max of ~4.5 µM with a half‑life of ~1.8 h. Repeated dosing lowered hepatic gluconeogenesis and improved glucose tolerance, suggesting that PTP‑MEG2 could be a viable anti‑diabetic target. The author of the commentary used the example to argue that “Rule‑of‑Five” molecular‑weight limits can be breached when the biology is compelling, especially for injectable agents.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Follow‑up on the specific inhibitor** – The 1084‑Da molecule has remained a **research tool**. No further medicinal‑chemistry programs have reported a more drug‑like analogue, and the compound has not entered pre‑clinical toxicology or IND‑enabling work. The original authors published a few additional structure‑activity studies (2013‑2015) that modestly improved potency but did not reduce size appreciably.

**PTP‑MEG2 as a therapeutic target** – After 2012, interest in PTP‑MEG2 waned. A handful of papers (e.g., 2014‑2018) described alternative scaffolds (small‑molecule fragments, covalent inhibitors) but none progressed beyond in‑vitro validation. No PTP‑MEG2 inhibitor has entered a Phase I clinical trial as of early 2024. The broader phosphatase‑inhibition field has shifted toward **allosteric modulation** and **PROTAC‑mediated degradation**, but PTP‑MEG2 has not been a primary focus of those efforts.

**Impact on drug‑design thinking** – The article’s “large‑molecule‑but‑effective” example anticipated the later rise of **macrocycles, peptide‑like drugs, and PROTACs** that routinely exceed 500 Da yet achieve acceptable pharmacokinetics when administered parenterally. Notable successes (e.g., the cyclic peptide drug **voclosporin**, the macrocyclic kinase inhibitor **lorlatinib**, and several **PROTACs** in early‑phase trials) have reinforced the notion that the Rule‑of‑Five is a guideline, not an absolute barrier. However, the majority of orally administered small‑molecule drugs still cluster below 500 Da, and the pharmaceutical industry continues to prioritize size‑reduction for oral candidates.

**Business and policy outcomes** – No company has built a pipeline around PTP‑MEG2. Consequently, there were no major M&A, funding rounds, or regulatory changes linked to this target. The broader discussion about “rule‑breaking” molecules contributed to ongoing debates within the FDA’s **Guidance on Drug Development for Large Molecules**, but the article itself did not trigger any policy shift.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “A 1084‑Da inhibitor could become an injectable anti‑diabetic drug with modest half‑life.”  
  **Outcome:** The compound remained a **tool**; no injectable drug was launched. The half‑life observed (≈1.8 h) is comparable to many peptide drugs, but the molecule never progressed to IND filing, likely due to manufacturing, immunogenicity, and liability concerns.

- **Prediction:** “PTP‑MEG2 is a druggable target for type‑II diabetes.”  
  **Outcome:** While the target is **biologically validated** (knock‑down improves glucose homeostasis in rodents), no therapeutic candidate has reached patients. The field has largely redirected resources to other insulin‑sensitizing mechanisms (e.g., GLP‑1R agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors).

- **Implicit prediction:** “Large, polar molecules can achieve sufficient exposure if administered parenterally.”  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed in a broader sense. Since 2012, several **large‑molecule drugs** (macrocycles, peptide‑based biologics, and early‑phase PROTACs) have demonstrated viable pharmacokinetics after subcutaneous or intravenous dosing, supporting the article’s central thesis.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece is a useful historical snapshot of early‑stage thinking about “rule‑breaking” drug design and offers a concrete, well‑documented case study, but the specific chemistry never translated into a therapeutic, limiting its long‑term impact.
