# Free Chemical Patent Searching (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article announces the creation of SureChEMBL, a free chemical patent database. The resource was created when SureChem, a company that had attempted to build a business around chemical patent information, folded and donated its database and software to EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory). The system automatically extracts chemical structures from patent text and images, processes new patents within days of publication, and enables chemical structure searching, substructure searching, and similarity searching—functionality previously only available through expensive commercial databases like Chemical Abstracts and Reaxys. The author frames this as positive news for open access to chemical information and suggests commercial database providers will need to add more value to justify their costs.

## 2. HISTORY

The creation of SureChEMBL in 2013 proved to be a significant development in chemical information access over the subsequent decade. The database became integrated into the broader ChEMBL ecosystem at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and has been actively maintained and expanded. As of 2024, SureChEMBL contains over 20 million unique chemical structures extracted from more than 40 million patent documents, representing substantial growth from the initial 15 million structures mentioned in 2013.

The open access movement in chemical information gained considerable momentum following this development. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began using SureChEMBL for regulatory research, validating the database's utility in practical applications. Major pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline, have incorporated SureChEMBL into their research workflows, particularly for prior art searching and intellectual property analysis.

The commercial database landscape did evolve as predicted. Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and Elsevier's Reaxys continued to operate but shifted toward providing enhanced value through integrated analysis tools, predictive capabilities, and curated content rather than competing solely on structure search functionality. Both platforms maintained their market positions but increasingly emphasized features like reaction planning, analytical data integration, and expert curation that free resources couldn't replicate.

SureChEMBL's impact extended beyond individual researchers to influence policy and standards. The European Patent Office began collaborating with EMBL-EBI on chemical data standards, and discussions emerged about mandating machine-readable chemical structure data in patent applications. However, widespread regulatory changes requiring standardized chemical data submission did not materialize by 2024.

The most concrete outcome has been the democratization of chemical patent searching. Academic researchers, small biotechnology companies, and researchers in developing countries gained access to capabilities previously restricted to organizations with substantial budgets. This has been particularly valuable for drug discovery efforts at smaller institutions and for patent landscaping studies that would have been prohibitively expensive using commercial databases alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Commercial chemical database providers (Chemical Abstracts, Reaxys) would need to provide more value to justify their costs
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate. Both CAS and Elsevier's Reaxys maintained their premium pricing but enhanced their offerings with advanced features including predictive analytics, reaction synthesis planning, and expert-curated content. They successfully differentiated themselves from free alternatives through added value rather than competing solely on basic search capabilities.

• **Prediction**: The free database would expand chemical information access
  - **Outcome**: This prediction was correct. SureChEMBL became widely adopted by academic institutions, small biotech companies, and researchers worldwide who previously couldn't afford commercial patent databases. Usage statistics showed significant adoption in both academic and industrial settings.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

The article identified a pivotal moment in chemical information democratization that had lasting impact on research accessibility and influenced the evolution of commercial database business models over the following decade. While not technologically revolutionary, the opening of patent chemical structure data had meaningful practical consequences for research communities.
