# How Not to Do It: Sophomore Organic Edition (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a humorous retrospective by a former organic chemistry teaching assistant recounting memorable mishaps from sophomore lab sessions. The author describes three problematic experiments: (1) the Grignard reaction performed on open bench tops with inadequate fume hood space, resulting in excessive ether vapor exposure; (2) the isoamyl acetate (banana ester) synthesis where a student failed to properly vent a separatory funnel, causing a carbon dioxide-driven explosion that sprayed banana-scented contents on a lab partner; and (3) an oxidation using hot nitric acid where a student dangerously wafted the reaction mixture near the TA's face.

The article is framed as a cautionary tale about laboratory safety practices, illustrating how routine undergraduate experiments can go wrong through carelessness, inadequate facilities, or poor judgment. The tone is anecdotal rather than prescriptive, using personal experience to highlight the practical realities of teaching laboratory chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY

Organic chemistry laboratory pedagogy has evolved substantially since 2007, with several concrete developments affecting the practices described:

**Fume Hood Infrastructure**: Modern chemistry departments have significantly expanded fume hood capacity. Many institutions now mandate that all volatile organic reactions be conducted in certified fume hoods, with some universities adopting "100% fume hood coverage" policies for organic chemistry labs. The 2010s saw major facility upgrades driven by both safety concerns and LEED certification requirements.

**Curriculum Modernization**: The nitric acid oxidation of glucose mentioned in the article has largely disappeared from undergraduate curricula. Most programs have replaced hazardous reagents like concentrated nitric acid with safer alternatives such as bleach-based oxidations or enzymatic methods (e.g., glucose oxidase). The 2016 ACS Guidelines for Chemistry in Two-Year College Programs specifically recommended eliminating particularly hazardous reagents from introductory courses.

**Safety Culture Transformation**: Following high-profile incidents (notably the 2010 Texas Tech explosion and 2011 Yale University fatality), institutions implemented more rigorous safety protocols. Many universities now require formal safety training certifications before laboratory access, and some use video monitoring in teaching labs. Venting separatory funnels is taught more systematically through instructional videos and step-by-step procedure cards.

**Microscale Chemistry Adoption**: Growing emphasis on green chemistry principles has led many programs to adopt microscale techniques, reducing both chemical waste and exposure risks. Ether usage has declined in favor of alternative solvents like ethyl acetate or acetonitrile, though complete replacement remains impractical for certain reactions.

**Emil Fischer Historiography**: The Wikipedia article on Emil Fischer has been updated multiple times since 2007 and now includes discussion of Fischer's practice of tasting compounds, though details remain debated among historians. This reflects broader improvements in Wikipedia's chemistry-related content quality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no explicit predictions about future developments in chemistry education, laboratory safety, or biotechnology. It is purely retrospective in nature, recounting past experiences. The closest element to a forward-looking statement is "No matter where I end up over the next few months, at least no one's going to do that to me," which is personal commentary rather than a substantive prediction about the field.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This essay provides entertaining anecdotes about chemistry lab mishaps but lacks substantive scientific content or broader industry relevance. It would primarily interest current or former chemistry students who can relate to similar experiences, but it does not address biotechnology developments, drug discovery, or policy changes in meaningful ways. The focus on nostalgia and humor is well-executed but narrow in scope and long-term importance.
