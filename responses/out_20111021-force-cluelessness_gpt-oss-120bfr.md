# The Force of Cluelessness (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a polemic about the prevalence of passionate but uninformed advocacy in politics and public policy.  The author argues that anyone proposing a policy should first be forced to write a short essay that proves they understand the issue.  He extends the idea to voting: if a voter cannot answer a handful of basic civics questions, the voting booth should not open for them.  He also proposes “None of the above” (NOTA) ballot options that would trigger a new election with entirely new candidates, and even a whimsical scheme in which anyone who openly declares a desire to be president would be disqualified.  The piece ends with a brief jab at big‑pharma (referencing a 2011 *Science* article on Pfizer) and a general lament that “the worst are full of passionate intensity.”

## 2. HISTORY  

### Voting‑knowledge tests  
- **United States:** No federal or state election law has adopted a civic‑knowledge test for voters.  The closest analogue is the long‑standing voter‑ID movement, which focuses on documentary proof of identity, not on political knowledge.  All attempts to introduce a “literacy” or “civics” test have been blocked on constitutional grounds (the 24th Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Voting Rights Act).  As of 2026, the idea remains a fringe proposal discussed only in academic blogs and libertarian think‑tanks.  

- **International examples:** Some democracies (e.g., Estonia’s e‑residency program) require a short online quiz to verify understanding of the voting platform, but this is a technical safeguard, not a knowledge gate.  No country has institutionalized a mandatory pre‑vote civics exam for the general electorate.

### “None of the above” (NOTA)  
- **U.S. practice:** Several U.S. states already have a “None of These Candidates” option for certain statewide elections (e.g., Nevada since 1975, and more recently, Alaska’s 2022 primary ballot included a “None of the Above” write‑in).  However, the option does **not** trigger a new election; the vote is simply recorded as a protest.  The author’s suggestion that a NOTA win would force a fresh election with a completely new slate of candidates has never been adopted.  

- **Other countries:** India introduced a NOTA option for national and state elections in 2013, and Nepal added it in 2017.  In both cases, a NOTA victory does **not** invalidate the election; it merely records a protest vote.  The “reset‑the‑ballot” mechanism remains a theoretical curiosity.

### Disqualifying “ambitious” candidates  
- No jurisdiction has enacted a rule that bars anyone who expresses a desire to hold high office from running.  Candidate eligibility in the U.S. continues to be governed by age, citizenship, residency, and criminal‑record criteria, not by self‑reported ambition.

### The “essay‑first” policy proposal  
- The Atlantic article the author cites (Oct 2011) sparked a brief wave of commentary about “policy‑proposal briefs,” but no legislative body has required proposers to submit a pre‑written justification beyond the standard legislative bill text and impact statements.  Think‑tanks and NGOs sometimes publish “policy briefs,” but this is a voluntary practice, not a mandated gate.

### Pfizer and the broader biotech landscape  
- The 2011 *Science* piece on Pfizer’s “secret history” highlighted the company’s aggressive R&D and marketing tactics.  Since then, Pfizer has remained a dominant player:  
  * **COVID‑19 vaccine (BNT162b2):** Co‑developed with BioNTech, received Emergency Use Authorization in Dec 2020 and full FDA approval in Aug 2021.  Over 1 billion doses have been administered worldwide.  
  * **Financial performance:** Pfizer’s revenue grew from ≈$53 B in 2011 to >$100 B in 2022, driven largely by the vaccine and later by antiviral Paxlovid (approved 2022).  
  * **Public perception:** The company’s high profile during the pandemic intensified scrutiny of drug pricing and corporate influence, but it did not lead to any systemic “evil‑conspiracy” narrative becoming mainstream policy.  

Overall, none of the author’s concrete institutional reforms have been realized, while the biotech references have unfolded in the expected direction of continued industry growth and occasional controversy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Civic‑knowledge voting test:**  
  - *Prediction:* Voting booths will require voters to answer basic civics questions; those who fail will be barred from voting.  
  - *Outcome:* **Not realized.** All attempts to introduce such tests have been rejected as unconstitutional or impractical.  

- **“None of the above” triggers a new election:**  
  - *Prediction:* A NOTA win forces a fresh election with entirely new candidates within 60 days.  
  - *Outcome:* **Not realized.** NOTA exists in a few U.S. states and several foreign elections, but it never forces a new election.  

- **Disqualifying candidates who want power:**  
  - *Prediction:* Anyone who openly states a desire to be president would be barred from running.  
  - *Outcome:* **Not realized.** No jurisdiction has adopted such a rule; candidate ambition remains a political reality.  

- **Pfizer’s “secret history” relevance:**  
  - *Implicit prediction:* Pfizer’s questionable practices would continue to shape public distrust.  
  - *Outcome:* **Partially true.** Pfizer’s prominence during COVID‑19 amplified public debate over pharma ethics, but the company also achieved unprecedented commercial success and regulatory approvals.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The piece is a colorful critique of political ignorance, but its proposals have had no tangible impact, and its biotech reference is peripheral.  It is of modest historical curiosity rather than lasting significance.
