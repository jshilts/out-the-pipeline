# How Slow is Research Today? Here's a Recipe! (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This appears to be a lighthearted blog post from Thanksgiving week 2008, written by what seems to be a chemist or pharmaceutical researcher. The author observes that research pace slows during holiday periods in both industrial and academic labs. They mention working on a manuscript and planning to take a blogging break for the Thanksgiving holiday. The "recipe" referenced in the title is literally a chocolate pecan pie recipe that the author shares after describing a synthetic chemistry-like preparation process in their kitchen with their children.

## 2. HISTORY

This is a personal blog post rather than a commentary article about the biotechnology industry. It contains no substantive claims about biotechnology developments, drug pipelines, clinical trials, or industry trends that could be tracked or verified. The post is primarily lifestyle content mixing lab culture observations with a holiday recipe.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no predictions about biotechnology, drug development, or scientific research outcomes. The only forward-looking statements are the author's personal plans to finish a manuscript and take a blogging break until Monday.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This appears to be completely off-topic - it's a personal blog post about holiday baking and general lab slowdown during Thanksgiving, not a commentary article about the biotechnology industry or any substantive scientific topic.
