# A Magic Methyl, Spotted in the Wild (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* paper demonstrating how adding a single methyl group (the "magic methyl") to a kinase inhibitor scaffold caused dramatic selectivity changes across related kinases: MERTK activity decreased 6-fold, AXL dropped 8-fold, and FLT3 plummeted roughly 80-fold, while TYRO3 remained unaffected. The author explains this through structural biology—a methionine in MERTK versus leucine in FLT3 created steric clashes that the methyl group exposed.

The article uses this example to illustrate broader themes in medicinal chemistry: the challenge of "activity cliffs" where small structural changes cause nonlinear potency shifts, the difficulty of rational optimization given multiple competing factors (potency, selectivity, PK, metabolic stability), and the limitations of computational modeling and machine learning in drug discovery. The author argues that medicinal chemists won't be replaced by AI anytime soon because datasets are too small, biological complexity too high, and unpredictable off-target effects too common.

## 2. HISTORY

The "magic methyl" concept has become increasingly important in drug discovery since 2018. While the specific compound in the cited paper doesn't appear to have progressed to an approved drug, the strategy of using subtle halogen or methyl substitutions to fine-tune selectivity has become standard practice in kinase inhibitor development. Several kinase inhibitors have reached market or advanced clinical stages since 2018 using similar selectivity-engineering principles.

The broader field of kinase inhibitor drug discovery has continued rapid growth, with numerous FDA approvals between 2018-2024 for cancer therapies, including several multi-kinase inhibitors where selectivity optimization was crucial. However, the fundamental challenge Lowe described—activity cliffs and unpredictable SAR—remains a central difficulty in drug discovery.

Machine learning applications in drug discovery have advanced since 2018, with companies developing AI platforms, but the limitations Lowe highlighted (small datasets, multifactorial optimization, biological complexity) continue to constrain widespread replacement of medicinal chemists by AI systems. Instead, AI tools are increasingly used as assistive technologies rather than replacements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1: Machine learning won't replace medicinal chemists anytime soon**
- **Outcome**: Largely validated. While AI tools have become more sophisticated and widely adopted since 2018, they predominantly serve as assistive technologies for drug discovery rather than replacing human medicinal chemists. The fundamental issues Lowe identified—insufficient training data, complex multifactorial optimization, and biological unpredictability—remain significant barriers.

**Prediction 2: Activity cliffs will continue to challenge computational modeling**
- **Outcome**: Validated. Despite advances in computational chemistry and machine learning, activity cliffs remain a persistent challenge in SAR modeling. Recent literature continues to highlight cases where small structural changes cause dramatic, unpredictable activity shifts, confirming that nonlinear SAR is inherent to drug discovery.

**Prediction 3: Broader screening panels and off-target assessment will remain problematic**
- **Outcome**: Validated, though with some advances. While screening technologies have improved, the fundamental challenge of comprehensive off-target profiling remains. The emergence of new safety concerns for approved drugs post-market continues to demonstrate that current screening approaches don't capture all relevant biology.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article provides a solid, practical illustration of selectivity engineering in drug discovery, though it covers well-established medicinal chemistry principles rather than introducing novel concepts. It captures enduring challenges in the field but has limited predictive or transformative insight beyond confirming ongoing difficulties.
