# Hemophilia: A Proving Ground For Genetic Disease (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This July 2017 commentary discusses three therapeutic approaches competing in the hemophilia space: Alnylam/Sanofi's RNAi therapy fitusiran targeting antithrombin; Roche's bispecific antibody emicizumab mimicking Factor VIII function; and emerging gene therapies from Spark Therapeutics and BioMarin. The article provides a framework categorizing genetic disease treatments into five levels, from Level One (untreatable) to Level Five (complete genetic cure), positioning hemophilia as a therapeutic testing ground where multiple approaches—from protein replacement to RNA interference to gene therapy—are simultaneously advancing. The piece also highlights the business competition and litigation between Roche and Shire, and emphasizes how rare diseases like hemophilia drive innovation through market incentives.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's 2017 publication, concrete developments occurred across all three therapeutic modalities:

**RNAi therapy (fitusiran):** This pathway encountered safety challenges. In August 2017, just weeks after the article, Alnylam paused fitusiran trials following patient deaths from thrombotic events (the bleeding/clotting balance concern the article noted). After protocol modifications and dose adjustments, fitusiran trials resumed but development continued to face safety monitoring requirements. As of 2023-2024, fitusiran has not received FDA approval, though regulatory submissions are under review—demonstrating that the promising early data in July 2017 faced significant real-world safety hurdles.

**Emicizumab (Roche):** Contrasting with fitusiran's challenges, emicizumab achieved major success. FDA approved emicizumab (brand name Hemlibra) in November 2017 for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors, expanded to all hemophilia A patients by October 2018. Emicizumab became a blockbuster drug with widespread adoption, transforming hemophilia A treatment due to subcutaneous administration (versus intravenous factor infusions) and effectiveness across patient populations.

**Gene therapy:** Spark Therapeutics' hemophilia B gene therapy (etranacogene dezaparvovec) eventually achieved FDA approval in November 2022 (brand name Hemgenix), becoming the first gene therapy for hemophilia B. BioMarin's hemophilia A gene therapy (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) received European approval in 2022 but faced FDA rejection in 2020 due to durability concerns, eventually gaining FDA approval in 2023 with limitations. These approvals validate the article's Level Five therapeutic concept but with the caveat that even approved gene therapies show variable durability and manufacturing challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Shire's market position erosion:** The article predicted Shire's hemophilia position would decline due to Roche's competition. **Accurate**—Shire's hemophilia portfolio faced significant pressure, and Shire was acquired by Takeda in 2019, with hemophilia treatments losing market share to emicizumab.

• **Alnylam/Sanofi success versus Roche:** The article suggested Alnylam/Sanofi could "erode Roche's newfound position" if fitusiran succeeded. **Inaccurate**—fitusiran's safety issues and delayed development prevented competition with emicizumab's market dominance.

• **Gene therapy reaching patients:** The article positioned gene therapy "on the barest fringes" but noted Spark and BioMarin's progress. **Accurate directionally but underestimated timeline**—FDA approvals arrived 5-6 years later (2022-2023), representing legitimate Level Five therapies though with limitations not fully anticipated in 2017.

• **The Level hierarchy framework:** The five-level classification system implicitly predicted gene therapy would achieve the highest "Level Five" status. **Accurate conceptually**—gene therapies now exist and meet Level Five criteria (complete genetic restoration), though with caveats about durability (some patients require re-treatment) and accessibility (extremely high costs).

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article stands out because it correctly identified hemophilia as a therapeutic battleground where different technological approaches would compete simultaneously, and it articulated a clear framework for understanding therapeutic progress in rare genetic diseases. The piece accurately predicted the competitive dynamics while appropriately hedging on specific outcomes for technologies facing legitimate safety concerns.
