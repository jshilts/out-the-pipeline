# Running Out of Helium? (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In this 2012 commentary Derek Lowe warned that the United States’ decision to sell off its strategic helium reserve had driven down the price of “cheap” helium, which in turn encouraged higher consumption and created a looming shortage. He argued that the market was becoming distorted: once‑cheap helium was being squandered (e.g., in party balloons) while high‑cost helium was needed to keep NMR spectrometers and MRI scanners running. Lowe doubted that new natural‑gas or shale‑gas discoveries would quickly replenish cheap supplies, and he suggested that “Peak Helium” might already have been reached, implying that future prices would stay high.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Policy and supply changes**  
- **2015 Helium Stewardship Act** – Replaced the 1996 Helium Privatization Act. It created a new Federal Helium Reserve (the “Helium Reserve”) and imposed a “price ceiling” that was gradually lifted, allowing the government to sell helium at market‑based rates.  
- **2021 Helium Act amendment** – Further liberalized sales and authorized the Treasury to set a “fair market price” for the reserve’s output, smoothing price volatility.  

**Production trends**  
- **U.S. domestic output** rose sharply after 2013 as companies (e.g., ExxonMobil, Noble Energy) began extracting helium from natural‑gas fields, especially the Barnett, Haynesville, and Marcellus shales. By 2018 the U.S. was the world’s second‑largest helium producer after Qatar.  
- **Global supply** expanded with new projects in Algeria, Russia, Poland, and Australia, adding roughly 1 billion cubic feet per year (Bcf/yr) of recoverable helium.  

**Price trajectory**  
- The spot price for helium (USD per 1,000 cubic feet) climbed from ~ $100 in 2012 to a peak of $200‑$300 in 2015‑2016, confirming Lowe’s short‑term shortage concerns.  
- After the 2015‑2016 peak, prices fell steadily, reaching $30‑$40 by 2020 as new supply entered the market and the Federal Reserve’s sales increased.  

**Impact on scientific and medical equipment**  
- **NMR/MRI magnets**: The high‑price period prompted many research labs and hospitals to install helium‑recovery and “zero‑boil‑off” systems, cutting annual helium loss by 70‑90 %.  
- **Cryogen‑free technology**: By the late 2010s, commercial cryogen‑free (dry) MRI and high‑field NMR spectrometers using high‑temperature superconductors became viable, reducing dependence on bulk helium. Adoption is still limited for the highest‑field (> 900 MHz) NMR instruments, but the trend has softened the market impact.  

**Overall market health**  
- As of 2024 the helium market is considered **stable**. The U.S. Federal Reserve reports a modest surplus in the reserve, and global production meets the combined demand of scientific, medical, aerospace, and semiconductor sectors. Shortages occasionally appear in niche high‑purity grades, but they are managed through inventory and recycling rather than price spikes.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “Peak Helium may have already been realized; prices will stay high.”  
  - **Outcome:** Prices did spike (2015‑2016) but then fell dramatically as new sources and recycling took hold. The “peak” was temporary, not permanent.  

- **Prediction:** “NMR magnets will become more expensive to run because cheap helium will disappear.”  
  - **Outcome:** The cost pressure led to widespread adoption of helium‑recovery systems and, in some cases, to cryogen‑free magnets. Operating costs have stabilized or even declined for many facilities.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** “Continued oil and natural‑gas exploration will not quickly replenish cheap helium.”  
  - **Outcome:** Exploration of helium‑rich natural‑gas fields in the U.S. and elsewhere did add substantial low‑cost helium, contradicting the notion that new gas finds would be irrelevant.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article captured a real, time‑bound market distortion and sparked industry‑wide responses (recycling, policy reform), but its long‑term alarmist tone over‑estimated the permanence of the shortage.
