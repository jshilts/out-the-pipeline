# How You Make an Adenovirus Vaccine (February 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This technical commentary explains the manufacturing process for adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines (J&J, Oxford/AstraZeneca, CanSino, Gamaleya/Sputnik V). The author details how adenoviruses are engineered by removing replication genes (E1 and E3 regions) and inserting DNA encoding the coronavirus spike protein. Production involves creating modified linear adenovirus DNA (often using bacterial plasmids), transfecting it into engineered human cell lines (HEK293 or PER.C6) that provide the missing replication proteins, then culturing these cells to produce non-replicating viral particles. The article emphasizes manufacturing challenges, including varying adenovirus serotypes used to overcome pre-existing immunity (Ad26, chimpanzee adenovirus) versus CanSino's use of Ad5, and production difficulties like the yield problems some facilities experienced. The purification process involves cell lysis, filtration, chromatography, and ultrafiltration, with simpler formulation compared to mRNA vaccines. The author notes widespread global manufacturing partnerships and the fundamental trade-offs in scaling viral vector production.

## 2. HISTORY

The adenovirus vector vaccines described achieved varying levels of real-world success and deployment:

**Johnson & Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S)**: Received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in February 2021. The vaccine saw significant global deployment but faced manufacturing challenges, including a major contamination incident at Emergent BioSolutions' Baltimore facility in March 2021 that ruined 15 million doses and led to FDA scrutiny. The vaccine was widely used internationally and in the US, with over 200 million doses administered globally. In May 2022, the FDA limited authorization due to rare blood clotting events (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). J&J discontinued the vaccine in 2023 as the pandemic evolved.

**Oxford/AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)**: Widely deployed globally, with over 3 billion doses administered worldwide. Faced multiple manufacturing challenges, including the yield problems mentioned in the article. The vaccine encountered significant regulatory issues: several European countries temporarily suspended use in March 2021 due to blood clotting concerns. In April 2021, the UK restricted use in people under 30, and several countries limited it to older populations. It was never authorized in the US, with manufacturing problems and regulatory concerns cited as factors. AstraZeneca announced withdrawal from the market in 2024 as demand decreased.

**CanSino (Ad5-nCoV)**: Authorized in several countries including China, Mexico, Pakistan, and Hungary. However, it faced criticism regarding efficacy data transparency and concerns about pre-existing Ad5 immunity affecting effectiveness, as the article anticipated. Deployed primarily in China and limited international markets, with lower global uptake compared to mRNA vaccines.

**Gamaleya (Sputnik V)**: Authorized in over 70 countries, primarily Russia and allied nations, but faced significant production delays and international skepticism about data transparency. Production partnerships with countries like India and South Korea faced challenges, and the vaccine was not approved by major Western regulatory bodies.

The broader adenovirus vector platform demonstrated both advantages (single-dose potential, simpler storage than mRNA) and significant limitations (rare blood clotting events, pre-existing immunity concerns, complex manufacturing). The technology proved valuable for global vaccination but did not match mRNA vaccine performance in settings with pre-existing adenovirus immunity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Pre-existing immunity impact**: The article raised concerns that pre-existing immunity to adenovirus vectors would reduce vaccine effectiveness. This prediction was validated: studies showed decreased immunogenicity in populations with high Ad5 seroprevalence, which influenced vaccine design choices (such as J&J's use of rarer Ad26 and Oxford's use of chimpanzee adenovirus).

• **CanSino efficacy concerns**: The article questioned whether CanSino's use of Ad5 would limit effectiveness. This concern proved prescient; CanSino showed lower efficacy than mRNA vaccines and faced questions about performance in populations with high Ad5 immunity.

• **Manufacturing complexity and yield problems**: The article highlighted production scale-up challenges, noting AstraZeneca's yield problems. This prediction was validated repeatedly: multiple manufacturers faced production delays, contamination issues (particularly J&J/Emergent), and difficulty meeting manufacturing commitments.

• **Second-dose effectiveness concerns**: The article questioned whether vector-based platforms would face reduced effectiveness with repeated dosing. Limited data emerged on this as most vaccine programs didn't rely heavily on adenovirus vector boosters due to the clotting concerns and availability of heterologous boosting with mRNA vaccines.

• **Cross-reactivity between adenovirus vectors**: The article wondered about cross-reactivity when using the same vector for different diseases. While this remained a theoretical concern, the rapid vaccine development timeline provided limited practical data on long-term vector immunity impacts.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article provided technically accurate and prescient analysis of adenovirus vector vaccine manufacturing, correctly identifying key challenges (pre-existing immunity, manufacturing complexity) that would significantly impact real-world deployment. The article's depth on production processes and clear explanation of trade-offs made it valuable for understanding subsequent vaccine performance and manufacturing struggles.
