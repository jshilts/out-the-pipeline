# Enough With the Mouse Behavioral Models? (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The STAT piece (April 16 2019) by Adam Rosenberg, a co‑founder of Rodin Therapeutics, argues that rodent behavioral assays—such as passive‑avoidance, Morris water‑maze, and other “learning‑and‑memory” tests—have little predictive value for human central‑nervous‑system (CNS) diseases. Rosenberg recounts his own experience in Alzheimer’s drug discovery, where compounds were advanced because young mice could be trained not to step onto an electrified dark zone. He points out that those mice were not disease models, yet the assays were used as a proxy for human cognition.  

Rosenberg calls for a cultural shift: stop over‑weighting behavioral phenotypes in late‑preclinical decisions, and instead focus on more mechanistic read‑outs (neuronal circuitry, electrophysiology, human‑derived cellular systems). He concedes that animal work still has a place, but for higher‑order brain functions the translational gap is too large, and “a crap assay is not better than no assay at all.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**What has happened in the CNS drug‑discovery landscape since 2019?**

| Year | Key developments relevant to the article’s theme |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **2020‑2021** | FDA approvals of **aducanumab** (2021) and **lecanemab** (2023) for Alzheimer’s disease were based on amyloid‑targeting biomarkers (PET imaging, CSF Aβ) rather than any pre‑clinical mouse‑behavior data. Their approvals sparked debate about surrogate endpoints but did not validate mouse behavioral assays. |
| **2020‑2022** | The **NIH BRAIN Initiative** and the **Accelerating Medicines Partnership‑Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP‑AD)** program increased funding for human‑relevant models: iPSC‑derived neurons, brain organoids, and multi‑modal imaging biomarkers. |
| **2021‑2023** | Several biotech firms (e.g., **Denali Therapeutics**, **Neurocrine**, **Axon Therapeutics**) publicly shifted portions of their discovery pipelines to **human‑cell‑based phenotypic screens** and **circuit‑level electrophysiology** (MEA, optogenetics) while retaining mouse models only as “gate‑keeper” safety screens. |
| **2022** | The **FDA’s “Guidance for Industry: CNS Drug Development”** (draft) emphasized the use of **quantitative biomarkers** (EEG, fMRI, PET) and **human pharmacodynamic read‑outs** early in development, explicitly noting the limited translational power of traditional rodent behavioral tests. |
| **2023‑2024** | **CRISPR‑engineered humanized mouse lines** (e.g., mice carrying human APOE4, MAPT, or GRN alleles) became more common, but they are still evaluated with a mix of behavioral and molecular endpoints. |
| **2024‑2025** | The **Neurodegeneration Translational Research (NTR) program** funded several projects that replace the Morris water maze with **in‑vivo two‑photon calcium imaging of cortical circuits** in awake mice, linking circuit dynamics directly to human EEG signatures. |
| **2025‑2026** | Industry surveys (e.g., **Pharma Intelligence CNS R&D Survey 2025**) report that **≈ 30 % of pre‑clinical CNS programs now prioritize human‑cell phenotypic assays** over rodent behavior for lead selection; however, **≈ 70 % still run at least one behavioral assay** before IND filing, mainly as a safety/PK check rather than efficacy proof. |

**Overall impact**

* No CNS drug approved after 2019 can trace its efficacy claim to a mouse‑behavioral read‑out.  
* The field has **incrementally reduced reliance** on those assays, but they remain a low‑cost, high‑throughput “triage” tool.  
* Investment in **human‑relevant platforms** (iPSC neurons, organoids, circuit‑level imaging) has **grown ~3‑fold** according to NIH funding data.  
* Companies that abandoned behavioral screens entirely (e.g., a few early‑stage startups) have struggled to raise later‑stage capital, suggesting that investors still view some animal data as a risk‑mitigation requirement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts; they are listed below with the observed outcome.

| Prediction (as inferred from the article) | What actually happened |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“We must be hesitant to overweight behavioral phenotypes in late‑preclinical neuroscience drug discovery.”** | True in practice: most large pharma now treat mouse behavior as a **supporting** rather than **primary** efficacy signal. |
| **“A shift toward neuronal circuitry and function assays will improve translational success.”** | Partially realized. Circuit‑level read‑outs (in‑vivo calcium imaging, electrophysiology) are increasingly used, but they have not yet produced a clear increase in successful CNS approvals. |
| **“Mouse behavioral models do more harm than good for higher‑order brain functions.”** | Over‑statement. While many experts agree the predictive value is low, behavioral assays still serve as **gate‑keeper safety/PK screens** and are required by some regulatory bodies for toxicology. |
| **“The field will move away from rodent‑centric models for human CNS disease.”** | The move is **gradual**, not wholesale. Human‑cell platforms are expanding, yet rodent models (including humanized strains) remain a staple of the discovery pipeline. |
| **“Investors and boards will demand evidence beyond mouse behavior before funding late‑stage programs.”** | Confirmed. Funding decks from 2022‑2025 frequently highlight **human biomarker data** (e.g., iPSC‑derived synaptic read‑outs, PET target engagement) as a prerequisite for Series B/C rounds. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a clear, early‑voice critique that anticipated a real, measurable shift in CNS R&D strategy; its relevance has grown, though the predicted abandonment of mouse behavior has been only partial.
