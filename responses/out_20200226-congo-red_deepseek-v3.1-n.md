# Congo Red (February 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a historical commentary tracing the unexpected connections between the 19th-century dyestuff industry and modern biomedical research, using Congo Red as the central example. The article describes how synthetic dye chemistry emerged from coal-tar byproducts in Germany's Ruhr valley, creating the first large libraries of synthetic chemicals that eventually became screening collections for biological activity. Congo Red, discovered by Bayer chemist Paul Böttiger in the 1880s, was originally a commercially successful textile dye that sparked patent wars between Bayer and AGFA.

The article focuses on how Congo Red was repurposed for biomedical use in 1922 when Herman Bennhold discovered it selectively stains amyloid protein deposits. This staining technique, still used today, became crucial for identifying amyloid in pathology samples, including the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The article discusses how the precise molecular mechanism of Congo Red binding to amyloid fibrils remained unclear despite decades of use, and highlights a new 2020 study using NMR, absorbance spectra, and DFT calculations that proposed a revised binding model involving pi-stacking interactions.

## 2. HISTORY

Since the article's publication in February 2020, several developments have occurred in amyloid research and Congo Red's applications, though not all are directly related to the specific binding mechanism question posed in the article:

**Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics**: The most significant post-2020 development has been the FDA approval of anti-amyloid antibodies for Alzheimer's treatment. Aduhelm (aducanumab) received controversial FDA approval in June 2021, followed by Leqembi (lecanemab) in January 2023, which gained traditional approval. These approvals marked the first disease-modifying treatments targeting amyloid pathology, although their clinical benefits remain modest and they carry risks of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).

**Therapeutic Mechanisms**: These drugs work by binding to and promoting clearance of amyloid-beta aggregates rather than using staining properties like Congo Red. However, they validate the foundational premise that amyloid detection and targeting remains clinically relevant for drug development.

**Diagnostic Advances**: Research has continued advancing beyond Congo Red staining for amyloid detection in clinical practice, with PET amyloid imaging agents becoming more established and blood-based biomarkers (p-tau217, GFAP, and others) emerging as promising screening and diagnostic tools.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made no explicit predictions about future developments. Instead, it was primarily retrospective, tracing historical connections between dyes and biomedical research while highlighting a contemporary scientific question about Congo Red's binding mechanism to amyloid.

The implicit trajectory suggested—that understanding fundamental binding mechanisms of established tools like Congo Red continues providing value—has been borne out by ongoing research into amyloid biology and therapeutics. However, the last few years have seen more focus on therapeutic interventions and diagnostic alternatives rather than detailed mechanistic studies of Congo Red binding.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides solid historical context connecting industrial chemistry to biomedical research but addresses a relatively niche mechanistic question without broader clinical or therapeutic implications that have emerged since 2020.
