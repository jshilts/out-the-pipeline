# The End of Synthesis (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Science paper by Marty Burke's group at the University of Illinois introducing an automated synthesis approach using MIDA boronates. The key insight was that MIDA boronates adhere to silica gel when eluted with MeOH/ether but release with THF, creating a "catch-and-release" purification system. This enables iterative, automated coupling of building blocks—deprotect a MIDA boronate to boronic acid, couple to a brominated partner with another MIDA boronate, purify via solvent switching, and repeat.

The author frames this as potentially revolutionary for organic synthesis, comparing it to how solid-phase synthesis transformed peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis from bespoke challenges into routine, machine-driven processes. The piece argues that traditional total synthesis of natural products has become less intellectually vital as analytical methods obviate structure determination needs and synthetic techniques make most molecules theoretically accessible. The author suggests organic synthesis must evolve from an end in itself (pursuing elegant, optimized routes) toward a means to other ends—quickly generating molecules for drug discovery, materials science, or other applications, prioritizing "enough" yield over optimization.

## 2. HISTORY

Burke's MIDA boronate platform catalyzed significant investment and activity in automated synthesis and molecular assembly:

- **Technology commercialization**: Burke co-founded REVOLUTIONARY MEDICINES in 2015 to commercialize the automated synthesis technology. The company raised substantial venture funding (including $25M Series A in 2015) to develop automated small-molecule synthesis platforms for drug discovery.

- **Scientific development**: The field of automated synthesis expanded considerably. Research groups demonstrated increasingly complex molecules accessible through iterative cross-coupling approaches, though the "saturated carbon" coupling limitation noted in 2015 remained a challenge. The concept evolved into what became known as "iterative cross-coupling" or "autonomous synthesis" platforms.

- **Industrial impact**: Pharmaceutical companies and synthetic biology firms invested in automated synthesis capabilities. The approach proved particularly valuable for fragment-based drug discovery, rapid analog synthesis in medicinal chemistry, and synthesizing compound libraries for screening. However, the vision of completely automated total synthesis replacing traditional methods did not fully materialize—instead, automated approaches became valuable *tools* augmenting medicinal chemistry rather than replacing all conventional synthesis.

- **Commercial platforms**: Several companies built synthesis automation platforms using related principles. While yields and scope remained varied (as predicted), the technology enabled routine synthesis of certain molecular classes, particularly via Suzuki-Miyaura and related cross-coupling reactions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions about automated synthesis transforming organic chemistry:

- **Prediction**: "Synthesis will become modular and mechanized like peptide/oligonucleotide synthesis"

  **Reality**: Partial success. Automated synthesis platforms became commercially available and widely adopted for certain applications (library synthesis, fragment elaboration), but traditional synthesis methods remain dominant for complex natural products and novel structures. The field hybridized rather than fully transformed.

- **Prediction**: "Synthesis will shift from art/optimization to utility—focus on making molecules for applications rather than elegant routes"

  **Reality**: Mixed outcome. Drug discovery chemistry increasingly prioritizes rapid access to testable compounds over optimized synthesis. However, total synthesis and method development continue thriving in academia, and optimization remains crucial for manufacturing processes.

- **Prediction**: "We'll need fewer new bond-forming reactions and more focus on making new modular building blocks"

  **Reality**: This proved prescient. The rise of building-block-centric synthesis, fragment-based approaches, and modular design significantly influenced medicinal chemistry practice. Many pharmaceutical companies now maintain extensive building-block libraries and emphasize rapid analog synthesis.

- **Prediction**: MIDA boronate catch-and-release would enable "cranking out new molecules for other purposes"

  **Reality**: Achieved in specific domains. The technology and related platforms enabled routine synthesis of certain compound classes, particularly for drug discovery applications. However, the universal applicability envisioned for all organic molecules ran into the predicted limitations around saturated carbon-carbon bond formation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article correctly identified a major technological shift toward automated synthesis and articulated the broader implications for chemistry's relationship to utility versus aesthetics. While some hyperbolic framing ("seeing the end from here") overstated the completeness of transformation, the core vision of routine automated synthesis for drug discovery applications proved quite prescient. The piece captured a genuine inflection point in how chemistry would interface with high-throughput molecular design and remains relevant today as automation expands in both synthetic chemistry and drug discovery.
