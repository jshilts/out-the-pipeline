# Business Note: Random Promotion, Anyone? (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This short commentary piece discusses research suggesting that traditional corporate promotion strategies may be counterproductive, with random promotion potentially being more effective. The article cites a Guardian piece referencing academic studies showing that promotion systems based on performance metrics show minimal measurable differences—sometimes in "single digits on a hundred point scale"—from random assignment. Key factors identified include the difficulty of accurately judging promotion criteria, choosing wrong criteria, and Peter Principle effects where people are promoted into positions where they're less effective. The author notes the paradox that HR practitioners evaluate these systems, creating potential bias in assessment, and raises the broader question of whether the significant time spent on promotion processes actually impacts organizational bottom lines.

## 2. HISTORY
The fundamental research behind this 2011 article (likely referencing work by researchers like Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo on the "Peter Principle") has since been more formally published and extended. The original Italian research team published their mathematical model demonstrating that random promotion outperforms merit-based promotion in certain organizational contexts in journals like Physica A (2010-2011). Subsequent research in 2018 in the journal Advances in Complex Systems provided more rigorous mathematical backing, showing that under realistic assumptions about job hierarchy and human career dynamics, random promotion achieved better overall organizational performance than merit-based systems.

However, despite this academic work, there is no evidence of widespread corporate adoption of random promotion systems. No major companies have publicly moved to randomized promotion processes. Instead, corporate HR practices in the 2010s moved toward more data-driven approaches, with companies like Google developing sophisticated performance analytics (Project Oxygen) and others adopting continuous feedback systems, frequent performance conversations, and more granular metrics. The tech industry in particular focused on structured interviews, competency frameworks, and metrics-based evaluation rather than random processes.

The research did contribute to broader discussions about performance management reform—leading companies like Microsoft, Deloitte, and GE moved away from forced ranking and annual reviews toward more frequent feedback systems. But these reforms still maintained merit-based selection, just with different evaluation timing and methods. The practical barriers to implementing truly random promotion (employee morale, legal compliance, organizational culture) apparently outweighed the theoretical benefits demonstrated in academic models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction that random promotion might gain consideration**: The article suggested the research "raises uncomfortable questions" and noted the difficulty of implementation. In reality, random promotion never moved beyond academic exercises. Organizations continued investing heavily in refined merit-based systems.

• **Suggestion that HR practitioners might resist such findings**: The article noted that HR professionals evaluate these systems themselves, creating potential bias. This accurately captured the dynamic—the HR industry continued developing more sophisticated performance management tools rather than abandoning merit-based systems.

• **Implication that traditional promotion might decline**: The research suggested traditional methods show minimal impact. However, corporations actually increased their investment in performance management and promotion systems throughout the 2010s, with the global performance management market growing significantly.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

The article presents an interesting academic counterintuitive finding, but it connects to a niche research area that never achieved practical application or broad impact on actual management practices.
