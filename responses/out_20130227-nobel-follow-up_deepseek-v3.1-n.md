# A Nobel Follow-Up (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary discusses Douglas Prasher, the scientist who discovered and cloned the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) but was controversially left out of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which was awarded to Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Tsien for GFP work. By the time the Nobel was announced, Prasher had suffered career setbacks and was working as a shuttle bus driver in Huntsville. The article reports the heartening news that Prasher had returned to scientific research and was working in Roger Tsien's laboratory, potentially representing a "happy ending" to his story.

## 2. HISTORY

**Prasher's Continued Scientific Career**: After returning to research in Tsien's lab in 2013, Prasher continued working in scientific positions. He joined Roger Tsien's laboratory at the University of California, San Diego, as a research associate, contributing to ongoing research projects. In subsequent years, Prasher maintained his connection to the scientific community and continued working in research roles, though he never received formal recognition through the Nobel Prize.

**No Major Professional Recognition or Independent Research Breakthroughs**: Despite his return to science, Prasher did not achieve major independent scientific breakthroughs or receive significant professional awards following his comeback. He remained primarily in supporting research roles rather than leading his own major research programs.

**Tsien's Continued Advocacy**: Roger Tsien continued to publicly acknowledge Prasher's foundational contributions to GFP work in interviews and scientific discussions, helping to ensure Prasher's role in GFP history was recognized within the scientific community.

**GFP's Ongoing Impact**: GFP and its variants have remained essential tools in molecular biology and biomedical research, used in thousands of laboratories worldwide across applications including protein localization, gene expression studies, and live-cell imaging. Multiple drugs using GFP-related technology have entered clinical pipelines for various diseases, though primarily as research tools rather than therapeutic agents.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: The article ended with "A happy ending?" (a question implying hope that Prasher would find professional fulfillment and success in his return to science).

**Reality**: Mixed outcome. While Prasher did successfully return to scientific work and contributed to research in Tsien's lab, he did not achieve breakthrough scientific success or major professional advancement comparable to Nobel laureates. His story remains primarily notable as a tale of resilience and a cautionary example of how scientific credit can be unevenly distributed.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **4/10**

The article is of moderate interest as a human-interest story about a controversial Nobel Prize exclusion, and it highlights issues of scientific credit and career resilience. However, it lacks broader implications for biotechnology or policy.

A Nobel Follow-Up
27 Feb 2013

Those of you who remember the Green Fluorescent Protein Nobel (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/10/08/a_green_fluorescent_nobel_prize) story will likely recall Douglas Prasher. He was the earliest discoverer of GFP, and Roger Tsien has said that he has no idea why he didn't get the Nobel as well. But Prasher, after a series of career and personal reverses, ended up (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95545761) driving a shuttle bus in Huntsville by the time the prize was announced. 
 Well, he's back in science again - and working in the Tsien lab. Here's the story (http://www.the-scientist.com//?articles.view/articleNo/34536/title/What-Ever-Happened-to-Douglas-Prasher-/) , which I was very glad to read. Prasher's clearly smart and talented, and I hope that he can put all that to good use. A happy ending?
