# Getting Down to Protein-Protein Compounds (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the challenges of targeting alpha-helix protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with small molecules, referencing a Nature Chemistry review from researchers at Leeds. The author notes there are two main approaches: creating helical molecules that present side chains in correct orientation, or designing non-helical structures that happen to arrange groups into the right positions. Neither approach typically yields drug-like molecules.

The central tension identified is between making potent PPI inhibitors versus staying within Lipinski-guideline property space (which defines drug-like molecules) - the author suggests both may not be simultaneously achievable. A major concern raised is getting such compounds into cells, particularly for macrocyclic structures. The article proposes that without clear understanding of cellular permeability, the field might need "brute force" approaches - rapidly generating diverse complex structures and testing them to build empirical understanding. The piece emphasizes that advancing this area requires cutting-edge synthetic organic chemistry capabilities.

The article also references ongoing controversy about "stapled peptides" and suggests some may not work as well as initially advertised, linking to a C&E News overview of that debate.

## 2. HISTORY
**Stapled Peptides Development:** Stapled peptides (chemically stabilized helices) saw continued development after 2013. In 2019, the FDA approved the first stapled peptide drug, ALRN-6924, as a p53-MDM2/MDMX antagonist for treating certain cancers, representing a significant validation of the approach for PPI modulation. Several other stapled peptide candidates progressed through clinical trials targeting various PPI interfaces.

**PPI Drug Development Landscape:** The decade following 2013 saw significant progress in PPI drug development. Key successes included: venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor, FDA approved 2016), which targets a PPI interface in apoptosis regulation and achieved blockbuster status; and navitoclax and other BCL-2 family inhibitors. The field moved beyond just helical interfaces to various PPI topographies.

**Cellular Delivery Solutions:** Progress occurred in understanding and improving cellular permeability of PPI inhibitors. PROTAC technology emerged as a major breakthrough, obviating some cellular permeability challenges by achieving intracellular protein degradation through different mechanisms. Macrocyclic compounds became better understood, with improved design principles for cell penetration. Computational and structural biology advances enabled better prediction of PPI "hot spots."

**Synthetic Chemistry Advances:** High-throughput synthesis and screening capabilities improved significantly, enabling the "brute force" approach suggested in the article. Diversity-oriented synthesis, DNA-encoded libraries, and automated synthesis platforms addressed the need for generating complex PPI-inhibitor scaffolds rapidly. The organic chemistry field continued developing new methodologies for complex molecule construction.

The PPI field evolved from "undruggable" to a validated target space with approved drugs and extensive clinical pipelines by 2023.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction about choice between Lipinski space and PPI potency**: The article suggested having to choose between drug-like properties and potent PPI inhibition. **Assessment**: This proved partially true but overly pessimistic. Drugs like venetoclax achieved FDA approval while maintaining reasonable drug-like properties, though many PPI inhibitors still sit outside traditional Lipinski space. The emergence of PROTACs provided an alternative solution entirely.

• **Concern about cellular permeability for big cyclic compounds**: The article worried about getting macrocyclic PPI inhibitors into cells. **Assessment**: This concern proved valid but manageable. Understanding of cell penetration mechanisms improved significantly, with advances in molecular design, formulation, and delivery technologies. Some macrocyclic PPI inhibitors achieved clinical success.

• **Suggestion that "brute force" synthesis would be needed**: The author proposed generating diverse complex structures rapidly for empirical learning. **Assessment**: Accurate prediction. Combinatorial chemistry, DNA-encoded libraries, and high-throughput screening became central to PPI drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in these capabilities.

• **Argument for importance of cutting-edge organic chemistry**: The article emphasized that advanced synthesis capabilities would be essential. **Assessment**: Correct. The PPI field's progress was indeed enabled by advances in synthetic methodology, particularly for complex molecular architectures.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This article identified core challenges in PPI drug development that remained relevant for years. The discussion about balancing potency with drug-like properties, the cellular delivery problem, and the need for advanced synthesis capabilities proved prescient. However, the article understated how quickly some solutions would emerge (like PROTACs) and the field's overall progress trajectory.
