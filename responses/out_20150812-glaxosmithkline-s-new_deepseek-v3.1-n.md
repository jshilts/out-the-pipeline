# GlaxoSmithKline's New Strategy, Defended (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article presents an interview with GlaxoSmithKline's Moncef Slaoui defending GSK's strategic pivot toward high-volume, lower-margin therapies rather than pursuing ultra-high-priced specialty drugs. Slaoui argues that the prevailing pharmaceutical pricing model is unsustainable, particularly for drugs that provide marginal benefits (such as a few months of extended survival) at enormous cost to a small patient population. He contends that such pricing disproportionately burdens healthcare systems and fails to align with genuine therapeutic value. The piece contrasts GSK's strategy with companies like Gilead Sciences (with its $87,000-$95,000 hepatitis C cures Sovaldi and Harvoni that eliminate future transplant costs) versus Merck's Keytruda (an immunotherapy offering months of extended survival for advanced melanoma at high cost). Slaoui acknowledges that GSK's board, including CEO Andrew Witty, believes the traditional pricing approach must evolve toward greater volume with lower margins to remain viable long-term. The article notes that if this strategy fails to deliver clear financial returns quickly, GSK leadership may face pressure to reverse course.

## 2. HISTORY

**GSK's Strategy Evolution (2015-2020):**
Moncef Slaoui's prediction about pricing sustainability proved prescient, though GSK's execution of their volume-focused strategy faced challenges. By 2017, GSK had indeed emphasized their vaccine and consumer healthcare divisions while maintaining moderate R&D investment. However, the anticipated shift to high-volume, lower-margin success did not fully materialize in the short term. Andrew Witty stepped down as CEO in 2017, succeeded by Emma Walmsley, who maintained some elements of the strategy but also pursued different initiatives.

**Drug Pricing Developments:**
Public and political scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing intensified substantially after 2015, validating Slaoui's concerns. By 2016-2020, the hepatitis C pricing controversy led to significant payer restrictions and formulary battles. The broader debate on drug affordability intensified, especially in oncology, where immunotherapies continued to expand but at premium prices. GSK did not fully abandon innovative drug development, but their portfolio focus shifted—by 2020, their pharmaceutical pipeline included substantial investments in oncology (including PARP inhibitors and immuno-oncology), though many programs required partnerships or acquisitions rather than purely internal discovery.

**Keytruda Evolution:**
Merck's Keytruda expanded dramatically beyond advanced melanoma, gaining approvals across numerous cancer types including lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and others, becoming one of the world's best-selling drugs. By 2020-2022, Keytruda sales exceeded $14-20 billion annually, demonstrating that high-priced immunotherapies with broad application could achieve commercial success even without being curative in all settings, particularly when they provided durable responses or survival benefits that justified costs to payers. The predicted collapse of premium pricing models did not fully occur, though pricing negotiations and value-based frameworks became increasingly common.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** "Slaoui suggested [...] the current pricing model is unsustainable in the long run"  
**Reality:** Partially validated. While drug prices did not collapse across the board, intense pricing pressure emerged through mechanisms like value-based contracts, formulary exclusions, and government policy changes. High-priced drugs with demonstrated value continued to thrive (Keytruda, CAR-T therapies), while those with marginal benefits faced greater scrutiny and negotiation.

• **Prediction:** GSK would shift "volume-price equation" toward high-volume, lower-margin products  
**Reality:** Mixed results. GSK continued developing significant pharmaceutical assets but made major organizational changes. In 2020-2022, GSK demerged its consumer healthcare business (Haleon) and increased focus on vaccines and specialty medicines, suggesting a refinement rather than wholesale adoption of the 2015 strategy.

• **Prediction:** High-priced drugs treating few patients with limited benefit would become untenable  
**Reality:** Oversimplified. Niche drugs with transformative outcomes (e.g., gene therapies, some rare disease treatments) maintained premium pricing and achieved commercial success. Marginal benefits remained commercially viable if properly targeted to patient populations with sufficient need and payer willingness.

• **Implicit prediction:** Immunotherapy drugs like Keytruda might face pricing headwinds due to limited benefits for small populations  
**Reality:** Demonstrably incorrect. Keytruda expanded to dozens of indications, generated massive revenue, and established immunotherapy as a pillar of cancer treatment despite variable patient response rates. The drug demonstrated that transformative clinical impact, even in subsets of patients or for incremental gains, could justify premium pricing when accompanied by strong clinical evidence.

• **Prediction:** If GSK's strategy didn't quickly show dividends, board support might wane  
**Reality:** Partially validated. Witty's departure preceded leadership changes. However, the company continued to balance volume-focused (vaccines) and high-value (oncology) portfolios. By 2020-2023, GSK strengthened their presence in oncology and immunology while maintaining vaccine leadership.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures the drug pricing debate at a crucial inflection point and foreshadows the strategic dilemmas pharmaceutical companies would face over the next decade. Slaoui's articulation of pricing sustainability concerns demonstrated prescient awareness of the political and economic pressures that would intensify across the industry.
