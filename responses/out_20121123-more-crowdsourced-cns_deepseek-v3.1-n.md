# More on That Crowdsourced CNS Research (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a brief update from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog noting that a crowdfunded central nervous system (CNS) research project was entering its final 48 hours for donations on the RocketHub crowdfunding platform. Lowe mentions that donations were accelerating but it remained uncertain whether the project would reach its funding target. The blog post served as both an update and a promotional call to action, directing interested readers to contribute to the research project's crowdfunding campaign.

## 2. HISTORY
This brief blog update reflects the early experimental phase of crowdfunding for scientific research, which was novel in 2012. Looking at the broader trajectory since then:

**Crowdfunding for scientific research has grown significantly** but remains a niche funding mechanism rather than a mainstream approach. Platforms like Experiment.com (launched in 2013), Consano, and others have emerged specifically for scientific crowdfunding, while general platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have occasionally hosted research projects.

**The model has had mixed success** - some projects have successfully reached funding goals and produced publishable research, while many others have struggled to attract sufficient funding. Success rates vary by field, with more accessible, applied, or publicly relevant research (environmental studies, health-related work, citizen science) generally performing better than fundamental laboratory research.

**Despite initial enthusiasm**, crowdfunding has not fundamentally disrupted traditional research funding mechanisms (government grants, foundation support, industry partnerships). Most academic and institutional research continues to rely on conventional funding sources. The model works best for small-scale projects, proof-of-concept studies, or research with strong public appeal, but has not scaled to support major multi-year research programs typical in CNS drug discovery.

**The specific CNS research project mentioned** in this article appears to have been part of this broader experimental wave, but I don't have confidence in providing specific outcomes about this particular campaign's success or failure, or its subsequent scientific contributions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself does not contain explicit predictions about the future of crowdfunding for scientific research. It is primarily an update about a specific funding campaign's status. 

Lowe's brief commentary gives no indication of whether he expected crowdfunding to become a major force in scientific research or remain a marginal approach. The post is purely informational about the immediate situation.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2/9**

This short blog update is a minor historical datapoint reflecting the experimental phase of research crowdfunding. While the broader trend of alternative research funding mechanisms has continued relevance, this particular article is very brief, time-limited, and lacks deeper analysis or significant follow-up, making it of limited long-term interest beyond documenting an early example of this funding model.
