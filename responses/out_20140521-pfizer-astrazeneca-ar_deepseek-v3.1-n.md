# Pfizer/AstraZeneca: The Arm-Wrestling Phase (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This May 2014 commentary describes the tense takeover situation between Pfizer and AstraZeneca, with Pfizer's deadline of May 26th approaching under UK securities law. The article reports that institutional investors were split—some pressuring AstraZeneca's board to accept Pfizer's offer or at least negotiate, while others supported the company's management in resisting the takeover. The author predicts that the current deal would likely not go through, but warns that any missteps in AstraZeneca's turnaround plans throughout the rest of 2014 would bring Pfizer back to attempt another acquisition.

## 2. HISTORY

The Pfizer-AstraZeneca takeover attempt ultimately **did not proceed** as predicted. AstraZeneca successfully resisted Pfizer's £69.4 billion ($117 billion) offer, with the UK company's management arguing that the bid significantly undervalued their pipeline and future prospects.

Following the failed acquisition:
- **AstraZeneca's turnaround**: The company pursued an aggressive restructuring strategy, focusing on innovative medicines and expanding into emerging markets. Their oncology and respiratory portfolios became key growth drivers.
- **Pfizer's subsequent M&A activity**: In 2015, Pfizer acquired Hospira for $17 billion, and later pursued other major deals including the $14 billion acquisition of Medivation in 2016 and the $160 billion merger attempt with Allergan (which was abandoned due to US tax inversion rules).
- **Long-term outcomes**: AstraZeneca remained independent and went on to develop important drugs including cancer immunotherapies and, notably, played a significant role in COVID-19 vaccine development through their partnership with Oxford University.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "My guess is that the current deal won't go through"
  - **Outcome**: ✅ **Correct**. The deal did not go through by the May 26, 2014 deadline.

• **Prediction**: "if there's any mis-step in AZ's turnaround plans during the rest of the year, Pfizer will be right back at the door"
  - **Outcome**: ⚠️ **Partially correct**. Pfizer did not return with another AZ bid during 2014-2015. However, Pfizer did pursue other major pharmaceutical acquisitions, suggesting their M&A strategy remained active, just redirected toward other targets.

• **Implicit prediction about institutional investor influence**: The article suggested institutional pressure might force AZ's hand
  - **Outcome**: ❌ **Incorrect**. Despite investor pressure, AZ's management successfully maintained independence and convinced stakeholders of their standalone strategy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical industry consolidation and demonstrates accurate foresight about the deal's immediate failure, while the broader significance lies in understanding how major drug companies strategize around M&A, pipeline valuation, and corporate independence.
