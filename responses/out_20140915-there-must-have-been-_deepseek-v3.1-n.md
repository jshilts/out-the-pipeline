# Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Graphical Abstract (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2014 blog post by Derek Lowe highlights an embarrassing error in a published scientific figure. Lowe points readers to a *Chemical Reviews* article titled "Aqueous Rechargeable Li and Na Ion Batteries" and tells them to examine the graphical abstract figure, noting "Oh, dear" without specifying the exact mistake but implying something obviously wrong or unprofessional made it through peer review and production. The commentary is a hang-heads-in-shame moment aimed at the scientific publishing process.

## 2. HISTORY
A survey of subsequent developments suggests that aqueous rechargeable batteries continued as a niche research area focused on safety and cost advantages over conventional non-aqueous lithium-ion systems, but did not displace them in commercial markets. Research continued into aqueous lithium-ion and sodium-ion systems, along with zinc-ion and other aqueous chemistries, addressing challenges such as electrochemical stability windows and energy density. I cannot confirm the specific article's errata history or the exact error it contained.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There are no quantitative forecasts or explicit predictions presented in the article. The piece is a commentary on publication oversight, not a forward-looking assessment of battery technologies. Therefore, this section is not applicable.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
This is a brief, niche call-out post rather than substantive analysis of trends or breakthroughs. Its interest is limited to readers interested in publishing mishaps rather than broader scientific developments, and it lacks lasting significance.
