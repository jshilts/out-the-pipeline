# The New Age of Organic Synthesis (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary celebrated a newly reported nickel‑photoredox dual‑catalyzed coupling that joins **alkyl carboxylic acids** (as decarboxylative radical precursors) with **alkyl halides** to forge **sp³–sp³ C–C bonds**.  The reaction, disclosed by David MacMillan’s group in *Nature* (vol 536, 2016), uses a visible‑light‑absorbing photocatalyst (typically Ir[dF(CF₃)ppy]₂(dtbbpy)PF₆) together with a Ni(II) precatalyst and a suitable ligand.  Upon irradiation, the photocatalyst reduces the carboxylate to generate a carbon‑centered radical after loss of CO₂; the radical is captured by the Ni(0) species, which then undergoes oxidative addition with the alkyl halide and reductive elimination to give the coupled product.  

The author highlighted the method’s functional‑group tolerance (e.g., free alcohols, aldehydes, Boc‑protected amines, cyclopropyl groups) and its ability to work with the amino‑acid derived carboxylic acid proline.  The piece framed the development as a watershed moment, likening the expected impact of photoredox‑nickel couplings to the earlier “Pd‑coupling revolution” and predicting that future synthetic labs would be “lit‑up” by such chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Post‑2016 methodological expansion**  
* Within two years, dozens of groups (Baran, Doyle, Molander, Fu, etc.) published variants that broadened the substrate scope (e.g., secondary/tertiary alkyl halides, heteroaryl halides, redox‑active esters, and even organoboron partners).  
* Enantioselective versions appeared in 2018–2020 (e.g., MacMillan JACS 2018; Doyle Science 2020) by employing chiral ligands on nickel, proving that stereocontrol is possible despite the radical intermediate.  
* Flow‑photochemistry platforms (e.g., 2019 JACS “Scale‑up of photoredox‑nickel cross‑coupling in flow”) demonstrated decagram‑scale reactions with improved photon efficiency, addressing early concerns about scalability.  

**Industrial uptake**  
* Several pharmaceutical process chemists reported using the decarboxylative alkyl‑alkyl coupling for late‑stage diversification of drug candidates (e.g., Pfizer, Merck internal reports, 2019–2021). The method proved valuable for installing alkyl groups that are difficult to introduce by traditional SN2 or Pd‑mediated routes.  
* However, routine large‑scale manufacturing still favors well‑established Pd‑cross‑couplings or metal‑hydride reductions because the photoredox step requires careful light management and often stoichiometric additives (e.g., bases, sacrificial electron donors).  

**Impact on the field**  
* The 2016 paper has been cited > 1,200 times (as of late 2024), making it one of the most influential works in the “photoredox‑nickel” sub‑field.  
* It helped cement photoredox catalysis as a mainstream tool in academic synthetic chemistry; dedicated conferences (e.g., “Photoredox Chemistry” symposia at ACS meetings) and textbooks now include entire chapters on dual catalysis.  
* The broader promise of “remaking organic synthesis” has been partially realized: while photoredox‑nickel couplings are now a standard option in the synthetic toolbox, they have not displaced Pd‑couplings for the majority of C–C bond‑forming steps. The technology is most valuable for **challenging sp³–sp³ linkages**, **late‑stage functionalization**, and **rapid SAR exploration**.  

**Limitations that persisted**  
* Sensitivity to strongly coordinating heterocycles (e.g., basic amines) remains a practical hurdle; later work introduced protecting‑group strategies or alternative photocatalysts to mitigate this.  
* The need for anhydrous, oxygen‑free conditions and the cost of iridium photocatalysts limited routine use in some process labs, though cheaper organic dyes (e.g., 4CzIPN) have been adopted in later protocols.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Photoredox‑nickel couplings will “remake organic synthesis” and be as transformative as the Pd‑coupling wave of the 1990s.** | The methods have become a **high‑impact niche** rather than a universal replacement. They are now a **standard option** for difficult sp³–sp³ bonds, but Pd‑couplings still dominate routine large‑scale C–C bond formation. |
| **Synthetic labs will become “very lit‑up places”** (i.e., widespread use of LEDs and photoreactors). | **True** – most major academic labs now have LED arrays or flow photoreactors; commercial photoreactor kits (e.g., from Vapourtec, SynLED) are commonplace. |
| **The reaction will tolerate a broad range of functional groups, including basic amines and heterocycles.** | **Partially true.** Early reports showed limited compatibility with free basic amines; subsequent work introduced protecting‑group strategies and alternative catalysts, but strong nucleophiles still require careful handling. |
| **The method will be quickly adopted for drug‑discovery and process chemistry.** | **Confirmed** – several pharma groups have used the reaction for rapid SAR generation and, in a few cases, for pilot‑scale synthesis, though full commercial scale‑up remains rare. |
| **The community will view the method as a “new world” that will rewrite classic syntheses.** | **Mixed outcome.** Classic retrosynthetic analyses now often include a photoredox‑nickel step as a viable disconnection, but most textbook routes still rely on older strategies; the “new world” label is more aspirational than fully realized. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article captured a pivotal methodological breakthrough that sparked a vibrant sub‑field and has had tangible, though not universal, impact on both academic and industrial chemistry. Its hype was slightly overstated, but the underlying chemistry proved enduring and widely influential.
