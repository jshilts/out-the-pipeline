# Reworking Big Pharma (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

Bruce Booth of Atlas Venture published a provocative article arguing that big pharma's R&D productivity crisis couldn't be solved through incremental operational improvements. He identified the core problem as an "ossified, risk-avoiding, analysis-paralysis culture" in large pharmaceutical R&D organizations. 

Booth proposed three radical solutions: (1) disaggregate 5,000-person R&D campuses into two dozen therapeutically-focused biotech firms with independent CEOs and budgets, creating vibrant biotech parks; (2) remove commercial/ marketing influence from early research decisions, letting science and medicine guide program selection rather than NPV models and market research; (3) shake up Boards and Scientific Advisory Boards to combat "group think" by bringing in outside expertise. The article's author noted that while these ideas had merit, they faced significant implementation barriers including management resistance (since these changes would decrease executive power) and Wall Street investor opposition to such radical restructuring.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this article, the pharmaceutical industry did undergo significant transformation, though not exactly along Booth's proposed lines:

**Industry Restructuring and Biotech Integration**: Major pharmas continued large-scale reorganizations. The period saw significant M&A activity including Pfizer's $160B acquisition of Allergan (2016, later abandoned due to tax inversion rules), Bristol-Myers Squibb's $74B acquisition of Celgene (2019), and AbbVie's $63B acquisition of Allergan (2019). However, these were traditional consolidations rather than disaggregation into biotech-style units.

**R&D Model Evolution**: Companies did move toward more external innovation, but through partnership models rather than internal disaggregation. **Pfizer** established Centers for Therapeutic Innovation, **Roche** expanded Genentech's independent R&D culture, **Novartis** restructured around the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research model, and **AstraZeneca** did relocate significant operations to Cambridge (both UK and US), though maintained integrated R&D structures. The shift was more toward external collaboration hubs than internal biotech creation.

**Commercial vs Research Tensions**: The tension between commercial prioritization and scientific exploration persisted. However, the rise of breakthrough therapies, orphan drugs, and personalized medicine did push companies toward more flexible portfolio approaches. The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation (established 2012) accelerated development paths that might have been deprioritized under traditional market-size criteria.

**Biotech Investment Growth**: Venture funding in biotech surged, particularly post-2015, reaching record levels by 2021 ($28.5B in US biotech VC funding). This created a robust external innovation ecosystem that pharma could access through partnerships and acquisitions, partially achieving Booth's goal of external thinking but through buy-side rather than build-side strategies.

**Cultural Changes**: The period saw increased openness to external innovation, with most major pharmas establishing venture arms, academic partnerships, and biotech collaboration programs. However, the fundamental tension between quarterly earnings pressure and long-term innovation investment remained largely unresolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Booth's Main Predictions/Aspirations**:

• **Disaggregate R&D into independent biotech units**: → **Mostly did NOT happen**. No major pharma broke up its R&D organization into independent biotech firms as Booth envisioned. Instead, companies increased external partnerships while maintaining integrated internal R&D structures.

• **Remove commercial influence from early research**: → **Partially happened, with caveats**. Early-stage research did gain more independence at some companies, helped by regulatory pathways like Breakthrough Therapy and orphan drug designations. However, resource allocation decisions remained commercially driven, and NPV models persisted as key decision tools.

• **External advisory input to combat group think**: → **Largely achieved**. Most major pharmas expanded external advisory networks, increased Key Opinion Leader engagement, and became more open to external data and perspectives, particularly with the growth of real-world evidence initiatives.

• **The author's skepticism about implementation**: → **Proved accurate**. The author predicted management resistance and investor opposition would limit radical changes, which aligned with what actually occurred. No major pharma attempted the "tear it up for real" approach that Booth suggested.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a crucial industry debate about innovation culture that remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade, correctly identifying cultural barriers to R&D productivity even if the proposed solutions proved too radical for implementation.
