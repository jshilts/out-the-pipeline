I notice that the article you've provided is about a YouTube video showcasing a physical periodic table with real element samples, from a collector named Theodore Gray. This appears to be a chemistry/physical sciences topic, not about the biotechnology industry as mentioned in the prompt template.

Additionally, both the prompt template and your instructions indicate that I should only use information I'm confident about. I don't have access to current internet browsing capabilities to research what happened after this 2012 article was published, nor can I verify specific details about:

- Theodore Gray's subsequent work
- The commercial success of PeriodicTable.com
- Any developments in element collecting or display technology
- Whether this led to educational applications
- What happened to this specific periodic table display

To provide the thorough analysis requested in the HISTORY section (which requires researching developments from 2012 to the present), I would need to access current information sources.

Would you like me to:
1. Wait for you to provide a different article that's actually about biotechnology?
2. Proceed with a very limited response based only on the article content itself (which would not meet the full requirements of the template)?
3. Pass on this particular article as it doesn't fit the biotechnology industry focus indicated in the template?
