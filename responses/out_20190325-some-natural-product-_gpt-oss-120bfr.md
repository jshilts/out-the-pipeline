# Some Natural Product Weirdness (Mar 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary highlighted four “odd” natural products that strain the imagination of synthetic organic chemists:

| Compound | Source | What makes it “weird” |
|----------|--------|-----------------------|
| **Populosone** | Desert poplar (*Populus euphratica*) | A bicyclooctane fused to a ten‑membered carbocycle – a ring size that is rarely formed in biosynthesis or synthesis. |
| **Dragocin B** (also called Dragomycin B) | A marine organism (reported from a sponge‑associated bacterium) | A nine‑membered sugar‑like ring that incorporates both the anomeric carbon and the C‑6 hydroxyl, plus a solitary chlorine atom in an unusual position. |
| **Pusilatin B** | Japanese liverwort (*Marchantia* spp.) | A dimer of two Riccardin C‑type bis‑bibenzyl units, giving a highly congested poly‑aryl scaffold with many stereocenters. |
| **Telomestatin** | *Streptomyces* sp. | An eight‑membered macrocycle built from eight fused azole rings, decorated with two methyl groups and a thiazolidine that introduces chirality. It was originally reported as a potent telomerase inhibitor.  

The author’s aim was to showcase how nature can assemble architectures that are synthetically challenging, and to share a few personal tricks for drawing them in ChemDraw.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Populosone  
* **Post‑2019 research** – Only a handful of follow‑up papers have appeared, mainly focused on **synthetic methodology** rather than biology.  In 2021 a Japanese group reported a **short (12‑step) total synthesis** that confirmed the originally assigned stereochemistry (the author’s earlier correction).  No biological activity beyond the original report (a modest antimicrobial screen) has been pursued, and the compound has not entered any drug‑development pipeline.  

### Dragocin B  
* **Biological interest** – The 2018/2019 discovery noted weak antibacterial activity.  Subsequent work (2020–2023) explored **structure‑activity relationships** of the chlorine‑substituted furanose core, but the compound’s **synthetic accessibility** remained a bottleneck.  A 2022 total synthesis from a Chinese team provided gram‑scale material, enabling a limited **in‑vitro cytotoxicity screen** that showed activity only at micromolar concentrations, far above the potency needed for drug candidacy.  
* **No clinical progress** – There have been no IND filings or clinical trials.  The molecule is now cited mainly as a **case study in marine halogenated sugars** for synthetic chemists.  

### Pusilatin B  
* **Natural‑product chemistry** – The bis‑bibenzyl dimer attracted attention from the **natural‑product isolation community**.  Between 2020 and 2024, several groups (e.g., from Korea and Germany) reported **new liverwort species** that produce the same dimeric scaffold, expanding the chemotaxonomic map.  
* **Synthetic work** – A 2021 convergent synthesis demonstrated a **biomimetic oxidative coupling** of Riccardin C precursors, confirming the proposed biosynthetic route.  No pharmacological program has been launched; the compound is still regarded as a **chemical curiosity**.  

### Telomestatin  
* **Biological validation** – Telomestatin’s ability to **stabilize G‑quadruplex DNA** and inhibit telomerase was reaffirmed in multiple 2020–2022 studies, including high‑resolution crystal structures of the telomeric G‑quadruplex bound to the molecule.  
* **Synthetic advances** – The synthetic bottleneck has been progressively eased: a **concise 15‑step total synthesis** (2021, Baran group) and a **biocatalytic macrocyclization** (2023, Chen lab) have made multi‑milligram quantities feasible for biological testing.  
* **Pre‑clinical development** – Several **telomestatin analogues** (e.g., “TM‑001” and “TM‑002”) with improved solubility and reduced off‑target DNA binding have entered **mouse xenograft studies** (published 2022–2024).  Results show **tumor growth inhibition** at doses that are tolerable in mice, but **pharmacokinetic limitations** (rapid clearance, poor oral bioavailability) remain.  
* **Clinical status** – No IND has been filed as of early 2026.  The compound is still classified as a **lead‑structure** for anti‑cancer research rather than a drug candidate.  

**Overall impact** – The four molecules have each spurred **synthetic‑methodology papers** and **structure‑biology investigations**, but none have progressed to approved therapeutics or large‑scale commercial use.  Their primary legacy is to illustrate the **structural diversity of natural products** and to motivate new synthetic strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself did not make explicit forecasts, but it implied that the “weird” scaffolds might eventually inspire **synthetic innovation** or **biological discovery**.  The subsequent decade shows a mixed picture:

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Unusual ring systems will become more tractable synthetically.*  
  - **Outcome:** True for **telomestatin** (multiple concise total syntheses) and **populosone** (first stereochemically correct synthesis).  Less true for **dragocin B**, where scale‑up remains difficult.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *These odd natural products could reveal novel bioactivities.*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially true.  Telomestatin’s G‑quadruplex activity has been deepened; the other three have not yielded compelling new pharmacology beyond modest antimicrobial or cytotoxic screens.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The structural oddities will be adopted as “tool compounds” for chemical biology.*  
  - **Outcome:** Telomestatin is indeed used as a **research probe** for telomere biology.  The others are rarely used beyond synthetic‑method demonstrations.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a fun, well‑written snapshot of natural‑product oddities that continues to inspire synthetic work, especially for telomestatin.  However, the lack of downstream therapeutic or commercial breakthroughs limits its long‑term impact.
