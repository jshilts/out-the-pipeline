# Bromopyruvate Revealed (Nov 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe discusses 3-bromopyruvate, a controversial compound that had been promoted as an anticancer agent, particularly by alternative medicine advocates who claimed "Big Pharma" was suppressing it. The compound was believed to work by inhibiting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a key enzyme in glycolysis, taking advantage of the Warburg effect where cancer cells rely heavily on glucose metabolism.

The article centers on a new proteomics study that used chemical biology techniques to identify the protein targets of 3-bromopyruvate in cells. Researchers created a tagged version of the compound with an acetylene group, allowing them to identify over 60 proteins that were covalently modified by the compound - far more than just GAPDH. The "volcano plot" analysis revealed broad reactivity across many proteins with reactive cysteine residues, suggesting the compound was a promiscuous covalent modifier rather than a selective GAPDH inhibitor.

Lowe notes the deaths of three patients in Germany who had received the compound, highlighting safety concerns. He argues that while inhibiting GAPDH might be a valid therapeutic strategy, 3-bromopyruvate is too crude a tool due to its broad reactivity and resulting toxicity.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2018 publication, 3-bromopyruvate did not become an FDA-approved cancer therapy. The compound's path to clinical development faced what turned out to be insurmountable toxicity and selectivity challenges.

Clinical status: No FDA-approved drugs based on 3-bromopyruvate have reached the market. The compound remains investigational, with safety concerns preventing advancement to large-scale clinical trials.

GAPDH inhibition strategy: The broader strategy of targeting cancer metabolism via GAPDH inhibition did not prove to be a major therapeutic breakthrough. While metabolic reprogramming remains an area of cancer research interest, the specific approach of inhibiting GAPDH has not led to breakthrough therapies, likely because of the enzyme's essential roles in normal cell metabolism.

Covalent drug development: The concerns about 3-bromopyruvate's promiscuous reactivity highlighted the challenges of developing selective covalent inhibitors. The broader field of covalent drugs has evolved, with successful examples (like certain kinase inhibitors) demonstrating that selectivity is achievable when proper molecular design principles are followed - typically involving less reactive electrophiles and careful positioning to target specific nucleophilic residues.

Alternative medicine industry: The narrative about "suppressed" cancer cures has continued, with 3-bromopyruvate remaining part of that landscape. The scientific evidence has not supported the treatment's efficacy claims.

Research outcomes: The promiscuous reactivity identified in the 2018 proteomics study proved to be a fundamental limitation that was not overcome through further engineering or formulation improvements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: Lowe suggested that "You're going to want a better GAPDH inhibitor" for viable therapeutic development.
- **Outcome**: Better GAPDH inhibitors were indeed developed, but they did not become major cancer therapies. More selective GAPDH inhibitors have been reported in scientific literature, but none have achieved significant clinical success. Cancer metabolism targeting has evolved to focus on other approaches (like targeting other metabolic pathways or combination strategies) rather than single-enzyme inhibition of GAPDH.

**Prediction**: The article expressed skepticism about systemic use of 3-bromopyruvate due to toxicity, while acknowledging potential for topical application.
- **Outcome**: This assessment proved prescient. The compound has not been successfully developed for systemic cancer treatment. Even topical applications have not emerged as significant therapies, suggesting the therapeutic window remains too narrow.

**Expectation** (implicit): That the proteomics approach would guide development of more selective compounds.
- **Outcome**: The field did not successfully engineer selective versions of bromopyruvate that maintained efficacy while reducing off-target effects. The fundamental structure appeared too intrinsically reactive for meaningful selectivity improvements.

**Concern**: Lowe worried that such a small, reactive molecule would have severe toxicity.
- **Outcome**: This concern was validated. The toxicity profile remained a barrier throughout subsequent years, with no successful resolution that would enable clinical development.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article was reasonably interesting but of moderate long-term importance. While it provided important mechanistic insights about 3-bromopyruvate's promiscuous reactivity that influenced research directions, the compound itself ultimately did not become a significant therapeutic or represent a major breakthrough strategy for cancer treatment.
