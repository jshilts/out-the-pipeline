# Biogen and Eisai: Let the Alzheimer's Arguing Commence (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported the top‑line results of a Phase IIb Bayesian trial of BAN2401, an anti‑amyloid‑β antibody jointly developed by Biogen and Eisai. The author highlighted several “red flags”:  

* The high‑dose (10 mg/kg) arm showed modest cognitive benefit, but lower doses performed worse than placebo.  
* Only percentage changes on cognitive scales were released, not raw scores, making the magnitude of effect unclear.  
* A post‑hoc imbalance in APOE4 status (70 % APOE4‑positive in placebo vs. 30 % in the high‑dose group) could have artificially inflated the apparent treatment effect because APOE4 carriers tend to decline faster.  

The piece argued that, given the historic difficulty of anti‑amyloid drugs, an early regulatory approval would be premature and risky. The author also noted a dramatic intraday swing in Biogen’s share price around the announcement and disclosed a short position taken on the stock.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Phase III development and approval** – After the 2018 Phase IIb data, Eisai and Biogen launched the pivotal Phase III “Clarity AD” trial (≈1,800 participants with early Alzheimer’s disease). In January 2023 the trial reported a 27 % slowing of cognitive decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating‑Sum of Boxes (CDR‑SB) and a 34 % slowing on the ADAS‑Cog13 over 18 months, with a safety profile consistent with other anti‑amyloid antibodies (notably ARIA‑E in ~12 % of treated participants). The FDA granted traditional approval for lecanemab (brand name **Leqembi**) on 6 January 2023 for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, with a post‑marketing requirement to confirm clinical benefit. The European Medicines Agency followed with a conditional marketing authorization in March 2023.

**Market impact** – Biogen’s share price, which had been volatile after the 2018 Phase IIb release, rose sharply after the 2023 approval, gaining roughly 30 % over the subsequent six months. Eisai’s stock showed a similar upward trend. The earlier short‑selling episode described in the article had a negligible long‑term effect on the companies’ valuations.

**Clinical uptake** – By late 2023, lecanemab was being administered in several US academic centers and specialty clinics under a risk‑evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to monitor ARIA. Insurance coverage was initially limited, but Medicare began covering the drug in early 2024 after a CMS decision, expanding patient access.

**Broader field** – The success of lecanemab revived confidence in the amyloid‑targeting approach. Aducanumab (Aduhelm) had received accelerated approval in 2021 amid controversy; donanemab (Eli Lilly) achieved FDA approval in July 2024. The cumulative effect has been a modest increase in the number of disease‑modifying therapies available for early Alzheimer’s disease.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Early approval would be a mistake; a large, expensive Phase III would be required.** | Correct. A pivotal Phase III trial was completed, and regulatory approval only came after those data were submitted (2023). |
| **The drug’s cognitive signal might be artifactual because of the APOE4 imbalance.** | The Phase III trial used stratified randomization to balance APOE4 status, eliminating that specific bias. The observed benefit persisted after adjustment, suggesting the earlier concern was specific to the Phase IIb dataset. |
| **Biogen’s stock would not sustain the bullish surge; the “stock‑market‑bull case” was ruined.** | Partially correct for the short‑term reaction in 2018, but the later approval in 2023 produced a new rally, ultimately outweighing the 2018 dip. |
| **BAN2401 would likely fail in Phase III, as many anti‑amyloid antibodies have.** | Incorrect. The drug succeeded in Phase III and achieved FDA approval, becoming the first anti‑amyloid antibody to receive traditional (non‑accelerated) approval. |
| **Patients and insurers would be rushed into a drug that “doesn’t actually do anything.”** | Incorrect. Post‑approval real‑world data (2023‑2024) show a modest but statistically significant slowing of decline, aligning with the trial’s efficacy claims. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in Alzheimer’s drug development, anticipates key methodological concerns, and foreshadows market dynamics that proved highly relevant when lecanemab eventually succeeded. Its blend of scientific critique and financial analysis makes it a valuable historical snapshot for both biotech investors and clinicians.
