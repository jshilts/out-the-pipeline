# A Day of Irreproducibility In Cambridge (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article announces a symposium on "Irreproducibility in Target Validation" scheduled for October 23, 2014, at Novartis in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The author notes that irreproducibility is a familiar concern for industrial biopharma researchers, and that academic centers are increasingly encountering similar challenges as they engage more deeply in drug research. The symposium features speakers from both academia and industry, with the implication that this problem affects multiple stakeholders in drug discovery and warrants coordinated discussion and solutions.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2014 symposium reflected and helped catalyze a broader movement to address the reproducibility crisis in biomedical research. In the following years, numerous scientific journals adopted initiatives such as mandating structured materials and methods sections, requiring data availability statements, and encouraging preregistration of studies. Funding bodies, including the NIH, increasingly required applicants to detail plans for rigor and reproducibility. These actions responded to growing evidence that many published findings were challenging or impossible to replicate, leading to wasted resources and slowed drug development. While a definitive count is not readily available, institutions and organizations have since established ongoing efforts to improve data sharing, protocol transparency, and validation standards, aiming to reduce irreproducibility and enhance the robustness of preclinical and target-validation research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit suggestion that irreproducibility would become a more widely recognized problem**: The article anticipates continued and widening awareness of irreproducibility as academic centers become more involved in drug research. Reality: Yes—extensive attention followed, with major journals, funders, and institutions implementing reforms, guidelines, and training on rigor and reproducibility.
- **Implicit prediction that cross-sector collaboration (academia/industry) would become more valuable for addressing reproducibility**: The event's combined academic/industry lineup suggested a path toward shared standards. Reality: Yes—many subsequent consortia and initiatives explicitly bridge academia and industry to align on standards, data sharing, and validation practices, although achieving full alignment remains an ongoing effort.
- **General trend of more focus on validation and reproducibility in target selection and drug discovery**: The symposium signaled growing concern about target validation quality. Reality: Yes—over the subsequent decade, pharmaceutical and biotech R&D increasingly emphasized orthogonal validation, public data repositories, and independent replication, which has influenced preclinical attrition rates and informed better target-selection strategies.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **score/10**
5/10. The article documents a timely, industry-relevant symposium that helped frame the reproducibility crisis in drug development. Its content is specialized for researchers focused on biomedical rigor and validation, thus placing it in the middle range of broader interest and importance.
