# The Broad Gets $650 Million For Psychiatric Research

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on a $650 million gift from the Stanley Foundation to the Broad Institute for basic psychiatric research. Eric Lander is quoted characterizing much of the 1990s genetic research on mental illness as "pretty much completely useless," framing this as motivation for more rigorous approaches. The author acknowledges the difficulty of CNS (central nervous system) research as "the ultimate black box" while noting that any solid discoveries would represent real advances. The article also highlights the unusual source of this philanthropic funding: the Stanley Foundation generated its wealth through selling collectibles like sports figurines and miniature replicas rather than through traditional business or tech sectors.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 gift catalyzed the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad, which became a major hub for psychiatric genetics over the subsequent decade. The center contributed to foundational work in psychiatric genomics, particularly large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that identified hundreds of loci associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and depression. These efforts helped move psychiatric genetics from candidate gene studies (the "useless" work Lander referenced) to more systematic, statistically rigorous approaches.

However, the translation to clinical applications has remained limited. While researchers have identified numerous genetic variants associated with these conditions, very few have led directly to new drug targets or approved therapies. The complexity of psychiatric disorders—involving hundreds of genetic variants, environmental factors, and gene-environment interactions—has proven even more challenging than anticipated. Diagnostic tools and preventive interventions based on genetic findings have not yet seen widespread clinical adoption.

The Broad Institute's Stanley Center has produced valuable research resources and data, and has contributed to understanding disease architecture, but the optimism about rapid translation to treatments has been tempered by the field's recognition of how much remains unknown about CNS biology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **That the funding would enable real advances in understanding psychiatric disorders**: This has partially materialized. The genetic architecture of major psychiatric disorders is far better characterized today than in 2014, with dozens of robustly associated loci identified. However, the functional understanding of how these variants affect brain circuits and behavior remains incomplete.

• **Implicit: Avoiding the "completely useless" characterization by 2034**: This remains to be definitively assessed (the 20-year mark is 2034). Early indicators suggest progress, but the distance from genetic associations to mechanistic understanding and clinical applications remains substantial. The field has moved beyond single-gene hunting to systems approaches, but the practical clinical impact is still emerging.

• **That CNS work is a "black box" but solid discoveries would be meaningful advances**: The characterization remains accurate—CNS research continues to be exceptionally challenging, and each solid finding indeed represents significant progress given the complexity of the biological systems involved.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in psychiatric genetics funding and frames the central challenge that would define the next decade of research. The tension between massive investment and the profound scientific difficulties makes it historically significant.
