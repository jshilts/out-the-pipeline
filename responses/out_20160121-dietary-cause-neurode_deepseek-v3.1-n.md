# A Dietary Cause for a Neurodegenerative Disease (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a paper examining beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a cyanobacteria-produced amino acid linked to a specific neurodegenerative disease among Chamorro villagers on Guam (Guamanian ALS/parkinsonism dementia complex). The disease features hallmark neurological changes similar to Alzheimer's disease, including neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid plaques.

The research describes primate (vervet monkey) feeding studies showing that dietary BMAA exposure alone can produce neuropathology. The mechanism involves BMAA being mistakenly incorporated into proteins in place of the amino acid serine, causing cellular damage. Researchers also found that supplementing with L-serine prevents BMAA uptake and protects against the neurotoxic effects. The broader implication is that BMAA—produced by globally distributed cyanobacteria—may be an environmental trigger for other neurodegenerative disorders like sporadic ALS and Alzheimer's disease.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Translation and Human Trials:**
- Within months of publication, in April 2016, the FDA approved an expanded access protocol for L-serine treatment in ALS patients, based partly on this research.
- The first peer-reviewed clinical trial results were published in 2020 (Sabblah et al.), and a larger Phase II trial was completed in 2021, evaluating L-serine's effects in ALS patients.
- In 2023 and 2024, additional clinical trials were registered evaluating L-serine for both ALS and progressive supranuclear palsy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT05908061, NCT05908074).
- As of 2024, L-serine remains an unapproved investigational therapy—it has not received FDA approval for any neurodegenerative disease treatment.

**Scientific Evidence Evolution:**
- The BMAA hypothesis has remained controversial in the scientific community. While some studies found BMAA exposure can reproduce neuropathology in animals and is associated with increased Alzheimer's incidence in epidemiological studies, others found no clear link between environmental BMAA and neurodegeneration.
- Research has found conflicting evidence regarding cyanobacterial BMAA exposure as a risk factor for sporadic ALS, with some studies showing some effects and others finding none, suggesting BMAA may be only one of multiple contributing environmental factors.

**Institution and Business Impact:**
- The Institute for Ethnomedicine continued research in this area, but gained no significant policy changes to date.
- No major pharmaceutical companies developed treatments around this mechanism by 2024.

**General Uptake:**
- L-serine never became a standard treatment for ALS or any neurodegenerative disease.
- Public health policies did not change regarding cyanobacterial blooms or BMAA exposure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: BMAA exposure may serve as an environmental trigger for sporadic ALS and Alzheimer's disease, with older age increasing risk.
  - **Outcome**: The association remains unproven. While animal studies support the neurotoxicity of BMAA and some human studies show correlations, the evidence does not establish causation, and there is no consensus that BMAA causes sporadic ALS or Alzheimer's. Regulatory agencies have not recognized this association.

• **Prediction**: Chronic dietary BMAA exposure may cause or worsen neurodegenerative disease pathology.
  - **Outcome**: Though animal studies (vervets and other species) continued to show some neuropathological effects, no definitive human link is established, and human trials have not proven this mechanism causes disease.

• **Prediction**: Dietary L-serine supplementation could prevent BMAA uptake and thus prevent neurodegeneration.
  - **Outcome**: Early animal studies showed protection, generating hope that led to human trials. By 2024, however, no Phase III trial has shown strong efficacy, and L-serine is not approved or recommended for treating neurodegeneration, though clinical investigations continue.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article addresses a somewhat interesting hypothesis regarding environmental triggers for neurodegenerative disease, but nearly ten years later, this has not led to approved treatments or established public health impact; ongoing clinical research exists but remains inconclusive.
