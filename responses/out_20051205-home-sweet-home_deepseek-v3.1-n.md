# Home Sweet Home (5 Dec 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a lighthearted personal blog-style post reflecting on unusual microbial contamination in chemistry laboratories. The author describes various instances where organisms managed to grow in seemingly inhospitable chemical solutions, including phosphate buffer that clouded up after weeks on the bench, something growing in saturated ammonium chloride, halophilic organisms in saturated brine, and most dramatically, a "Jersey mold" – a large fluffy fungus thriving in a bottle of saturated sodium bicarbonate. The tone is anecdotal and humorous rather than scientific, framed around the paradoxical idea that labs, despite their controlled and often toxic environments, can inadvertently create unexpected microbial habitats through improper storage of solutions.

## 2. HISTORY
The publication of this informal blog post did not lead to any identifiable downstream scientific, regulatory, or business developments. It did not trigger new research directions, drug approvals, clinical trials, or changes in laboratory practice guidelines. No evidence exists that this specific article influenced public policy, regulatory frameworks for lab safety, or the biotech industry in any measurable way. The observations described – microbial contamination of improperly stored laboratory reagents – remained and remains a routine, well-understood challenge in laboratory management, addressed through established protocols for sterile technique, storage conditions, and reagent handling, none of which changed specifically because of this article. The companies or institutions involved were not mentioned, and no growth or failures can be attributed to this piece.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future technological developments, scientific breakthroughs, business outcomes, or policy changes. Its focus was entirely retrospective and observational, describing amusing anecdotes of unusual growths in lab solutions. There were no statements forecasting how these contamination issues might evolve, whether new organisms would be discovered in such environments, or what impact these observations might have on laboratory practices or biotech innovation. Therefore, no predictive claims can be evaluated for accuracy or alignment with subsequent events.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **1/10**
This is essentially a personal anecdote with no broader scientific, technological, or industry significance. While amusing, it lacks any substantive information relevant to evaluating the biotechnology industry, current scientific developments, or policy matters.
