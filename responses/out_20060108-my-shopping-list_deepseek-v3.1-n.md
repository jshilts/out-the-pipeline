# My Shopping List (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a "molecular wish list" by medicinal chemist Derek Lowe, written as commentary about molecular fragments and chemical groups he wishes were available for drug discovery. He identifies three categories of desired molecular building blocks: (1) metabolically stable linear spacers of variable lengths that can attach to carbon and heteroatoms, noting that alkynes exist but are problematic due to liver metabolism; (2) six-membered heteroaromatic rings containing elements other than nitrogen (specifically oxygen, sulfur, or phosphorus) to expand beyond the overused pyridines, pyrimidines, and pyrazines; and (3) large, polar atoms the size of bromine that can hydrogen-bond and improve aqueous solubility without making molecules too lipophilic. The tone is pragmatic—focusing on what would actually be useful in pharmaceutical research—and acknowledges that many exotic alternatives are synthetically inaccessible, metabolically unstable, or otherwise impractical.

## 2. HISTORY
The article reflects chemistry constraints from the mid-2000s that remained largely unchanged for over a decade, though incremental progress occurred in each area.

**Linear spacers**: Alkyne-containing drugs continued to face metabolic liability. While click chemistry using azide-alkyne cycloadditions became a powerful tool in chemical biology and materials science, alkynes themselves did not become preferred metabolic-stable spacers in marketed drugs. PEG (polyethylene glycol) linkers—long known but often polymer-like—were refined and widely used as flexible spacers in biologics and ADC linkers, but small, rigid, metabolically stable carbon-based spacers of variable length remained a niche synthetic challenge rather than a commodity.

**Six-membered heteroaromatics with non-nitrogen heteroatoms**: Pyrylium and thiopyrylium species remained highly reactive curiosities, not practical drug scaffolds. Nitrogen heterocycles (pyridines, pyrimidines, pyrazines) continued dominating pharmaceutical libraries and marketed drugs. Some boron-, silicon-, and phosphorus-containing heterocycles saw use in specialty contexts—e.g., boronic acids in enzyme inhibitors and PROTAC warheads, or benzoxa/benzazaboroles in specific programs—but they did not displace nitrogen heterocycles at scale. Academic work produced exotic species, but practical, stable, scalable, drug-like six-membered aromatics with oxygen or sulfur remained elusive.

**Large polar atoms**: Heavy halogens (Br, I) persisted with trade-offs (light sensitivity, lipophilicity), while trifluoromethyl was heavily adopted as a lipophilicity-modifying group. In the late 2010s–2020s, **iodine** gained attention in radiopharmaceuticals, particularly for I-124 and I-131 imaging and therapy, making it essential in specific oncology contexts. **Boron** emerged prominently with the 2003 approval of bortezomib (a boronic acid proteasome inhibitor), followed by other boron-containing drugs (e.g., ixazomib, tavaborole, crisaborole), delivering a "lumpy polar atom" that could hydrogen-bond and didn't merely behave like a halogen. Clickable bioisosteres also evolved—e.g., triazoles formed from azide-alkyne cycloadditions acted as amide or ester bioisosteres with hydrogen-bonding capability—though not truly "single large atoms."

Overall, the core chemical toolkit for medicinal chemistry did not shift as dramatically as the author might have wished; nitrogen heterocycles still dominate, though targeted innovations (e.g., boron, improved PEG linkers, click-derived bioisosteres) provided measured progress. No major class-wide adoption of the requested motifs occurred, and no large-scale public-policy changes resulted from these chemical gaps.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Linear spacers of different lengths**: The author wished for metabolically stable, variable-length spacers. Alkynes remained metabolically problematic and did not become commodity spacers; flexible PEG linkers saw extensive use in biologics/ADCs and some small-molecule conjugates, but small, rigid, stable carbon spacers did not become widely available "by the kilo." Drug companies continued using existing linkers and custom synthesis rather than adopting new classes of spacers. The prediction that companies wouldn't be interested unless available at scale proved largely true.
- **Six-membered heteroaromatics beyond nitrogen**: Lowe speculated that oxygen, sulfur, or phosphorus variants could diversify discovery but acknowledged stability/reactivity obstacles. In practice, pyrylium and thiopyrylium remained impractical, phosphorus aromatics stayed exotic, and nitrogen heterocycles continued dominating drug discovery. Some niche applications emerged for boron-containing aromatics, but they did not displace nitrogen heterocycles broadly. The prediction about synthetic impracticality was borne out.
- **Large polar atoms for solubility/H-bonding**: Lowe wanted bromine-sized polar atoms that improve aqueous solubility without lipophilicity. Heavy halogens (Br, I) stayed problematic due to light sensitivity and lipophilicity, while trifluoromethyl remained a common lipophilicity tool. Boron-containing drugs (e.g., bortezomib, ixazomib, crisaborole) later emerged as examples of electrophilic, hydrogen-bonding "lumpy" atoms, albeit with covalent reactivity rather than pure polarity. No single new element became a drop-in replacement for bulky polar groups, so this prediction only partially materialized through boron chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This short wish list is a useful snapshot of mid-2000s medicinal chemistry constraints and has aged into a partially prescient critique. It moderately influenced synthetic and medicinal chemists' thinking, and some gaps (e.g., boron's emergence) validate its practical relevance. However, it did not lead to major toolset shifts or widespread adoption of the requested motifs.
