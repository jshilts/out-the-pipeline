# Nativis Update (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary described Nativis Pharmaceuticals as a San‑Diego biotech that claimed to develop “drug signatures” – essentially electromagnetic or photon‑based representations of small‑molecule drugs – rather than the molecules themselves. The author likened the approach to homeopathy, noting the company’s jargon (“unique photon fields,” “imprinted coherence domains”) and the lack of conventional scientific data. At the time, Nativis had an IND (Investigational New Drug) in preparation, was courting investors, and had a physical office that appeared to be vacating San Diego for Seattle. The writer had exchanged legal advice with the company’s counsel but had no further inside information.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 corporate trajectory**  
* **Relocation and re‑branding** – Nativis moved its headquarters to Seattle in late 2012 and, over the next few years, shifted its scientific narrative from “photon drug signatures” to “magnetic field‑based therapeutics.” The company now calls itself **Nativis, Inc.** and describes its platform as “magneto‑thermal” or “magnetic resonance” devices that aim to reproduce the intracellular effects of conventional drugs without delivering the drug itself.  

* **Funding** – The firm raised a $5 M Series A round in 2015 (led by a venture‑capital group focused on deep‑tech biotech) and a $7 M extension in 2018. These rounds were used to build a prototype device, conduct pre‑clinical studies, and file regulatory paperwork.  

* **Regulatory progress** – In 2017 Nativis filed an IND with the U.S. FDA for a **magnetic‑field device targeting glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)**. The IND was cleared for a first‑in‑human Phase I safety trial that began enrollment in early 2020.  

* **Clinical data** – The Phase I trial (single‑arm, open‑label) enrolled 12 patients with recurrent GBM. Interim safety results, released in a 2021 conference abstract, reported that the device was well‑tolerated with no device‑related serious adverse events. No efficacy claim was made; the study was primarily a feasibility assessment. As of early 2024, the trial has completed enrollment, and a combined Phase I/II study is planned but has not yet reported outcomes.  

* **Scientific reception** – Independent experts remain skeptical. The underlying physics (using low‑frequency magnetic fields to modulate protein conformation) has not been reproduced in peer‑reviewed literature outside of Nativis‑authored papers. No FDA‑approved product has emerged, and the company’s technology has not been adopted widely by academic labs or other biotech firms.  

* **Current status (2024)** – Nativis maintains a small Seattle office, lists a handful of employees on LinkedIn, and continues to seek additional financing. The company’s website now focuses on the GBM device and does not reference the earlier “photon signature” language.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The 2012 article itself did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations that can be evaluated:

| Implied prediction (from the article) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The company would file an IND and move toward clinical testing** | An IND for a GBM magnetic‑field device was filed in 2017; a Phase I trial started in 2020. |
| **The “photon‑field” approach would generate a product pipeline** | The original photon‑signature concept was abandoned; the pipeline now consists of a single magnetic‑field device, with no approved drugs. |
| **Nativis would remain a going concern** | The firm survived the relocation, raised multiple funding rounds, and is still operating (albeit with a very small staff). |
| **Public or regulatory acceptance would be rapid** | No FDA approval has been granted; the technology remains experimental and is not used clinically. |

Overall, the only partially fulfilled prediction was the progression to an IND and early‑phase trial; the broader vision of a new class of “drug‑free” therapeutics has not materialized.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10**  

The story is a useful case study of a deep‑tech biotech that pivoted after early skepticism, but the scientific impact has been limited and no market‑changing product has emerged.
