# Goldman Sachs: A New Drug Research Model? (December 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2008 article reported that Goldman Sachs was in discussions to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to a large pharmaceutical company through a novel business model. Instead of traditional company financing, the investment bank proposed creating a "research pool" where multiple pharma companies would contribute their early-stage (Phase 1 and Phase 2) experimental drugs within a single therapeutic area. These compounds would be developed collaboratively, with external experts including scientists, chemists, and clinical research organizations working alongside company specialists.

The article expressed skepticism about the lack of concrete details available, noting that information came from a single conference source with minimal independent verification. Key uncertainties included: which therapeutic area would be targeted, how returns would be distributed when compounds succeeded, how multiple successful outcomes would be handled, and who would pay the external experts. The author acknowledged that new research models were needed in an industry where existing approaches weren't delivering results, but remained cautious due to the scarcity of specific information about Goldman's proposal.

## 2. HISTORY

Based on publicly available information, there is little evidence that this specific Goldman Sachs initiative came to fruition as described in 2008. The proposed research pool model involving multiple pharmaceutical companies co-developing early-stage drugs does not appear to have materialized at scale within the ensuing years.

However, the broader concept of alternative financing models for drug development did evolve through different mechanisms:
- **Clinical trial partnerships**: Pharma companies increasingly partnered with CROs (Contract Research Organizations) for drug development, but these remained bilateral relationships rather than multi-company pools
- **Biotech financing**: Investment banks including Goldman Sachs continued participating in traditional biotech IPOs and financing rounds rather than creating the novel pooled research structure
- **Drug development failures**: The pharmaceutical industry continued facing the same challenges mentioned in 2008, with high failure rates for early-stage compounds persisting through subsequent years

The specific Goldman Sachs research pool concept appears to have been either abandoned, significantly modified, or never implemented beyond initial discussions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: Goldman Sachs would pioneer a new business model shifting drug financing from company funding to targeted co-development of specific medicines through research pools.

**Outcome**: There is no substantial evidence that this prediction materialized. While alternative financing models emerged in pharma (such as increased use of CROs, risk-sharing partnerships, and different milestone-based deals), the specific Goldman Sachs research pool model with multiple companies contributing early-stage compounds to a shared development pool did not become a significant industry practice.

The pharmaceutical industry's fundamental research and development challenges persisted, but the solution did not come through the investment bank-led pooled approach envisioned in 2008.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article touches on important themes about pharmaceutical industry innovation and alternative financing models, but the specific proposal appears to have been speculative without material impact. While the underlying problem (inefficient drug development) remained relevant, this particular Goldman Sachs initiative does not appear to have influenced subsequent industry practices or outcomes significantly.
