# Ah, Marketing (November 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary on pharmaceutical advertising strategies, specifically focusing on how Merck was promoting its COX-2 inhibitor Vioxx through fragmented television commercials. The article describes how Merck split their ads into separate pieces—one showing Dorothy Hamill discussing arthritis pain while mentioning the drug name Vioxx, and another with similar visuals but avoiding direct claims about what the drug treats. This strategy aimed to circumvent FDA regulations requiring pharmaceutical ads to list side effects when both the drug name and its therapeutic use are mentioned together. The author notes that Roche had attempted a similar strategy the previous year with their weight-loss drug Xenical (orlistat), but faced FDA intervention when they ran the ads back-to-back. Merck appeared to be avoiding this mistake by ensuring their ads were not broadcast consecutively. The article critiques these tactics as obvious attempts to bypass advertising regulations while acknowledging the ongoing debate about whether such rules should exist.

## 2. HISTORY

This article predated one of the most significant drug safety scandals in pharmaceutical history. Vioxx (rofecoxib) was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by Merck in September 2004 following revelations that long-term use significantly increased the risk of heart attack and stroke. The drug had generated billions in revenue during its time on the market, with extensive direct-to-consumer advertising playing a major role in its popularity. The Vioxx withdrawal resulted in massive litigation against Merck, ultimately costing the company approximately $4.85 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits. 

The FDA's oversight of pharmaceutical advertising faced increased scrutiny following the Vioxx crisis. The agency did indeed crack down on the split-advertising strategy described in the article, establishing clearer guidelines that prevented pharmaceutical companies from circumventing side-effect disclosure requirements through ad fragmentation. The broader COX-2 inhibitor class faced increased regulatory pressure, with safety concerns emerging for other drugs in this category. Celebrex (celecoxib) remained on the market but received strengthened safety warnings, while Bextra (valdecoxib) was withdrawn in 2005.

Regarding Roche's Xenical, the drug continued to be marketed but never achieved blockbuster status, largely due to the unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects the article referenced. It was later approved for over-the-counter sales under the name Alli, maintaining the same mechanism of action and side effect profile that made it "a pretty tough sell" according to the original article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction about FDA advertising regulation**: The author predicted that if the FDA allowed the split-ad strategy to continue, it would "become the standard advertising method for the whole industry." This prediction proved directionally correct in terms of regulatory outcome but incorrect in implementation—the FDA did crack down on these practices, but pharmaceutical companies continued developing ever-more sophisticated methods to maximize promotion while meeting regulatory requirements. Direct-to-consumer advertising continued to grow as a multi-billion dollar industry, though within tighter regulatory frameworks.

• **Implicit prediction about Vioxx safety**: While not explicitly stated as a prediction, the article's skeptical tone about marketing practices hints at the broader tensions between aggressive promotion and patient safety. The Vioxx scandal that emerged less than two years later validated concerns about the impact of heavy marketing on appropriate drug utilization and safety monitoring.

• **Implicit prediction about Xenical challenges**: The author's characterization of Xenical as "a pretty tough sell under the best of circumstances" proved accurate. Despite various marketing approaches, the drug never achieved widespread patient acceptance due to its tolerability issues, maintaining a niche role in obesity treatment rather than becoming a breakthrough therapy.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience in highlighting the systemic tensions between pharmaceutical marketing and drug safety that would explode into public consciousness with the Vioxx crisis. The piece captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical regulation where advertising tactics were testing the boundaries of FDA oversight, while simultaneously documenting the beginning of what would become one of the most consequential drug safety scandals in modern medicine. The author's skeptical, almost cynical tone about industry practices proved justified by subsequent events, making this a valuable historical document about pharmaceutical marketing and regulation in the early 2000s.
