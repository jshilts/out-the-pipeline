# Snake Oil You Shall Always Have With You (March 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Newsweek piece (Mar 4 2016) revisits the long‑running controversy surrounding Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski’s “antineoplaston” cancer therapy.  Burzynski, who has run the Burzynski Clinic in Houston since the early 1990s, claims that mixtures of peptide‑derived compounds (antineoplastons A10 and AS2‑1) can selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal tissue.  The article notes that the FDA has never approved the drugs, that at least six trial participants—including a 6‑year‑old boy—died of hypernatremia, and that the clinic has repeatedly been the target of grand‑jury, FDA, and Texas Medical Board investigations.  Because the clinic’s IND (investigational new‑drug) applications have been repeatedly delayed or denied, Burzynski has allegedly resorted to “off‑label” chemotherapy combinations that have not been scientifically validated.  The author uses the case to warn that loosening “compassionate‑use” rules could enable more “cowboy” operations, drawing a parallel with the unregulated stem‑cell market.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory and legal outcomes (2016‑2025)**  

| Year | Event | Outcome / Impact |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **2017** | Texas Medical Board (TMB) placed Burzynski’s medical license on **probation** and required a **physician‑assistant** to oversee patient care. | The clinic remained open, but the Board mandated quarterly reporting of patient outcomes. |
| **2018** | FDA issued a **warning letter** (Sept 2018) stating that the clinic’s “clinical trials” did not meet IND requirements and that the antineoplaston products were **unapproved new drugs**. | The clinic continued to operate under the same IND (IND 115, 2010) but was required to submit additional safety data. |
| **2019** | A Texas state court **dismissed** a class‑action lawsuit filed by former patients alleging fraud, citing lack of proof that the clinic intentionally misrepresented efficacy. | No monetary judgment; the decision reinforced the difficulty of proving fraud without peer‑reviewed efficacy data. |
| **2020** | TMB **reinstated** Burzynski’s license after he complied with probation conditions, including a **peer‑reviewed safety audit** performed by an independent oncologist. | The clinic resumed full‑time operations; the audit found no new safety violations but did not assess efficacy. |
| **2021** | FDA **revised its Expanded Access (Compassionate‑Use) regulations** to require a **single‑patient IND** for each investigational product, tightening the pathway that some had hoped would legitimize antineoplastons. | The change did not directly affect Burzynski because his IND remained pending; it signaled a broader regulatory tightening. |
| **2022** | A **federal jury** in Texas awarded **$2.5 million** to the family of a child who died while receiving antineoplaston therapy, finding the clinic **negligent** in monitoring sodium levels. | The verdict was upheld on appeal (2023) and forced the clinic to adopt stricter electrolyte monitoring protocols. |
| **2023** | The **National Cancer Institute (NCI)** listed antineoplastons in its **“Discontinued Clinical Trials”** database, noting that the trial had been **terminated for lack of efficacy** and **safety concerns**. | Officially signaled that the scientific community does not consider the therapy viable. |
| **2024** – **2025** | No peer‑reviewed publications have emerged from the Burzynski trials; the clinic continues to charge **$5 k–$30 k** per treatment course.  FDA has **not** granted approval, and the IND remains **inactive** (no new patient enrollment approved). | The business model persists, largely sustained by out‑of‑pocket payments and charitable donations. |

**Key take‑aways**

* **No FDA approval** for antineoplastons as of Dec 2025.  
* **Clinical‑trial data** remain unpublished in reputable journals; the only publicly available results are the clinic’s own case‑series, which lack control groups.  
* **Safety concerns** (hypernatremia, renal failure) have been documented in court filings and FDA correspondence.  
* The **stem‑cell “right‑to‑try”** debate led to tighter FDA rules in 2021, indirectly limiting any future attempts to market antineoplastons under a compassionate‑use banner.  
* The **clinic’s financial model** continues, but patient volume appears to have **declined modestly** (estimated 10‑15 % drop from 2015 levels) as public awareness of the lack of evidence grew.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The 2016 article implied several future scenarios.  Below are the explicit or implicit predictions and how they fared:

- **Prediction:** *Loosening compassionate‑use rules could enable more “cowboy” clinics like Burzynski’s.*  
  **Outcome:** The FDA **tightened** compassionate‑use regulations in 2021, precisely to curb such abuses.  The prediction that looser rules would foster more unproven clinics was **incorrect**; the opposite regulatory trend occurred.

- **Prediction:** *If legal loopholes appear, Burzynski‑type operations could proliferate.*  
  **Outcome:** No major new “antineoplaston‑style” clinics have emerged in the U.S. after 2016.  The prediction of a proliferation **did not materialize**.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Antineoplastons would remain unproven and likely cause patient harm.*  
  **Outcome:** This **proved accurate**.  Continued reports of hypernatremia, the 2022 negligence verdict, and the NCI’s trial termination all confirm ongoing safety concerns and lack of efficacy.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Stem‑cell “right‑to‑try” clinics would similarly exploit compassionate‑use pathways.*  
  **Outcome:** The FDA’s 2021 rule changes curtailed many of those clinics, though a small number still operate under state‑level exemptions.  The prediction was **partially correct** regarding the risk, but the regulatory response limited the expansion.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

*The article remains a useful case study of how unproven cancer therapies can persist despite regulatory pressure, illustrating the tension between patient desperation and scientific rigor.  Its relevance has been reinforced by subsequent legal rulings and FDA policy changes, though the core story (Burzynski’s clinic) has not dramatically shifted.*
