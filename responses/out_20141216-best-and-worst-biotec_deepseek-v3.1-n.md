# Best and Worst Biotech CEO Time (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2014 blog post references journalist Adam Feuerstein's annual CEO rankings in the biotech industry, specifically calling attention to his "Best" and "Worst" CEO categories for that year. The author notes that while both categories exist, the "Worst CEO" nominees likely attract more reader attention and votes, similar to how Dante's "Inferno" is more widely read than "Paradiso." The article serves as commentary on the industry's focus on leadership failures rather than successes.

## 2. HISTORY
The referenced voting was part of Feuerstein's regular biotech industry coverage at TheStreet.com. Adam Feuerstein continued his biotech journalism career, later moving to STAT News where he became a senior writer covering biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. The practice of ranking biotech CEOs has continued in various forms in industry coverage, with leadership performance remaining a critical factor in biotech company valuations and investor confidence.

The CEO categories referenced (Aegerion, MannKind, Chimerix, and others) reflected 2014's specific challenges in drug development, regulatory approvals, and commercial launches. Many of these companies faced continued scrutiny in subsequent years, with some experiencing significant clinical or commercial setbacks, while others eventually achieved turnaround stories.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article makes implicit predictions about CEO accountability trends in biotech:

* **Increased focus on leadership failures**: While presented somewhat humorously, the observation about greater public interest in "Worst CEO" rankings reflected an ongoing trend. CEO accountability in biotech has indeed remained under intense scrutiny, with leadership changes frequently following clinical failures, regulatory issues, or commercial disappointments.
* **Continued public interest in biotech executive performance**: This prediction proved accurate. Executive leadership remains a key focus in biotech investing and media coverage, with CEO changes often significantly impacting company stock prices and investor confidence.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

This brief commentary article serves as industry color rather than substantial analysis, functioning mainly as a referral to Feuerstein's more detailed rankings. While it captures a snapshot of 2014 biotech sentiment, it lacks the substance to maintain long-term relevance.
