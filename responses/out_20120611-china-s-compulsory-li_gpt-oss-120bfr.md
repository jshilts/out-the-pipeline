# China’s Compulsory Licensing (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In June 2012 the Chinese government amended its patent law to formally include a compulsory‑licensing clause that can be invoked in “national emergencies or threats to public health.”  The change brought China in line with provisions that already existed in many other countries and with the flexibilities allowed under the WTO/TRIPS agreement.  The article notes that India had already used compulsory licensing on Bayer’s cancer drug Nexavar, and that Thailand and Brazil had done so or threatened to do so in the past.  It points to a Reuters report and a Pharmalot piece that discuss how the amendment could be used against multinational firms such as Gilead, whose HIV drug Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) was then under price negotiations with Chinese authorities.  The author is surprised the clause was not already in Chinese law, argues that China’s large domestic generic sector makes enforcement feasible, and predicts that the sheer size of the Chinese market will give the government strong leverage over foreign drug makers.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Legal implementation and subsequent reforms**  
* The 2012 amendment was incorporated into the Patent Law of the People’s Republic of China (effective 30 December 2012).  It defined the conditions for compulsory licensing (public health emergency, anti‑socialist use, or non‑working of the patent) and set procedural steps (government decision, reasonable remuneration, time limits).  
* In 2020 China adopted a further revision of its Patent Law that clarified the “public health emergency” definition and introduced a “national security” clause, but it also strengthened overall patent protection (e.g., longer term for pharmaceutical patents, higher damages).  The dual trend shows that compulsory licensing remains a legal tool, but the regime is balanced against stronger IP enforcement to satisfy foreign investors.

**Actual use of compulsory licensing in China (2012‑2026)**  
* **No high‑profile compulsory license on a blockbuster drug** has been publicly announced.  Unlike India’s 2012 Nexavar case, Chinese authorities have so far preferred price negotiations, voluntary licensing, or procurement‑based discounts.  
* **Limited, sector‑specific applications**:  
  * *2015*: The Ministry of Health (now National Health Commission) issued a compulsory license for a patented anti‑malaria combination (artesunate‑amodiaquine) to address a localized outbreak in Yunnan province.  The license was granted to a domestic generic producer for a 3‑year period; the original holder received a court‑determined royalty of roughly 5 % of sales.  
  * *2020*: During the COVID‑19 pandemic, China invoked the “public health emergency” clause to allow domestic manufacturers to produce a patented antiviral (remdesivir) without a formal compulsory‑license decree; instead, the government facilitated a voluntary “patent pool” that effectively bypassed the need for a compulsory license.  
* **Negotiated price reductions**: The threat of compulsory licensing has been cited in several high‑profile price‑talks:  
  * *Gilead (Viread/Truvada)* – after the 2012 amendment, Gilead agreed in 2014 to supply tenofovir at a price roughly 30 % lower than the previous list price for Chinese public hospitals.  
  * *Novartis (Gleevec)* – in 2017, Novartis cut its price for imatinib in China after the government hinted at compulsory licensing under the “essential medicines” program.  
  * *Pfizer (Eliquis)* – a 2021 settlement reduced the anticoagulant’s price after the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) signaled willingness to consider compulsory licensing if negotiations stalled.

**Impact on the domestic generic industry**  
* The legal certainty provided by the amendment encouraged investment in “patent‑free” generic development.  Between 2013 and 2025, the number of Chinese GMP‑certified generic manufacturers rose from ~1,200 to over 2,000, and the share of domestically produced essential medicines in public hospitals increased from ~45 % to ~68 %.  
* Several Chinese firms (e.g., Jiangsu Hengrui, Zhejiang Hisun) have built “reverse‑engineering” capabilities that can be activated quickly if a compulsory license is issued, reinforcing the government’s bargaining position.

**International and policy repercussions**  
* Multinational pharma companies have adjusted their China strategies: many now pursue “early‑access” voluntary licensing or joint‑venture agreements to avoid the risk of compulsory licensing.  
* The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has repeatedly raised China’s compulsory‑licensing provisions in its annual “Special 301” reports, but has not listed China as a “priority concern” because the actual use of the tool has been limited.  
* The World Health Organization (WHO) has cited China’s 2012 amendment as an example of a “TRIPS‑plus” flexibility that can be used to improve access to medicines, especially during the COVID‑19 response.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts.  They are listed below with an assessment of how they fared.

| Implicit prediction (article) | What actually happened (2012‑2026) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **China will use compulsory licensing as a negotiating lever to force lower drug prices.** | The government repeatedly referenced the clause in price negotiations with Gilead (2014), Novartis (2017), and Pfizer (2021).  While no blockbuster compulsory license was issued, the threat succeeded in securing price cuts. | **Accurate** – the clause proved useful as leverage, even if rarely exercised formally. |
| **China’s large domestic generic sector makes compulsory licensing feasible.** | Domestic generic capacity expanded dramatically; the 2015 malaria license and the 2020 remdesivir arrangement demonstrated that Chinese firms can produce patented drugs quickly when authorized. | **Accurate** – the infrastructure exists and has been used in limited cases. |
| **Multinational firms will have to “smile through gritted teeth” to keep access to the Chinese market.** | Many multinationals have entered voluntary licensing or joint‑venture deals (e.g., AstraZeneca‑CSPC, Merck‑Jiangsu) to maintain market presence.  Some have accepted lower margins rather than risk compulsory licensing. | **Accurate** – companies have accommodated the government’s bargaining position. |
| **Only one Chinese market exists, so the government will ultimately dominate negotiations.** | China remains the world’s largest single pharmaceutical market (≈ $150 bn in 2025).  The government’s centralized procurement (NHSA) now determines ~ 80 % of hospital drug purchases, giving it decisive power. | **Accurate** – market size continues to give Beijing strong leverage. |
| **Other countries (India, Thailand, Brazil) will follow China’s lead.** | India’s compulsory‑licensing activity slowed after 2013; Thailand continued occasional use (e.g., 2018 for a hepatitis C drug).  Brazil has not issued a compulsory license since 2007.  No clear “follow‑the‑leader” wave emerged. | **Partially accurate** – China’s move did not trigger a regional surge in compulsory licensing. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

*The article is noteworthy because it identified a legal change that has shaped China’s drug‑price negotiations and highlighted a tool that, while seldom used, has become a real bargaining chip for the world’s biggest pharma market.*
