# Getcher Nucleic Acids, Cheap (Mar 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the marketing and sale of "DNA supplements" by health-food vendors. The author notes these pills contain 100mg of RNA and 10mg of DNA, and shares anecdotes from customer reviews where users claim the supplements provide "energy" and improve skin appearance. The piece takes a skeptical, humorous tone toward these products—particularly their extremely low price ($4.99 per bottle, half off) and the vague nature of their purported benefits. The author contrasts the claimed energy boost with the placebo-like satisfaction he gets from peanut M&Ms, and the piece closes with a light exchange with his wife, who raises practical questions about the source of the RNA and shipping costs.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to 2014, direct-to-consumer DNA/RNA "supplements" remained a fringe wellness product with no credible scientific backing for oral bioavailability or physiological benefits. Nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) are readily broken down by digestive enzymes into nucleotides and nucleosides, which are then either absorbed or further degraded; intact nucleic acids do not meaningfully enter circulation to produce systemic effects. Clinical nutrition and regulatory bodies have not endorsed DNA/RNA supplements for energy, skin health, or any therapeutic indication, and there is no FDA-approved drug or widely accepted clinical use arising from oral nucleic acid supplementation.

In parallel, related technologies advanced in legitimate settings:
- **mRNA therapeutics/vaccines**: Lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of synthetic mRNA (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines) proved highly effective, but this depends on encapsulation and injection—not oral dosing.
- **Nucleotide/nucleoside therapies**: Antivirals (e.g., remdesivir, molnupiravir) use modified nucleosides and require specific formulations/dosing, not generic "RNA/DNA" pills.
- **Regulation and market behavior**: The supplement market continued selling unproven products, but legitimate medicine and biotechnology did not adopt or validate oral nucleic acid supplements for any indication. Uptake of scientifically validated therapies (e.g., mRNA vaccines) was widespread where appropriate, whereas DNA/RNA supplements remained confined to the unregulated wellness niche with no measurable public-health impact.

In short, nothing in the legitimate biotech or pharmaceutical landscape after 2014 supported oral DNA/RNA supplements as effective interventions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself does not make explicit forward-looking predictions. It uses irony and personal anecdotes to implicitly suggest that:
- These supplements are pseudoscientific, and their claimed benefits are likely placebo effects.
- The low price and marketing tactics should raise skepticism about quality and efficacy.

**How things actually turned out:**
- No credible evidence emerged for oral DNA/RNA supplementation providing energy, skin improvements, or any therapeutic benefit; the products remained scientifically unvalidated.
- Legitimate nucleic-acid-based therapies (mRNA vaccines, antisense oligonucleotides, etc.) succeeded only when delivered via specific routes (e.g., injection with LNPs) and formulations, confirming that simply swallowing nucleic acids does not produce meaningful biological effects.
- The supplement industry continued marketing such products in an unregulated space, but they had no measurable impact on health outcomes compared to evidence-based interventions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the article offers a witty, skeptical take on fringe supplements, it centers on a niche wellness product with no scientific plausibility or real-world impact, so it ranks in the bottom deciles of interest for biotechnology.
