# Merry Christmas, Fred (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2011 blog post recounts an anecdote about a former Schering-Plough medicinal chemist who was laid off following the Merck-Schering-Plough merger. While boarding a flight to Florida in late October, he encountered Fred Hassan, the CEO of Schering-Plough who had engineered the merger deal, sitting in first class. When Hassan asked "Do I know you?", the chemist loudly announced that he had just been laid off before proceeding to his coach seat, leaving Hassan to contemplate the encounter with an irate ex-employee for the remainder of the 2.5-hour flight.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2009 Merck-Schering-Plough merger (valued at $41.1 billion) was part of a wave of pharmaceutical industry consolidation during that period. Following the merger, significant workforce reductions occurred as part of integration efforts - Merck announced plans to eliminate approximately 15% of its global workforce (around 16,000 positions) following the acquisition. 

Fred Hassan continued his career in pharmaceuticals, later becoming CEO of Bausch Health Companies (formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals) starting in 2020. The journalist who wrote this blog post, Derek Lowe, continued his influential "In the Pipeline" blog about drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry, which has become one of the most widely-read sources for medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical industry commentary.

The anecdote reflects the broader trend of pharmaceutical industry consolidation during the late 2000s and early 2010s, where mergers led to significant redundancies and workforce reductions as companies sought to achieve cost synergies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

*No explicit predictions were made in this article. The piece is a retrospective anecdote rather than a forward-looking analysis.*

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 2**

While the anecdote provides a humanizing glimpse into the personal impact of pharmaceutical industry consolidation and contains some entertainment value, it lacks substantive scientific, policy, or business analysis. The story has limited broader significance beyond illustrating workforce consequences of mergers, making it of relatively low long-term importance in understanding the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries.
