# The Blogroll (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a short blog post from January 2009 in which the author announces they have cleaned up their blogroll by removing inactive or "dead" blogs. The author mentions plans to add new sites over the weekend and explicitly requests recommendations from readers for chemistry, biology, pharma, and science blogs that they should include. This appears to be routine blog maintenance and community engagement rather than substantive scientific content.

## 2. HISTORY

This blog post represents typical blog maintenance activity from the late 2000s when personal blogs and blogrolls (lists of recommended blogs) were common features of the science blogging ecosystem. The "blogroll" as a concept has largely declined in relevance since 2009, as social media platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn) became the primary means of content discovery and community building among scientists and science writers. Many science blogs from that era have either ceased publishing or migrated to other platforms. The science communication landscape shifted significantly toward social media aggregation and institutional websites rather than personal blog networks connected through blogrolls.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **No specific predictions were made in this article.** The post was focused on immediate blog maintenance rather than forecasting future trends in science communication or biotechnology.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This blog maintenance post has minimal scientific or long-term importance as it contains no substantive content about biotechnology or scientific developments. It was relevant only to the author's immediate blog upkeep needs at the time.
