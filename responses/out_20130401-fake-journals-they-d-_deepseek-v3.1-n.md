# Fake Journals - But They'd Like Real Money (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a scheme where fake academic journals were created to scam researchers. Two legitimate but low-profile journals, *Archives des Sciences* (Geneva) and *Wulfenia* (Austria), had their names fraudulently used to create convincing counterfeit websites that appeared to be legitimate scientific publications. These fake journal operations were sophisticated enough to pass scrutiny from Thomson Reuters for months and deceived an unknown number of authors into submitting their work. Researchers paid publication fees to Armenian bank accounts, a detail that should have raised suspicions. The counterfeit websites even listed editorial board members, some of whom were fictitious while others were real scientists whose names were misappropriated without their knowledge. The piece serves as a commentary on the profitable nature of scientific publishing - so valuable that criminals would fabricate entire journal operations to capture publication fees.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, "predatory publishing" grew into a massive and increasingly sophisticated problem in academia. The incident described was not isolated but rather an early manifestation of a broader trend. By the mid-2010s, it became apparent that hundreds, and eventually thousands, of predatory journals had entered the academic marketplace, with India, Nigeria, and other countries emerging as major hubs for such operations far beyond the Armenian banks mentioned here.

Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at the University of Colorado Denver, became well-known for his "Beall's List" of predatory publishers, though the list became controversial and he discontinued it in 2017. Cabell's, a reputable academic services company, later launched a more systematic predatory journal blacklist. Over the decade from 2013 to 2023, numerous studies demonstrated that articles published in predatory journals are disproportionately cited elsewhere, spreading misinformation and lowering overall scientific quality - with some estimates suggesting that thousands of researchers, particularly in developing countries or early-career positions, have been victimized.

Institutions and policymakers responded to the proliferating threat. Major funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, issued guidance warning grantees against publishing in predatory journals. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and other groups developed educational materials to help authors recognize legitimate vs. predatory venues. India's University Grants Commission notably removed thousands of suspected predatory journals from its approved list, a major policy step reflecting growing awareness of the problem at governmental levels. The phenomenon even entered criminal enforcement when, in certain jurisdictions, particularly egregious publishers faced legal action for fraud or defamation.

Technological responses also emerged. Tools such as Think, Check, Submit became standard educational resources to help authors vet journals. However, challenges remain: predatory publishers continue to evolve their tactics, often maintaining plausible websites, claiming fake impact factors, and inventing editorial boards. High-profile cases, such as the 2020 retraction of dozens of COVID-19 papers from compromised journals, underscore the ongoing threat to research integrity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself is observational rather than predictive, focusing on exposing a specific scam rather than forecasting long-term trends. However, its underlying message implies predictions that largely proved accurate:

• **Scientific publishing profitability attracts criminal enterprise**: ✓ **ACCURATE**  
This prediction (implicit in the title and conclusion) proved correct. Between 2013 and 2023, predatory publishing exploded into a global industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The FTC and other authorities eventually brought enforcement actions against some of the largest predatory publishers, confirming that this became a significant profit-driven criminal enterprise.

• **Sophisticated counterfeit operations will continue**: ✓ **ACCURATE**  
The article notes how convincing these fake sites were. This trend dramatically accelerated. Rather than just isolated hijackings, entire predatory publishers emerged with hundreds of fake "journals," often with polished websites, fake impact factors, and forged editorial boards. The operations became far more organized than the early 2013 cases.

• ***Caveat emptor* - researchers must be vigilant**: ⊗ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**  
While the warning was well-founded, it's unlikely the author could have anticipated the sheer scale and geographic distribution of predatory publishing in the coming decade. The problem grew beyond individual vigilance to require institutional policies, major educational campaigns, and government interventions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

While not highly influential on its own, the article serves as an early canary in the coal mine for the predatory publishing crisis that would intensify throughout the 2010s. The phenomenon it describes evolved into a significant threat to research integrity with concrete policy implications at institutional and governmental levels.
