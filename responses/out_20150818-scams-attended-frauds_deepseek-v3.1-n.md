# Scams, Attended By Frauds (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article exposes a predatory conference organizer, WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology), that was hosting a fraudulent "natural products" conference in London. The conference displayed numerous red flags: no recognizable experts in the field, template text repeated throughout the description, 20 different "conferences" scheduled simultaneously at the same hotel, and presentation formats (e-poster: five-minute, five-slide maximum) designed to maximize registration fees (450 euros for presenters, 250 euros for attendees). The author identifies WASET as a known predatory publisher run by a Turkish family with domains registered in Azerbaijan, citing previous scandals including fake publications of pseudoscientific devices and conferences that stole names from legitimate academic events.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2015 article, the predatory publishing and conference industry continued to thrive and evolve, though with increased scrutiny:

**Continued WASET operations**: WASET maintained its business model, expanding to host conferences globally. However, increased awareness led to more public exposure. Academic databases like Scopus and Web of Science continued to explicitly exclude WASET journals from their indexing.

**Predatory publisher listings**: Jeffrey Beall's list of "potential predatory publishers" became a widely-used reference in the academic community (though it was taken down in 2017 due to legal pressure), and predatory publishing gained recognition as a systemic problem affecting academic integrity.

**Impact on academic evaluation**: Many institutions began explicitly warning researchers about predatory conferences and journals. Funding agencies and universities increasingly emphasized the importance of venue quality over quantity in researcher evaluations.

**No meaningful regulatory action**: Despite widespread awareness, there was limited government intervention to shut down operations like WASET, which continued exploiting the "publish or perish" culture in academia.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Although the article was primarily exposé rather than prediction-focused, it contained implicit predictions about what would happen to both the perpetrators and attendees:

• **Implicit prediction**: That WASET operations would become more brazen and move to prestigious locations.
  - **Outcome**: Correct – predatory conferences did expand to major Western cities while maintaining the same fraudulent patterns.

• **Implicit prediction**: That the academic community would become more savvy about these scams with internet research.
  - **Outcome**: Partially correct – awareness increased significantly, evidenced by proliferating academic blog posts, institutional warnings, and the existence of resources like Beall's List. However, these conferences still attracted enough participants to remain profitable.

• **Implicit prediction**: That attendees were engaged in fraud by padding CVs with bogus credentials.
  - **Outcome**: Difficult to verify empirically – some attendees may have been genuinely deceived, while others may have knowingly participated. However, academic institutions increasingly scrutinized conference quality in hiring and promotion decisions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article addressed a persistent but niche problem in academia rather than fundamental scientific developments. While predatory publishing remains relevant to the scientific enterprise, its impact on the biotechnology industry specifically was indirect – primarily related to research integrity and resource waste rather than substantive scientific advancement or therapeutic development.
