# Thanksgiving Break (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from November 27, 2019 is a personal Thanksgiving holiday entry from what appears to be a science-focused blog (likely Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog at Science Magazine). The author describes their traditional Thanksgiving cooking preparations, mentioning they are making chocolate pecan pie using a recipe they've shared previously, and plans to post book recommendations in their next entry.

The bulk of the article details their extensive Thanksgiving menu, which includes: roasted kosher turkey, stuffing with a specific family recipe containing unusual ingredients like pepperoni sausage, Iranian morasa pullo (a rice dish with saffron, barberries, nuts, and orange peel), various vegetable sides including brussel sprouts, mushrooms, green beans, and mashed potatoes, plus homemade cranberry sauce and gravy. The post is framed as a holiday greeting to American readers.

## 2. HISTORY

This article has no meaningful connection to biotechnology, science, or the pharmaceutical industry. It is purely a personal lifestyle/holiday blog post about Thanksgiving cooking traditions. There is no scientific content, no discussion of drug development, no biotechnology companies or methods mentioned, and no policy discussions relevant to the biotech sector.

The article would have been followed by standard Thanksgiving holiday activities in 2019, shortly before the emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019/early 2020, which dramatically changed holiday gatherings in subsequent years. However, this has no bearing on the content of the article itself.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about biotechnology, scientific developments, or pharmaceutical outcomes. It is entirely focused on immediate holiday cooking plans and does not discuss future events, scientific breakthroughs, or industry trends. The only forward-looking statement is about posting book recommendations "either Friday or Monday," which is irrelevant to biotechnology.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This is a completely off-topic personal blog post about Thanksgiving cooking with zero relevance to biotechnology, pharmaceutical science, or the healthcare industry. It appears to have been misclassified or included in error in what should be a collection of biotechnology-related articles.
