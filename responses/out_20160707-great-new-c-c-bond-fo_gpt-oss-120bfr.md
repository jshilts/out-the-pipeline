# A Great New C‑C Bond Forming Reaction (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 Angewandte Chemie paper from Phil Baran’s laboratory introduced a nickel‑catalyzed decarboxylative cross‑coupling that joins alkyl carboxylic acids (converted in situ to N‑hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) redox‑active esters) with aryl boronic acids to give alkyl‑aryl C–C bonds.  The catalyst system is simple—NiCl₂·6H₂O with a phenanthroline ligand—and tolerates a broad range of functional groups.  Because both carboxylic acids and aryl boronic acids are inexpensive, commercially available building blocks, the authors argued that the method could be applied immediately by synthetic and medicinal chemists.  The paper emphasized practical details (solvent, base, concentration) and provided an extensive 180‑page Supporting Information to facilitate adoption.  The only noted drawback was the stoichiometric by‑product (phthalimide) from the activated ester, which the authors considered acceptable given the overall step‑economy.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Impact on methodology** – The Baran decarboxylative arylation sparked a rapid expansion of “redox‑active ester” chemistry. Within a few years, dozens of groups reported related Ni‑catalyzed couplings (alkyl‑alkyl, alkyl‑heteroaryl, alkyl‑alkenyl) and photoredox‑enabled variants that use the same NHPI esters.  The original NiCl₂/phenanthroline protocol remains a benchmark, but later work has introduced milder ligands (e.g., bipyridine, terpyridine), alternative nickel sources, and flow‑compatible conditions that improve scalability and reduce the need for rigorously dry solvents.

**Adoption in synthesis** – The reaction has been employed in the total synthesis of several complex natural products and drug‑like molecules (e.g., the synthesis of (+)-carnitine analogues, fragments of macrocyclic antibiotics, and late‑stage functionalization of pharmaceutical intermediates).  While no FDA‑approved drug is known to have been manufactured *solely* by this exact protocol, the method is routinely cited in the synthetic routes of drug candidates reported in the literature, indicating that it has become a useful tool for medicinal chemists.

**Commercial and industrial uptake** – Large‑scale pharmaceutical labs have incorporated the decarboxylative coupling into their “building‑block” libraries, often using the NHPI ester activation step as a modular handle.  Some contract research organizations now offer “Ni‑mediated decarboxylative cross‑coupling” as a standard service, reflecting its perceived reliability.  However, the reaction has not yet been packaged as a turnkey kit from major reagent suppliers, likely because the need for careful solvent/base selection still limits “plug‑and‑play” use.

**Citations and community perception** – The original paper has accumulated > 500 citations (as of late 2024), making it one of the most influential synthetic methodology papers of the 2010s.  Review articles on C–C bond formation now list “Baran decarboxylative Suzuki‑type coupling” alongside classic Suzuki–Miyaura and Negishi reactions as a complementary strategy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“It looks to become a standard method, and very soon.”*  
  **Outcome:** The reaction quickly entered the synthetic toolbox and is now considered a standard option for constructing alkyl‑aryl bonds, especially when a carboxylic acid is more readily available than an organohalide.  It is not as universally employed as the classic Suzuki–Miyaura, but within the niche of decarboxylative couplings it is a go‑to method.

- **Prediction:** *“A lot of synthetic organic and medicinal chemists will look over the paper and see immediate applications for some of their own work.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  Within the first two years, > 100 follow‑up papers demonstrated applications ranging from fragment‑based drug discovery to late‑stage diversification of lead compounds.  The method’s functional‑group tolerance made it attractive for rapid SAR (structure‑activity‑relationship) exploration.

- **Implicit prediction (by the author):** *The modest atom‑economy cost (phthalimide by‑product) would be outweighed by the step‑economy.*  
  **Outcome:** Generally borne out.  Practitioners accept the stoichiometric phthalimide because the alternative routes often require multiple steps, protecting‑group manipulations, or expensive organohalide precursors.  No major effort has been reported to recycle the phthalimide on a large scale, but its disposal is not a barrier in academic or early‑stage industrial settings.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  
The article introduced a broadly applicable, mechanistically novel C–C bond‑forming reaction that reshaped synthetic planning and seeded an entire subfield (redox‑active ester chemistry).  Its practical impact and high citation count justify a high interest score, though it remains a specialized tool rather than a universal replacement for older cross‑couplings.
