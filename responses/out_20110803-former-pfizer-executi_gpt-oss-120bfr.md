# A Former Pfizer Executive Finally Trashes Pfizer's Strategy (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
John LaMattina, former head of R&D at Pfizer, wrote a commentary in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* arguing that the wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that turned Pfizer into the “undisputed king of pharma mergers” had a **devastating impact on R&D**. He walked through Pfizer’s recent history—most notably the 2009 Wyeth merger—and highlighted the resulting **site closures, large‑scale layoffs, and the erosion of scientific talent**. LaMattina questioned how a company that repeatedly “buys, slashes, and burns” could continue to discover new medicines, and he suggested that the industry’s overall capacity for innovation was being weakened by the consolidation of fewer, larger players.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Major corporate moves after 2011**  

| Year | Transaction | Immediate effect on Pfizer |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 2015 | Acquisition of Hospira (≈ $17 bn) | Added sterile‑injectable portfolio; integration led to further R&D site rationalisation (e.g., closure of the Sandwich, UK site in 2014). |
| 2016‑2018 | Series of smaller buys (e.g., Medivation, Anacor) | Brought in oncology and dermatology assets; modest R&D staffing changes. |
| 2020 | Purchase of **Array BioPharma** (≈ $11.6 bn) | Strengthened oncology pipeline; integration coincided with a company‑wide restructuring that cut ≈ 13 000 jobs (≈ 10 % of workforce) across R&D, manufacturing, and commercial functions. |
| 2021‑2022 | Acquisitions of **Global Blood Therapeutics** (≈ $5.4 bn) and **Seagen** (≈ $43 bn, completed 2023) | Expanded rare‑disease and antibody‑drug‑conjugate (ADC) capabilities; Seagen deal is the largest pharma‑M&A in the past decade. |
| 2023‑2024 | Continued divestitures of non‑core assets (e.g., consumer health) | Refocused capital on core pharma R&D. |

**R&D output and productivity**  

* **New molecular entity (NME) approvals** – After the Wyeth merger, Pfizer’s FDA‑approved NMEs fell from 7 (2008‑2009) to 2–3 per year through the early 2010s. The pace began to rise again after 2019, driven largely by the **COVID‑19 vaccine (Comirnaty, 2020)** and the **antiviral Paxlovid (2021)**, both of which were developed under an accelerated, partnership‑heavy model rather than traditional internal discovery pipelines.  

* **R&D spending** – Pfizer’s R&D budget peaked at ≈ $9.5 bn in 2015, then trended downward, reaching ≈ $7.5 bn in 2022. The decline reflects both cost‑cutting after large acquisitions and a strategic shift toward external collaborations.  

* **Site closures & layoffs** – The UK Sandwich site (a former Wyeth R&D hub) was shut in 2014, eliminating ~ 300 scientists. In 2020‑2022, Pfizer announced a **global restructuring** that cut roughly 13 000 positions, with many cuts in research and development functions.  

* **Pipeline health** – Despite the downsizing, Pfizer’s pipeline remained robust in the 2020s, especially in oncology (e.g., **Lorbrena** for ALK‑positive lung cancer, approved 2022) and rare diseases (e.g., **Vyndaqel** for transthyretin amyloidosis, approved 2021). The Seagen acquisition added > 30 ADC candidates, many now in early‑stage trials.  

**Industry‑wide impact**  

* Studies published after 2011 (e.g., *Science* 2015; *Nature Biotechnology* 2019) found that **large pharma mergers correlated with a short‑term dip in R&D productivity**, measured by reduced NME launch rates and higher attrition in Phase II/III. Pfizer’s experience mirrors this trend, though the dip was partially offset by the unprecedented COVID‑19 response.  

* The **consolidation of R&D talent** did reduce the number of independent discovery teams in the U.S. and Europe, but it also spurred a rise in **external innovation models** (venture‑backed biotech partnerships, academia collaborations). Pfizer became a leading partner in such models, funding > $2 bn in external biotech collaborations between 2018‑2023.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit numeric forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Mergers will continue to erode Pfizer’s internal discovery capability**, leading to fewer new drugs. | Internal NME launches did decline in the 2010s, but the company rebounded with **high‑impact products** (COVID‑19 vaccine, Paxlovid) that were largely partnership‑driven. The overall number of FDA‑approved NMEs rose again to 5–6 per year by 2023, though many were acquired or co‑developed. |
| **Continued site closures and layoffs will cripple long‑term R&D**. | Pfizer executed multiple rounds of restructuring (2014, 2020‑2022), cutting ~10 % of its workforce. However, the firm maintained a **stable core R&D budget** and continued to fund a large external pipeline, mitigating a total collapse of discovery capacity. |
| **Industry‑wide innovation will suffer as fewer independent companies exist**. | The broader market saw a **rise in biotech IPOs and venture funding** (global biotech VC funding > $100 bn in 2022), suggesting that while big‑pharma R&D labs contracted, **innovation shifted to smaller, more agile firms** that often partnered with Pfizer. |
| **Pfizer’s “buy‑and‑burn” model will be unsustainable**. | Pfizer’s **large‑scale acquisitions** (e.g., Seagen) have persisted, and the company has **re‑invested** the acquired assets into its pipeline. The model appears sustainable for now, though it has forced continuous cost‑cutting and cultural integration challenges. |

Overall, LaMattina’s concerns about **short‑term productivity loss** were borne out, but the **long‑term outcome**—a mixed picture of continued blockbuster launches alongside a leaner internal R&D engine—differs from the more pessimistic scenario implied in the 2011 piece.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a noteworthy insider critique that foreshadowed measurable R&D slow‑downs after major mergers, yet the subsequent emergence of partnership‑driven breakthroughs (COVID‑19 vaccine, Paxlovid) and ongoing large acquisitions temper its long‑term relevance. It remains a valuable case study for understanding how consolidation can reshape pharma R&D strategy.
