# Odd Functionality in Drugs: A Bis‑N‑Oxide (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary notes that pyridine N‑oxides are rare in marketed medicines—aside from a couple of historical examples (chlordiazepoxide and minoxidil). The author speculates that the N‑oxide functional group may be a liability because it can act as a mild oxidant and is often generated metabolically as a step toward rapid renal clearance.  

The piece then turns to a recent *J. Med. Chem.* paper describing a “benzotriazine bis‑oxide” scaffold that showed activity against drug‑resistant *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. The author wonders whether such N‑oxide‑containing molecules could ever be pushed forward as clinical candidates, and asks the community if anyone has successfully advanced an N‑oxide drug.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Pyridine N‑oxides in approved drugs** – Since 2012 no new small‑molecule medicines containing a pyridine N‑oxide have reached regulatory approval. The two cited agents (minoxidil, chlordiazepoxide) remain the only examples in the United States and European markets.  

**TB drug pipeline** – The benzotriazine bis‑oxide series reported in 2012 (e.g., compounds such as “BTZ‑N‑oxide 1”) never entered formal clinical development. Follow‑up papers (2013‑2017) explored SAR and metabolic stability, but the series was abandoned because of:

* **Rapid in‑vivo reduction** of the N‑oxide to the corresponding pyridine, which eliminated the antibacterial activity observed in vitro.  
* **High oxidative liability** leading to off‑target protein adducts in mouse toxicity studies.  

Consequently, the effort shifted toward other DprE1 inhibitors (e.g., the benzothiazinone BTZ‑043 and its analogs) that do not rely on an N‑oxide. Those compounds have progressed to Phase II/III trials but remain investigational as of early 2024.

**Broader N‑oxide research** – A modest amount of work continued on N‑oxide prodrugs designed to improve brain penetration (e.g., quinidine‑N‑oxide, loperamide‑N‑oxide) or to serve as “redox‑activated” warheads in oncology. None of these programs have produced an approved product; most remain at pre‑clinical or early‑phase status.

**Metabolic understanding** – The hypothesis that N‑oxides are quickly cleared via reduction and subsequent conjugation has been confirmed by human liver microsome studies. The N‑oxide is typically reduced by flavin‑containing reductases (e.g., NQO1) and then glucuronidated or sulfated, leading to short plasma half‑lives (often <30 min in rodents).

**Policy & market impact** – The article’s call for “more attention” to N‑oxides did not translate into any regulatory or funding initiatives. TB drug development funding (e.g., TB Alliance, Gates Foundation) continued to prioritize nitro‑imidazoles (pretomanid, delamanid) and DprE1 inhibitors without N‑oxide motifs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
*The original commentary implied two informal predictions:*

- **Prediction 1:** *Pyridine N‑oxides could become viable drug scaffolds if pharmacokinetic issues are solved.*  
  **Outcome:** No new N‑oxide‑containing drugs have been approved; the pharmacokinetic barrier remains largely unsolved. Research interest has stayed low.

- **Prediction 2:** *Benzotriazine bis‑oxides might be developed into anti‑TB agents.*  
  **Outcome:** The series was discontinued after pre‑clinical failures; no clinical trials have been registered for any benzotriazine N‑oxide compound.

Overall, the article’s optimism was not borne out by subsequent empirical results.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  

*Reasoning:* The piece raises a chemically interesting niche (N‑oxides) and ties it to a pressing disease (drug‑resistant TB), but the lack of subsequent progress limits its long‑term impact. It remains a useful historical footnote for medicinal chemists curious about “failed” scaffolds.
