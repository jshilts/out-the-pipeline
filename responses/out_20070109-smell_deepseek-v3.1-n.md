# That Smell (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog-style post from January 2007 references recent headlines about a "powerful natural-gas smell" in New York City. The author speculates whether organic chemistry labs at Columbia, NYU, Hunter College, or other local institutions might have accidentally released alkanethiols (specifically ethanethiol) down waste pipes, causing the odor. The piece poses a rhetorical question about how much ethanethiol would be needed to "stink out Manhattan," suggesting the threshold might be lower than expected depending on wind conditions.

## 2. HISTORY

The January 2007 incident referenced in the article was a real event. On January 8, 2007, thousands of New York City residents reported a strong gas-like odor across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and New Jersey. The smell prompted widespread 911 calls and concern about a potential gas leak.

Subsequent investigation by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, the Coast Guard, and other agencies determined that the source was likely methyl mercaptan (methanethiol) released from a facility in New Jersey, not ethanethiol from academic labs. The odor was traced to a company called New Jersey Resources, which was conducting maintenance involving mercaptan odorants used in natural gas. The company acknowledged they had been working with mercaptan compounds that day.

The incident led to significant public concern but no evacuations or injuries. It highlighted the challenges of odorant detection in urban environments and raised questions about industrial chemical handling near populated areas. No academic labs were found to be involved in the release.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in this article. The piece was speculative commentary rather than a predictive analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the article references an actual notable incident, the piece itself is brief speculation without substantive scientific or policy analysis, limiting its lasting importance.
