# Natural Products: Always Coming Back (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 commentary questions whether natural product drug discovery faces diminishing returns, noting that decades of screening have picked the "low-hanging fruit" from traditional sources. The author argues that while natural products remain valuable, the field increasingly requires more effort for fewer discoveries, despite continued sampling of extreme environments and new ecosystems.

The article highlights potential escape routes from this plateau: advanced analytical chemistry to detect previously overlooked compounds; "cryptic natural products" produced only under stress conditions; and co-culturing techniques to access unculturable microorganisms. However, the author remains skeptical about whether these approaches can overcome the fundamental challenge of diminishing returns, noting that predictions of a "rebirth" in natural product research have appeared repeatedly over the years without necessarily delivering transformative results.

## 2. HISTORY

The five years following this article saw continued but cautious investment in natural product drug discovery, with mixed outcomes that largely validated the author's concerns about diminishing returns.

**Continued Research with Limited Breakthroughs:** Academic and industrial screening programs persisted, particularly focusing on marine organisms, endophytes, and extreme environments. However, no major blockbuster drugs derived from natural products received FDA approval between 2017-2022 that would fundamentally alter the pharmaceutical landscape. Antibiotic discovery remained especially challenging despite natural products' historical success in this area.

**Technical Advances in Isolation and Characterization:** Analytical chemistry capabilities continued improving, enabling detection of compounds at lower concentrations. Techniques like NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and genomic mining became more sophisticated, supporting the "cryptic natural product" approach. However, the translation of these technical advances into clinically approved drugs remained slow, with development timelines typically exceeding a decade.

**Microbiome and Synthetic Biology Integration:** Research increasingly focused on the human microbiome as a source of bioactive compounds, representing a shift toward "endogenous" natural products. Synthetic biology approaches gained traction for producing known natural products more efficiently, but discoveries of entirely new scaffolds with novel mechanisms remained limited.

**Industry Consolidation and Strategic Shifts:** Several pharmaceutical companies continued reducing or eliminating natural product screening programs, preferring more predictable target-based approaches. Those maintaining natural product research often did so through partnerships with academic institutions or specialized companies, rather than large internal programs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction:** "I would like to see some good drug leads and tool compounds come from Antarctic valleys and deep-sea sampling"
  
  **Outcome:** Limited success. While research continued in extreme environments, no major drugs from these specific sources reached clinical approval by 2022. Several academic papers reported novel compounds from such environments, but none translated to approved therapeutics.

- **Prediction:** Analytical chemistry's "relentless march could pull some of these [compounds] back out into the light, but it'll be work, for sure"
  
  **Outcome:** Partial validation. Analytical capabilities improved significantly, enabling rediscovery and characterization of known compounds at lower concentrations, but this did not fundamentally reverse diminishing returns in finding truly novel structures with commercial potential.

- **Prediction:** About "cryptic natural products" - "it's still a young field, with a lot of work to be done in it"
  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. The field remained research-intensive without producing major commercial successes by 2022. Academic interest continued, but industrial adoption remained limited due to technical challenges and uncertain returns.

- **Prediction:** Co-culturing microorganisms "has the advantage of perhaps producing some new active compounds"
  
  **Outcome:** Modest progress. Research continued, and some novel compounds were discovered through co-culture approaches, but scaling and reproducibility challenges limited widespread pharmaceutical adoption.

- **Prediction implied throughout:** That predictions of natural product "rebirth" may be overstated and cyclical
  
  **Outcome:** Largely accurate. While natural products research continued, there was no dramatic resurgence comparable to the golden age of antibiotic discovery. The field evolved gradually rather than experiencing revolutionary change.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article demonstrates thoughtful analysis of a persistent challenge in drug discovery, with accurate assessment of diminishing returns and cautious evaluation of potential solutions. Its moderate score reflects solid scientific insight without breakthrough predictions or transformative impact on the field.
