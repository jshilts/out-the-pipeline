# ICOS In Pieces?
18 Dec 2006

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Eli Lilly's acquisition of ICOS, their Cialis partner, for what was initially $32/share and later raised to a final offer of $34/share. The acquisition drew objections from ICOS shareholders who felt the company was worth more. The author notes that Lilly's plan was to lay off all ICOS employees after the acquisition, keeping only the Cialis rights and intellectual property. The article expresses mixed feelings about this "buy-'em-and-fire-'em" approach, acknowledging it makes business sense but worries about the destruction of a potential biotech cluster in Washington state. The author speculates that small pharma/biotech companies will become increasingly important in the US research environment but laments the loss of talent and infrastructure that comes with such acquisitions.

## 2. HISTORY

Eli Lilly did indeed acquire ICOS in January 2007 for approximately $2.3 billion, finalizing the deal at $34 per share. Following the acquisition, Lilly largely followed through on its plans regarding ICOS personnel. **Cialis (tadalafil)**, the erectile dysfunction drug that was the joint venture between Lilly and ICOS, continued to be a major commercial success for Lilly. The drug gained additional FDA approvals over the years, including for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in 2011, and became one of Lilly's blockbuster products, generating billions in annual revenue. The Washington state biotech community did suffer from the loss of ICOS as an independent company, though some former ICOS employees went on to other ventures. The acquisition pattern of large pharma buying smaller biotech companies for their assets while eliminating redundancies continued to be a common industry practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and observations that can be evaluated:

- **Prediction that Lilly's buyout approach would follow through**: ✓ **Accurate**. Lilly did acquire ICOS and did proceed with significant layoffs of ICOS employees, keeping primarily the Cialis asset and associated IP.

- **Prediction that small pharma/biotech would become increasingly important in US research**: ✓ **Accurate**. The biotech sector continued to grow significantly post-2006, with small and medium-sized companies driving much of the innovation that larger pharmaceutical companies later acquired.

- **Concern about "wiping out a possible biotech cluster" in Washington state**: ⚠️ **Partially accurate, though less severe than feared**. While the loss of ICOS as an independent company was significant for the local ecosystem, Washington state's biotech sector continued to develop, albeit with the loss of what could have been an anchor company for a major cluster.

- **Observation about the "buy-'em-and-fire-'em" style being associated more with Pfizer**: ℹ️ **Contextually accurate for the time**. This pattern did indeed continue across the pharmaceutical industry, not just with Pfizer or Lilly, as large companies increasingly focused on acquiring assets rather than maintaining redundant research operations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article provides a prescient look at biotech acquisition patterns and their impact on research ecosystems, though it focuses mainly on one transaction rather than broader industry trends with enduring significance.
