# What Became of Cubist (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reports on the aftermath of Merck's December 2014 acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a pure-play antibiotic company. Merck quickly fired Cubist's entire R&D workforce in March 2015, treating the scientists as expendable while keeping the late-stage clinical assets. The piece examines what happened to the 120+ affected scientists, finding surprisingly positive employment outcomes. Within months, more than half had secured new positions at smaller Boston-area biotech companies, despite competing with an additional 80 AstraZeneca antibiotic researchers who were laid off from nearby Waltham facilities around the same time.

The article highlights several factors contributing to this successful re-employment: Boston's dense concentration of smaller biotech companies doing antibiotic work; an industry-wide shift from large pharma to smaller, specialized firms in the antibiotic space; and the region's vibrant startup ecosystem that provides constant job turnover. The author frames this as an encouraging counter-narrative to typical drug discovery layoff stories, showcasing how geographic clustering and industry restructuring can benefit displaced scientists.

## 2. HISTORY

**Cubist's Clinical Assets and FDA Outcomes:**
Merck's acquisition centered on Cubist's late-stage antibiotic pipeline. The crown jewel was **Cubicin (daptomycin)**, already FDA-approved in 2003, which remained a significant hospital antibiotic through the late 2010s. More critically, Merck acquired **Zerbaxa (ceftolozane/tazobactam)**, which received FDA approval in December 2014 - just as the acquisition closed - for complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections. Zerbaxa later gained an additional indication for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia in 2019. A third key asset was **Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate)**, approved in June 2014 for acute bacterial skin infections.

**Post-Acquisition Antibiotic Market Evolution:**
The period 2015-2020 saw continued concentration of antibiotic R&D in smaller companies. Major pharma largely exited the space due to challenging economics: antibiotics require short treatment durations, face antimicrobial stewardship pressures limiting use, and offer modest revenue compared to chronic disease drugs. This validated the article's observation that the economic model "makes more sense for a smaller outfit."

However, many small antibiotic companies faced severe financial headwinds. Despite scientific successes, companies like Achaogen, Melinta Therapeutics, and others struggled with commercial viability, leading to bankruptcies and acquisitions in the late 2010s. The core issue: innovative new antibiotics were being developed but couldn't achieve commercial success due to low prices and restricted use policies designed to preserve effectiveness.

**Antibiotic Policy Developments:**
Major policy changes occurred that the article couldn't have anticipated. The **GAIN Act** (Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now) of 2012, which provided extended exclusivity for qualified infectious disease products, had already passed but its full impact was still unfolding. More significantly, **CARB-X** (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) launched in 2016 as a public-private partnership investing $500+ million in early-stage antibiotic development. Additionally, the **DISARM Act** was proposed (though not enacted) to create new reimbursement models for antibiotics. The fundamental market challenges remained: companies could discover breakthrough antibiotics but couldn't generate sustainable revenue.

**Merck's Strategic Outcomes:**
Merck successfully integrated Cubist's marketed products into its hospital portfolio. Cubicin maintained steady use for serious Gram-positive infections. Zerbaxa became a significant hospital antibiotic, competing with newer agents like Allergan's Avycaz. However, Merck scaled back antibiotic R&D investment in subsequent years, consistent with broader industry patterns.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: "A bunch of smaller companies betting their respective farms will probably produce more drugs than leaving it all to the bigger players"**
- **Outcome Accuracy:** The prediction proved directionally correct but overly optimistic regarding commercial success. Small companies did drive antibiotic innovation from 2015-2025, with numerous FDA approvals coming from companies like Nabriva, Paratek, Melinta, and others. However, the underlying economic challenges overwhelmed these companies. Achaogen's Zemdri (plazomicin) showed clinical promise but the company declared bankruptcy in 2019. Melinta's Baxdela (delafloxacin) faced similar commercial struggles despite FDA approval. The "more drugs produced" prediction held true scientifically, but the "betting their farms" strategy proved unsustainable - the farms kept being foreclosed.

**• Prediction: Industry rebalancing toward smaller companies would continue in antibiotics**
- **Outcome Accuracy:** Highly accurate. The trend of large pharma exiting antibiotics accelerated significantly post-2015. Novartis, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, and others either drastically reduced or completely eliminated antibiotic R&D programs. By 2020, virtually all major pharma companies had exited early-stage antibiotic research. This concentrated innovation entirely in small biotech companies, academic spinouts, and specialty pharma. The Boston area particularly benefited from this shift, becoming an even more concentrated hub for antibiotic startups.

**• Prediction: Boston/Cambridge's biopharma cluster dominance would continue growing due to network effects**
- **Outcome Accuracy:** Correct. The Boston-Cambridge biopharma ecosystem expanded dramatically through the late 2010s and early 2020s, becoming the world's most concentrated hub for biotech R&D and investment. The region's density of specialized employers, crossover between academia and industry, and constant startup activity created resilience. When antibiotic companies failed or consolidated, researchers could transition to other therapeutic areas like oncology, rare diseases, or platform technologies flourishing in the region. This validated the author's premise that geographic clustering provides career safety nets.

**• Implicit Prediction: The antibiotic job market could absorb displaced scientists**
- **Outcome Accuracy:** Partially correct short-term, increasingly challenging long-term. While ex-Cubist scientists found positions in 2015, the broader antibiotic job market contracted significantly in subsequent years due to company failures and continued large pharma exits. Many skilled antibiotic researchers ultimately transitioned to other therapeutic areas as the sector's economic challenges accumulated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in antibiotic development's economic evolution and demonstrates accurate foresight about industry restructuring. The empirical observations about regional clustering and employment dynamics were particularly prescient. The analysis remains relevant for understanding pharmaceutical industry consolidation patterns and the geographic economics of biotech innovation. However, the article could not anticipate the severity of commercial challenges that would plague antibiotic companies, making it more historically interesting than presciently diagnostic about sector-wide sustainability.
