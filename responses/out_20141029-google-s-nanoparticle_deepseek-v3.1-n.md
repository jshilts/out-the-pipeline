# Google's Nanoparticle Diagnostic Ideas (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses Google X's reported interest in diagnostic magnetic-cored nanoparticles. The concept involved using nanoparticles to interrogate body functions and then reconcentrating them in superficial veins for readout—reportedly through some form of across-the-skin detection rather than blood draw. The author notes that if the goal is simply circulating factors, adding nanoparticles to blood samples ex vivo would be more straightforward, suggesting Google might be targeting solid tissue diagnostics instead. However, this raises pharmacokinetic concerns about particle retention, clearance, and tissue interactions. Google indicated they didn't plan to develop this fully themselves but rather wanted to interest other life sciences companies in the approach.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2014 article, Google's life sciences efforts evolved significantly. The nanoparticle diagnostic project became part of Verily (Google's life sciences subsidiary, spun out in 2015). The ambitious across-the-skin nanoparticle detection concept described here does not appear to have resulted in commercial diagnostic products or widespread clinical adoption. 

By the late 2010s, Verily had shifted focus to other areas of diagnostics and digital health, including continuous glucose monitoring partnerships, smart contact lenses (later discontinued), and various AI-driven health initiatives. The specific magnetic nanoparticle-based diagnostic platform with noninvasive readout described in this article has not become a standard clinical tool or achieved regulatory approval for diagnostic use.

The broader field of nanoparticle diagnostics continued to advance separately from Google's specific approach, with applications in cancer detection, infectious disease diagnostics, and medical imaging, though these typically involve established laboratory techniques rather than the across-skin readout concept.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **The article's implicit prediction about technical development**: The author suggested the across-the-skin readout had "a ways to go" and would require extensive animal work. **Outcome**: This was accurate—the technology did not advance to clinical use, suggesting the technical challenges were more substantial than initially anticipated.

- **Google's stated intent to partner with life sciences companies**: The company indicated they weren't planning full independent development but wanted to interest other companies. **Outcome**: While Verily did pursue numerous partnerships, the nanoparticle diagnostic concept specifically did not appear to generate the industry uptake that might have been hoped for in 2014.

- **The broader assumption about nanoparticle diagnostics entering clinical practice**: **Outcome**: Nanoparticle-based diagnostics have seen some adoption in laboratory settings, but not through the across-skin readout mechanism envisioned here. The pharmacokinetic and targeting challenges the author noted proved significant barriers.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured a moment when Google's entry into healthcare diagnostics generated excitement, but the specific technology discussed never materialized into clinical impact. While historically interesting for showing early Google health ambitions, the nanoparticle concept itself remained speculative.
