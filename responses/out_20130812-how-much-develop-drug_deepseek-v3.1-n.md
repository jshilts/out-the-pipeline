# How Much to Develop a Drug? An Update (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article analyzes Matthew Herper's updated calculation of pharmaceutical R&D costs per approved drug, examining 98 companies over a ten-year period. The study calculated costs by dividing total R&D expenditures by the number of drugs each company gained approval for. The results revealed staggering figures: Sanofi ranked second at $10 billion per approved drug (6 drugs total), AstraZeneca at $9.5 billion per drug (4 drugs), with other major pharma companies like Roche, Pfizer, and Novartis showing costs around $6 billion per drug. Bristol-Myers Squibb appeared more efficient at $3.3 billion per drug.

Smaller companies with only one approval showed a median cost of $350 million per drug, but the article notes this reflects survivor bias - these companies were "lucky the first time out" without accounting for their many failed counterparts. Larger companies' higher costs reflect both clinical failures and organizational inefficiencies. The analysis revealed that 66 of 98 companies launched only one drug during the decade studied, while costs per drug increased with company size, reaching $5.5 billion for companies approving 8-13 medicines.

## 2. HISTORY

The cost calculations in this 2013 article reflected a period of declining R&D productivity in the pharmaceutical industry. In the decade following this analysis, several key developments occurred:

**Industry Response and Internal Reforms**: Major pharmaceutical companies indeed implemented significant cost-cutting measures. Sanofi, under CEO Christopher Viehbacher (mentioned in the article), continued restructuring efforts, though Viehbacher departed in 2014. Companies increasingly outsourced early-stage research and adopted more targeted, smaller-scale approaches to drug discovery.

**R&D Productivity Trends**: Subsequent analyses through the 2010s showed that while individual drug approval costs remained high, the industry made some progress in improving success rates. The rise of precision medicine and biomarker-driven trials helped reduce late-stage failure rates in certain therapeutic areas.

**New Business Models**: The biotech sector continued growing, with smaller companies increasingly specializing in specific therapeutic areas or stages of development. This led to more partnerships and acquisitions, with large pharma companies buying innovative smaller companies rather than developing everything internally.

**Technological Impact**: Advancements in genomics, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy (particularly after the success of checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda and Opdivo, approved 2014-2015) changed cost structures. These therapies often had higher success rates in specific patient populations but required significant investment in companion diagnostics.

**M&A Activity**: The trend toward consolidation continued, with companies like AbbVie spinning off from Abbott (2013) and major acquisitions reshaping the landscape. However, these mergers often led to R&D budget cuts and pipeline pruning.

**Approval Rates and Costs**: Through the 2010s, the industry saw some improvement in FDA approval rates, partly due to expedited pathways like breakthrough therapy designation (created in 2012), but R&D costs remained substantial.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific predictions about named drugs or technologies. Instead, it dealt with institutional and economic forecasts about the pharmaceutical industry's sustainability.

**Concern about unsustainable costs**: The article concluded that "we can't go on like this." In reality, the industry did continue, though with significant structural changes. Major companies shifted strategies toward greater efficiency, targeted acquisitions, and more focused therapeutic areas rather than broad discovery efforts.

**Implicit concern about industry consolidation**: The analysis suggested that high costs would continue to drive consolidation, which did occur throughout the 2010s with numerous major mergers and acquisitions, including several involving companies on this list.

**Prediction that large companies would face continued productivity challenges**: This proved accurate. Large pharmaceutical companies continued struggling with R&D productivity relative to their massive investments, leading to ongoing restructuring and strategy changes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides valuable economic analysis of pharmaceutical R&D productivity at a time when the industry was grappling with major efficiency concerns. The data-driven approach and the stark revelation of billion-dollar-per-drug costs offer important insights into the economics of drug development, even though the calculation method was necessarily simplified.
