# The Research Works Act: One (Two!) Against and One For (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on publisher positions regarding the proposed Research Works Act (RWA), which sought to roll back the requirement that US government-funded research be made freely available within one year. Nature Publishing Group had publicly opposed the bill, joining AAAS (publisher of Science) in taking a stand against the legislation. The author notes that the American Chemical Society remained silent on the issue.

The piece also describes an unconventional defense of the RWA from Rich Apodaca at Depth-First, who argued that passing the Act would "heighten the contradictions" by accelerating the collapse of traditional scientific publishing. Apodaca contended that publishers' only remaining value was "imprimatur" (prestige endorsement), which was becoming less meaningful as fewer scientists could access expensive journal content. Both viewpoints agreed that the traditional publishing model was being eroded, though they differed on whether legislation should prevent or accelerate that process.

## 2. HISTORY
The Research Works Act died in committee in 2012 following widespread opposition from researchers, universities, and some publishers. The controversy catalyzed the growth of the open access movement and led to several significant developments:

**Policy Responses:**
- In 2013, the Obama administration issued a directive requiring federal agencies with over $100M in R&D funding to develop public access plans for federally funded research.
- In 2016, this evolved into the federal Public Access Policy mandating free public access within 12 months of publication.
- In August 2022, the Biden administration's Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a new policy eliminating the 12-month embargo entirely, requiring immediate open access for federally funded research by 2026.

**Publishing Industry Changes:**
The traditional subscription model faced sustained pressure. Many publishers developed hybrid open-access options, allowing authors to pay article processing charges (APCs) for immediate open access. By the early 2020s, major funding agencies increasingly mandated or strongly encouraged immediate open access publication. Meanwhile, preprint servers like bioRxiv, arXiv, and medRxiv became standard infrastructure, further decoupling dissemination from publisher imprimatur.

**Market Realities:**
While high-impact journals like Nature and Science maintained their prestige, they increasingly relied on APCs rather than subscriptions for revenue. The prediction that traditional publishing would collapse entirely proved premature—high-impact journals adapted through hybrid models. However, subscription-based access did decline significantly, and the "imprimatur" function became somewhat more distributed across open-access venues, preprints, and institutional repositories.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Apodaca's prediction that RWA passage would quickly destroy traditional scientific publishing through "heightened contradictions":** The RWA failed to pass, yet traditional publishing faced sustained pressure anyway. The industry adapted rather than collapsing, shifting to hybrid open-access models that preserved revenue streams while accommodating open access demands.

- **The claim that publisher "imprimatur" would become worthless as fewer scientists could read premium journals:** High-impact journals retained significant prestige throughout the 2010s and early 2020s. While access barriers created friction, the imprimatur remained valuable for career advancement, grant funding, and media coverage. However, changes in evaluation criteria at some institutions and funders did reduce reliance on journal-based metrics.

- **Implicit assumption that this represented an existential threat to high-priced publishers:** Major publishers like Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley adapted successfully by developing open-access revenue models, maintaining profitability despite the erosion of pure subscription-based publishing.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in scholarly communication policy, correctly identifying the fundamental tensions that would reshape scientific publishing over the subsequent decade. The failed RWA became a catalyst for widespread change in how research is disseminated.
