# Another Crashing Noise From the Basement (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece treats Theranos – the Silicon‑Valley‑styled blood‑testing startup – as being in the deepest stage of its downfall.  By April 2016 the company was already facing public doubts about its technology, customer defections, and an FDA warning.  The article reports that the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal probe into whether Theranos deliberately misled investors, and that the SEC was also looking at the firm’s fundraising statements.  The author wonders why the high‑profile board was silent, questions whether the company could ever recover, and warns future investors that “wunderkinder” like Elizabeth Holmes are a risky bet in medicine.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Legal outcomes (2016‑2023)**  
* **2018** – The SEC filed a civil fraud action.  Theranos and Holmes settled without admitting wrongdoing; Holmes was barred for ten years from serving as an officer or director of a public company and fined $500 k.  
* **June 2018** – The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California indicted Holmes and former president Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani on multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy.  
* **2021‑2022** – Holmes’ trial began (January 2022) and concluded with a conviction on four counts of fraud (January 2022).  In November 2022 she was sentenced to **11 years + 3 months** in federal prison, plus restitution and a lifetime ban from the health‑care industry.  
* **December 2022** – Balwani was found guilty on all 12 counts and received a **20‑year** prison term.  

**Company fate**  
* Theranos ceased all operations in 2018, laid off staff, and formally dissolved in **September 2021**.  No Theranos device ever received FDA clearance, and the company never shipped a validated test to the market.  

**Industry‑wide repercussions**  
* **Regulatory vigilance** – The FDA and CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) tightened oversight of laboratory‑developed tests (LDTs).  The “Laboratory Improvement Amendments” (CLIA) inspections of point‑of‑care devices increased, and the FDA issued clearer guidance on when a diagnostic device requires pre‑market approval.  
* **Investor due‑diligence** – Venture capital firms became markedly more skeptical of “black‑box” biotech claims.  Post‑Theranos, many funds added mandatory scientific advisory board reviews and required third‑party validation data before committing capital.  
* **Public‑policy response** – While no federal “Theranos Act” was enacted, the case spurred congressional hearings (e.g., a 2020 Senate subcommittee hearing on “Health‑Tech Start‑ups and Consumer Protection”) and prompted the SEC to issue a 2020 staff bulletin warning about “unverified health‑technology claims.”  
* **Cultural impact** – The story inspired multiple books, a documentary (“The Inventor”), and the 2021 Hulu series “The Dropout,” cementing Theranos as a cautionary tale for both biotech and Silicon‑Valley hype cycles.  

**Broader biotech landscape**  
* No other startup has attempted to replace central‑lab testing with a single finger‑stick device at Theranos’ scale.  Companies that do pursue point‑of‑care diagnostics (e.g., Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre, Roche’s Accu-Chek) have proceeded through conventional regulatory pathways and have achieved market adoption.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction in the article | What actually happened |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Investors will keep throwing “sackfuls of money” at a 19‑year‑old with a big biomedical idea** | The specific hype around Elizabeth Holmes vanished; investors became far more cautious about unproven biomedical claims.  While young founders still raise capital, they now face stricter scientific validation requirements. |
| **Theranos might recover from the collapse** | The company dissolved and never returned to market.  Its assets were liquidated, and the brand is now synonymous with fraud. |
| **The board of directors was absent or ineffective** | Most board members (e.g., Henry Meyer, former Secretary of State) resigned or were removed by 2017.  The board never intervened to halt the fraudulent practices, confirming the article’s criticism. |
| **Regulators (FDA) would be “breathing down your neck”** | The FDA issued a “warning letter” in 2016 and later barred Theranos from operating a CLIA‑certified lab.  The agency’s subsequent guidance on LDTs reflects the heightened scrutiny implied. |
| **Future biotech “wunderkinder” could turn the world upside down** | No comparable breakthrough from a single teenage founder has materialized in the diagnostic space.  The broader biotech sector continues to rely on multidisciplinary teams and rigorous clinical validation. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in a high‑profile fraud that reshaped investor behavior, regulatory oversight, and public perception of biotech startups; its relevance persists years later.
