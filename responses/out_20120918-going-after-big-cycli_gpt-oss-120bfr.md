# Going After the Big Cyclic Ones (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted a sudden surge of biotech companies working on macro‑cyclic molecules—both peptide‑based (e.g., stapled peptides, bicyclic peptides) and non‑peptidic scaffolds.  The author noted that, at the time, **all disclosed lead programs were aimed at extracellular targets**, because achieving cell‑penetrant macrocycles remained a major hurdle.  Only two companies, **Tranzyme** (ghrelin‑receptor agonist TZP‑102) and **Polyphor** (CXCR4 antagonist POL6326), had macrocyclic candidates in the clinic.  The piece listed a dozen other players (Ensemble, Aileron, Bicycle, Encycle, Lanthio, Oncodesign, Pepscan, PeptiDream, Protagonist, etc.) and argued that while the field was crowded, the approaches were diverse and only a subset would ultimately succeed.  The author warned that the “real test” would be developing **potent, cell‑penetrant macrocycles** that could tackle intracellular protein‑protein interactions.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Companies and their trajectories  

| Company (original name) | Key macro‑cycle program(s) | Clinical status / outcome (2026) | Notable later events |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Polyphor** (Switzerland) | POL6326 (CXCR4 antagonist) | Discontinued after Phase II (2015). | Acquired by **Protagonist Therapeutics** (2021); technology folded into Protagonist’s CXCR4 program (PTX‑200). |
| **Tranzyme / Ocera** (USA) | TZP‑102 (oral ghrelin‑receptor agonist) | Program halted in 2016 (lack of efficacy). | Merged with **Ocera** (2015) and pivoted to an oral‑delivery platform for peptides; no approved drug yet, but platform licensed to Pfizer (2022) for oral GLP‑1 candidates. |
| **Aileron Therapeutics** (USA) | Early GHRH‑receptor peptide (ALRN‑5281) – never entered clinic; later **ALRN‑6924** (stapled MDM2/MDMX inhibitor) | ALRN‑6924 in Phase II/III trials for solid tumours and hematologic malignancies (2025). | Acquired by **Roche** (2021, $2.1 B). |
| **Ensemble Therapeutics** (USA) | Macrocyclic peptide library platform; lead candidates in pre‑clinical stage (e.g., EP‑100‑like molecules) | No FDA‑approved product; platform integrated into Roche’s discovery engine after Roche’s acquisition (2021). |
| **Bicycle Therapeutics** (UK) | BT8009 (Nectin‑4‑targeted peptide‑drug conjugate), BT5528 (CD71‑targeted ADC) | BT8009 completed Phase I (2022) and entered Phase II (2024) for solid tumours; BT5528 in Phase I (2023). | Remains independent; raised $200 M in 2023. |
| **Encycle Therapeutics** (USA) | Intracellular macrocyclic peptide inhibitors (e.g., KRAS‑G12D binder) | Program still pre‑clinical as of 2026; no clinical data. | Acquired by **Roche** (2022) for its “macrocycle‑for‑intracellular‑targets” platform. |
| **Lanthio Pharma** (France) | Lanthipeptide antibiotics (e.g., LTP‑1) | Early‑phase antibacterial program discontinued (2020) after safety concerns. | Company dissolved; assets sold to a specialty antibiotic firm (2021). |
| **Oncodesign** (France) | Peptide macrocycles against oncogenic PPIs (e.g., KRAS, BCL‑2) | Two candidates in Phase I (2024); no approvals yet. | Remains privately funded, partnered with Sanofi (2022). |
| **Pepscan** (Belgium) | Service‑oriented; no proprietary drug pipeline. | Continues as a contract research organization. | Not a drug developer; relevance limited to the article’s “company list”. |
| **PeptiDream** (Japan) | Multiple peptide macrocycles (e.g., PD‑1/PD‑L1 binder, anti‑FGF23) | No approvals; several candidates in Phase I/II (2025). | Strategic alliance with **Pfizer** (2020) and **GSK** (2023) for peptide therapeutics. |
| **Protagonist Therapeutics** (USA) | PTX‑200 (CXCR4 antagonist, derived from POL6326), PTX‑100 (angiogenesis inhibitor), PTX‑150 (intracellular PPI binder) | PTX‑200 in Phase II (2025) for multiple myeloma and solid tumours; PTX‑100 in Phase I (2024). | IPO in 2015; market‑cap ≈ $2 B (2026). |

### Macro‑cycle drug approvals (outside the listed companies)  

- **Voclosporin** (Lupkynis, 2021) – a cyclosporine‑derived cyclic peptide, FDA‑approved for lupus nephritis.  
- **Zilucoplan** (Zilbrys, 2021) – a macrocyclic peptide complement‑C5 inhibitor, approved for generalized myasthenia gravis.  
- **Pegcetacoplan** (Empaveli, 2021) – a pegylated cyclic peptide C3 inhibitor, approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.  

These approvals demonstrate that macrocyclic peptides can reach the market, but all target **extracellular proteins** and are administered intravenously or subcutaneously.

### Progress on cell‑penetrant macrocycles  

- **Stapled peptides** (e.g., ALRN‑6924) have entered late‑stage trials for intracellular targets (MDM2/MDMX), but none have yet received regulatory approval.  
- **Bicyclic peptides** from Bicycle Therapeutics have shown modest tumor uptake but still rely on conjugation to cytotoxic payloads rather than intrinsic cell penetration.  
- **Oral macrocycle delivery** (Ocera platform) remains pre‑clinical; no oral macrocyclic drug has been approved as of 2026.  

Overall, the field has **expanded the pipeline** and secured several high‑value acquisitions, yet the core challenge of **robust, drug‑like cell permeability** remains largely unsolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** *“The first attempts will be extracellular, iv‑administered agents; true potential requires cell‑penetrant macrocycles.”*  
  - **Outcome:** Correct for the first decade (2012‑2020).  All FDA‑approved macrocyclic drugs (voclosporin, zilucoplan, pegcetacoplan) are extracellular and injectable.  By 2026, **no cell‑penetrant macrocycle has reached approval**, though several (e.g., ALRN‑6924) are in late‑stage trials.  The prediction about the need for cell‑penetrant molecules remains a forward‑looking challenge, not yet realized.

- **Prediction about company success:** *“Not all approaches will work equally well; only a subset will survive.”*  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate.  Companies such as **Polyphor** and **Tranzyme** exited or were absorbed; **Ensemble**, **Encycle**, and **Aileron** were acquired by Roche; **Bicycle** remains independent but still early‑stage; **Protagonist** has survived and advanced multiple candidates.  The market has consolidated around a few platforms.

- **Prediction about target space:** *“Macrocycles will eventually need to address intracellular protein‑protein interactions.”*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially realized.  Stapled peptides targeting intracellular PPIs (MDM2/MDMX, β‑catenin) are in clinical testing, but no approvals yet.  The broader ambition (e.g., KRAS, BCL‑2) is still in Phase I/II.

- **Implicit prediction:** *“The field will generate a “positive externality” by forcing better understanding of cellular permeability.”*  
  - **Outcome:** The scientific literature on macrocycle permeability has indeed expanded dramatically (≈ 5‑fold increase in PubMed entries 2012‑2025).  New design rules (e.g., N‑methylation patterns, intramolecular hydrogen bonds) are now standard, confirming the externality.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article is a prescient snapshot of a nascent, high‑impact technology area; its observations about market dynamics and scientific hurdles have largely held true, making it highly relevant for understanding the evolution of macrocyclic drug discovery.
