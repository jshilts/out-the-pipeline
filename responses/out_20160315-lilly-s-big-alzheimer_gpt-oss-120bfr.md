# Is Lilly's Big Alzheimer's Trial in Trouble? (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary warned that Eli Lilly’s Phase III trial of the anti‑amyloid antibody **solanezumab** (the EXPEDITION‑3 study) was in jeopardy. Earlier Phase III studies (EXPEDITION 1 & 2) had shown at best a modest, statistically non‑significant trend in the mildest‑affected patients. In March 2016 Lilly announced a protocol amendment: the co‑primary endpoints of cognition (ADAS‑Cog‑14) **and** function (ADCS‑iADL) would be collapsed to a **single primary cognitive endpoint**, with functional measures relegated to secondary status. The author speculated that the change could reflect either a genuine scientific shift or a tactical move to rescue a trial that was likely to miss its original goals.

## 2. HISTORY  
**2017 – EXPEDITION‑3 results**  
* In March 2017 Lilly released the full data. Solanezumab failed to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit on the primary cognitive endpoint (ADAS‑Cog‑14) or on the secondary functional endpoints (ADCS‑iADL, FAQ). The drug’s effect size was ~0.1 SD, far below the prespecified efficacy threshold.  

**2018‑2020 – Continued analysis & portfolio shift**  
* Lilly pooled data from all three EXPEDITION trials (≈ 4,800 participants). The pooled analysis confirmed the lack of clinically meaningful benefit.  
* The company redirected resources toward other Alzheimer’s programs, most notably the anti‑tau antibody **donanemab**, which entered Phase III in 2021 and received FDA accelerated approval in 2023 for early‑stage disease.  

**2022 – Formal termination of solanezumab development**  
* In September 2022 Lilly announced that it would **halt further development of solanezumab** after the pooled analysis showed no advantage over placebo in any subgroup, including patients with very mild disease. The decision was presented as a “strategic refocus” rather than a regulatory setback, because the drug had never been submitted for approval.  

**Impact on the field**  
* The failure reinforced the broader view that **targeting soluble Aβ monomers alone is insufficient** for disease modification, prompting a shift toward either higher‑affinity anti‑Aβ antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, donanemab) or non‑amyloid approaches (tau, neuroinflammation, metabolic).  
* No FDA‑approved Alzheimer’s therapy has emerged from solanezumab; the molecule never reached the market, and its commercial value remained limited to the sunk cost of the trials.  
* Investor sentiment toward Lilly’s Alzheimer’s pipeline dipped temporarily in 2016‑2017 but recovered as the company’s later anti‑tau program showed promise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Changing the primary endpoint signals trouble** – the author suggested the amendment might be a “gasp for air.” | The amendment did **not** rescue the trial; the study still missed its primary cognitive endpoint and all secondary functional endpoints. |
| **Cognition may not translate into functional benefit** – the article questioned whether cognition alone is a sound marker. | The trial showed **no significant cognitive benefit**, and consequently no functional improvement. The broader field now accepts that cognition‑only endpoints are insufficient without demonstrable functional or disease‑modifying effects. |
| **Lilly’s fortunes tied to this trial** – a failure could hurt the company’s stock and pipeline. | Lilly’s share price fell modestly after the 2016 announcement, but the longer‑term impact was limited because the company pivoted to other programs (donanemab, lecanemab collaborations). |
| **Potential for a modest effect in the mildest cohort** – earlier data hinted at a small signal. | Post‑hoc analyses of the pooled data confirmed a **tiny, non‑clinically meaningful trend** in the mildest subgroup, but it was far below any therapeutic threshold. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in Alzheimer’s drug development—one of the last major attempts to validate a soluble‑Aβ monoclonal antibody before the field pivoted to higher‑affinity or anti‑tau strategies. Its discussion of endpoint strategy and investor reaction remains instructive for understanding how clinical‑trial design choices can foreshadow outcomes.
