# A Nobel for Circadian Rhythm (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine being awarded to Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael Young for their discoveries of the molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythm. The author notes that circadian rhythm was not a highly predicted winner compared to topics like CRISPR gene editing. The piece explains how circadian rhythms represent an internal biological clock that operates even without external light cues, with humans and organisms maintaining approximately 24-hour cycles in controlled environments.

The core discovery involved identifying the feedback loop mechanism in fruit flies (Drosophila), building on earlier work by Konopka and Benzer who identified the first "clock mutants" in the 1970s. Hall, Rosbash, and Young elucidated how the PER, TIM, CLK, and CYC proteins interact in a feedback loop: PER and TIM proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm, enter the nucleus, associate with CLK/CYC transcription factors, and shut down their own gene expression, creating an oscillating system that cycles every 24 hours. The article emphasizes that this was the first clear demonstration of a single gene (period) controlling complex behavior, and that similar mechanisms operate in mammals, affecting numerous physiological processes including blood pressure, metabolism, hormone levels, and cognitive functions.

## 2. HISTORY
After the 2017 Nobel Prize, circadian rhythm research continued expanding across multiple domains. The molecular clock mechanism proved to be more complex than initially understood, with additional clock genes and regulatory layers discovered in mammals, including REV-ERBα/β, ROR proteins, and post-transcriptional modifications.

**Clinical Applications and Drug Development:**
- Several drugs targeting circadian pathways reached clinical development, though none achieved blockbuster status
- Melatonin receptor agonists like tasimelteon (Hetlioz) received FDA approval for sleep disorders and saw moderate clinical adoption
- REV-ERB agonists and other circadian-modulating compounds entered clinical trials for metabolic disorders
- Chronotherapy (timing drug administration to circadian cycles) gained recognition but saw limited widespread clinical implementation

**Scientific Impact:**
- The field of "chronopharmacology" expanded significantly, studying how drug efficacy and toxicity vary with timing
- Research established stronger links between circadian disruption and diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer
- Shift work was formally classified as a probable carcinogen by IARC due to circadian disruption

**Business Developments:**
- Companies focused on circadian therapeutics (like Vanda Pharmaceuticals) achieved some success but remained niche players
- The broader sleep and wellness industry increasingly incorporated circadian science, though often with limited scientific rigor

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**No explicit predictions were made in this article.** The piece is primarily retrospective and explanatory rather than predictive. The author did note that CRISPR gene editing was favored by many observers for the Nobel Prize (which eventually won in 2020 for Chemistry), but made no specific predictions about circadian rhythm research directions or commercial outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article addresses fundamental biological mechanisms with broad health implications, but focuses primarily on established science rather than forward-looking developments or breakthrough applications.
