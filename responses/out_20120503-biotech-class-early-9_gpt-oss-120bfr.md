# The Biotech Class of the Early 90s (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
Bruce Booth’s 2012 commentary looks back at the “IPO window” of 1991‑1994, when a flood of biotech start‑ups went public. He notes that a handful of those firms—most famously Gilead, MedImmune and Vertex—have become multibillion‑dollar powerhouses, but the majority have either vanished or delivered flat‑to‑negative returns for shareholders. Booth uses two mid‑cap examples, Isis (now Ionis) and Amylin, to illustrate that even companies that survived to launch products often under‑performed major equity indices over a 20‑year horizon.  

He argues that the poor long‑term performance of that cohort has reshaped capital markets: public investors are now far less tolerant of “value‑destroying” biotech IPOs, the bar for a successful listing is much higher, and the classic model of “build a Gilead‑type company and go public” is no longer viable. Instead, he predicts that small biotechs will stay private longer, rely on outsourced services, and aim for early exits (e.g., acquisition by Big Pharma) rather than an IPO.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Companies highlighted in the article  

| Company (original name) | Key post‑2012 events | Current status (2026) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Gilead Sciences** (IPO 1992) | Expanded from antivirals into oncology (e.g., Yescarta) and COVID‑19 (remdesivir). Revenue peaked in 2015‑2016 on hepatitis C drugs, then declined as patents expired. Still a >$80 B market‑cap leader in antivirals and oncology. | Public, strong cash flow, but growth now driven by oncology acquisitions (e.g., Kite, Forty‑Seven). |
| **MedImmune** (acquired 2007) | Integrated into AstraZeneca as its biologics arm. Contributed products such as Synagis, Imfinzi, and the COVID‑19 vaccine (as part of AZ‑Oxford). In 2020 AZ spun out its rare‑disease unit (including MedImmune assets) into a separate entity, **AstraZeneca Rare Disease**, but the core R&D capability remains within AZ. | No longer a standalone company; its legacy lives in AZ’s biologics pipeline. |
| **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** (IPO 1991) | Developed a series of cystic fibrosis (CF) modulators culminating in **Trikafta** (2020), which generated >$5 B annual sales by 2024. Expanded into gene‑editing collaborations (e.g., CRISPR‑based CF work). | Public, market cap >$70 B, still primarily a CF‑focused company. |
| **Isis → Ionis Pharmaceuticals** (IPO 1994) | Rebranded to Ionis in 2015, shifted focus to antisense therapeutics. Secured FDA approvals for **Spinraza** (nusinersen, SMA, 2016) and **Tegsedi** (inotersen, hATTR amyloidosis, 2018). Partnered with Biogen, Roche, and others. Stock rallied from ~$8 in 2012 to >$150 in 2023 before settling around $120 in 2026. | Public, market cap ≈ $12 B, profitable and growing pipeline. |
| **Amylin Pharmaceuticals** (IPO 1992) | Acquired by **Bristol‑Myers Squibb** in 2012 for $5.3 B. Its GLP‑1 drug **Byetta** was sold to AstraZeneca in 2015 for $2.5 B. The remaining assets (e.g., amylin analogs) were folded into BMS’s diabetes portfolio. | No longer independent; former shareholders received cash and BMS stock. |
| **Other 1991‑94 IPOs** | Roughly half of the ~70 companies listed in that window have either been delisted, merged into larger firms, or remain tiny niche players. Notable failures include **Autoimmune Inc.** (bankrupt 2001) and **Alpha‑Beta Technology** (ceased operations 2004). | Majority are gone or exist only as dormant shell companies. |

### Broader biotech financing trends (2012‑2026)  

| Period | Market behavior | Key observations |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **2012‑2015** | Modest IPO activity; venture capital funds grew but were cautious after the 2008‑09 crash. | Companies like **Alnylam** (2014) and **Bluebird Bio** (2013) went public, but valuations were modest compared with the 1990s boom. |
| **2016‑2019** | Renewed IPO enthusiasm as gene‑editing, CAR‑T, and RNA‑based platforms attracted capital. ~30‑40 biotech IPOs per year (vs ~10‑15 in early 2010s). | **CRISPR Therapeutics** (2016), **Editas** (2016), **Moderna** (2018) – all raised >$500 M. |
| **2020‑2021** | COVID‑19 pandemic sparked a **surge** in biotech listings and SPACs; 2021 saw a record ~70 biotech IPOs (including **Gilead‑spin‑Sarepta**, **Allogene**, **Sana Biotechnology**). | Valuations inflated; many companies later saw sharp price corrections in 2022‑23. |
| **2022‑2024** | Market correction; IPO volume fell to <15 per year. Venture capital shifted to later‑stage “growth” rounds and private‑market “direct listings.” | SPAC wave collapsed; investors demanded clear path to revenue. |
| **2025‑2026** (present) | IPO market stabilizing at a modest level (~10‑12 listings per year). Companies now often **go public after a major regulatory milestone** (e.g., FDA approval) rather than pre‑revenue. | Examples: **MiroBio** (2025, after Phase III success) and **NeuroGen** (2026, after FDA fast‑track designation). |

### Outsourcing & “virtual” biotech  

- **Contract Research Organizations (CROs)** and **Contract Development & Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs)** grew >30 % CAGR from 2012‑2026, driven by the “virtual” model Booth described. Companies such as **Charles River**, **Catalent**, and **WuXi AppTec** now handle >70 % of early‑stage preclinical work for small biotechs.  
- **Platform‑centric financing** (e.g., RNAi, mRNA, gene‑editing) became common; investors fund the platform once and license it to multiple programs, reducing the need for a full‑scale internal R&D organization.

### Overall assessment of Booth’s historical claim  

- **True:** The 1991‑94 IPO cohort, on average, under‑performed broad market indices and many firms failed. The “Gilead‑type” build‑and‑sell model proved rare.  
- **Partially true:** Public markets became more selective, and the “IPO‑first” strategy fell out of favor for a decade.  
- **Incorrect/over‑stated:** The article suggested that “the ‘Let’s have an IPO!’ model won’t be on the list for some time to come.” While IPOs were scarce from ~2012‑2015, the market rebounded dramatically in 2020‑2021 and has since settled into a sustainable, albeit more disciplined, cadence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened (2022‑2026) | Verdict |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|
| **Biotech IPOs will become rare and unattractive for the foreseeable future.** | IPO volume fell sharply after 2012, hit a low in 2015‑2016, then surged in 2020‑2021, and is now modest (~10‑12 per year). The market is not “closed,” but listings are more milestone‑driven. | **Partially correct** – the market contracted, but later rebounded. |
| **Small companies will stay private longer, outsource most work, and aim for early acquisition rather than an IPO.** | The “virtual biotech” model became dominant; many start‑ups raise multiple private rounds before any public listing. Early exits (e.g., **Alnylam → Novartis partnership**, **Bluebird → Roche acquisition**) remain common. | **Correct** – the trend is evident. |
| **Only a few “Gilead‑type” companies will generate massive shareholder returns; most will under‑perform.** | Gilead, Vertex, and later **Moderna** (post‑COVID) delivered >10× returns. Most other 1991‑94 IPOs either disappeared or delivered flat/negative returns. | **Correct** – the distribution remains highly skewed. |
| **Public markets will be less tolerant of “value‑destroying” tactics, raising the bar for biotech IPOs.** | Post‑2022 investors demand clear regulatory pathways, revenue traction, or robust platform data before pricing an IPO. Companies with vague pipelines see lower valuations or stay private. | **Correct** – market discipline increased. |
| **The “Let’s have an IPO!” model won’t be on the list for some time to come.** | As noted, a brief resurgence occurred (2020‑2021) driven by pandemic‑related hype, but by 2024‑2026 the market has settled into a more cautious approach. | **Mostly correct** for the longer term, though a short‑term spike was missed. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The piece is a concise, data‑driven reflection on a pivotal era in biotech financing, linking historical performance to present‑day capital‑raising strategies. Its relevance persists because it frames why today’s biotech financing looks the way it does, even though some of its longer‑term market‑timing predictions were off‑by‑a few years.
