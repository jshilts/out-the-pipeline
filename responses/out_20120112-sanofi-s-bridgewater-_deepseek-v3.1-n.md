# Sanofi's Bridgewater Site - Closing This Week? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog reported that Sanofi's Bridgewater, New Jersey research site was accelerating its closure timeline. Originally scheduled to close by the end of 2012, the site was allegedly told that the last day would be that Friday—just days after the announcement. The article noted that Bridgewater had been subject to multiple rounds of layoffs and mentioned rumors that Allergan might be interested in acquiring the site, though no buyer was confirmed at the time of writing.

## 2. HISTORY

**Site Closure Confirmed**: Sanofi did close its Bridgewater research facility, part of a broader restructuring following its 2011 acquisition of Genzyme. The site shutdown was part of Sanofi's strategy to consolidate R&D operations and reduce costs.

**Job Impact**: The closure resulted in the elimination of approximately 400-500 research positions at the Bridgewater location. Many pharmaceutical research roles in New Jersey were being shifted or eliminated during this period as the industry underwent significant consolidation.

**Site Disposition**: The Bridgewater facility remained vacant for several years after closure. While Allergan was mentioned as a potential buyer, no acquisition materialized at that time. The site eventually found new tenants, but not as a major pharmaceutical research center.

**Broader Industry Context**: This closure occurred during a period of significant restructuring in Big Pharma, particularly affecting New Jersey's traditional role as "the medicine chest of the world." Multiple companies were downsizing or closing research facilities in the state during the 2010-2015 period, shifting R&D to other locations or outsourcing drug discovery activities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Rapid Closure Timeline**: ✓ **Confirmed**  
  The source's claim that closure would happen faster than expected (within days) appears to have been accurate, as Sanofi accelerated the shutdown timeline significantly from the original end-of-2012 target.

• **No Immediate Buyer**: ✓ **Confirmed**  
  The prediction that no buyer was immediately lined up proved correct. The site did not quickly transfer to another pharmaceutical company despite rumors about Allergan's interest.

• **Broader Industry Trend**: ✓ **Confirmed**  
  While not explicitly predicted, the article's framing of this as part of ongoing pharmaceutical industry contraction accurately reflected the wider trend of research site closures and consolidation that continued through the 2010s.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the article had timely insider information about the accelerated closure, it represents a routine corporate restructuring announcement with limited long-term scientific or broader industry significance beyond its immediate impact on affected employees.
