# More Things to Do With mRNA (January 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a BioNTech paper published in *Science* showing that mRNA technology could be applied beyond COVID-19 vaccines to treat autoimmune diseases. The research focused on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, using a liposomal mRNA formulation encoding a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) epitope (amino acids 35-55).

BioNTech developed a modified, non-immunogenic mRNA payload (using methylpseudouridine instead of uridine) delivered via lymphatic system-targeting liposomes to specifically address autoreactive T cells without suppressing overall immune function. The treatment "blocked all clinical signs of EAE in mice" and restored motor function, while also inducing "bystander tolerance" - a mechanism where regulatory T cells can dampen autoimmune responses against unknown antigens.

The author highlights the potential for personalized mRNA therapy, where individual patients' specific autoantigens could be targeted, similar to CAR-T cell approaches in cancer, and notes BioNTech's apparent plans for clinical trials. The platform's flexibility could benefit both major autoimmune diseases (MS, diabetes, lupus, arthritis) and rarer conditions with poor treatment options.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this January 2021 publication, BioNTech has indeed advanced mRNA immunology research in multiple directions:

**Autoimmune Disease Programs**: By 2022, BioNTech had disclosed clinical programs targeting autoimmune conditions using their mRNA platform. However, progress has been **cautious and iterative** rather than revolutionary. The most advanced programs focused on **mRNA cancer vaccines** rather than autoimmune applications, leveraging the company's core oncology expertise.

**Clinical Translation Challenges**: The autoimmune field faces fundamental hurdles that mRNA technology doesn't eliminate: identifying reliable autoantigens, ensuring delivery to the right immune cells, avoiding unintended immunogenicity, and demonstrating efficacy in heterogeneous patient populations. While BioNTech's preclinical EAE results were impressive, **no breakthrough autoimmune therapy has reached widespread clinical use** based on this mRNA tolerance approach as of late 2024.

**COVID-19 Vaccine Commercial Success**: BioNTech's partnership with Pfizer on the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) generated over $36 billion in revenue in 2021, providing massive resources for research expansion. This success **validated mRNA delivery and manufacturing at scale** but didn't automatically translate into autoimmune therapy breakthroughs.

**Alternative mRNA Approaches**: Moderna, BioNTech's main competitor, has also explored mRNA for autoimmune applications but similarly found **slow progress**. Both companies have emphasized **oncology** (cancer vaccines and personalized neoantigen therapies) as their primary non-COVID focus.

**Immune Tolerance Research**: The broader field of antigen-specific immune tolerance has seen **modest progress** through various approaches (nanoparticles, cell therapies, antigen modification), but no paradigm-shifting therapy has emerged. The complexity of human autoimmune diseases - with multiple antigens, genetic heterogeneity, and environmental triggers - **remains daunting**.

**Business Developments**: BioNTech has maintained a robust pipeline and expanded manufacturing capabilities. The company continues investing in **multiple therapeutic areas** including oncology, infectious diseases, and immunology, but hasn't announced major autoimmune clinical successes directly stemming from this 2021 paper's approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Testable predictions made in the article:**

• **"I hope to see it in human trials as soon as feasible"**
  - *Outcome*: BioNTech has initiated clinical programs in immunology, but progress has been **slower than hoped**. No major Phase II/III results have been reported for the specific MOG-tolerance approach described in mice.

• **Individualized therapy "similar to what's being done with CAR-T cells in cancer"**
  - *Outcome*: While **CAR-T therapies have become established cancer treatments**, personalized mRNA autoimmune therapy hasn't achieved similar success. The complexity of identifying individual autoantigens and demonstrating their causative role remains a **major barrier**. Cancer neoantigens have more straightforward validation pathways.

• **Platform enabling specificity "very welcome indeed" for effective immune therapy**
  - *Outcome*: The flexibility of mRNA manufacturing is **technically proven** (validated by rapid COVID vaccine development), but the "specific targeting" vision hasn't materialized in autoimmune applications yet. The fundamental challenge isn't manufacturing but **target identification and validation**.

• **"Application to lesser-known autoimmune diseases" with poor treatment options**
  - *Outcome*: Rare autoimmune diseases **remain underserved** with limited new therapies. No mRNA-based breakthrough has emerged to address this unmet need, though research continues.

• **"Making a serious run at this in the clinic"**
  - *Outcome*: BioNTech has pursued immunology programs, but the **commercial and clinical focus remains oncology** where the scientific rationale and business case are clearer.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses an important but realistically difficult application of mRNA technology beyond vaccines. While the science was solid and forward-looking, the limited subsequent clinical translation highlights the gap between promising preclinical results and real-world autoimmune therapy. The topic remains scientifically interesting but not transformative in practice.
