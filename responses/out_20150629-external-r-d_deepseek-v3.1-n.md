# External R&D (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses Bruce Booth's analysis of external R&D models in biopharma, focusing on alternatives to traditional partnerships and outsourcing. Key approaches include large pharma companies partnering with VC firms to launch smaller biotechs, making strategic investments with buyout rights, and creating "skunk works" groups separate from the main organization. The article highlights GSK's Tempero Pharmaceuticals experiment as a cautionary tale—despite good science, the spinout was eventually reabsorbed due to GSK's "gravitational pull" through infrastructure sharing, cost consolidation, and eventual employee reintegration.

The central tension identified is between large pharma's desire for innovation culture and their organizational inertia. Success requires true disruption rather than superficial change, and overcoming institutional mental models like excessive legal protectionism that can "suffocate" creative deals. While corporate venture capital arms benefit the broader ecosystem, Bruce Booth argues that significant scale and genuine organizational openness are essential for external innovation models to succeed. The piece concludes that most attempts are too recent (as of 2015) to evaluate returns definitively.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2015, external R&D models have evolved significantly, with mixed results validating many of the article's insights:

**Corporate Venture Capital Expansion**: Pharma CVC arms expanded substantially post-2015, with companies like Roche (with Foundation Medicine), Novartis, and Pfizer increasing strategic investments. These have indeed supported the biotech ecosystem, but direct impact on parent companies' pipelines has been debated—most successful portfolio companies pursue independent paths rather than integration.

**Biohub and Consortium Models**: Initiatives like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's research collaborations and various public-private partnerships (e.g., in Alzheimer's research) have shown modest success, though precompetitive consortia often struggle with data sharing and IP concerns.

**Platform Company Acquisitions**: Large acquisitions continued (e.g., Gilead/Kite, Novartis/AveXis, Bristol Myers/Celgene), validating that external innovation drives major pharma pipelines. However, integration challenges persist—many acquired companies lose key talent and innovation momentum.

**GSK's Continued Restructuring**: GSK underwent multiple R&D reorganizations post-2015, including forming Galvani Bioelectronics as a joint venture, suggesting ongoing tension between centralized control and external innovation independence. Several other spinouts met similar fates to Tempero, being reabsorbed or discontinued.

The fundamental challenge the article identified—corporate antibodies rejecting external innovation—remains largely unresolved. Most successful biopharma R&D still emerges from independent biotechs rather than corporate innovation labs or controlled spinouts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **External Innovation Models Would Require "Significant Scale"**: Accurate. Successful examples (like VCs partnering systematically with pharma) have indeed required substantial, sustained investment. However, many pharma companies attempted smaller pilot programs that failed to achieve critical mass.

• **"Skunk Works" Groups Risk Reabsorption**: Validated. Multiple attempts at internal innovation labs (e.g., various company "bioscience hubs") have struggled with corporate culture assimilation, with many eventually being integrated back into parent organizations or shuttered.

• **Legal/Deal Protection Mindset Would Suffocate Innovation**: Partially accurate. Pharma deal-making has become even more complex post-2015, with many pointing to risk aversion as a barrier. However, some companies (notably through CVC arms) have managed creative deal structures, suggesting this isn't insurmountable.

• **Early External Models Too Recent for Returns Assessment**: Accurate timing observation. By 2015, many models were indeed too new. In the subsequent decade, evaluation has become possible—and the results are mixed, with no single external innovation model emerging as clearly superior.

• **Corporate Mindsets Preventing Innovation**: This concern proved largely accurate. The core cultural barriers the article identified—risk aversion, integration challenges, and organizational inertia—remain central obstacles today. Success stories like Spark Therapeutics (acquired by Roche) emerged from truly independent biotech rather than controlled pharma spinouts.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides prescient analysis of the structural tensions in big pharma innovation strategies, identifying persistent challenges that remain relevant today. While focused on a specific industry niche, it captures broader organizational dynamics around innovation culture and corporate antibodies.
