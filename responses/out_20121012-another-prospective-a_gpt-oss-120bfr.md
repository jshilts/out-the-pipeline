# Another Prospective Alzheimer's Trial (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article announced the launch of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network (DIAN) trial, a multinational, prospective study that would enroll people who carry rare, autosomal‑dominant mutations (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) that guarantee the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Participants would be observed for about two years with cognitive testing and brain imaging, after which the investigators planned to randomise everyone to the “most efficacious” of three anti‑amyloid agents and continue follow‑up to see whether disease progression could be altered in a real‑world setting.  

At the time the three candidate drugs were:  

* **LY2886721** – Eli Lilly’s β‑secretase (BACE) inhibitor.  
* **Solanezumab** – Eli Lilly’s circulating‑amyloid monoclonal antibody, then controversial because earlier Phase III trials had shown no clear benefit.  
* **Gantenerumab** – Roche’s monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds fibrillar amyloid plaques.  

The author praised the “preventative” design, warned that results from a genetically‑defined cohort might not translate to sporadic Alzheimer’s, and laid out three possible outcomes: a clear preventive benefit, a decisive blow to the amyloid hypothesis, or an ambiguous “maybe” result.

## 2. HISTORY  

### DIAN‑TU (Trial Unit) outcomes  
* **2018** – The first DIAN‑TU results were published (Salloway et al., *Lancet Neurology*). Participants received either gantenerumab, solanezumab, or placebo in a double‑blind, adaptive design. Both antibodies reduced amyloid PET signal, but clinical endpoints (cognitive decline) showed only modest, non‑significant slowing, primarily in the earliest symptomatic carriers.  
* **2020‑2022** – The DIAN platform was repurposed to test newer antibodies. A Phase II trial of **lecanemab (BAN2401)** in mutation carriers showed a ~30 % reduction in clinical decline over 18 months (Miller et al., *JAMA Neurology* 2022). This trial is still ongoing, and lecanemab later received FDA approval (2023) for early sporadic Alzheimer’s.  

### Individual drug trajectories  

| Drug | Post‑2012 fate |
|------|----------------|
| **LY2886721 (Lilly BACE inhibitor)** | Discontinued in 2013 after Phase I/II trials revealed dose‑related liver enzyme elevations. No further development. |
| **Solanezumab** | Three large Phase III trials (EXPEDITION 1, 2, 3) completed 2014‑2017. The drug failed to meet primary cognitive endpoints; a modest benefit was observed only in a post‑hoc subgroup with very mild disease, which was not sufficient for FDA approval. Development for Alzheimer’s was halted in 2017. |
| **Gantenerumab** | Two Phase III studies (SCarlet RoAD, Marguerite) were stopped for futility in 2014‑2015. A later “high‑dose” open‑label extension suggested some slowing of brain atrophy, but no clear clinical benefit. Roche discontinued further Alzheimer’s programs in 2020. |
| **Crenezumab** (mentioned in the article’s side note) | Multiple Phase III trials (CREAD, CREAD‑2, CREAD‑3) failed to demonstrate efficacy; development stopped in 2019. |

### Broader impact on the amyloid hypothesis  

* The string of high‑profile failures (BACE inhibitors, solanezumab, gantenerumab, crenezumab) led many researchers to question whether amyloid removal alone could translate into meaningful clinical benefit.  
* Nevertheless, **aducanumab** (Biogen) received accelerated FDA approval in 2021 based on a surrogate amyloid‑PET endpoint, and **lecanemab** obtained full approval in 2023 after demonstrating a statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline in early Alzheimer’s (CLARITY‑AD trial). These approvals revived commercial and academic interest in amyloid‑targeted therapies, albeit with ongoing debate about clinical relevance and cost.  

### Policy and industry shifts  

* The FDA’s “accelerated approval” pathway for amyloid‑targeting antibodies was invoked for aducanumab and later clarified for lecanemab, influencing regulatory expectations for biomarker‑driven endpoints.  
* Payers (Medicare, private insurers) have been cautious, often limiting coverage to patients meeting strict criteria (early disease, confirmed amyloid positivity).  
* Venture capital and big‑pharma investment in Alzheimer’s has rebounded since 2020, with several biotech firms (e.g., Eli Lilly’s donanemab, Roche’s donanemab) advancing late‑stage trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *If nothing distinctive emerges, the amyloid hypothesis will take a major hit.*  
  **Outcome:** The hypothesis suffered a credibility crisis after 2014‑2017 due to multiple negative trials, but later data (aducanumab, lecanemab) showed that amyloid reduction can modestly slow decline, preventing a total collapse. The hypothesis is now viewed as **partially valid but insufficient alone**.

- **Prediction:** *Best result would be a clear preventive or early‑stage benefit.*  
  **Outcome:** No drug has yet demonstrated a robust, disease‑preventing effect in mutation carriers or sporadic patients. Lecanemab shows the strongest early‑stage benefit to date (≈27 % slowing of decline), but it is not a preventive cure.

- **Prediction:** *Second best would be a painful realization that amyloid is insufficient.*  
  **Outcome:** This was essentially realized after the 2014‑2017 failures; the field broadened to include tau‑targeting, neuroinflammation, and metabolic approaches.  

- **Prediction:** *A “maybe” outcome with ambiguous data would be the worst.*  
  **Outcome:** Many of the DIAN‑TU results fell into this category—clear amyloid clearance but limited clinical impact—matching the author’s “bottom‑of‑the‑barrel” scenario.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment when large, genetically‑defined prevention trials were launched, and its foresight about the stakes for the amyloid hypothesis proved prescient, even though the subsequent story turned out to be a mix of failures and modest successes.
