# More on the Mighty Mohawk Maneuver (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses Allergan's controversial 2017 strategy of transferring patent rights for its dry eye drug Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, then licensing them back. The move exploited the tribe's sovereign immunity to shield the patents from inter partes review (IPR), an administrative patent challenge process created in 2012. The article notes that state universities had previously established precedent for sovereign immunity in IPR challenges, but questions whether sovereign entities can "sell" this immunity through patent transfers. The piece highlights legal complexities surrounding sovereign immunity waivers and mentions the pending Supreme Court case *Oil States Energy Services v. Greene's Energy Group*, which challenged the constitutionality of the entire IPR system. The author observes that while the biopharma industry generally disliked IPR (which generic manufacturers favored), Allergan's tactic was widely viewed as ethically questionable.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication, Allergan's sovereign immunity strategy failed. In February 2018, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled that the tribe had waived sovereign immunity when it sought to dismiss IPR proceedings, and proceeded to invalidate key Restasis patents on obviousness grounds. The Federal Circuit affirmed this decision in 2018, establishing that tribal sovereign immunity could not be used to shield patents from IPR challenges.

The Supreme Court decided *Oil States* in April 2018, upholding the constitutionality of IPR proceedings in a 7-2 decision, resolving uncertainty about the system's future.

Subsequently, Allergan faced significant business consequences. The company lost patent protection for Restasis, enabling generic competition that substantially reduced the drug's market exclusivity and revenue. In 2019, Allergan was acquired by AbbVie in a $63 billion deal, though this acquisition faced its own challenges and was ultimately completed amid broader industry consolidation.

The "Mohawk Maneuver" became a cautionary tale in patent strategy discussions, demonstrating the limits of sovereign immunity exploitation and solidifying IPR as a permanent feature of the patent landscape.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"There's no way to take that one back; we're now an industry where people do such things"** – This prediction proved overly pessimistic. The maneuver was widely condemned and ultimately failed, with no other companies successfully replicating the strategy. Instead, it became a notorious example of failed patent gaming.

• **"Where we land on that scale is yet to be seen"** (referring to the range from "IPR disappears from existence" to "everyone sells everything to Indian tribes") – The outcome landed decisively at neither extreme. IPR was upheld as constitutional and remains active, but the tribal immunity strategy was invalidated, eliminating it as a viable tactic.

• **Implicit prediction about Allergan's strategy success** – The article maintained uncertainty about the legal viability, but the actual outcome was definitive failure: courts rejected both the sovereign immunity defense and upheld the IPR system itself.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses a significant intersection of patent law, pharmaceutical strategy, and sovereign immunity with real-world impact on drug competition and patient access. While the specific tactic failed, the underlying issues about patent challenge mechanisms and pharmaceutical intellectual property strategy remain highly relevant, and the case became an important legal precedent.
