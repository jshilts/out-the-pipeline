# Riding to the Rescue of Rhodanines (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a new paper defending rhodanines, a class of compounds that had been widely criticized in drug discovery as "polluting the scientific literature" due to their promiscuous binding behavior. While the defending paper initially sounds like a call to arms for rhodanine supporters, the author notes its conclusion actually aligns with industry concerns: rhodanines do show a tendency to bind many targets with weak affinity, making them problematic drug leads. The key point of agreement is that rhodanines require exceptionally strong requirements (nanomolar affinity, proven selectivity) to be considered legitimate candidates, rather than a blanket condemnation, while industry researchers tend to avoid them entirely due to uncertainty about what they might do in vivo.

## 2. HISTORY
The "rhodanine problem" persisted and became more recognized in medicinal chemistry throughout the 2010s. Subsequent research confirmed that rhodanines are frequent hits in high-throughput screening due to their promiscuous binding properties, and they continued to be flagged as potential Pan-Assay INterference compounds (PAINS). Studies showed that rhodanines often act as covalent modifiers and aggregators, leading to false positives in drug screens. Very few rhodanine-based compounds successfully advanced to clinical use. Notable exceptions included epalrestat (for diabetic neuropathy, used primarily in Japan) and some experimental compounds. However, the broader pharmaceutical industry largely heeded the warnings, and rhodanines remained largely avoided in drug discovery programs due to poor drug-like properties and high attrition rates. The scientific community increasingly emphasized proper validation and rigorous selectivity profiling for any screening hits, including rhodanines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about future developments in the field. Instead, it focused on describing the current state of the debate between industry skepticism and academic defense of rhodanines, and the alignment between these positions when the defending paper's conclusions were carefully examined.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

The article addresses an important but somewhat niche topic in medicinal chemistry and represents a typical cautionary tale about promiscuous compounds in drug discovery, rather than having broad long-term importance.
