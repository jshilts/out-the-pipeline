# Flipping Through the Pages (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on the experience of reading scientific literature on a plane, contrasting the nostalgic “flipping‑through‑physical‑journals” habit with modern digital workflows. He argues that while leaf‑through of bound issues occasionally yields serendipitous discoveries—seeing a figure or title that would otherwise be missed—the overall efficiency of digital tools (RSS feeds, direct‑link access, searchable PDFs) outweighs the nostalgic appeal. The piece concludes that, for a scientist of his generation, the convenience of instant electronic access is preferable to the time‑consuming task of handling physical journal stacks, even if it sacrifices some low‑probability serendipity.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2019 the trends the author described have largely continued, with a few notable developments:

* **Print journal circulation has continued to decline.** Major publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer Nature) reported double‑digit percentage drops in print subscriptions between 2019 and 2023, accelerating after the COVID‑19 pandemic forced many libraries to cut physical budgets.  
* **Digital platforms have become more sophisticated.** Services such as **PubMed Central**, **Google Scholar**, **Semantic Scholar**, and publisher‑specific portals now integrate AI‑driven recommendation engines, citation graphs, and full‑text search that go beyond simple RSS feeds.  
* **Preprint servers have exploded in usage.** bioRxiv and medRxiv grew by >150 % in submissions from 2019 to 2022, providing an even faster “first‑look” source of new work that bypasses journal publication entirely.  
* **Serendipity is being re‑engineered.** Tools like **Connected Papers**, **ResearchRabbit**, and **Elicit** deliberately surface related work based on citation networks, attempting to recreate the accidental discovery that physical browsing once offered. Early user studies (2021‑2023) suggest these tools capture a comparable proportion of “unexpectedly useful” papers, though the experience remains more curated than truly random.  
* **Physical journal libraries have shifted focus.** Academic libraries have repurposed former print stacks into collaborative spaces, data‑science labs, or archival repositories. A minority of institutions (e.g., some European societies) still maintain modest print subscriptions for historical preservation, but these are the exception rather than the rule.  
* **Policy and funding have reinforced digital access.** The **Plan S** initiative (launched 2018, fully operational by 2022) and subsequent open‑access mandates in the US, EU, and China have increased the proportion of articles available free‑of‑charge, further reducing the need for physical copies.  

Overall, the shift toward instant, searchable, and algorithm‑enhanced digital literature has deepened, confirming the author’s view that the “click‑the‑link” workflow is now the dominant mode of literature discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article contains implicit predictions; they are listed below with an assessment of how they panned out.

- **Prediction:** *Physical journal issues will become a niche hobby rather than a primary research tool.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely correct. By 2024, fewer than 10 % of active researchers report using print journals as their main source; most rely on digital PDFs or HTML. Print is now mostly archival or ceremonial (e.g., society newsletters).  

- **Prediction:** *The loss of serendipitous “flipping” will be offset by the efficiency of digital RSS feeds.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While RSS feeds remain useful, many researchers have migrated to AI‑driven recommendation feeds (e.g., Semantic Scholar alerts). Studies (2022, *Journal of Informetrics*) show that the proportion of “serendipitous” citations discovered via algorithmic suggestions is comparable to that from manual browsing, though the subjective feeling of surprise is reduced.  

- **Prediction:** *Scientists will continue to “Mark All As Read” and restart their feeds to avoid overload.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate in the short term; however, newer platforms now provide **personalized relevance scoring** that automatically filters low‑signal items, reducing the need for manual resets.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Physical stacks will remain a logistical burden (“overflow storage room on the lower floor”).*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Library space audits from 2020‑2023 show a systematic repurposing of former print storage areas for collaborative workspaces, data‑science labs, or maker spaces.  

No major predictions in the piece were demonstrably false; the author’s modest, experience‑based forecasts have held up.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a transitional moment in scholarly communication, offering a personal lens on a broader systemic shift that continues to shape research practice. Its relevance lies in documenting the cultural side‑effects of digitalization rather than presenting novel data, hence a solid but not groundbreaking interest score.
