# More Vaccine Data, in Advance of More Efficacy (November 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2020 commentary discusses two newly published Lancet papers on COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The first covers SinoVac's CoronaVac, an inactivated virus vaccine using established technology that showed mixed immunogenicity results. Phase I trials showed only 80% seroconversion with neutralizing antibodies, while Phase II improved to 95-99% after manufacturing process changes. However, antibody titers remained lower than in recovered COVID-19 patients, with no clear T-cell response evidence. The second paper examines AstraZeneca/Oxford's adenovirus vector vaccine, finding that older patients responded similarly to younger ones with good tolerability. Both vaccines were still awaiting actual efficacy data from ongoing trials in multiple countries, with expectations of results by December 2020.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent real-world outcomes diverged significantly between these two vaccines. **AstraZeneca/Oxford's vaccine** received emergency authorization in multiple countries starting December 2020-January 2021, was widely deployed globally (over 3 billion doses delivered by 2022), and demonstrated solid efficacy (~60-70% against symptomatic disease). However, it faced challenges including rare blood clot concerns, varying efficacy against emerging variants, and mixed uptake in some wealthy countries. The vaccine became a workhorse of global vaccination efforts, particularly in low- and middle-income countries through COVAX.

**SinoVac's CoronaVac** also received emergency authorization in numerous countries (China, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Chile, and others) starting mid-2021. While it proved safe and helped mitigate severe disease, its efficacy against symptomatic disease was notably lower than mRNA vaccines (around 50-70% in various studies), with particularly reduced effectiveness against later variants like Delta and Omicron. Many countries that initially relied heavily on CoronaVac transitioned to mRNA boosters, and the WHO included it in emergency use listing but with recommendations for heterologous boosting. The vaccine saw extensive use across Asia and Latin America, contributing significantly to global vaccination coverage, though with ongoing debates about its optimal role in mixed vaccination strategies.

The prediction of nearly simultaneous efficacy data materialized, with both vaccines' trial results emerging in late 2020/early 2021, providing unprecedented comparative data across different vaccine platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "The Brazilian trial... has been turbulent... suddenly halted last week on orders from Brazil's turbulent president."

**Outcome**: The Brazil trial interruptions were indeed politically contentious under the Bolsonaro administration, highlighting the intersection of public health and politics that continued to affect vaccine deployment.

• **Prediction**: "What this will do to the statistics or timeliness of the overall results is not clear."

**Outcome**: Despite political challenges, CoronaVac trials proceeded to completion, with Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey all authorizing the vaccine and publishing efficacy data in 2021.

• **Prediction**: "Those [AstraZeneca efficacy data] shouldn't be long in coming... expect to hear from both the AZ/Oxford team and J&J's single-dose trial in December."

**Outcome**: This prediction was accurate - both AZ/Oxford and J&J reported interim efficacy results in late 2020/early 2021 as expected.

• **Prediction, albeit implicit**: Neutralizing antibody levels correlating with vaccine efficacy for both platforms.

**Outcome**: This proved partially true but more nuanced - robust antibody responses strongly predicted efficacy, but lower responses like CoronaVac's still provided meaningful protection against severe disease, suggesting other immune mechanisms matter. The mRNA vaccines demonstrated higher antibody titers and superior efficacy, supporting the importance of strong immunogenicity.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in vaccine development history with prescient observations about manufacturing changes and the unprecedented nature of simultaneous multi-platform data - the dual-track coverage of an inactivated virus vaccine facing challenges and an adenovirus vector showing promise provided important context for what became two of the most widely used vaccines globally. The discussion accurately foreshadowed key issues about efficacy and manufacturing that would become central to vaccine policy.
