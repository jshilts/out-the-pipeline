# The Reasons for Failure at the FDA (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes an FDA retrospective study published in JAMA examining why new molecular entities (NMEs) were rejected between 2000-2012. During this period, 302 NMEs were submitted, with half rejected on first submission. Of those rejected, about half eventually gained approval after a median delay of over one year, resulting in an ultimate approval rate of approximately 73%.

The most common reasons for initial rejection included: dose selection uncertainties (15.9%), poorly chosen study endpoints that didn't reflect clinically meaningful effects (13.2%), inconsistent results across different endpoints (13.2%), inconsistent results across study sites or trials (11.3%), and poor efficacy compared to standard of care (13.2%). The article emphasizes that while safety concerns appeared equally distributed between eventually-approved and never-approved drugs, efficacy problems plagued 76% of never-approved drugs—nearly double the rate in delayed approvals. The author concludes that while safety issues may be addressable with time and resources, efficacy failures are typically fatal to drug development programs.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2014 article highlighted systemic issues in drug development that have remained persistent challenges in the subsequent decade. The FDA's regulatory framework and approval pathways continued to evolve, but the fundamental issues around trial design, efficacy demonstration, and appropriate endpoints remained central to regulatory decision-making.

The core findings from this 2000-2012 dataset proved prescient for understanding ongoing pharmaceutical development challenges. Between 2014-2024, the FDA maintained similar standards, and many of the identified issues—particularly around endpoint selection and dose optimization—continued to be major factors in regulatory submissions. The rise of personalized medicine and biomarker-driven development somewhat altered the landscape, but the fundamental criteria for demonstrating clinically meaningful benefit remained unchanged.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"You may be able to rescue a drug with safety concerns, given time and money, but there is likely to be no cure for poor efficacy"** ✓ **Accurate**: This prediction aligned with subsequent industry experience. Post-2014, numerous examples emerged of drugs addressing safety concerns through additional studies, risk evaluation programs, or restricted populations. However, drugs failing primary efficacy endpoints rarely recovered.

- **"Well-designed well-powered trials are invariably more expensive than most of the alternatives, but smaller companies are often running on fumes"** ✓ **Accurate**: This captured the ongoing tension in drug development. The subsequent decade saw continued struggles for smaller biotech companies balancing capital constraints with regulatory requirements, leading to many companies prioritizing better trial design despite higher upfront costs.

- **Implicit prediction that FDA standards wouldn't shift toward laissez-faire approval** ✓ **Accurate**: The FDA maintained robust efficacy requirements throughout 2014-2024, resisting pressure to approve drugs based solely on safety data without demonstrated clinical benefit.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides valuable insight into FDA regulatory patterns and decision-making criteria that remain highly relevant to pharmaceutical development. The quantified analysis of rejection reasons and ultimate approval rates offers practical guidance that has maintained its applicability for drug development strategy over the subsequent decade, making it of enduring interest to industry researchers, developers, and investors.
