# Doing the Right Thing (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary highlights an exemplary case of scientific integrity. A graduate student working with Professor Rory Waterman at the University of Vermont discovered that a key product in their published paper on iridium-catalyzed silane couplings had been mischaracterized, which invalidated significant portions of the work. Upon being informed, Waterman promptly retracted the paper with a full public explanation of what went wrong. The author praises this response as "exactly how it's supposed to work" in science, contrasting it with the "shenanigans" that often complicate the scientific literature, and hopes the student receives strong recognition for their honesty.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2015 incident, the case became a notable example in discussions of research integrity. The retraction itself was documented and discussed in academic circles and on platforms like Retraction Watch. Professor Waterman continued his career at the University of Vermont, where he maintained an active research program in organometallic chemistry and catalysis, publishing numerous papers after 2015. The incident did not appear to damage his career, and he subsequently rose to serve as Chemistry Department Chair and was named a University Distinguished Professor, suggesting the honest handling of the error was viewed positively by his institution and peers. The broader scientific community continued to grapple with retraction issues, with ongoing debates about retraction rates, reasons for retractions, and systemic approaches to self-correction in science. While this specific paper did not involve biotechnology or drug development with direct patient impact, the principles it exemplified remained relevant to biomedicine where mischaracterized results could have downstream effects on drug discovery and clinical research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article does not contain explicit predictions about future scientific developments, drug approvals, business outcomes, or policy changes. It is primarily observational commentary about a specific incident of scientific integrity rather than a forward-looking analysis. The author's main point about how the scientific process "is supposed to work" represents a statement of principle rather than a prediction about future events.

**Prediction identified**: None present in the article.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This is a brief anecdotal piece about scientific ethics with limited broader impact on biotechnology or medicine, primarily serving as commentary rather than substantive analysis of scientific developments or their real-world consequences.
