# Thanksgiving Break (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a personal Thanksgiving holiday blog post by Derek Lowe, written the day before Thanksgiving 2018. The author describes his traditional Thanksgiving cooking preparations and menu, including making turkey gravy in advance, preparing his signature chocolate pecan pie and another nontraditional dessert. He details his family's long-standing Thanksgiving traditions spanning over twenty years, with a consistent lineup of dishes including a kosher turkey cooked using a specific flipping technique, stuffing (both inside the turkey and in a separate pan using his mother-in-law's recipe with apples, cranberries, and pepperoni), brussels sprouts, green beans with country ham, creamed pearl onions, mashed potatoes, and jeweled rice (a Persian dish with saffron, nuts, and berries). The tone is personal and culinary-focused rather than scientific or biotechnological.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a cooking/recipe blog post rather than a biotechnology industry commentary article. The content discusses Thanksgiving meal preparation using traditional cooking techniques and family recipes. There are no biotech industry developments, drug approvals, clinical trials, regulatory changes, or business outcomes mentioned that could be tracked over time. The article is entirely focused on holiday food preparation with no connection to science or biotechnology topics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, scientific methods, or industry trends. The author makes no forward-looking statements about drug development, clinical outcomes, regulatory changes, or business developments in the biotech sector.
