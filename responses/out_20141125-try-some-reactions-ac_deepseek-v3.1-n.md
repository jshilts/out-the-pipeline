# Try Some Reactions. Actually, Try Them All. (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes a Merck research team's high-throughput approach to discovering Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions, particularly for complex pharmaceutical substrates. The authors reference an internal Merck study showing that 55% of metal-catalyzed C-N couplings failed on highly functionalized drug leads. The Merck team used miniaturized 1536-well plates to screen reactions in DMSO or NMP solvents, testing various bases and catalysts at scale. The system allowed them to screen 48 different reaction conditions using less than 1 mg of substrate in under 3 hours via LC/MS. This brute-force approach contrasts with Design-of-Experiments methods by sampling reaction space more granularly. The ultimate goal stated was that chemical synthesis should not limit access to molecules designed to answer biological questions.

## 2. HISTORY
High-throughput experimentation (HTE) in chemistry has seen significant adoption since 2014:

- **Industrial Adoption**: Pharmaceutical companies including Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and GSK have established robust HTE platforms. By 2022, these platforms routinely run thousands of reactions weekly for reaction screening and optimization.

- **Methodological Advances**: HTE has been applied successfully to C-N couplings, C-C couplings, asymmetric hydrogenations, photoredox catalysis, and biocatalysis. The approach of using DMSO/NMP for solubility-challenged substrates has become standard practice.

- **Technology Integration**: Automated liquid handlers (Hamilton, Tecan) coupled with plate readers and LC/MS have become widespread in industrial medicinal chemistry. Companies like Merck have scaled their toolkit from 96-well to 1536-well plates.

- **Clinical Impact**: HTE optimizations have contributed to the development of approved drugs. Examples include Merck's HIV integrase inhibitor Islatravir, and several oncology kinase inhibitors. However, HTE alone does not guarantee clinical success—many programs still fail due to toxicity or poor translational efficacy.

- **Academic Integration**: Universities like MIT, Scripps, and the University of Manchester have established HTE platforms, democratizing techniques pioneered in industry.

The "synthesis should not limit access" aspiration remains partially unfulfilled. While certain molecule classes are more accessible, complex natural products and macrocytes still pose significant synthetic challenges. However, HTE has demonstrably reduced time-to-candidate for many pharmaceutical targets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Chemical synthesis should not limit access to any molecule that is designed to answer a biological question"**: Progress toward this goal has been steady but measured. For many therapeutic areas (kinase inhibitors, protease inhibitors), synthesis is rarely the rate-limiting step post-2020. However, complex modalities like macrocyclic peptides, PROTACs, and antibody-drug conjugates still face synthetic bottlenecks. HTE has clearly reduced, but not eliminated, synthesis roadblocks.

- **Implicit prediction about miniaturization and automation**: The prediction that miniaturized, automated experiments would become valuable has been validated. HTE platforms are now fixtures at major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic adoption has grown.

- **Implicit prediction regarding reaction generality**: The idea that systematic screening could achieve "granularity in reaction condition space" has been realized. Companies now maintain databases of thousands of validated protocols, enabling rapid analog synthesis and SAR expansion, though failures still occur on particularly challenging substrates.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score**: 6 

Reasoning: This article highlighted a pragmatic solution to a pervasive industrial problem, accelerating the adoption of HTE in medicinal chemistry. It occupies an important, if not paradigm-shifting, role in modern pharmaceutical synthesis practices.
