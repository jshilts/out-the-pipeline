# Media Note (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Science magazine announced that the author would be appearing on a Marketplace public radio segment that evening to discuss cancer therapy. The author noted that the segment would feature their opinions on the topic, and made a lighthearted comment about their wife insisting that holidays weren't complete without hearing these opinions. The post served as a media notification/announcement for readers who might want to tune in to the broadcast.

## 2. HISTORY
This was simply a promotional announcement for a radio appearance, not a substantive article about biotechnology science, policy, or clinical developments. There were no new scientific claims, predictions, business developments, or research findings presented in this media note. The only "development" was that a radio broadcast occurred that evening as scheduled. No follow-up research, clinical trials, FDA approvals, business outcomes, or policy changes stemmed from this announcement itself.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No predictions were included in this media announcement.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 0**

This was a routine media notification with no scientific content, making it of minimal long-term importance to biotechnology understanding or development.
