# Alan Katritzky 1928-2014 (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is an obituary tribute to organic chemist Alan Katritzky, written by Derek Lowe for Science's "In the Pipeline" blog. The piece highlights Katritzky's immense productivity with 2,170 published papers and his reputation as "a link to another era of chemistry" having studied under Nobel laureate Sir Robert Robinson. The article emphasizes his fame for work on benzotriazole compounds and more broadly heterocyclic chemistry. It includes a personal anecdote about his vigorous lecturing style at a Gordon Conference in the early 1990s, where his booming voice prompted a humorous comment from fellow chemist Stuart McCombie about never needing a microphone again after being exposed to benzotriazole.

## 2. HISTORY

Katritzky's scientific legacy has continued to grow significantly since his 2014 passing. His benzotriazole methodology has found extensive applications in pharmaceutical and agrochemical synthesis. The heterocyclic chemistry field he helped pioneer has expanded, with benzotriazole derivatives appearing in numerous drug discovery programs and approved medications over the past decade. His 2,170+ publications have accumulated substantial citation metrics, with Google Scholar showing tens of thousands of citations posthumously. The Alan R. Katritzky Award was established in his honor, recognizing outstanding contributions to heterocyclic chemistry, with recipients including prominent researchers in the field. His textbooks, particularly "Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry," remain standard references in graduate programs worldwide. The methodology he developed for benzotriazole-based synthesis continues to be refined, with new applications appearing regularly in journals like the Journal of Organic Chemistry and Tetrahedron Letters through 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's only explicit prediction was that "there's no doubt that his name will live on" in chemistry. **This prediction has proven accurate:** Katritzky's work continues to be cited extensively, awards bear his name, and the chemical methodologies he developed remain actively used in both academic research and industrial applications more than a decade after his death. His legacy as a bridge between classical and modern organic chemistry has been solidified through continued recognition and practical application of his contributions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

While well-written and personally engaging given the author's direct experience, this article is fundamentally a brief obituary rather than a biotechnology industry analysis. It serves primarily as a tribute to a respected chemist's career rather than examining industry trends or implications that would be most relevant to the assessment framework requested.
