# The Flu Plan, Part Two: Antiviral Drugs (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article argues that reliance on antiviral drugs for pandemic influenza protection is even more problematic than relying on vaccines. The only effective drugs at the time were neuraminidase inhibitors—Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir)—which require early administration to be effective, often before patients realize they have the flu.

Prophylactic use faces two critical problems: it could accelerate development of resistant viral strains and would exhaust limited drug supplies. Production scalability is severely constrained by complex ten-step synthetic routes requiring specialized azide chemistry and, more critically, dependence on shikimic acid as a starting material. Shikimic acid primarily comes from star anise (a Chinese spice) and can also be produced by fermentation, but both sourcing and production face bottlenecks—Roche already controlled Chinese supplier networks, and fermentation requires specialized expertise.

While the author supports stockpiling these drugs, they express strong skepticism about both supply availability and actual effectiveness, creating a pessimistic outlook for pandemic preparedness.

## 2. HISTORY

**Tamiflu and Relenza Performance and Resistance:**
The 2009 H1N1 pandemic became the first major test of neuraminidase inhibitors at scale. While Tamiflu was widely deployed and did show efficacy when administered early, several issues emerged that aligned with the article's concerns. Most notably, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strains did emerge, with resistance rates varying by region and season. The H275Y mutation in particular became prevalent, reducing Tamiflu's effectiveness against some circulating strains.

Meta-analyses in subsequent years, including Cochrane Collaboration reviews, raised questions about the magnitude of Tamiflu's benefit, particularly in reducing hospitalizations and complications in otherwise healthy individuals. The drugs were shown to shorten symptom duration by approximately one day when taken within 48 hours of symptom onset, but evidence for preventing serious complications was less robust than initially hoped.

**Production and Supply:**
The star anise supply constraint proved real but manageable. Roche significantly expanded production capacity after 2005, with partnerships and new facilities coming online. The fermentation route became increasingly important, with microbial production of shikimic acid improving over time. However, during the 2009 pandemic, supply shortages did occur, validating concerns about rapid scalability.

**Regulatory and Policy Impact:**
Major countries built substantial Tamiflu stockpiles following the H5N1 avian flu concerns of 2005-2006. The US Strategic National Stockpile expanded significantly. Government purchases created the market pull the article noted was missing—transforming Tamiflu from a modest-selling antiviral into a blockbuster during pandemic preparedness spending.

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, these stockpiles were deployed, but distribution challenges and questions about optimal timing (when to release stockpiles, who should receive priority) emerged as new problems not fully anticipated in 2005.

**Continued Development:**
Research continued on alternative anti-influenza drugs with different mechanisms. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, received FDA approval in 2018, providing a new oral option with a different mechanism. Peramivir, an intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor, was approved in 2014 for emergency use and later received full approval, addressing the need for treatment in hospitalized patients who cannot take oral medications.

**Business Impact:**
Roche's Tamiflu became one of the best-selling antiviral drugs in history, generating billions in revenue during pandemic preparedness and the 2009 pandemic. This created the market incentive the article noted was previously lacking. Subsequent to the article, Gilead Sciences (which discovered oseltamivir and licensed it to Roche) benefited significantly from this increased valuation of antiviral assets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"We're in even worse shape" with antivirals than vaccines:** This proved somewhat too pessimistic. While neuraminidase inhibitors showed limitations, they were widely deployed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and likely had some positive impact. However, the emergence of resistance and questions about overall effectiveness suggested that the skeptical tone was warranted to some degree.

• **Resistance development with prophylactic use:** Correct concern. While not primarily driven by prophylactic use at population scale, resistant strains did emerge (particularly H275Y mutation in H1N1), confirming that widespread antiviral pressure would select for resistance.

• **Production bottlenecks due to shikimic acid sourcing:** This concern was validated during the 2009 pandemic ramp-up, though Roche eventually resolved most supply issues through expanded partnerships and improved fermentation processes.

• **Limited effectiveness due to delayed treatment:** This proved accurate—the critical need for very early intervention remained a limitation throughout subsequent influenza seasons and the 2009 pandemic.

• **Supply shortages:** Partially validated—there were shortages during initial pandemic response, but production eventually scaled up enough to meet expanded demand through government stockpiling.

• **Stockpiling as necessary but challenging:** This prediction was entirely correct. Governments worldwide created massive stockpiles, validating the strategy, while the sourcing challenges did indeed cause initial delays and concerns.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience about the real constraints facing neuraminidase inhibitor deployment during a pandemic. The author identified critical bottlenecks in manufacturing and supply chain that did materialize, expressed appropriate skepticism about effectiveness, and correctly predicted that stockpiling would be attempted despite serious implementation challenges. The technical understanding of production constraints and resistance mechanisms showed genuine expertise that aged well against subsequent events.
