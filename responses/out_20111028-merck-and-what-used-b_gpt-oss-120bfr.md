# Merck, And What Used to Be Schering‑Plough (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary laments the deep R&D cutbacks Merck imposed after swallowing Schering‑Plough in 2009.  The author notes that many senior scientists were let go, that the merger’s promised pipeline benefits were uneven (women’s‑health and respiratory products performed, while cardiovascular and hepatitis‑C programs lagged), and that the biggest revenue generators from the deal—Singulair (soon to lose patent protection) and Nasonex—were modest contributors.  The piece questions whether the cost‑saving rationale of the merger truly outweighed the loss of early‑stage research talent and asks if former CEO Ken Frazier’s decision to drop EPS guidance in favor of rebuilding R&D was genuine or merely “window‑dressing.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑merger integration (2010‑2014).**  
- Merck completed the Schering‑Plough acquisition in November 2009, creating a combined R&D organization of ~13 000 scientists.  By 2012 Merck had reduced headcount by roughly 1 200–1 500 positions, mainly in early‑stage discovery, while consolidating labs in New Jersey, New York and New York‑state sites.  
- The anticipated pipeline boost was modest.  **Nasonex** (mometasone furoate) and **Singulair** (montelukast) remained top‑selling respiratory products, but Singulair’s U.S. patent expired in 2012, leading to a 30 % sales drop by 2014.  **Vytorin** (ezetimibe/simvastatin) continued to generate modest revenue but never became a blockbuster.  

**Cardiovascular & hepatitis‑C programs.**  
- The cardiovascular assets (e.g., the **torcetrapib**‑type CETP inhibitor program) were terminated in 2011 after disappointing Phase III data; no new Merck‑Schering‑Plough cardiovascular drug reached market.  
- Merck’s hepatitis‑C effort, centered on a protease inhibitor (later known as **BMS‑790052** after a partnership with Bristol‑Myers Squibb) and a polymerase inhibitor, was abandoned in 2012 when competing DAAs (Sovaldi, Harvoni) entered the market.  Merck never launched an HCV drug from the Schering‑Plough pipeline.  

**Cost‑saving outcomes.**  
- The merger delivered roughly **$2 billion** of annual cost synergies by 2014, largely from overlapping manufacturing, sales, and administrative functions.  Merck’s R&D expense fell from $9.5 bn (FY 2010) to $8.2 bn (FY 2014) before climbing again after 2015.  

**Ken Frazier’s EPS strategy.**  
- Upon becoming CEO in January 2011, Frazier announced that Merck would **stop issuing forward EPS guidance** to focus on long‑term R&D.  The policy remained in place through 2013.  After the 2014 FDA approval of **Keytruda** (pembrolizumab) for melanoma, Merck reinstated EPS guidance in 2014, citing the drug’s rapid revenue growth (≈ $1 bn in 2015, > $10 bn by 2022).  

**Long‑term pipeline impact.**  
- The most consequential product emerging from the post‑merger R&D organization is **Keytruda**, a PD‑1 checkpoint inhibitor discovered in Merck’s own labs (not a Schering‑Plough asset) but accelerated by the larger, more financially stable company.  Its success helped reverse the “R&D slump” narrative and justified renewed investment in discovery.  
- Merck’s vaccine business, bolstered by Schering‑Plough’s **Merial** animal‑health unit, grew steadily; Merial was sold to Boehringer Ingelheim in 2017 for $9.5 bn, providing cash that funded later R&D.  

**Overall performance.**  
- From 2011 to 2020 Merck’s total revenue rose from $45 bn to $48 bn, with **Keytruda** becoming the top‑selling drug (≈ $14 bn in 2022).  The original Schering‑Plough respiratory products now represent < 5 % of total sales.  The merger is generally judged a **financially successful cost‑cutting move**, but **scientifically it delivered few new blockbuster drugs** directly traceable to Schering‑Plough assets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| *“Women’s health and respiratory pipelines will work out as planned.”* | **Partially true.**  Nasonex remained a solid, though not blockbuster, product; Singulair lost patent protection in 2012 and sales fell sharply.  No major new women’s‑health blockbuster emerged from the combined pipeline. |
| *“Cardiovascular and hepatitis‑C pipelines will **definitely not** work out.”* | **Accurate.**  Both programs were terminated (cardiovascular CETP inhibitor in 2011; HCV protease/polymerase projects cancelled by 2012) with no FDA approvals. |
| *“Cost reductions will bring EPS to target and the merger will look good on the balance sheet.”* | **True for cost side.**  Merck achieved ~ $2 bn annual synergies and improved EPS, but the R&D “rebuilt” narrative lagged until Keytruda’s success. |
| *“Ken Frazier’s decision to drop EPS guidance was either window‑dressing or an honest effort that may have been abandoned.”* | **Mixed.**  The guidance suspension was genuine (2011‑2013) and reflected a strategic shift.  It was later **reinstated** in 2014 after Keytruda’s market impact, so the original intent was not merely window‑dressing, but the policy changed when the company’s financial outlook improved. |
| *Implicit: “The merger will ultimately be worth it if the R&D pipeline delivers new drugs.”* | **Partially fulfilled.**  The only blockbuster directly linked to the post‑merger R&D is Keytruda, which originated in Merck’s own labs, not from Schering‑Plough assets.  Thus, the merger’s scientific payoff was limited, though the financial payoff was positive. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in big‑pharma consolidation and raises questions about R&D talent loss versus cost synergies; the subsequent history (Keytruda, EPS policy reversal, failed cardiovascular/HCV programs) makes it a useful case study for biotech strategy, though the piece itself is relatively narrow in scope.
