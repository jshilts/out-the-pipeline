# ANALYSIS OF "TODAY WE HAVE NAMING OF PARTS" (FEBRUARY 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a reflection on how chemists (and scientists more broadly) argue over nomenclature and terminology. The author uses a Chemical & Engineering News piece by Carmen Drahl as a launching point to discuss the deeper philosophical implications of how we name scientific concepts. 

The core argument is that naming conventions are not trivial—they shape how we think about scientific phenomena through "reification," the process of turning abstract concepts into concrete "things" that we can discuss. The author provides examples of problematic terminology, including the way "agonist" and "antagonist" are applied to nuclear receptor ligands (which he argues is misleading for those familiar with GPCRs), and critiques empty phrases like "taken to the next level." The piece concludes with references to Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, emphasizing the importance of being precise about what we can and cannot meaningfully discuss in science.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published on Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which has since moved from Science Magazine's network to become an independent Substack publication (still widely read in the pharmaceutical and chemistry communities). In the decade since publication, several relevant developments have occurred:

**Technical progress in chemistry:** While the fundamental tension between precise nomenclature and practical communication remains, the rise of machine learning and cheminformatics has created new nomenclature challenges. Large language models and chemical databases struggle with inconsistent naming conventions, leading to systematic efforts like the IUPAC standards updates and various attempts at automated chemical name standardization.

**Blog evolution:** Lowe's blog remains one of the most influential chemistry blogs, and he has continued to write about nomenclature issues periodically. The field has generally moved toward more systematic approaches to terminology, partly driven by computational needs.

**Philosophical discourse:** The intersection of philosophy of science and practical scientific communication has gained more attention, with discussions about "ontological commitments" in scientific terminology becoming more mainstream in STEM education.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the article got right:**
- The fundamental insight that poor nomenclature actively harms scientific thinking, not just communication, has been repeatedly validated
- The prediction that terminology fights would continue was correct—debates over terms like "biotechnology," "nanoparticles," and various computational chemistry terms have intensified
- The link between precise language and clear thinking remains as relevant as ever

**What the article missed:**
- The scale and urgency of nomenclature problems in the age of AI and big data—machine learning systems often fail because of inconsistent human terminology in training data
- The extent to which computational chemistry would force new naming conventions (like SMILES, InChI, etc.) that solve some problems while creating new ones
- The rise of "living systematic reviews" and meta-science has made terminology consistency even more critical than anticipated

**Ironically:** The article's casual dismissal of computational solutions to terminology problems seems shortsighted in hindsight, as computational approaches have become essential tools for managing chemical nomenclature.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article deserves high marks for addressing a genuinely fundamental and persistent problem in science. The insight about reification and language games in scientific discourse is philosophically sophisticated and practically important. Unlike many contemporary science blog posts that focus on specific research findings, this piece tackles the underlying structure of how science works as a human enterprise.

However, it falls short of the highest tier because:
- The connection to actual scientific progress remains somewhat abstract
- While the intellectual content is strong, the practical implications for day-to-day scientific work could be more clearly articulated
- The examples, while apt, don't quite capture the urgency and scale of nomenclature problems in the modern computational era

The article occupies an important niche—it's the kind of piece that makes scientists pause and examine their own linguistic practices, which is valuable but perhaps not transformative enough to reach the 8-9 decile.
