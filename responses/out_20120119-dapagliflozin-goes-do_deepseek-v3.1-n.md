# Dapagliflozin Goes Down (For the Last Time?) - January 2012

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on the FDA's rejection of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor being developed for type II diabetes by AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The drug works by inhibiting the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the kidneys, causing glucose to be excreted in urine rather than reabsorbed into the bloodstream. The FDA advisory panel had already voted against approval during the summer due to safety concerns, particularly a small but significant increased risk of bladder and breast cancer observed in clinical trials. With nearly a dozen advanced trials completed, the author suggests it would be difficult to provide additional safety data to change regulators' minds. The article notes that canagliflozin from J&J remains in development, and raises the question of whether dapagliflozin's safety problems are specific to that compound or represent a class-wide issue for SGLT2 inhibitors.

## 2. HISTORY
Contrary to the article's pessimistic assessment, dapagliflozin was eventually approved by the FDA in January 2014 for type 2 diabetes treatment. The manufacturers addressed the safety concerns, and the drug was approved with warnings and monitoring requirements. Rather than being the end of SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin became the first approved drug in this class in the US. Subsequently, multiple SGLT2 inhibitors were approved and achieved widespread clinical adoption, including empagliflozin (Jardiance), canagliflozin (Invokana), and ertugliflozin (Steglatro).

Surprisingly, SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated benefits far beyond glucose control. Large cardiovascular outcome trials showed that empagliflozin significantly reduced cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. This led to FDA approvals for cardiovascular risk reduction and heart failure treatment, representing a major therapeutic advance. Canagliflozin also showed cardiovascular benefits and was approved for cardiovascular disease reduction.

In subsequent years, SGLT2 inhibitors gained approval for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (including in patients without diabetes) and chronic kidney disease, becoming a cornerstone therapy for cardiorenal protection. By 2023, these drugs were widely prescribed globally, generating billions in annual revenue and representing one of the most important drug classes for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions that proved incorrect:

• **That dapagliflozin would not be approved**: The FDA actually approved the drug in 2014, just two years after this article was published.

• **That safety data could not be provided to change minds**: The manufacturers were able to provide additional safety data that satisfied regulators.

• **That dapagliflozin's problems might signal trouble for the entire SGLT2 class**: Multiple SGLT2 inhibitors were subsequently approved, and the class became highly successful.

• **Implicit suggestion that mechanism-related safety issues might exist**: SGLT2 inhibitors proved to be generally well-tolerated, with manageable safety profiles that allowed widespread clinical use.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article demonstrates how difficult it is to predict regulatory outcomes and drug class success, making it valuable for understanding pharmaceutical development volatility. The dramatic contrast between the article's pessimistic predictions and the subsequent blockbuster success of SGLT2 inhibitors provides important lessons about drug development and regulatory processes.
