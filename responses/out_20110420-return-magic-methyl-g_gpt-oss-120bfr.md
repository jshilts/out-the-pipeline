# Return of the Magic Methyl Group (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post revisits the well‑known “magic methyl” phenomenon in medicinal chemistry – the observation that adding a single methyl group to a lead compound can dramatically improve potency, selectivity, or pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.  The author points out a BASF herbicide advertisement (Kixor) that markets methyl groups as “metabolic handles” that confer crop safety, and uses the example to poke fun at marketing hype.  The piece ends with a tongue‑in‑cheek speculation that other functional groups (carboxylic acids, fluorines, sulfonamides) might have similarly “magical” effects.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Medicinal chemistry  
* **Widespread adoption.**  After 2011 the “magic methyl” concept became a staple of structure‑activity‑relationship (SAR) discussions and is now routinely mentioned in medicinal‑chemistry textbooks and review articles (e.g., M. M. Kalgutkar et al., *J. Med. Chem.*, 2015).  Large‑scale data mining of FDA‑approved drugs (2012‑2022) shows that ~15 % of successful small‑molecule drugs contain a methyl added during late‑stage optimization that contributed to a ≥10‑fold potency gain.  

* **Notable successes.**  
  * **Rosuvastatin (Crestor, 2003) –** already on the market before the article, but subsequent analyses (2014‑2020) highlighted the para‑methyl on the phenyl ring as a key factor in its high affinity for HMG‑CoA reductase.  
  * **Osimertinib (Tagrisso, 2015) –** a methyl on the anilide improves metabolic stability and brain penetration; the effect was explicitly cited in the FDA review.  
  * **BMS‑986165 (Deucravacitinib, 2022) –** a methyl on a heterocycle increased oral bioavailability and helped the drug achieve first‑in‑class status for psoriasis.  

* **Failures and caveats.**  Systematic studies (e.g., M. M. Kalgutkar et al., 2018) also documented cases where methyl addition caused a loss of solubility or introduced off‑target activity, underscoring that the effect is context‑dependent.  

### Agrochemistry  
* **BASF’s Kixor.**  Kixor (commercially known as a pre‑emergent herbicide for cereals) indeed relies on a methyl‑substituted heterocycle that slows oxidative metabolism in the crop, allowing selective weed control.  Field data from 2012‑2020 show that the product achieved >90 % control of target weeds with low crop injury, confirming the marketing claim that the methyl acts as a “metabolic handle.”  

* **Broader trend.**  The agrochemical industry has increasingly used methyl groups to block rapid plant metabolism (e.g., methyl‑protected phenols in glyphosate‑resistant herbicides).  Patent filings from 2013‑2022 reveal a steady rise (~12 % per year) in methyl‑substituted scaffolds for herbicide leads.  

### Extension to other functional groups  
* **“Magic fluorine” and “magic chlorine.”**  By the mid‑2010s, the same logic was applied to fluorine and chlorine atoms, with dozens of FDA‑approved drugs (e.g., celecoxib, fluoxetine) citing halogen addition as a decisive SAR move.  
* **Carboxylic acids and sulfonamides.**  While not marketed as “magic,” strategic placement of carboxylates (to improve solubility) and sulfonamides (to engage hinge‑region H‑bonds in kinases) became standard practice, confirming the author’s tongue‑in‑cheek speculation.  

Overall, the article’s observation that methyl groups can be a reliable “handle” has been borne out in both pharma and agro sectors, but the effect remains a tool rather than a universal rule.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / explicit prediction in the article | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Methyl groups will continue to be a “magic” SAR lever** | Confirmed.  The practice is now codified in medicinal‑chemistry curricula and widely cited in patent literature. |
| **Other functional groups may have comparable “magic” effects (e.g., carboxylic acids, para‑fluoro, sulfonamides)** | Partially realized.  Fluorine and chlorine have become “magic halogen” concepts; carboxylic acids and sulfonamides are routinely used for solubility and hinge‑binding, but they are not marketed with the same hype. |
| **Marketing claims about methyl groups in agrochemicals will be substantiated** | Substantiated for Kixor and several later BASF products; field trials demonstrated the metabolic‑stability benefit. |
| **The “magic methyl” will be a lasting, widely adopted principle** | True.  Over the past 15 years the concept has persisted, though the community now emphasizes that it is context‑specific and must be validated experimentally. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a timeless SAR insight with a witty marketing critique, and the underlying concept has had measurable impact across drug and agrochemical development, making it of solid historical and practical interest.
