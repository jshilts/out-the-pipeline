# STEM Shortages Everywhere You Look (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary article challenges the widespread claim that there is a severe shortage of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The author presents evidence contradicting the "skills shortage" narrative that industry leaders like Eli Lilly's CEO John Lechleiter had been promoting for several years.

The article points out the contradiction between claims of thousands of unfilled high-paying positions and the reality of mass layoffs in the UK pharmaceutical industry. It cites stagnant inflation-adjusted salaries for chemists over thirty years and actual wage declines for life scientists from 2008-2012 as evidence that labor demand has not been increasing. The piece highlights Roche's announcement of 1,200 job cuts across facilities in Ireland, Spain, Italy, and the US as further evidence that the hiring market was not experiencing a shortage of qualified workers.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2015 article, several significant developments occurred regarding STEM workforce dynamics:

**Continued Industry Consolidation and Layoffs**: Major pharmaceutical companies continued restructuring throughout 2016-2020. Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis, and other majors announced additional facility closures and workforce reductions globally. The industry's move toward outsourcing manufacturing and focusing on biologics rather than small molecules drove ongoing job cuts in traditional chemistry roles.

**Academic Labor Market Deterioration**: For PhD scientists in academic positions, conditions continued to worsen. Postdoctoral positions became increasingly long-term rather than transitional, with stagnant wages and limited faculty job prospects. This trend contradicts the narrative that high-level STEM training leads to abundant career opportunities.

**Salary Evidence Confirmed**: The inflation-adjusted salary stagnation cited in the article persisted. ACS salary surveys through 2019-2023 continued showing minimal real wage growth for chemists. The life sciences sector showed similar patterns, with entry-level positions particularly affected by oversupply of qualified candidates.

**Industry Shift Toward Specialized Skills**: While traditional chemistry and biology roles faced oversupply, specific areas like computational biology, data science, and AI/machine learning applications in drug discovery did show growing demand and higher salaries. However, these represented a small fraction of overall pharmaceutical industry employment.

**Immigration Policy Debates Continued**: The STEM shortage narrative continued being used in policy debates about H-1B visas and skilled immigration. However, several studies from the National Bureau of Economic Research and think tanks continued finding limited evidence of widespread shortages in most STEM fields.

**COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic created unusual demand spikes in specific areas (vaccine production, assay development, diagnostic work) but most of these were temporary. The broader structural oversupply of life sciences PhDs remained a persistent issue.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself did not make explicit forward-looking predictions. It was primarily a skeptical commentary challenging existing claims. However, the evidence presented in the article strongly suggested that:

• **Implicit Prediction**: The "STEM shortage crisis" narrative would be revealed as unsupported by labor market evidence
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate. Multiple economic analyses confirmed that outside specific high-demand niches, most STEM fields including chemistry and life sciences continued showing signs of oversupply through 2023

• **Implicit Prediction**: Industry consolidation and job cuts would continue rather than mass hiring
  - **Outcome**: Correct. Major pharmaceutical companies continued facility rationalization, outsourcing, and workforce optimization throughout 2016-2023

• **Implicit Prediction**: Salary stagnation would continue to indicate lack of genuine shortage
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Real wages remained largely stagnant for most pharmaceutical industry scientists, with notable exceptions only in highly specialized computational fields

## 4. INTEREST
**8 out of 9**

This article belongs in the top decile of interest because it correctly identified and deconstructed a widely promoted but economically unsupported narrative about STEM labor markets. The author's use of concrete salary data, job market indicators, and industry contradiction spotting demonstrated clear insight. The persistent relevance of the STEM shortage debate in policy discussions through 2023, coupled with the article's accurate analysis of the underlying economic reality, gives it long-term importance.
