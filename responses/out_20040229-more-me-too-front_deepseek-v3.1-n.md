# More From the Me-Too Front (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary responds to reader feedback on two related themes in drug development. First, it addresses how patient response heterogeneity complicates comparative clinical trials—when drugs X and Y work equally well but in different patient subgroups, head-to-head trials can wrongly conclude one is superior overall, potentially depriving patients of the therapy best suited to them. The author notes this is largely trial-and-error today but sees pharmacogenomics as the way out: it will identify who should receive which drug, shrink many drugs' target populations, and disrupt business models (especially in cancer therapy).

Second, the piece defends "me-too" drugs against critics who argue they divert resources from breakthrough cures. The author counters that me-toos fund the high-risk R&D that mostly fails, provide financial ballast through dry spells, and are a rational response to how hard it is to discover first-in-class therapies. The analysis contrasts the marketing dynamics of breakthrough drugs (likely to sell themselves) versus crowded fields (expensive promotion wars), arguing companies need both types to survive—me-toos for steady revenue and first-in-class drugs for growth and scientific impact.

## 2. HISTORY

Pharmacogenomics and biomarker-guided therapy became clinical reality far more slowly than 2004 optimism suggested. By the late 2000s–2010s, notable successes emerged but remained concentrated in specific areas. HER2 testing for trastuzumab (Herceptin) in breast cancer, EGFR and ALK testing for targeted therapies in lung cancer, and KRAS testing to guide anti-EGFR antibodies in colorectal cancer became standard practice. These did indeed segment markets, often shrinking the eligible patient population while improving outcomes for those treated. By the 2020s, broad tumor mutational profiling and NGS panels became routine in oncology, though uptake outside cancer remained limited.

However, pharmacogenomics did not "solve" the heterogeneity problem across most diseases. Warfarin dosing using CYP2C9/VKORC1 variants showed modest benefit, and adoption was inconsistent due to cost and turnaround time. Many proposed genetic associations failed replication or had small effect sizes; direct-to-consumer genetic testing (e.g., 23andMe) provided risk information but rarely actionable pharmacogenomic guidance. Even today, preemptive pharmacogenomic testing is not standard, and most prescribing remains empiric outside oncology and a few other domains.

Me-too drug waves continued and even intensified. Statins exemplified the pattern: atorvastatin (Lipitor, 1996) dominated, rosuvastatin (Crestor, 2003) entered a crowded field, and both faced generic competition starting 2011–2016. The 2010s–2020s saw similar dynamics with PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab), SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetes (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin), and PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab). Payers increasingly demanded comparative effectiveness data or substantial discounts, shifting the economics. Many me-toos achieved blockbuster status anyway, funding pipelines as predicted.

Comparative effectiveness research gained policy traction, especially after the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the formation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The FDA sometimes required head-to-head trials or active comparator studies for approval, and payers used such data for formulary decisions. Cost-effectiveness analysis (e.g., QALY calculations) became standard in many markets, influencing access and pricing.

Biotech business models evolved as predicted—toward stratified markets and targeted therapies—but the transition was gradual. Companies that successfully developed parallel diagnostics and therapeutics (e.g., in oncology or rare diseases with biomarkers) captured value but often with smaller, defined populations. Larger firms continued balancing portfolios between first-in-class assets and me-too/fast-follower programs.

Breakthrough first-in-class drugs did emerge, such as Gleevec in CML, checkpoint inhibitors in cancer, CAR-T therapies, and gene therapies (e.g., Luxturna, Zolgensma), but these remained relatively rare. Some (e.g., Viagra) saw generic entry; others maintained dominance with lifecycle management, risk evaluation, and mitigation strategies. High launch prices for first-in-class therapies drew scrutiny and payer pushback.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction 1: Pharmacogenomics would enable precise patient stratification and "whack" market sizes for many drugs.**  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. In oncology, biomarker-guided therapy became standard (e.g., HER2, EGFR, ALK, PD-L1) and did segment markets, often reducing eligible populations. However, pharmacogenomics penetrated slowly outside cancer due to limited clinical utility, cost, slow turnaround, and modest effect sizes. Adoption was more niche than transformational by the 2020s. The broader vision of preemptive pharmacogenomic panels guiding most prescribing has not yet materialized at scale.

- **Prediction 2: Business models, especially cancer therapy models, would have to change as a result.**  
  **Outcome:** Correct. Precision oncology drove a shift toward companion diagnostics, smaller targeted populations, and high prices per patient. Companies increasingly developed drugs for biomarker-defined subsets and managed smaller, more focused markets. Rare disease and niche oncology indications became attractive targets. Some firms struggled with the economics of stratified medicine, while others (e.g., Foundation Medicine, Guardant Health) built business models around testing and data.

- **Prediction 3: The world would need fewer head-to-head trials in areas where many patients respond to both drugs, but heterogeneity complicates comparisons.**  
  **Outcome:** Mixed. Comparative effectiveness research grew due to payer demands, regulatory requirements, and cost pressures. Head-to-head trials became more common (e.g., in diabetes, anticoagulants, oncology), often as post-marketing commitments or pragmatic trials. Heterogeneity still limits interpretability in many non-stratified studies, but biomarkers and subgroups are now routinely incorporated to address this. Crowded classes (statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors) saw multiple head-to-head studies but rarely definitive differentiators favoring one drug across all subgroups.

- **Prediction 4: Me-too drugs fund R&D and provide security, so companies need both breakthrough and me-too assets.**  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Industry economics continued to depend on me-too/fast-follower drugs (e.g., follow-on SGLT2s, PD-1s) to generate revenue streams, offset pipeline failures, and fund higher-risk research. Breakthrough drugs remained scarce and unpredictable, making balanced portfolios the norm. Payers and health systems increasingly challenged me-too pricing, demanding value differentiation or discounts, but me-toos still proved profitable for many manufacturers.

- **Prediction 5: Breakthrough drugs require little marketing (they "sell themselves") while me-toos need heavy promotion.**  
  **Outcome:** Overly simplistic. First-in-class breakthroughs did become major brands with strong pull (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T), but most still required substantial marketing and medical education to drive adoption, manage access, and differentiate from competitors. Viagra, the example given, continued aggressive promotion. Breakthroughs with uncertain markets or complex logistics often needed extensive commercial investment to succeed.

- **Prediction 6: Crestor illustrated questionable need for more me-too statins in an already crowded field.**  
  **Outcome:** Incorrect in practice. Crestor achieved blockbuster status, faced generic erosion, but proved clinically and commercially successful. Statins overall remained widely used, with newer entrants sometimes favored for potency, tolerability, or indications. The global statin market evolved into a mix of branded and generic options, meeting cost and access needs. Whether the "world needed" Crestor became moot—prescribers, patients, and payers used it.


## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This commentary identified durable trends (pharmacogenomics, stratified medicine, me-too economics) that shaped the next two decades, albeit slower and more selectively than predicted. The discussion of comparative trials and heterogeneity remains highly relevant. While narrower in scope than a broad industry forecast, it captured key R&D and market-access dynamics that still matter today.
