# Allow Me to Peruse Your Grant (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the practice of academic scientists using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to access other researchers' successful grant applications. Based on a BuzzFeed News analysis, the piece reveals that while FOIA requests had previously been associated with activist groups targeting controversial research areas like climate science and animal experimentation, the majority of grant proposal requests at NIH and NSF actually came from within academia itself.

Between 2015-2016, nearly 30% of NIH grant FOIA requests originated from other academic institutions, while at NSF that proportion reached 50%. The motivations varied: some requests came from university offices seeking model applications to help train faculty for better funding success, while others likely came from competing labs wanting to understand what their peers were pursuing. The article notes that many researchers were surprised to learn their funded grant applications were subject to public disclosure with minimal redaction protection, as these became federal government documents once approved. The ethical dimensions are complex—while using applications as educational models seems acceptable, using them for competitive intelligence creates tension, though legally these are public records accessible to any citizen.

## 2. HISTORY

The practice of FOIA requests for grant applications has continued and evolved since 2017, though specific comprehensive statistics on usage patterns remain limited. Several developments have occurred:

**Continued Legal Precedent**: The legal framework established before 2017 has remained largely intact. Funded NIH and NSF grants continue to be subject to FOIA as public documents, with limited exemptions available primarily for genuine trade secrets or national security concerns. The "personal privacy" exemption does not apply to academic research grants.

**Institutional Responses**: Many universities and research institutions have become more proactive in educating their faculty about FOIA disclosure requirements. Some institutions now explicitly warn grant applicants that successful applications may become publicly accessible, reducing the "surprise" element mentioned in the original article.

**Transparency Initiatives**: NIH has expanded its own transparency efforts through databases like the NIH RePORTER system, which provides public access to abstracts and basic information about funded grants. While not as detailed as full applications, these tools serve some of the same educational purposes that FOIA requests were being used for.

**Competitive Intelligence Concerns**: The tension between transparency and research competition has persisted. While no major scandals or policy changes have emerged specifically from FOIA-related competitive issues, the fundamental concern remains that scientists can legally access details of competitors' planned research directions before publications or patents appear.

**Technology and Process Improvements**: Government agencies have streamlined FOIA processing to varying degrees, though response times and processing efficiency continue to be challenges across federal agencies, including scientific funding bodies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not make explicit predictions about future developments. However, it raised several implicit questions and concerns that can be evaluated:

- **Implicit expectation that awareness would grow**: ✓ This has occurred. The research community is generally more aware today that funded grants are public documents subject to FOIA requests.

- **Concern about competitive intelligence proliferation**: → No major policy interventions have addressed this concern. The practice continues within existing legal frameworks, but has not emerged as a major controversy requiring congressional or agency-level policy changes.

- **Hope for more direct sharing practices**: → This has seen mixed results. Some researchers and institutions have embraced more open sharing of successful grant applications, particularly for educational purposes, but FOIA requests remain necessary when direct requests are denied or ignored.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an important but niche aspect of academic research culture and transparency policies. While the topic affects researchers and institutions directly involved in grant funding, it lacks the broader societal significance or scientific breakthrough implications that would merit higher interest ratings, and the issue has not evolved into a major policy debate or reform movement since publication.
