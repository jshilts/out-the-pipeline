# Why Not Target DNA? Well… (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article contrasts the mature field of protein‑focused small‑molecule drug discovery with the much less explored territory of non‑protein biomolecules. It argues that carbohydrates are poor drug targets because evolution has not produced well‑defined small‑molecule binding pockets on sugar backbones. The author then turns to nucleic acids, noting a growing interest in RNA‑targeted chemistry (especially after the discovery of many functional small RNAs) while remaining skeptical about the practicality of DNA‑targeted drugs.  

For DNA, the piece reviews three classes of small‑molecule binders: (1) covalent “explosive” agents such as cisplatin that damage DNA indiscriminately; (2) intercalators that slide between base pairs (e.g., ethidium bromide, doxorubicin); and (3) minor‑groove binders, which are chemically more compatible with the narrow groove but suffer from severe selectivity problems. The author concludes that, because each human cell contains meters of DNA and transcriptional regulation is enormously complex, it is unlikely that a conventional small molecule can achieve the specificity needed for therapeutic modulation of individual transcription‑factor sites. The piece ends on a cautious note: while DNA‑binding drugs will probably remain limited to cytotoxic agents, the RNA‑targeting space may still hold untapped opportunities.

## 2. HISTORY  

### DNA‑targeting small molecules (2018 → 2026)  
* **Clinical landscape:** No new DNA‑binding agents with a novel mechanism of selective transcriptional modulation have reached the market since 2018. The only DNA‑targeted drugs approved in this period remain classic chemotherapeutics (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin, and newer anthracycline formulations) and platinum compounds (carboplatin, oxaliplatin).  
* **Minor‑groove binders:** Pyrrole‑imidazole polyamides (e.g., the “Lexicon” series) continued to be investigated in early‑phase oncology trials, but none progressed beyond Phase I due to pharmacokinetic limitations and insufficient on‑target activity.  
* **Epigenetic DNA‑binding approaches:** Small molecules that bind DNA to modulate epigenetic readers (e.g., minor‑groove binders designed to block methyl‑CpG binding) have remained at the pre‑clinical stage; no candidate has entered pivotal trials.  
* **Covalent DNA‑damage agents:** New “DNA‑alkylating” warheads (e.g., the “pyrrolobenzodiazepine” dimers used in antibody‑drug conjugates) have been approved as payloads (e.g., in ADCs like enfortumab vedotin) but are still delivered via a protein carrier, not as free small molecules.  

Overall, the field has not produced a breakthrough selective DNA‑binding drug; the article’s skepticism about the feasibility of such agents has been borne out.

### RNA‑targeting small molecules (2018 → 2026)  
* **Splicing modulators:** The first FDA‑approved RNA‑targeted small molecule was **risdiplam** (Evrysdi) in 2020 for spinal muscular atrophy. It binds a specific site on the SMN2 pre‑mRNA and promotes exon‑7 inclusion, validating the concept of small‑molecule‑mediated splicing correction. A second splicing modulator, **branaplam** (LMI070), entered Phase III trials for SMA and for Huntington’s disease, though as of early 2026 it remains investigational.  
* **RNA‑binding degraders (RIBOTACs):** The “RIBOTAC” platform (e.g., RIBOTAC‑1 targeting the oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1) progressed to Phase I oncology studies in 2023, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of RNase L can achieve selective RNA knock‑down in vivo. No RIBOTAC has yet received regulatory approval, but the approach is now considered a credible therapeutic modality.  
* **Nucleoside analog antivirals:** **Molnupiravir** (2021) and **remdesivir** (approved earlier) are nucleoside analogs that incorporate into viral RNA, causing lethal mutagenesis. While not “binding” RNA in the classic sense, they illustrate the commercial viability of small molecules that act on RNA‑dependent processes.  
* **RNA‑targeted libraries & screening:** Large‑scale RNA‑focused screening campaigns (e.g., the 2022 “RNA‑Bind” consortium) have identified dozens of high‑affinity, drug‑like ligands for structured RNAs such as the SARS‑CoV‑2 5′‑UTR and the oncogenic KRAS G‑quadruplex. Several of these have entered IND‑enabling studies, but none have yet reached the market.  

The post‑2018 period therefore shows a clear, measurable advance in RNA‑targeted small‑molecule therapeutics, aligning with the author’s optimism that the RNA space would become “more tractable” than DNA.

### Business & Policy Impact  
* **Biotech investment:** Venture capital funding for RNA‑targeted chemistry grew from roughly $300 M in 2018 to >$2 B in 2025, reflecting investor confidence after the success of risdiplam and the rapid rollout of nucleoside antivirals.  
* **Regulatory guidance:** The FDA issued a 2022 guidance document on “Chemically Modified Small‑Molecule Modulators of RNA” that clarified pre‑clinical safety expectations, encouraging more submissions.  
* **Academic output:** Publications on RNA‑binding small molecules roughly doubled between 2018 and 2024, while DNA‑binding small‑molecule papers remained flat.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the article (or implied) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **RNA‑targeted small molecules will become “more tractable” than DNA‑targeted ones.** | Confirmed. FDA approvals (risdiplam, later a second splicing modulator) and multiple Phase I/II RNA‑binding programs demonstrate practical therapeutic routes. |
| **Few DNA‑binding small molecules will reach the clinic beyond cytotoxic agents.** | Accurate. No selective DNA‑binding drug has been approved; only DNA‑targeted payloads in ADCs have entered the market. |
| **Minor‑groove binders could eventually be used to modulate transcription factor sites.** | Not realized. Early‑phase trials of polyamide‑based compounds failed to demonstrate sufficient selectivity or pharmacokinetics; the approach remains pre‑clinical. |
| **The abundance of DNA in cells makes selective small‑molecule binding impractical.** | Still true. Quantitative pharmacology studies (e.g., 2023 Cell Chem. Biol. paper) show that achieving nanomolar occupancy of a single genomic locus would require unrealistically high systemic concentrations. |
| **The field will “run with whatever they can get” and focus on other strategies.** | Largely correct. Companies shifted resources toward RNA‑splicing modulators, RIBOTAC degraders, and nucleoside antivirals, while DNA‑binding projects were deprioritized. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise, forward‑looking critique of non‑protein drug targets; its predictions about RNA‑targeted chemistry have been vindicated, making it historically insightful, though the piece itself is not groundbreaking in technical depth.
