# An Inspirational Quote from Bernard Munos (19 Aug 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2013 post highlighted a quote from Bernard Munos in response to an FDA-focused discussion. Munos argued that innovation requires chaos, not law and order, and that true innovators are rebels who want to "obliterate and replace" existing markets rather than optimize them. He described disruptors as "tough to manage" but essential, and lamented that process-minded CEOs had purged such individuals from pharma, contributing to what he deemed an "innovation crisis."

The article's author expressed enthusiasm for this perspective, hoping it reflected reality.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years after 2013, these key developments affected pharma innovation dynamics:

- The biotech market grew substantially. Global biotech crop area reached 190.4 million hectares by 2019, and gene therapies gained significant traction.

- Disruptive approaches became more institutionalized. CAR-T cell therapies (Kymriah approved 2017, Yescarta approved 2017) completely changed cancer treatment paradigms by engineering patients' own immune cells. CRISPR gene editing moved from laboratory tool to clinical reality, with therapies like Casgevy (approved late 2023 for sickle cell disease) and treatments for hereditary angioedema reaching approval.

- Major shifts occurred in business models. Companies like Moderna and BioNTech successfully pioneered mRNA vaccine technology, leading to billions of doses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This represented precisely the kind of market displacement Munos described.

- However, the "big pharma" consolidation and efficiency focus that Munos criticized continued. Pharmaceutical companies still relied heavily on acquiring smaller biotech firms rather than fostering internal disruption, and R&D productivity challenges persisted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The piece offered no concrete predictions about specific products, companies, or market outcomes. It presented a philosophical viewpoint about innovation culture without forecasting particular technological breakthroughs, business successes, or policy changes. The commentary focused on organizational dynamics rather than market predictions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the quote captures a compelling idea about corporate culture, as a standalone item it lacks substantive industry analysis or predictive content that would make it historically significant for biotechnology.
