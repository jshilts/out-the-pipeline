# Rewiring Plankton. And Reality. (Oct 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a skeptical commentary on a 2018 Y Combinator “request for a startup” that proposed engineering marine phytoplankton to boost oceanic carbon sequestration. The author contrasts the “Silicon‑Valley‑style” belief that any biological system can be programmed like software with the reality of current synthetic‑biology capabilities. The proposal envisions two routes: (1) fertilizing the ocean with missing minerals (e.g., iron) or (2) redesigning phytoplankton so they no longer need those minerals, even suggesting that metallo‑enzymes could be replaced or eliminated. The article argues that such ideas are far beyond present technology, that the chemistry of metal centers is not easily bypassed, and that releasing genetically‑modified microbes into the open ocean raises ecological and regulatory concerns. The author concludes that the vision reflects a “digital fundamentalism” that overestimates what can be engineered today.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Research & development (2018‑2026).**  
- **Synthetic biology of marine microbes.**  Academic labs have continued to develop genetic tools for model cyanobacteria (e.g., *Synechococcus* sp. PCC 7942, *Prochlorococcus* spp.) and for the diatom *Phaeodactylum tricornutum*. These tools now allow modest metabolic rewiring (e.g., over‑expressing carbon‑fixation enzymes, introducing pathways for bio‑fuel precursors). No work has produced the kind of “megastructures” or mineral‑independent metabolism described in the proposal.  
- **Metal‑independent enzymes.**  The few natural examples cited (e.g., *Borrelia* using Mn instead of Fe) remain niche. Engineering a broad‑spectrum replacement for iron‑dependent enzymes in phytoplankton has not been demonstrated; attempts to substitute Fe‑sulfur clusters with synthetic cofactors have stayed in vitro.  
- **Ocean fertilization trials.**  Small‑scale iron‑addition experiments continued (e.g., the LOHAFEX, SEEDS, and several NOAA‑funded studies). Results consistently showed transient phytoplankton blooms with limited carbon export to the deep ocean and raised concerns about nutrient imbalances and unintended ecological effects. No commercial or regulatory‑approved program has been launched.  
- **Regulatory landscape.**  The 2010 UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) moratorium on “geoengineering activities that may affect marine biodiversity” was reaffirmed in 2022, explicitly covering the release of genetically engineered marine organisms. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued guidance that any field trial of engineered phytoplankton would require an extensive environmental‑impact assessment and an inter‑agency permit; no such permit has been granted to date.  
- **Business activity.**  No startup has emerged from the 2018 Y Combinator call that has secured funding or advanced to field trials. Venture capital in “blue‑carbon” has instead focused on nature‑based solutions (e.g., mangrove restoration, sea‑grass cultivation) and on carbon‑capture hardware. Companies that once marketed “marine carbon‑sequestration” services (e.g., CarbonCure’s ocean‑based projects) have either pivoted or shut down after failing to demonstrate measurable, verifiable sequestration.  
- **Policy & public perception.**  Public and scientific backlash against “marine geoengineering” intensified after the 2021 “Ocean Algae” controversy, where a private firm announced a plan to seed the Pacific with engineered algae. The plan was withdrawn following petitions and a congressional hearing. This episode reinforced the regulatory caution that the 2018 article warned about.  

**Bottom line:** From 2018 to early 2026, the field has made incremental progress in genetic manipulation of model phytoplankton, but none of the grand visions—large‑scale engineered carbon sinks, mineral‑independent metabolism, or ocean‑wide release of synthetic microbes—have materialized. The idea remains speculative and is not close to commercial or policy implementation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied in the article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Engineered phytoplankton could be programmed like a Turing‑machine to build “megstructures” that pull nutrients from the seafloor.** | No such engineering has been achieved; current synthetic‑biology tools only allow modest pathway insertion. | Not realized; still far beyond capability. |
| **It would be possible to eliminate the need for iron (or other metals) in phytoplankton enzymes, creating metal‑free metabolism.** | Research on metal substitution remains confined to a few laboratory enzymes; no organism has been engineered to grow without iron in seawater. | Unfulfilled; the chemistry of metallo‑enzymes remains indispensable. |
| **Releasing genetically engineered phytoplankton into the open ocean would be feasible and socially acceptable after modeling.** | Regulatory moratoria (CBD, NOAA) and strong public opposition have prevented any field release; no modeling study has led to approval. | Not realized; regulatory and societal barriers persist. |
| **Ocean fertilization (adding missing minerals) could be scaled up to turn the entire ocean into a powerful carbon sink.** | Small pilot studies showed limited carbon export; scaling up has not occurred due to ecological risk and lack of verifiable sequestration. | Over‑optimistic; no large‑scale deployment. |
| **A startup would emerge from the Y Combinator call and attract venture funding to pursue these ideas.** | No such company has been founded or funded; venture capital in marine carbon removal has focused elsewhere. | Unmet. |

Overall, the article’s implied predictions have not come true; the field’s progress has been modest and constrained by technical, ecological, and regulatory realities.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10**  
The article is an engaging critique of techno‑optimism, but its subject matter has not led to concrete scientific or commercial breakthroughs, limiting its long‑term relevance.
