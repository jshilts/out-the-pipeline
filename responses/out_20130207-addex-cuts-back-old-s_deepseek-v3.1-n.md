# Addex Cuts Back: An Old Story, Told Again (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Addex Therapeutics, a company focused on developing allosteric modulators as drugs—compounds that target regulatory sites separate from a protein's main active site. At the time of publication, Addex announced it was narrowing its focus to a few clinical programs targeting orphan diseases in major markets, while cutting back on early-stage discovery efforts to preserve cash. The author contextualizes this as a common survival strategy in small biopharma, where companies facing financial pressure often jettison discovery research to advance their most promising clinical candidates in hopes of securing additional funding or partnerships. The piece suggests this "hatches battened down" approach is frequently "the beginning of the end" due to the high failure rates in clinical development—when survival depends on immediate clinical success, the odds are not favorable.

## 2. HISTORY
Looking at subsequent developments, Addex's story largely followed the cautionary trajectory outlined in the article. The company continued to face significant challenges with its allosteric modulator programs:

**Clinical Program Outcomes:**
- **Dipraglurant (for Parkinson's levodopa-induced dyskinesia)**: Addex's lead program failed to meet primary endpoints in a Phase IIb study in 2016. The compound showed insufficient efficacy, dealing a major blow to the company's prospects.
- **ADX48621 (for epilepsy)**: Development was discontinued.
- **ADX71149 (for schizophrenia, in partnership with Johnson & Johnson)**: J&J returned rights to Addex in 2014, effectively ending the partnership.

**Financial and Corporate Trajectory:**
The promised "non-dilutive partnerships" and licensing deals never materialized at the scale needed. Addex underwent multiple restructuring efforts and continued to struggle financially. In July 2020, the company entered into a merger agreement with fellow Swiss biotech IncreBrain, effectively a merger of two struggling companies rather than a successful turnaround. By September 2020, Addex delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange. The company has since continued as a much smaller entity, with its shares trading on less liquid markets.

**Broader Industry Context:**
While Addex struggled, the broader field of allosteric modulation did see some successes. Several companies eventually brought allosteric modulators to market, including:
- G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) modulators
- Allosteric kinase inhibitors
- Various regulatory site-targeting drugs

However, these successes generally came from larger, better-capitalized companies with more diversified portfolios, not from companies that had narrowed their focus to just one or two clinical candidates under financial pressure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Prediction: "In the majority of these cases, I'd say that this turns out to be the beginning of the end."**
• **Outcome**: **Accurate**. This prediction proved prescient for Addex. Within three years, their lead clinical compound failed in Phase IIb, and the company never recovered to its previous valuation or operational scale.

**Prediction: "The failure rates in the clinic see to that - if you have to have your compounds work there, the very next ones you have, the only things you have on hand in order to survive, then the odds are not with you."**
• **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Addex's survival depended on dipraglurant succeeding in clinical trials, and when it failed, the company had insufficient backup options and discovery pipeline to pivot to, ultimately leading to its decline.

**Prediction: "We can advance this compound in the clinic, enough to try to get more money from someone, or we can continue to do discovery research. But not both. Not now."**
• **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Addex's choice to focus solely on clinical programs while cutting discovery proved unsustainable when clinical failures occurred.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**
This article demonstrates strong insight into biotech business dynamics and the risks of putting all resources into single clinical programs, with predictions that proved accurate for Addex's trajectory and broader lessons applicable across the industry.
