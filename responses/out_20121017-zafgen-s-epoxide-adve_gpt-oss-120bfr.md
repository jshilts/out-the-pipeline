# Zafgen's Epoxide Adventure (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article introduced Zafgen, a Boston‑area biotech, and its lead obesity candidate **beloranib** (formerly ZGN‑433). Beloranib was described as a “novel” small‑molecule inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidase‑2 (MetAP2), originally thought to work by blocking angiogenesis in adipose tissue. Subsequent pre‑clinical work suggested the weight‑loss effect stemmed instead from altered fatty‑acid metabolism. Chemically, beloranib is a **fumagillin‑derived epoxide**, a covalent electrophile that reacts with a histidine in MetAP2. The author used the compound to illustrate a broader resurgence of covalent drugs, noting both the potential for high potency/long residence time and the risks of off‑target reactivity or immunogenicity. No mechanistic data on beloranib were published at the time, but the piece argued that epoxides can be selective enough to be viable drugs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development**  
- **Phase I (2012)** showed acceptable safety and dose‑dependent weight loss in obese women.  
- **Phase II (2014‑2015)** in obese subjects and in a separate trial for **Prader‑Willi syndrome (PWS)** demonstrated robust weight loss (≈10 % of body weight) and improvements in appetite.  
- **Safety signals** emerged: several participants experienced serious cardiovascular events, and two deaths occurred in the PWS trial (one from myocardial infarction, another from pulmonary embolism).  

**Program termination**  
- In **July 2016**, Zafgen announced an **immediate halt** to beloranib development, citing the adverse events and an unfavorable risk‑benefit profile. The company withdrew the drug from all ongoing studies and never filed an NDA.  

**Company trajectory**  
- After the beloranib setback, Zafgen shifted focus to **ZGN‑106**, a MetAP2 inhibitor aimed at non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). That program also failed to achieve meaningful efficacy in early trials and was discontinued.  
- In **2020**, Zafgen was acquired by a private‑equity firm and re‑branded as **Zafgen Therapeutics**, but it has not reported any late‑stage candidates since the beloranib failure.  

**Broader impact on covalent drug space**  
- The article’s optimism about covalent drugs proved prescient. Since 2012, **several covalent small‑molecule inhibitors have received FDA approval**, including ibrutinib (2013), osimertinib (2015), sotorasib (2021), and many others. The field has matured with improved electrophile design (e.g., acrylamides) and proteome‑wide selectivity profiling, reducing the safety concerns that plagued early covalent agents like beloranib.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Beloranib would become a first‑in‑class weight‑loss drug** (based on its novel mechanism and strong pre‑clinical/early‑clinical weight loss) | The drug showed impressive weight loss in Phase II but was **terminated in 2016** due to serious cardiovascular toxicity; it never reached market. |
| **MetAP2 inhibition would be a viable therapeutic strategy for obesity** | While MetAP2 inhibition can induce weight loss, the safety profile proved unacceptable for chronic obesity treatment; no other MetAP2‑targeting obesity drugs have been approved. |
| **Epoxide‑containing covalent drugs could be safe and selective enough for clinical use** | Covalent drugs have indeed become mainstream, but **epoxides remain rare** in approved medicines because of inherent reactivity concerns; most successful covalent agents use less reactive warheads (acrylamides, chloroacetamides). |
| **Covalent drug renaissance would accelerate** (citing Celgene’s Avila acquisition) | Correct: the covalent modality has expanded dramatically, with dozens of covalent candidates entering the clinic and several approvals, confirming the predicted trend. |
| **Zafgen would emerge as a leader in covalent‑drug chemistry** | The company’s lead covalent candidate failed; Zafgen did not become a major player in the space. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is historically interesting because it captured an early, high‑profile attempt to bring a covalent MetAP2 inhibitor to market and foreshadowed both the promise of covalent drugs and the safety challenges that can derail such programs. Its relevance has been reinforced by the later rise of covalent therapeutics, even though the specific drug discussed never succeeded.
