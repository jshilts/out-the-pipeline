# Big Trouble For Zafgen and Beloranib (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Zafgen's crisis following a second patient death in the Phase III clinical trial of beloranib for Prader-Willi syndrome. One patient had previously died in October 2015, and the second death in December created what the author described as an "existential threat" to both the drug program and the company. The article notes concerns about Zafgen's disclosure practices and highlights the inherent unpredictability of drug development, where "nothing is for sure in an investigational drug program" until clinical trials are complete. The author had been following beloranib due to its unusual molecular structure and viewed this development as an instructive example of how drug programs can fail even at late stages.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the December 2015 events, Zafgen's troubles continued to mount:

**Clinical Development Outcomes:**
- In December 2015, Zafgen announced it was pausing enrollment in the beloranib Phase III trial due to the two patient deaths
- The FDA placed beloranib on clinical hold in January 2016, effectively halting all trials of the drug
- Zafgen discontinued development of beloranib in March 2016 after determining the risk-benefit profile was unfavorable

**Company Impact:**
- Zafgen's stock price fell dramatically, losing approximately 80% of its value from pre-crisis levels
- The company laid off approximately 34% of its workforce in March 2016 as part of restructuring
- Zafgen shifted its focus to developing another compound, ZGN-1061, targeting the same methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) pathway as beloranib
- In 2019, Zafgen changed its name to Larimar Therapeutics and pivoted its strategy entirely away from metabolic disorders

**Regulatory and Clinical Context:**
- Beloranib's mechanism (MetAP2 inhibition) showed promise for weight loss but ultimately proved too toxic for clinical use
- No drugs targeting the MetAP2 pathway have been FDA-approved to date
- Prader-Willi syndrome remains a condition with limited treatment options, though other approaches have been explored

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Explicit Predictions in Article:**
• **"This could be it for beloranib"** - **CORRECT**: Development was indeed discontinued in March 2016
• **"This could be it for Zafgen"** - **PARTIALLY CORRECT**: The company survived but required major restructuring, layoffs, and eventually rebranded completely as Larimar Therapeutics
• **"Nothing is for sure in an investigational drug program"** - **EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED**: Beloranib showed promise through Phase II but failed catastrophically in Phase III

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article captures a pivotal moment in drug development that illustrates the fragility of late-stage clinical programs and shows how unexpected safety issues can derail even promising candidates after substantial investment. The case became a cautionary example of risk management in pharmaceutical development.
