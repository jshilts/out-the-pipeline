# Sanofi Pays to Get Back Into Oncology (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Sanofi's $1.8 billion partnership with Regeneron to re-enter immuno-oncology after previously scaling back its internal oncology R&D efforts. The deal included a $640 million upfront payment, $750 million toward proof-of-concept costs, shared development of the PD-1 inhibitor REGN2810 (half of $650 million), and a $325 million sales milestone bonus. The author presents two perspectives: either Sanofi was too late to the competitive immuno-oncology field, or there was still room for meaningful innovation in this complex area. The move highlighted Sanofi's recognition that their internal R&D had fallen short, leading them to pay a premium to catch up through external partnership rather than building capabilities organically.

## 2. HISTORY

**REG N2810 Development and Approval:**
The PD-1 inhibitor REGN2810 progressed through development and was approved by the FDA in September 2018 under the brand name Libtayo (cemiplimab) for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This represented the first FDA approval specifically for this indication. Subsequently, Libtayo received additional approvals including for basal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer.

**Commercial Performance:**
Libtayo achieved blockbuster status, generating approximately $758 million in global sales in 2022. While strong, this placed it behind market leaders Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab) in the competitive checkpoint inhibitor market.

**Sanofi-Regeneron Partnership Evolution:**
The 2015 immuno-oncology deal became part of a broader, extensive collaboration between Sanofi and Regeneron spanning multiple therapeutic areas including immunology and cardiovascular disease. The partnership proved financially successful for both companies, though Sanofi ultimately exited certain aspects of their joint ventures in later years as they restructured their portfolio.

**Sanofi's Oncology Strategy:**
Following this deal, Sanofi made additional oncology acquisitions and partnerships, but eventually restructured its approach again in the late 2010s and early 2020s, divesting some assets while acquiring others to focus on specific areas like immune-mediated diseases and rare cancers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Late to the party" concern**: The article questioned whether Sanofi was too late to enter the competitive immuno-oncology space. **Outcome**: The concern was partially valid - while Libtayo achieved approval and blockbuster sales, market leaders Keytruda and Opdivo had already established strong market positions, limiting Libtayo's ability to achieve market leadership status despite being clinically effective.

• **"Wide field with surprises left" possibility**: The author suggested there might still be room for innovation and surprises in immuno-oncology. **Outcome**: Accurate - the field continued evolving with new combinations, biomarkers, and indications emerging. However, the fundamental mechanism of PD-1 inhibition remained broadly similar across competitors, limiting dramatic differentiation opportunities.

• **Implicit concern about relying on "getting lucky"**: The article noted Sanofi's strategy depended partly on luck. **Outcome**: The partnership did achieve success, suggesting this was a strategic decision rather than just hope. However, Sanofi's need to continuously restructure their broader oncology portfolio indicates ongoing challenges in building sustainable competitive advantages in this space.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal strategic moment for a major pharmaceutical company making a multi-billion dollar bet to re-enter a competitive field, and the partnership resulted in an approved blockbuster drug that validated aspects of the strategy while revealing the challenges of late market entry.
