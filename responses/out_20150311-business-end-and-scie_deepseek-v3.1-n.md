# The Business End and the Science End (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary contrasts the scientific progress in biotechnology—especially oncology—with the business struggles facing established pharmaceutical companies. The author celebrates oncology as potentially reaching a historic turning point, with eye-opening results emerging from clinical trials involving both small molecules and biologics, plus dramatic progress in immune-based therapies attracting significant investment. While acknowledging the scientific momentum and abundant opportunities across therapeutic areas, the author describes an "ugly period" for large pharmaceutical businesses struggling with legacy commitments, high overhead, and business models that may no longer be viable. The piece characterizes the industry as caught between scientific opportunity and business disruption, with the established companies facing existential challenges to their traditional operational structures.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2015 article has seen both the oncology revolution the author anticipated and the continued business model disruptions they described.

**Oncology Breakthroughs Validated:**
The immune-based therapies mentioned in the article, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, became blockbuster treatments. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Keytruda, Opdivo) and CTLA-4 inhibitors (Yervoy) achieved FDA approval and widespread clinical adoption. CAR-T cell therapy also emerged as an approved treatment for certain blood cancers. These immunotherapies fundamentally changed cancer treatment paradigms and generated tens of billions in revenue, justifying the investment attraction the author noted.

**Drug Development Outcomes:**
Small molecule advances continued with targeted therapies like EGFR, ALK, and PARP inhibitors gaining approval and improving patient outcomes, though challenges with resistance and patient selection persisted. Combination therapies, which the author mentioned were "just barely starting," became central to treatment protocols.

**Business Model Evolution:**
The "clanging noises" the author described intensified. Major pharmaceutical companies engaged in extensive restructuring, mergers, and portfolio optimization. Companies like Pfizer, Merck, and others focused heavily on oncology, often through acquisitions of smaller biotechs developing the immunotherapies and targeted treatments the article highlighted. The traditional R&D-heavy pharma model continued transforming toward more collaborative, external innovation approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

* **Prediction: "This could be the era when people, decades from now, will say that the corner was turned" in oncology.**
  - **Outcome: Largely accurate.** The 2015-2024 period indeed became recognized as a transformative era in cancer treatment. Immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and combination approaches fundamentally changed survival expectations for many cancers. The corner was indeed turned, though full transformation remains ongoing rather than complete.

* **Prediction: Existing large pharmaceutical business models were facing existential challenges and might not continue in their present form.**
  - **Outcome: Accurate.** Companies like Merck, Pfizer, and others underwent significant restructuring. Portfolio optimization, external innovation strategies, and M&A activity accelerated. Traditional integrated pharmaceutical company models evolved toward more distributed R&D and external collaboration approaches, though the largest companies still exist.

* **Prediction: Immune-based therapies, attracting dramatic investment money, would show substantial real progress.**
  - **Outcome: Exceeded expectations.** Immuno-oncology became one of the most important therapeutic categories, with multiple drug classes gaining approval and demonstrating remarkable efficacy across various cancers. The investment attraction proved justified by clinical and commercial outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article captured a critical inflection point in both biotechnology science and business with exceptional prescience, correctly identifying oncology's transformation and the business model disruptions that followed.
