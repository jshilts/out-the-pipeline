# Things I Won't Work With: Dioxygen Difluoride (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary article about dioxygen difluoride (FOOF), an extremely dangerous and unstable chemical compound. The article describes how FOOF is prepared by passing a mixture of oxygen and fluorine through a 700°C heating block, creating a substance that is only stable at cryogenic temperatures (around 90 Kelvin or -180°C). 

The piece focuses heavily on a 1962 paper by A.G. Streng of Temple University, who systematically tested FOOF's reactivity with various substances. The experiments showed that FOOF reacts violently with almost everything, including instant explosions with ethyl alcohol, methane, ammonia, water ice, chlorine, red phosphorus, and other compounds at extremely low temperatures. The article notes that while some work with FOOF has been done at Los Alamos for preparing plutonium and neptunium hexafluoride (national security applications), the compound appears to have no practical uses. The author also points out the absurdity of a chemical supplier (Hangzhou Sage Chemical Company) allegedly offering FOOF in kilogram quantities, which would be practically impossible and dangerous.

## 2. HISTORY

**Research Developments:**
After 2010, research on dioxygen difluoride has remained extremely limited, consistent with the article's characterization of it as a rarely-used compound. The few publications that mention FOOF are primarily theoretical/computational studies rather than experimental work.

**Commercial Availability:**
As of 2024, Hangzhou Sage Chemical Company (the supplier mentioned in the article) still lists dioxygen difluoride in their catalog, though this appears to be a catalog entry rather than actual stock. Other chemical suppliers occasionally list FOOF but typically require synthesis. The claim of kilogram quantities remains questionable and unrealistic given the compound's extreme instability.

**Continuing Niche Applications:**
FOOF continues to be used in very limited specialized contexts, primarily in nuclear chemistry research at national laboratories for preparing high-valence actinide fluorides. However, these applications remain highly specialized and do not represent broad scientific or industrial adoption.

**Regulatory and Safety Status:**
No significant regulatory changes specific to FOOF occurred. The compound remains classified under general hazardous materials regulations. It has not been involved in any major industrial accidents or security incidents post-2010, largely because almost no one works with it outside highly controlled laboratory settings.

**Scientific Community Reception:**
The article became one of the most popular posts in Derek Lowe's "Things I Won't Work With" series, cementing FOOF's reputation in chemistry folklore as the epitome of dangerously reactive compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article implicitly predicted that FOOF would remain a laboratory curiosity with no practical applications.
  **Outcome**: ✅ **CORRECT**. FOOF has not found any commercial, industrial, or widespread research applications in the 14 years since publication.

• **Prediction**: The suggestion that the listed commercial supplier (Hangzhou Sage Chemical) offering kilogram quantities was fraudulent or impossible.
  **Outcome**: ✅ **LIKELY CORRECT**. Despite still being listed in catalogs, there's no evidence that kilogram quantities of FOOF have ever been commercially supplied or safely stored. The impracticality remains self-evident.

• **Prediction**: Implicit prediction that most sulfur chemistry of FOOF would remain unexplored due to explosive risks.
  **Outcome**: ✅ **CORRECT**. No significant additional research into sulfur-FOOF chemistry has been published, with the field remaining as dangerous and unexplored as in 2010.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While entertaining and well-written, this article focuses on a chemical oddity with negligible practical importance. The high reactivity of fluorine compounds is well-established, and FOOF represents an extreme example without broader scientific or industrial significance. The piece is more notable for its engaging style than for illuminating important scientific developments.
