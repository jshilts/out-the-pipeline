# Oliver Sacks on Turning Back to Chemistry (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and author, wrote a self-elegy in the New York Times after being diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer. The article reflects on his childhood coping mechanism of turning to "nonhuman" things like numbers and the periodic table during times of loss and stress. Sacks described how, facing his own mortality, he found himself returning to metals and minerals as "emblems of eternity" — things that exist beyond human lifespans and concerns.

The piece references his memoir "Uncle Tungsten" and includes his reflection that in the physical sciences "there is no life, but also no death." The blog post author (likely from the "In the Pipeline" chemistry blog) relates to this sentiment, discussing how people either find the physical sciences beautiful and timeless or sterile and uninteresting, and shares Stanley Kubrick's quote about the universe being indifferent rather than hostile — something the author finds appealing about the nonhuman world.

## 2. HISTORY

Oliver Sacks died approximately one month after this article was published, on August 30, 2015. His death was widely reported and mourned in the scientific and literary communities. 

Following his death, several of his works saw renewed attention. His final book, "On the Move: A Life," had been published in April 2015, just a few months before his death. In February 2016, his posthumous work "The River of Consciousness" was announced, containing essays he had been working on in his final years.

Sacks' public announcement of his cancer diagnosis and his reflective writing about mortality became part of his legacy. The manner in which he faced death — with intellectual curiosity, acceptance, and continued writing — was widely discussed and admired. His New York Times piece became one of his most-remembered recent writings.

The prediction about his limited time proved accurate: metastatic liver cancer typically has a poor prognosis, and he died weeks after publication. There were no medical interventions or treatments mentioned in the article that could be evaluated for success or failure, as the piece was philosophical rather than medical in nature.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about his remaining lifespan**: The article discussed death as "an all-too-close, not-to-be-denied presence" with the understanding that metastatic liver cancer has "an extremely poor survival rate." **Outcome**: Sacks died on August 30, 2015, approximately 5 weeks after the article was published on July 27, 2015. The prediction about limited time remaining was accurate.

• **Philosophical prediction about the solace of the nonhuman**: Sacks predicted that returning to chemistry and the physical sciences would provide comfort and perspective. **Outcome**: This was a personal and philosophical statement rather than a testable empirical prediction. He continued writing and reflecting until his death, suggesting he did maintain engagement with the nonhuman world he described.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article is primarily interesting as a final testament from a significant public intellectual reflecting on science, mortality, and finding meaning — it gained additional poignancy when he died just weeks later. The piece captures the intersection of scientific thinking and human emotion.
