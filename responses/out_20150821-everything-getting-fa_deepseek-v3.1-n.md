# Is Everything Getting Fatter? (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article discusses a surprising Royal Society paper that examined body weight trends across 24 populations of animals (12 datasets separated by males/females) representing eight mammalian species living in industrialized societies. The researchers found that all 24 populations showed positive trends toward increasing body weight over several decades prior to 2015, with a statistical probability of this occurring by chance of approximately 1.2 × 10^-7.

The animals studied included primates and rodents in research colonies, feral rodents, and domestic dogs and cats. The authors excluded datasets that might have obvious confounds (end-of-life weights, animals selected for weight traits, calorically restricted groups, and toxin-exposed animals). Yet even after these exclusions, the consistent upward trend remained robust across all populations.

The article notes this challenges conventional explanations for the human obesity epidemic, since factors like vending machines, sedentary lifestyles, and poor nutrition education don't apply to lab animals on controlled diets or feral rats. The author speculates that if there's a single underlying cause spanning all these populations, it might involve endocrine-disrupting environmental contaminants, epigenetic signaling pathways, or even infectious agents—factors that had previously been considered less plausible than diet and exercise explanations.

## 2. HISTORY

The original 2011 Royal Society paper by Klimentidis et al. examining animal weight trends from 1948-2005 has become a frequently cited but controversial piece in obesity research. In the years since both that paper and this 2015 commentary, several developments have occurred:

**Scientific Developments:**
- Subsequent studies have attempted to replicate and extend these findings, with mixed results. Some research has confirmed similar trends in additional animal populations, while other analyses have questioned the methodology or interpretation, suggesting that selective breeding, changing husbandry practices, or other confounds might explain some of the patterns.

- The microbiome-obesity connection has become a major research area since 2015, with studies showing gut microbiota composition affects weight regulation and that modern environments (including antibiotics, processed foods, and reduced microbial diversity) might contribute to weight gain across species.

- Research into endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has expanded substantially. Studies have increasingly linked compounds like bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, and certain pesticides to metabolic disruption and weight gain in both animals and humans, providing potential mechanistic support for some of the author's speculation.

**Clinical/Practical Impact:**
- No environmental contaminant has been definitively identified as the primary driver of obesity trends, though numerous candidates remain under investigation.

- The role of epigenetics in obesity has become increasingly recognized, with studies demonstrating how factors like paternal/maternal diet, stress, and environmental exposures can influence offspring weight regulation through epigenetic mechanisms.

- Animal models remain crucial for obesity research, but there's been greater recognition of how standard laboratory conditions (including diet composition, housing, and microbiome status) themselves influence metabolic outcomes and complicate cross-study comparisons.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2011 study underlying this article contained analytical rather than predictive content, while this 2015 commentary speculated about potential explanations without explicit timeline predictions. The broader implications that could be drawn:

• **Environmental endocrine disruptors as major obesity drivers**: Research has expanded significantly in this area, with mounting evidence that EDCs can disrupt metabolic function. However, these compounds haven't been established as the primary driver of population-level obesity trends, and their relative contribution versus dietary, activity, and other factors remains actively debated and incompletely quantified.

• **Infectious agents contributing to obesity**: While certain pathogens (like adenovirus-36) have been associated with increased adiposity in some studies, infectious agents haven't been shown to explain the widespread, sustained weight trends observed across diverse populations.

• **Role of epigenetic mechanisms**: This has proven prescient—epigenetic research has blossomed since 2015, with substantial evidence that environmental factors can induce transgenerational metabolic changes through epigenetic modifications. These mechanisms are now considered important contributors to obesity risk, though their precise population-level impact remains an active research question.

• **Need for more research on animals with minimal human contact**: This has remained challenging to address systematically, though some studies have examined wildlife populations with varying human interaction levels, contributing to ongoing debates about the relative roles of diet composition, activity patterns, environmental chemicals, and other factors.

• **Methodological concerns about confounds**: This has remained highly relevant. Subsequent researchers have continued to debate whether factors like changing husbandry practices, selective breeding trends, evolving pathogen exposure, or other confounds might explain some of the observed patterns in certain populations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a genuinely puzzling phenomenon that cuts across species and challenges conventional obesity explanations. It raises important questions about potential environmental factors affecting weight regulation, and it points toward research directions (endocrine disruptors, epigenetics, microbiome) that have indeed grown significantly since 2015. While no smoking gun has emerged, the questions raised remain scientifically relevant and the phenomenon itself—if real and not fully explained by confounds—represents an important biological mystery with public health implications.
