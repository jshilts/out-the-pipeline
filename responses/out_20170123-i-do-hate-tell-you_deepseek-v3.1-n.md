# I Do Hate To Tell You This, But. . . (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses the high failure rate of drugs in clinical trials, drawing from an FDA report and emphasizing that around 90% of compounds entering clinical trials never reach approval, with nearly 40% still failing even in Phase III. The author argues that these failures stem not from excessive regulation but from fundamental gaps in biological understanding, contrasting drug development uncertainty with the relatively predictable outcomes in other industries like software or manufacturing.

Two prominent examples from 2013 illustrate the point: bitopertin (a glycine reuptake inhibitor for schizophrenia) showed promise in Phase II with 320 patients but failed in Phase III with 1,800 patients over a year; and darapladib (an Lp-PLA2 inhibitor for atherosclerosis) performed well in Phase II but showed no benefit in large Phase III trials involving 15,000 and 13,000 patients respectively, despite making biological sense and altering blood chemistry as predicted. The author contends that dismantling regulatory frameworks would expose more patients to ineffective or harmful compounds, making rigorous clinical trials both scientifically necessary and ethically imperative.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments generally reinforced the article's core arguments, with continued high attrition rates persisting through the late 2010s and early 2020s. FDA data shows that Phase III failure rates remained substantial and costly, though specific trends varied by therapeutic area.

**Neither bitopertin nor darapladib achieved FDA approval** or clinical success. Both compounds effectively remained failed programs, though bitopertin saw limited continued research in niche applications without successful commercialization. Darapladib's failure contributed to declining interest in the Lp-PLA2 pathway as a therapeutic target, with no blockbuster drugs emerging from this mechanism.

**FDA regulations strengthened rather than relaxed** in the years following 2017. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) implementation continued with modest reforms but did not fundamentally alter the clinical trial paradigm. Breakthrough Therapy designation and accelerated approval pathways expanded but maintained rigorous evidence standards, rejecting proposals for deregulation that would have bypassed robust trial requirements.

**Industry trends showed continued innovation in trial design** with adaptive trials, basket trials, and platform trials gaining adoption, yet these did not dramatically reduce failure rates. Pharma companies increasingly invested in biomarkers, patient stratification, and precision medicine approaches to improve odds, but uncertainties remained substantial.

Drug prices and access became more contentious during the Trump administration and beyond, with multiple legislative proposals, yet the fundamental requirement for adequate and well-controlled trials as the basis for approval remained unchanged. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated both the potential for accelerated development when evidence is compelling (Operation Warp Speed) and also reinforced the importance of rigorous evaluation when multiple vaccines and treatments underwent standard scrutiny despite political pressure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions and arguments about future outcomes:

- **Prediction**: That deregulation or "freeing up" the system would lead to patients paying for ineffective drugs and worse outcomes.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Proposals for substantial deregulation did not gain traction, and the FDA maintained robust evidence requirements. The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) and ongoing debates continued to center on access and cost rather than reducing evidentiary standards for approval.

- **Prediction**: That high clinical failure rates would persist due to biological complexity.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Industry data from 2017-2024 continued showing approximately 90% failure rates from first-in-human to approval, with Phase III failure rates remaining substantial. Total drug development costs rose to over $2.8 billion per approved drug by some 2023 estimates, reflecting persistent hurdles.

- **Prediction**: That current expensive, time-consuming trials would remain necessary and ethically required.
  - **Outcome**: **Mostly accurate**. While adaptive designs and real-world evidence gained regulatory acceptance for certain contexts, the fundamental requirement for randomized controlled trials as the gold standard persisted across therapeutic areas. No major therapeutic category saw standard requirements reduced in ways that would substantially increase patient risk exposure to unproven treatments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article articulated enduring structural realities of drug development that remained highly relevant through subsequent years. The validation of its core arguments by continued high failure rates and persistent regulatory requirements, combined with accurate warnings against deregulation, made its insights both prescient and important for ongoing policy discussions.
