# Holiday Recipe: Banana Bread (December 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is not a biotechnology commentary at all—it is a cooking recipe for banana bread published in a "Recipes" category of what appears to be a science blog. The author provides detailed instructions for making banana bread, including ingredients (shortening/butter, sugar, egg, lemon/lime juice, flour, baking soda, salt, and mashed bananas), step-by-step preparation method, baking temperatures and times, and suggested variations such as adding nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips. The article emphasizes techniques for quick breads, such as avoiding over-mixing to prevent gluten formation.

## 2. HISTORY
Since this is a cooking recipe rather than biotechnology content, there are no subsequent developments in drug approvals, clinical trials, scientific method adoption, or business outcomes to report. The banana bread recipe remains a standard home baking formula. The blog appears to have used this post to organize their recipe collection into a new category page, but no biotechnology industry impact followed from this particular article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
