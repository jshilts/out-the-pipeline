# Place Your Bets (December 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses European Union opposition to genetically engineered crops, focusing on a new strain of cold-tolerant rice that contains bacterial genes. Though Europe grows little rice, the author argues the EU's stance matters because poorer trading partners—such as African nations—avoid adopting GM crops out of fear of European market retaliation. The piece cites Zambia's rejection of US grain over GM concerns and notes Denmark's effort to allow small, strictly controlled amounts of inadvertently mixed GM grain. The author frames Europe's resistance as "fears of Franken-rice" and questions whether the EU will "come back to its senses" by the time the innovation is released to the public domain.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2002, the EU maintained a restrictive, precaution-based regulatory regime for genetically modified crops. Key developments include:

- **Regulatory framework**: The EU continued to require pre-market authorization under Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) 1829/2003. Approval is slow and politically contentious, with decisions often deadlocked in committees.
- **Approval outcomes**: Very few GM crops received cultivation approval; those that did (e.g., MON 810 maize) faced member-state bans and legal challenges. Most authorizations were for import and processing (primarily GM soybean and maize for animal feed), not cultivation.
- **Cultivation decline**: The small area of GM maize in Spain gradually shrank over time; no major expansion to other crops or countries occurred. No GM rice reached commercial cultivation in the EU.
- **Trade and developing-country impacts**: Many African nations remained hesitant to adopt GM crops due to EU market access concerns. High-profile cases included Zambia's 2002 refusal of GM maize aid; several countries later adopted GM cotton, but staple-food GM adoption was limited by stringent EU traceability and labeling requirements that raised export risks.
- **Global contrast**: While the EU stayed restrictive, GM adoption widened globally—especially in the Americas and parts of Asia—dominated by herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant traits in major commodity crops (soy, maize, cotton, canola). Cold-tolerant rice of the type hinted in the article did not become commercially dominant.
- **Public sentiment**: European skepticism persisted, leading to near-market bans, mandatory labeling, and coexistence rules that effectively discouraged GM cultivation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **European acceptance of the bacterial-gene rice/innovation**: The article asks whether Europe will "nervously sidle away" or "come slightly back to their senses" by the time the "livesaving innovation is released."  
  - **Outcome**: Europe did not broadly accept GM crops, nor did the described cold-tolerant bacterial-gene rice with purported lifesaving potential enter widespread cultivation. The EU system remained highly restrictive through the late 2000s and 2010s.  
- **Trade effects on poor countries' willingness to use GM food**: The author suggests, via the Zambia example, that if Europe relaxes GM rules, more African nations might feel safe to accept GM food aid and adopt GM crops.  
  - **Outcome**: The EU did not substantially relax its import rules. African adoption of GM food crops proceeded very slowly, constrained by stringent EU traceability and labeling policies and by public hesitancy. GM cotton saw adoption in some countries (e.g., Burkina Faso, South Africa), but major food staples were adopted more cautiously.  
- **"Franken-rice" framing as exaggerated fear**: The author implies the EU's fears are unscientific and the rice is beneficial.  
  - **Outcome**: The GM rice described did not materialize as a widely deployed "livesaving" product, and European regulatory skepticism remained entrenched. Broader GM crop adoption globally focused on agronomic traits (herbicide tolerance, insect resistance) rather than stress tolerances like cold.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures a durable clash between precautionary regulation in Europe and technology adoption, and it correctly identifies how EU policy affects developing-country choices. However, it overstates the near-term prospects for both EU acceptance and the specific innovation discussed.
