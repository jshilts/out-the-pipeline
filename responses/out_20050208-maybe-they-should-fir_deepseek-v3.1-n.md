# Maybe They Should Fire Them All? (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques Pfizer's business model based on two simultaneous news items in early 2005: the company's stock rising due to positive clinical trial results for a stomach cancer drug (acquired through the purchase of Sugen), and reports that Pfizer might cut 10,000 sales jobs—roughly 30% of their sales force. The author questions whether layoffs signal underlying weakness rather than strength, noting that Pfizer's pattern of acquiring drugs rather than developing them internally, combined with looming challenges including FDA hearings on COX-2 inhibitors (Celebrex), slowing sales of Neurontin and Viagra, and the approaching patent expiration of Lipitor, raised fundamental questions about the company's long-term strategy and sustainability.

## 2. HISTORY
**Pfizer's subsequent challenges unfolded largely as the article anticipated:**

- **Lipitor patent cliff (2011)**: Pfizer's blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor, which once generated $13 billion annually, lost patent protection in November 2011, resulting in a dramatic revenue decline that the company struggled to offset.
  
- **COX-2 inhibitor crisis deepened**: The FDA hearings mentioned in the article occurred as scheduled, and the COX-2 inhibitor class (including Celebrex) faced severe restrictions and market decline throughout 2005 and beyond due to cardiovascular safety concerns.

- **Continued acquisition-driven strategy**: Pfizer maintained its pattern of large acquisitions, notably acquiring Wyeth in 2009 for $68 billion, Pharmacia in 2003, and subsequently Hospira, Anacor, and Medivation, confirming the article's observation about external dependency for pipeline drugs. These acquisitions produced mixed results and integration challenges.

- **R&D productivity concerns persisted**: Between 2000-2010, Pfizer's R&D spending doubled while the number of new drug approvals per billion dollars spent declined significantly, leading to major R&D restructuring in 2011 with site closures and layoffs, validating the article's skepticism about internal innovation capacity.

- **Sales force cuts materialized**: The rumored 10,000 job cuts became part of broader restructuring efforts throughout the late 2000s, with Pfizer reducing its workforce from approximately 100,000 in 2005 to around 78,000 by 2010, reflecting the fundamental challenges the article identified.

- **Continued pipeline struggles**: Despite massive R&D investment, Pfizer faced numerous late-stage clinical trial failures in the following decade, particularly in Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease areas, further highlighting the R&D productivity issues the article indirectly identified.

- **Stock performance**: While the market initially rewarded the cost-cutting mentioned in the article, Pfizer's stock underperformed relative to peers and the broader market in the decade following 2005, trading relatively flat through 2015 despite overall market growth.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**The article's implicit predictions proved remarkably prescient:**

- **Pfizer's inability to "make this work" without fundamental changes**: The article questioned whether Pfizer could sustain its model given the patent cliff and internal challenges. Reality: Pfizer struggled significantly throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s, with revenue declining or remaining stagnant from 2010-2015 while facing multiple pipeline setbacks and continued dependence on acquisitions.

- **Sales force cuts signaling deeper problems rather than efficiency gains**: The market initially rewarded the layoff news, but the article suggested this reflected underlying weakness. Reality: The cuts preceded continued struggles with revenue growth and market share, with multiple subsequent rounds of restructuring indicating persistent fundamental issues rather than one-time efficiency improvements.

- **Celebrex facing regulatory and market headwinds**: The article highlighted the FDA hearings as a significant risk. Reality: Celebrx sales declined substantially throughout 2005 and beyond, with the drug receiving black box warnings and facing substantial market contraction due to cardiovascular safety concerns.

- **Acquisition strategy as symptom rather than solution**: The article noted Pfizer's dependency pattern on buying companies rather than developing drugs internally. Reality: This pattern continued and intensified, with large acquisitions (Wyeth, Hospira) producing mixed results and ongoing R&D productivity challenges, suggesting acquisitions were addressing symptoms rather than solving root causes.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 8/10**

The article demonstrates remarkable prescience in identifying fundamental structural problems at large pharma companies that would unfold over the subsequent decade, making it an important case study in pharmaceutical industry analysis and business model sustainability.
