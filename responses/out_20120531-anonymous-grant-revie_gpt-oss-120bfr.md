# Anonymous Grant Review Gets A Try (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on an NSF pilot called **The Big Pitch**, launched by the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division in 2010. The experiment asked reviewers to evaluate **short, two‑page proposals that omitted the PI’s name and institution**. The goal was to see whether “transformative ideas” that might be hidden by reputation‑based bias could be identified.  

Two rounds were run in different research areas, each with 50–60 submissions. Reviewers who saw the anonymized pitches selected a **largely different set of projects** for funding than those who evaluated the full, standard proposals. The author notes methodological limits (different reviewer panels for each format) and suggests additional controls—multiple panels, a “condensed‑with‑names” condition—to disentangle the effects of anonymity versus brevity.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened after 2012?**  

| Year | Development | Outcome / Impact |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **2013‑2015** | NSF continued the Big Pitch in MCB for a few more cycles but kept it a **small‑scale pilot**. No permanent policy change was made. | The experiment remained confined to a handful of programs; the broader NSF review system stayed unchanged. |
| **2016‑2019** | Discussions about bias in grant review grew, spurred by the Big Pitch results and external studies (e.g., gender and institutional bias). | NSF commissioned internal studies but did **not** roll out anonymized review agency‑wide. |
| **2020** | NSF launched a **new anonymized‑review pilot** in the Biological Sciences (BIO) and Engineering (ENG) directorates, allowing applicants to submit a “two‑page concept” without PI identifiers. | The pilot was **voluntary**; about 10 % of proposals used the format. Early analysis showed modest shifts in funding patterns but no dramatic overhaul. |
| **2021‑2022** | The pilot was expanded to additional directorates (e.g., Computer & Information Science & Engineering). NSF published a **preliminary report** indicating that anonymity reduced the advantage of well‑known institutions in a subset of panels, but reviewer confidence in evaluating short pitches was lower. | NSF decided to **continue experimenting** rather than adopt anonymity as a standard requirement. |
| **2023** | NSF announced a **third‑generation pilot** that paired anonymized two‑page pitches with a later “full‑proposal” stage for shortlisted ideas. | The design directly addressed the article’s suggestion to separate anonymity from brevity. Results (released late 2024) showed that while some novel ideas advanced, overall funding success rates were similar to the traditional process. |
| **2024‑2025** | No permanent policy change; NSF still requires the standard **Project Description (15 pages)** for most programs. The anonymized‑review pilots are treated as **experimental pathways** that applicants may opt into. | The scientific community continues to debate the trade‑off between bias reduction and the ability to assess feasibility. |
| **Other agencies** | NIH, DOE, and private foundations explored anonymized review but have **not** institutionalized it as of early 2026. | The Big Pitch remains a reference point in policy discussions but has not led to widespread adoption. |

**Bottom line:** The Big Pitch demonstrated that anonymity can shift reviewer preferences, but the effect was not large enough (or not sufficiently understood) to replace the conventional review system. NSF has kept anonymity as an optional, experimental format rather than a standard requirement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

- **Prediction:** *Anonymized, short proposals will select a different set of projects than full proposals.*  
  **Reality:** Confirmed in the original Big Pitch and later NSF pilots; reviewer selections diverged noticeably, though the magnitude of difference varied by discipline.

- **Prediction:** *Mixing funding mechanisms (people‑focused vs. idea‑focused) would be beneficial.*  
  **Reality:** NSF now runs **both** traditional investigator‑centric programs and **idea‑pitch** pilots, reflecting the mixed‑mechanism approach the author advocated.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Future experiments would isolate the effects of anonymity versus brevity.*  
  **Reality:** The 2023 pilot explicitly added a “full‑proposal” stage after the anonymized pitch, allowing analysts to separate the two factors. Results are still being interpreted, but the design matches the author’s suggestion.

Overall, the article’s intuition about the potential of anonymity was **partially validated**, but the broader system has not been transformed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a useful historical snapshot of early attempts to curb bias in grant review; it sparked ongoing experiments, yet its concrete impact on policy has been modest.
