# Worst Biotech CEO of the Year Time (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Science Magazine's blog announces that Adam Feuerstein has opened nominations for the annual "Worst Biotech CEO of the Year" award. The author notes that while readers might assume Martin Shkreli would easily win due to his recent notoriety, Shkreli is actually not going to win that year according to the poll. The post encourages readers to vote in the poll, mentioning that there's an early deserving leader in the voting, but doesn't reveal who that leader is. It also references that nominations for "Best Biotech CEO" are available as well, though those are "never quite as entertaining."

## 2. HISTORY
The December 2015 article was referencing ongoing controversy surrounding Martin Shkreli, who had gained infamy in September 2015 after his company Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired the drug Daraprim and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill. However, Shkreli's legal troubles intensified significantly after this article was published. In December 2015, the same month as this article, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI on securities fraud charges related to his former hedge fund and previous pharmaceutical company Retrophin. He was convicted in August 2017 on three counts of securities fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison in March 2018. Meanwhile, the practice of annual "Worst Biotech CEO" recognition by Adam Feuerstein (then at TheStreet, later at STAT News) continued as a fixture in biotech industry commentary.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction that Shkreli wouldn't win Worst Biotech CEO in 2015**: This appears to have been accurate based on the poll referenced, though the actual 2015 winner isn't clearly documented in publicly available records.
• **Implication that Shkreli was the most notorious biotech CEO at the time**: While historically accurate for late 2015, his infamy would only grow in subsequent years through his conviction and continued controversial behavior.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

This article has limited long-term importance as it was essentially a brief, ephemeral blog post about an annual industry poll. While it references the Martin Shkreli controversy at its peak moment, the post itself contains minimal substantive content and was quickly superseded by subsequent developments in Shkreli's legal saga.
