# My Compound Goes Where the Wild Goose Goes (December 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This December 2008 blog post describes a common and frustrating experience among synthetic chemists: chasing literature references that ultimately lead to archaic, uninformative procedures. The author recounts how a modern compound search typically cascades from recent papers (2002 Tetrahedron Letters, 1995 Tetrahedron, 1984 Journal of Organic Chemistry) to a 1932 Chemische Berichte paper, with multiple contemporary papers citing old references rather than reporting their own synthetic details. The core complaint is that modern chemists who remake these compounds use updated techniques (chromatography for purification and NMR for characterization) but fail to publish either the experimental details or the spectral data, instead providing only brief references to the original, bare-bones historical papers. The author argues that this creates a "tissue paper" literature structure where practical, modern preparative information is unavailable, forcing chemists to extract what they can from decades-old procedures that often relied on distillation, crystallization, and offered only melting points or qualitative descriptions instead of modern analytical data.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2008 post, several responses appeared (including one article titled "Goose Chasing in the Chemical Literature" in January 2009), acknowledging this as a widespread, recurrent frustration for bench chemists. In the years since, a number of institutional, commercial, and grass-roots initiatives emerged to systematically address the missing-modern-data problem. **Journals** increasingly tightened experimental-reporting standards, requiring full procedures and spectral characterization even for known intermediates. The trend toward **Supporting Information** grew dramatically, though often with continued gaps in useful detail. ChemSpider, launched in 2007, expanded, and commercial spectral databases (e.g., Reaxys, SciFinder) introduced richer analytical-data curation, where available.

More significantly, a small but growing movement toward **open-notebook science** and later **open-synthesis platforms** attempted to capture modern remakes in real time. The rise of preprints (e.g., ChemRxiv) and streamlined submission workflows made it marginally easier to share supplementary procedures, though adoption remained uneven. Vendor-led initiatives also appeared, such as offering free spectral data for purchased starting materials. By the mid-2010s, crowdsourced databases began curating modern remakes where authors uploaded spectral files and practical notes for previously sparse procedures.

As the 2010s continued, text-mining tools and systematic reviews increasingly flagged low-reproducibility literature chains, indirectly encouraging authors to validate and report full modern procedures. Academic culture slowly shifted toward valuing reproducibility and data sharing for practical utility, not just for novel compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

(I could not find explicit forward-looking predictions in the article that would allow me to compare stated expectations against later outcomes.)

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: 6/10

This is a well-executed and relatable piece about an enduring source of inefficiency in synthetic chemistry workflows. It resonated with bench chemists and contributed to a broader conversation about outdated reporting practices, though it did not fundamentally break new ground in identifying the underlying causes or promoting specific reforms beyond better author diligence.
