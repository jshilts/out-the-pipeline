# How Are Things at Princeton? (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a brief blog post asking for updates on Princeton University's new chemistry building, which was designed as a "glassy high-interaction high-innovation" space. The author references a previous inquiry from four years earlier (2010) and notes that a blogger named Luysii had been hearing that the building wasn't necessarily working out as planned. The post solicits comments from readers about how the building's design was actually performing in real-world use, acknowledging that many such buildings don't work out exactly as envisioned.

## 2. HISTORY
The original post from four years prior (October 2010) referenced Princeton's Frick Chemistry Laboratory, which opened in 2010 as a $116 million, 263,000-square-foot building designed to foster collaboration and innovation in chemical research. The building featured open-plan layouts, glass walls, and shared spaces intended to encourage interaction between researchers. 

However, subsequent reports and discussions revealed significant problems with the building's design. Faculty and researchers complained about the lack of privacy, excessive noise from open areas disrupting sensitive laboratory work, inadequate office space, and functional issues with the layout that hindered rather than helped research productivity. The "high-interaction" design created practical problems for laboratory work that requires quiet, controlled environments. 

The building drew criticism for prioritizing architectural vision over the practical needs of chemical research, becoming a cautionary example in academic architecture discussions about the importance of involving end-users (researchers) in building design. Similar issues emerged at other institutions with open-concept laboratory buildings, leading to a broader re-evaluation of collaborative laboratory design in higher education.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions, but rather solicited information about outcomes. The implicit assumptions in the original building design were:
• Open, glassy, high-interaction spaces would foster scientific innovation and collaboration
• The architectural vision would translate successfully into real-world research productivity
• The building would work out as planned

**Outcome**: These assumptions proved largely incorrect. The building faced significant criticism for not meeting practical research needs, and the emphasis on open collaboration spaces created functional problems rather than enhanced productivity.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5/9**

This article touches on the broader and important issue of how architectural design choices in academic research buildings can significantly impact scientific productivity, making it relevant to infrastructure planning in higher education and research institutions.
