# Incyte and Flexus: The Grappling Continues
October 2017

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses an ongoing intellectual property lawsuit between Incyte and Flexus Biosciences, a company that was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The dispute centers on Jordan Fridman, a former high-ranking Incyte employee who left to join Flexus. Incyte alleges that Fridman stole confidential information about IDO-1 inhibitors—a promising class of cancer immunotherapy drugs designed to work alongside checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda and Opdivo—and that this stolen intellectual property enabled Flexus's rapid rise and lucrative acquisition.

The lawsuit claims that after Fridman joined Flexus, the company dramatically shifted its entire focus to IDO-1 inhibition, using confidential information about Incyte's trial designs and pharmacokinetic data. The article notes that one Flexus board member allegedly expressed concern about the legal conflict, suggesting awareness that the information was problematic. The case was scheduled for trial approximately one year after the article's publication.

## 2. HISTORY

**Legal Resolution:** The lawsuit did proceed, concluding in 2018 with a confidential settlement between the parties. BMS continued developing the drug candidate acquired from Flexus, known as BMS-986205 or F001287, despite the legal disputes.

**Clinical Trials and Scientific Outcomes:** The IDO-1 inhibitor story took a dramatic turn in 2018. Incyte's lead IDO-1 inhibitor, epacadostat, failed in a pivotal Phase 3 trial (ECHO-301/KN-252) when combined with Merck's Keytruda for melanoma patients. The trial showed no improvement in progression-free or overall survival compared to Keytruda alone, dealing a major blow to the entire IDO-1 inhibitor field.

**Regulatory Impact:** No IDO-1 inhibitor has received FDA approval as of 2024. Following the epacadostat failure, enthusiasm for the mechanism waned significantly, with many companies abandoning or deprioritizing their IDO programs.

**Corporate Impact:** The settlement resolved the immediate legal dispute, but the broader scientific failure of the IDO mechanism meant that the contested intellectual property ultimately had limited commercial value. The high acquisition price BMS paid for Flexus did not translate into a marketable drug under this specific mechanism.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"That trial will be very interesting to watch, but we're going to have to wait until this time next year for it to get started."** - The trial did proceed as scheduled in 2018, though it resulted in a confidential settlement rather than a full public trial.

• **"I still have my doubts about whether it'll get that far... a settlement is still, I think, the most likely outcome."** - This prediction was accurate—the case settled confidentially before reaching a full trial verdict.

• **Implicit Prediction: The value of IDO-1 inhibitors as adjunctive cancer therapy.** - The article assumed IDO-1 inhibitors would be valuable additions to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This prediction proved incorrect when major trials failed to show benefit. The scientific mechanism that made Flexus valuable enough for BMS acquisition ultimately did not work as expected in clinical practice.

• **Implicit Prediction: That proving IP theft would have significant financial implications.** - While technically true that stolen IP could lead to damages, the underlying asset (IDO-1 inhibitor technology) lost most of its value due to clinical failures, likely reducing any potential damages significantly.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article captures a perfect storm of high-stakes biotech drama at a critical inflection point—combining intellectual property theft allegations, major corporate acquisition deals, and a promising scientific approach that ultimately failed, with the lawsuit settlement coinciding with scientific disappointment for the entire field.
