# Well-Rounded? (December 6, 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post responds to Nicholas Kristof's New York Times column "The Hubris of the Humanities," which lamented the cultural divide between the sciences and humanities. The author, a chemist in the pharmaceutical industry, agrees that educated people often consider it acceptable to be ignorant of basic science while valuing familiarity with humanities.

The post discusses the challenge this scientific literacy gap creates for the pharmaceutical industry, particularly when communicating with the public about drug development timelines and costs. The author expresses frustration with common conspiracy theories about pharmaceutical companies withholding cures or creating diseases for profit. The piece advocates for better science education for the general public and acknowledges the industry's difficulty in explaining why drug discovery is expensive and time-consuming. The author also critiques Kristof for incorrectly suggesting that anti-science sentiment is uniquely American and primarily from the political right, pointing out strong European opposition to genetically modified foods and science skepticism across the political spectrum.

## 2. HISTORY
In the two decades since this article was published, the science communication challenges and conspiracy theories described have intensified rather than diminished. The pharmaceutical industry has faced dramatic public relations crises and changed circumstances:

**Clinical Development Outcomes**: Between 2005-2025, the pharmaceutical industry has seen both significant breakthroughs and high-profile failures. Success rates for drugs advancing through clinical trials remain low (approximately 10-15% from Phase 1 to approval), validating the author's underlying message about the difficulty and unpredictability of drug development.

**Public Trust and Misinformation**: The conspiracy theories mentioned in 2005 have evolved but persisted. During the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023), pharmaceutical companies faced unprecedented public scrutiny regarding vaccine development speed, with widespread misinformation about vaccines being developed "too quickly" or containing harmful components. This directly parallels the 2005 concerns about public misunderstanding of drug development processes.

**European GMO Policy**: The author's critique of Kristof's dismissal of European anti-science sentiment was prescient. European regulations on genetically modified organisms remained highly restrictive throughout the 2010s and 2020s, with most EU countries maintaining bans or severe limitations on GMO cultivation and importation.

**Drug Pricing Debates**: The tensions around pharmaceutical pricing that were emerging in 2005 have become central political issues in the 2010s and 2020s, with numerous legislative efforts to control drug costs in both the US and Europe, and continued public skepticism about pharmaceutical company motives.

**Science Communication Evolution**: The author's expressed desire for better science education has seen mixed results. While science communication has professionalized with dedicated programs and practitioners, the rise of social media has simultaneously amplified misinformation and made nuanced scientific discussions more challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about future developments:

• **Prediction**: Scientific literacy would become increasingly important for being considered well-educated
**Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. While STEM education has gained prominence and funding, the gap the author described has arguably worsened in some respects, particularly with the rise of anti-vaccine sentiment and climate change denial. Scientific literacy remains uneven across the population.

• **Prediction**: Lack of scientific understanding would continue to fuel conspiracy theories about pharmaceutical companies
**Outcome**: **Accurate**. These conspiracy theories have become more sophisticated and widespread, amplified by social media. The COVID-19 pandemic saw exactly the types of misunderstandings the author worried about, including beliefs that cures were being withheld or that vaccines were developed too rapidly to be safe.

• **Prediction**: European anti-science sentiment, particularly regarding GMOs, would continue to be significant
**Outcome**: **Accurate**. European opposition to genetically modified foods has remained strong, with many countries maintaining restrictions or bans. The precautionary principle continues to dominate European policy on agricultural biotechnology.

• **Implicit prediction**: The pharmaceutical industry's communication challenges would persist due to the fundamental difficulty of explaining complex scientific processes to non-specialists
**Outcome**: **Accurate**. The industry continues to struggle with public communication, particularly around drug pricing, development timelines, and safety. The basic asymmetry the author identified - where humanities knowledge is valued more than scientific literacy in educated circles - has persisted.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about tensions between scientific and humanistic cultures that have become central to 21st-century public discourse. The specific issues identified - pharmaceutical conspiracy theories, European resistance to biotechnology, and the challenge of scientific communication - have only grown in relevance. The author's analysis of Kristof's blind spots about European anti-science sentiment appears especially insightful in hindsight. While focused on a particular historical moment, the piece illuminates structural problems in science-public communication that remain unresolved.
