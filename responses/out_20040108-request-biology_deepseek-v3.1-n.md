# A Request From Biology (January 2004)

## 1. Summary

This 2004 commentary addresses a biologist's question about why dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) remains the standard "universal solvent" for dissolving chemical compounds in biological screening assays, despite its known limitations. The author explains that DMSO has significant drawbacks: it can oxidize electron-rich molecules when exposed to air, and at higher concentrations it denatures proteins and disrupts biological assays. The core challenge identified is that any solvent with universal dissolving power will inevitably disrupt biomolecules because proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids are evolutionarily adapted to aqueous environments. The author argues that water's unique hydrogen-bonding properties make it irreplaceable for biological systems, and DMSO works as a compromise because it's small, has a strong dipole moment from its sulfoxide bond, and can dissolve both polar compounds and some hydrocarbons. Alternative solvents like N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), DMPU, and HMPA were noted as inferior substitutes that share DMSO's disadvantages. The conclusion was pessimistic about finding alternatives, suggesting the field would need to "live with DMSO."

## 2. History

**DMSO's Continued Dominance (2004-Present):** Two decades later, DMSO remains the standard solvent in high-throughput screening and drug discovery. Major pharmaceutical companies and academic screening facilities continue using DMSO stock solutions for compound libraries, typically at final assay concentrations of 0.1-1%. No alternative universal solvent has achieved widespread adoption.

**Technological Adaptations:** The response to DMSO's limitations has been primarily technological rather than chemical. Laboratories developed improved liquid handling systems with low-evaporation protocols, controlled atmosphere storage (nitrogen or argon overlays), and faster screening workflows to minimize DMSO's oxidative effects. Quality control measures became standardized, including regular compound purity verification and DMSO lot testing.

**Adjuvant and Cryoprotectant Applications:** DMSO found expanded use beyond solubility in cell-based assays and cryopreservation. Its membrane-penetrating properties made it valuable for delivering compounds into cells, though this also increased concerns about off-target effects and assay interference.

**Alternative Approaches (Not Solvents):** Research shifted toward addressing DMSO's limitations through non-solvent strategies: assay miniaturization (384-well and 1536-well plates reducing DMSO volumes), detergent-based formulations, cyclodextrin complexation for particularly insoluble compounds, and the development of "fragment-like" screening libraries with inherently better aqueous solubility.

**Biologics Revolution:** The rise of biologics (antibodies, proteins, peptides) as therapeutics reduced the importance of small-molecule solvents in certain therapeutic areas, though small molecules still dominate oral drugs.

**No Regulatory Changes:** No major policy changes occurred regarding DMSO use. It remains classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for certain applications, with concentration limits established for clinical formulations.

## 3. Predictions

**Prediction: "We're just going to have to live with DMSO"**
- **Verdict: ✓ Accurate.** DMSO remains the industry standard for compound dissolution in screening after 20 years. No competing universal solvent achieved widespread adoption, validating the author's assessment that alternatives like NMP, DMPU, or HMPA wouldn't replace it.

**Prediction: Water's "magical powers" are irreplaceable for biomolecules**
- **Verdict: ✓ Accurate.** The fundamental insight that any universal solvent would denature biomolecules proved correct. Modern screening still struggles with balancing compound solubility (requiring organic solvents) against maintaining physiological relevance in aqueous-based assays. The "aqueous boundary layer" problem in membrane permeability remains a central challenge in drug design.

**Implicit Prediction: Organic chemistry couldn't easily solve this problem**
- **Verdict: ✓ Accurate.** Despite advances in green chemistry, ionic liquids, and specialized solvents, no alternative matched DMSO's combination of dissolving power, stability, low toxicity (relative to alternatives), and compatibility with automated screening infrastructure. The problem proved more intractable than optimistically assumed.

**Bigger Picture Context:** The persistence of DMSO highlights a broader pattern: practical laboratory science often relies on "good enough" solutions that become entrenched through infrastructure and standardization, even when theoretically superior alternatives might exist. The sunk costs in validated DMSO-based workflows, compound libraries, and regulatory familiarity created path dependency.

## 4. Interest

**Rating: 6/10**

This article identified a durable, practical problem in drug discovery that remains relevant today. While narrowly focused, it illustrates how fundamental chemical constraints persist despite technological advancement. It earns moderate interest for its accurate foresight about DMSO's continued dominance and its realistic assessment of organic chemistry's limitations.
