# Down With the Research Works Act (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the Research Works Act (RWA), a bill introduced in December 2011 by Reps. Darrell Issa and Carolyn Maloney. The author argues this legislation was "shameless rent-seeking" by commercial scientific publishers (like Elsevier and Wiley) designed to protect their business model against open access trends. The act would have forbidden researchers funded by U.S. government grants from publishing in open access journals (such as PLoS) or depositing work in public repositories like PubMed Central.

The author explains the changing economics of scientific publishing: editorial work has decreased with electronic submission, most peer review is unpaid volunteer work by scientists, yet journal subscriptions remain extremely expensive ($15-50 per article). The RWA's goal, as stated by the Association of American Publishers, was to "ensure the sustainability of the industry" by legally mandating the traditional paywall model and rolling back the 2008 NIH policy requiring publicly funded research to become freely available within 12 months of publication.

## 2. HISTORY

The Research Works Act died in Congress in 2012 following significant public backlash from the scientific community, universities, and open access advocates. The opposition campaign included petitions, boycotts, and high-profile criticism that framed the bill as publishers trying to privatize publicly funded research.

**Immediate Aftermath (2012-2013):**
- In February 2012, Elsevier publicly withdrew support for the RWA following sustained pressure
- Academic boycotts against Elsevier gained momentum, with thousands of researchers pledging not to publish or peer review for their journals
- The failure of RWA accelerated momentum toward open access policies

**Later Developments (2013-2024):**
- **White House Directive (2013):** The Obama administration expanded public access requirements, mandating that federal agencies with R&D budgets over $100M must ensure federally funded research becomes freely available within 12 months
- **Continued Open Access Growth:** Organizations like PLoS expanded, and new open access journals proliferated
- **Publisher Adaptation:** Publishers increasingly adopted hybrid models (paying authors to make individual articles open access) and launched their own full open access journals
- **2022 OSTP Memo (Nelson Memo):** The Biden administration eliminated the 12-month embargo entirely, requiring immediate public access to federally funded research by 2025-2027 depending on the agency
- **Current Landscape:** Open access publishing continues growing, though subscription-based journals still dominate certain high-prestige titles; debates continue about article processing charges (APCs), which can be expensive ($2000-5000+ per article)

The RWA's failure marked a pivotal moment cementing the trend toward public access to taxpayer-funded research, though tensions between publishers and the research community persist.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained relatively few explicit predictions but made several implicit forecasts:

- **Implicit: Scientific publishing should and would evolve with new technology** ✓ **Accurate** - Open access has significantly expanded, though not replaced subscription models entirely.

- **Implicit: The Research Works Act represented a desperate attempt to preserve an outdated business model** ✓ **Accurate** - The bill did fail, and publishers have since diversified into hybrid and full open access options.

- **No explicit timeline predictions were made** - The article correctly identified the direction of change but didn't venture specific timelines.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a critical policy moment that shaped academic publishing for over a decade and relates to broader debates about access to publicly funded knowledge. While not primarily biotech-focused, scientific publishing is the infrastructure on which biotechnology research depends, making this highly relevant.
