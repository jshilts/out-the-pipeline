# Drug Research Areas You Wish You'd Never Heard Of (Aug 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on a personal “tour” of therapeutic fields he has worked in over his career—CNS (dementia, Alzheimer’s), diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, oncology, antibacterials, multiple sclerosis, and antivirals. He notes the gaps in his experience (cardiovascular, inflammation) and invites readers to share their own “missing‑area” wish‑lists. He also asks which fields colleagues regret entering; his own answer is Alzheimer’s research, which he now sees as a massive waste of effort given the lack of clinical breakthroughs up to that point.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Alzheimer’s disease (CNS)** – 2011 was still a “black‑hole” for drug development. Since then the first disease‑modifying antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab) received FDA approval (2021, 2023) but their clinical impact has been modest, uptake limited, and safety concerns (ARIA) remain. The field has shifted toward combination approaches and earlier‑stage interventions, but the overall success rate is still low.

**Diabetes** – The past decade saw the explosion of GLP‑1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) and SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, empagliflozin). These agents not only improve glycaemic control but also reduce cardiovascular and renal outcomes, reshaping standard of care and generating billions in sales. The author’s earlier work in diabetes is now part of a highly successful therapeutic class.

**Osteoporosis** – Bisphosphonates remain the backbone, while newer agents such as denosumab (RANKL inhibitor) and romosozumab (sclerostin antibody) entered the market (2019 onward). Romosozumab’s cardiovascular safety concerns have limited its use, but the overall pipeline has expanded, providing more options for patients.

**Obesity** – After 2011, the field was revitalized by the repurposing of GLP‑1 agonists for weight loss. Semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) achieved >15 % body‑weight reductions in phase III trials and received FDA approval (2021, 2022). This represents a dramatic shift from the “failed” anti‑obesity attempts of the early 2000s.

**Oncology** – The era of checkpoint inhibitors (PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies) and CAR‑T cell therapies transformed cancer treatment. Drugs such as pembrolizumab (2014) and tisagenlecleucel (2017) became standard of care in multiple indications, far exceeding the expectations of 2011’s more conventional small‑molecule pipelines.

**Antibacterials** – The antibiotic pipeline remained thin. A few new agents (cefiderocol 2019, plazomicin 2018, lefamulin 2019) received approval, but resistance continues to outpace development. The “antibiotic crisis” prompted policy actions (U.S. GAIN Act, 2012; WHO priority pathogen list, 2017) and increased public‑private partnership funding, yet the market remains financially unattractive.

**Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** – Since 2011, oral disease‑modifying therapies (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) and monoclonal antibodies (ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab) have broadened treatment options. Early‑initiation strategies and highly effective agents have improved long‑term disability outcomes.

**Antivirals** – The most striking post‑2011 development is the cure of hepatitis C with direct‑acting antivirals (sofosbuvir, ledipasvir) and the rapid emergence of COVID‑19 therapeutics (remdesivir, paxlovid) and mRNA vaccine platforms. Long‑acting HIV injectables (cabotegravir/rilpivirine) also entered the market (2021). The author’s late‑career interest in anti‑infectives aligns with this resurgence.

Overall, the therapeutic areas the author listed have experienced wildly different trajectories: some (diabetes, obesity, oncology, antivirals) have become blockbuster successes; others (Alzheimer’s, antibacterials) remain fraught with failure or modest progress.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / Explicit prediction in the 2011 piece | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|---|---|
| **Alzheimer’s research will be a “ferocious waste of effort.”** | The field still struggles; only two antibodies have been approved with limited uptake, and most large trials continue to fail. The sentiment remains largely true, though modest breakthroughs have occurred. |
| **Anti‑infectives were a “category” the author hadn’t touched until the last few years, implying future interest.** | The author’s implied shift aligns with a broader industry pivot: massive investment in antivirals (COVID‑19, hepatitis C) and renewed policy focus on antibiotics. The sector has indeed become a hot research area. |
| **Implicit expectation that some therapeutic areas will continue to be “well‑trod” (e.g., oncology, diabetes).** | Both oncology (checkpoint inhibitors, CAR‑T) and diabetes (GLP‑1, SGLT2) have exploded into dominant, high‑growth fields, confirming the expectation of continued relevance. |
| **No explicit forecast for obesity, osteoporosis, MS, or antibacterials.** | Obesity has seen breakthrough drugs (semaglutide, tirzepatide). Osteoporosis added novel biologics but with safety caveats. MS now enjoys a robust oral and monoclonal pipeline. Antibacterials remain a pipeline bottleneck despite policy incentives. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise, personal snapshot of a scientist’s career path that prompts reflection on the evolving fortunes of major therapeutic areas; its relevance has grown as some fields have dramatically succeeded while others have stalled.
