# Hexafluorocyclohexane: A Polarity Record-Holder (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary highlights a highly fluorinated cyclohexane isomer reported by David O'Hagan's group at an ACS meeting in Denver. The molecule has fluorine atoms on one face and C-H bonds on the opposite face, creating extreme polarity—reportedly the most polar aliphatic compound ever measured at the time. The author notes the compound's challenging synthesis (12 steps from myo-inositol) and speculates about potential applications as an unusual solvent for chromatography. However, the article acknowledges the compound is actually a solid at room temperature, possibly limiting its utility as a solvent. The tone is curious but pragmatic about immediate practical applications.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2015 report, highly fluorinated "Janus-faced" molecules like hexafluorocyclohexane continued to attract interest in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. Research groups explored these compounds' unusual polar properties and potential applications. The O'Hagan group and others investigated related fluorinated cycloalkanes to understand how such extreme polarity affects molecular recognition, crystal packing, and surface properties. 

However, the practical applications envisioned in the article—particularly as chromatography solvents—did not materialize significantly. The challenging synthesis (12+ steps) and the solid nature of many of these compounds limited their widespread adoption in routine laboratory applications. While scientifically interesting for understanding polarity and non-covalent interactions, these highly fluorinated compounds did not become standard tools in synthesis or analytical chemistry laboratories.

The broader field of organofluorine chemistry continued advancing, but this specific class of ultra-polar fluorinated cyclohexanes remained more of a chemical curiosity than a transformative material. No major commercial applications or widely adopted laboratory reagents emerged from this specific line of research. The compounds served primarily to expand fundamental understanding of molecular polarity rather than enabling new technologies or products.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions, only speculation about potential as an unusual chromatography solvent. This speculation was not realized due to the compound being a solid and the synthesis being impractical for routine laboratory use.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

This brief note describes an interesting chemical curiosity but lacks broader scientific or practical significance. The extreme polarity record is notable but had limited impact beyond the specialist community.
