# Article Title (Month Year)
And Another Thing. . . (6 Jan 2003)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a commentary piece dismissing the Clonaid and Raelian claims of having produced the first human clone. The author expresses extreme skepticism about these claims, referencing the Raelians' background from Donna Kossy's book "Kooks" as grounds for not taking them seriously. The core argument is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the author demands multiple blood samples for DNA microsatellite analysis under witness observation as proof. The piece takes a firm stance that the human cloning claims are false and criticizes the media circus surrounding these assertions.

## 2. HISTORY

The Clonaid situation unfolded as follows after this January 2003 article:

**Immediate developments (2003):** Clonaid, founded by the Raelian religious movement, claimed in December 2002 to have produced the first human clone named "Eve." However, they repeatedly failed to provide the DNA evidence that scientists and skeptics demanded. When pressed for proof, Clonaid made excuses about the "family" not wanting to participate, and no independent verification ever occurred.

**Scientific community response:** The overwhelming consensus among biologists and geneticists was that the claims were a hoax. No credible evidence emerged, and the scientific community largely dismissed the announcement as fraudulent.

**Outcome:** No human clone was ever verified. The claims faded from public attention within months, with no subsequent credible evidence appearing. The Raelian movement's credibility suffered, and Clonaid never produced any verifiable human clones.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit prediction in the article:**

• **That the Clonaid claims were false and would not withstand scientific scrutiny** - This prediction proved entirely accurate. No evidence of human cloning ever emerged, no DNA verification occurred despite demands, and the scientific consensus confirmed the claims were fraudulent. The author's skepticism was well-founded, and the prediction that these were unsubstantiated claims held true.

**The article implicitly predicted no legitimate human clones would be verified, which proved correct through the continued absence of evidence and the scientific community's dismissal of the claims.**

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

The article addresses a sensational but ultimately baseless claim that had already been widely discredited by the time it was published. While it takes a reasonable skeptical stance, it doesn't provide scientific analysis or novel insights—just restates what most informed observers already believed. The issue resolved quickly without lasting impact on biotechnology or policy.
