1. SUMMARY

This short article from February 2014 uses a cynical, sarcastic tone to highlight a new low in academic publishing scams: fake impact factors. Starting from the known problems of predatory journals and paper mills, the piece describes how enterprising fraudsters have begun selling counterfeit impact factors, allowing "credulous impact-seeking bozos" to inflate their journals' perceived prestige and attract publication fees. The author frames this scam with an Iranian proverb: "A thief robs a thief, and God smiles," suggesting a certain poetic justice in a system of mutual exploitation within academic publishing.

The article is best understood as a commentary track to an external blog post on ScholarlyOA (a site dedicated to tracking predatory publishing), rather than a self-contained investigative report.

2. HISTORY

The years following 2014 saw an explosive growth, not just in the number of predatory journals, but in the sophistication and variety of publishing scams, making the "fake impact factor" problem one of many, and perhaps one of the less impactful, fronts in a larger war on research integrity.

*   **Predatory Publishing Proliferation:** By the mid-to-late 2010s, the scale of predatory publishing became undeniable. Jeffrey Beall's list of "potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers," a key resource at the time, grew from hundreds to thousands. After Beall shut down his list in 2017 following legal pressure, other efforts like Cabells' Predatory Reports emerged as commercial alternatives. The problem of "credulous... bozos" paying for publications was shown to be a massive global issue, with some studies estimating hundreds of thousands of articles being published annually in such outlets.

*   **The "Fake Impact Factor" Scam Matures:** The business model described in the article—creating a fake metric to sell to journals—evolved. Instead of just inventing numbers, new metrics like the "Global Impact Factor" or "Universal Impact Factor" were created. These existed in a grey area: their formulas were opaque, they often calculated "impact" over very short periods, and they aggressively marketed themselves to new and low-quality journals. They were "fake" in spirit but real in name, creating a confusing ecosystem of faux-prestige metrics.

*   **Rise of "Hijacked Journals":** A related and arguably more damaging scam emerged where fraudsters would create a clone of a legitimate journal's website, complete with a similar name, ISSN, and often a fake (but plausible) impact factor, to trick authors into submitting papers and paying fees. The original article's focus on selling fake metrics to willing journals was only half the story; the other half was creating fake metrics for fake versions of real journals.

*   **Journal Impact Factor (JIF) Loses its Crown:** The very reputation of the *legitimate* Journal Impact Factor, published by Clarivate (formerly Thomson Reuters), came under sustained and powerful attack. Initiatives like the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2012) gained immense traction. By the late 2010s, major funders like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Wellcome Trust, and national bodies like the UK Research Excellence Framework, began officially de-emphasizing JIF in favor of assessing research on its own merits. This cultural shift within legitimate science toward alternative metrics and narrative CVs made the old game of chasing *any* impact factor—real or fake—seem increasingly irrelevant and outdated.

*   **The Rise and Fall of ScholarlyOA and Beall's List:** The blog ScholarlyOA, which first reported the fake impact factor issue, was run by librarian Jeffrey Beall, who became the central figure in the fight against predatory publishing. However, in 2017, he was forced to shut down his influential blog and "Beall's List" after a major publisher threatened him with a lawsuit. This was a significant event, marking the limits of individual activism in this space.

3. PREDICTIONS

*   **Prediction Matched: The "Credulous Bozos" Were Real.** The article's prediction (or rather, its diagnosis) that there was a large market of "impact-seeking bozos" ready to be harvested was proven overwhelmingly correct. The subsequent explosion of predatory journals, many of which prominently displayed made-up or misleading "impact factors" on their websites, showed that the demand for this kind of status symbol was immense.

*   **Prediction Missed: The Scammers' Motives Were Broader.** The article frames the scam as a simple transaction: thieves selling a fake product to other thieves. While partially true, subsequent history showed that many victims of predatory publishers were not complicit "bozos" but rather naive or early-career researchers from developing countries who were intimidated, misled, or lacked mentorship. The scam evolved to exploit vulnerability as much as vanity.

*   **Blind Spot: The Real Story Was the Devaluation of the JIF Itself.** The article takes the power of the *concept* of an Impact Factor for granted. The most significant development post-2014, however, was the organized, large-scale movement *within the legitimate scientific community* to dismantle the prestige of the *legitimate* Journal Impact Factor. The fake metrics were a symptom of a disease within a system obsessed with metrics. The real story of the last decade has been the attempt to cure that disease by moving away from metrics altogether. The "thieves" selling fake impact factors were fighting over a currency that the most powerful players in the legitimate world were increasingly deeming worthless. This was the article's biggest blind spot.

4. INTEREST

**Score: 4**

This article is only moderately interesting. It falls squarely in the 40-50th percentile range.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Lacks Depth and Originality:** It functions more as a short, sarcastic blog commentary than a deep investigation. It points to a webpage but provides little analysis of its own, making it a footnote in the larger saga of academic publishing.
*   **Low Importance:** While the topic of research integrity is of the highest importance, the specific niche of "fake impact factors" was never the central issue. It was a symptom, not the disease. The more historically significant stories were the broader proliferation of predatory publishers and, crucially, the DORA-led movement against the *real* Journal Impact Factor.
*   **Limited Impact on the Real World:** The article itself, and the phenomenon it described, did not fundamentally change the course of science, though it contributed to a growing awareness of the "Wild West" nature of academic publishing at the time. It was a snapshot of a small-time hustle in a much larger market of bad faith and bad practice.
