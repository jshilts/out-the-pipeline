# LaMattina on Angell (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses John LaMattina's response to Marcia Angell's critique of the pharmaceutical industry. Angell had claimed that drug companies "do almost no innovation nowadays" and that they merely handle late-stage clinical development, which she characterized as expensive but not innovative. LaMattina, former head of R&D at Pfizer, countered that innovation isn't limited to discovery research labs—translating laboratory science into meaningful clinical applications is both challenging and innovative. He argued that cancer drugs being approved at the time were developed through innovative paradigms and experimental methods created by industry scientists and physicians. The author (Derek Lowe) suggests Angell's inflammatory language is deliberate, designed to generate attention, book sales, and speaking engagements by attacking pharmaceutical companies—her established niche.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2012 saw significant developments that complicate both Angell's critique and industry responses:

**Industry R&D Productivity**: Pharma R&D spending continued rising, reaching approximately $180 billion globally by 2019, though productivity metrics remained mixed. Industry critics point to continued high drug prices and modest innovation in certain areas, while defenders highlight breakthrough therapies in oncology, rare diseases, and gene therapies.

**Drug Approvals and Innovation**: The FDA approved numerous innovative drugs post-2012, including breakthrough cancer immunotherapies (Keytruda, Opdivo), CAR-T cell therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta), and gene therapies (Luxturna, Zolgensma). Many originated from biotech companies later acquired by large pharma, validating both Angell's concerns about big pharma's innovation capacity and LaMattina's defense of industry role in development.

**Clinical Development Innovation**: Actual innovation occurred in trial design—adaptive trials, basket trials, master protocols—facilitated by industry expertise in navigating regulatory pathways, partially supporting LaMattina's argument that clinical development itself is innovative work.

**Market Dynamics**: Major mergers continued (Pfizer-Wyeth, Allergan-Pfizer attempt), reinforcing concerns about industry consolidation reducing innovation. Simultaneously, the biotech sector exploded, with many breakthrough therapies originating from small companies.

**Policy Changes**: The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) streamlined drug approval processes, addressing some development challenges LaMattina referenced about translating science into clinical reality.

**Public Perception**: Drug pricing controversies intensified, most notably with Martin Shkreli's Daraprim price hike (2015), validating critics' concerns about industry practices, while the pandemic highlighted industry's rapid vaccine development capabilities through Operation Warp Speed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Angell's implicit prediction that pharma innovation drought would continue**: Partially accurate—many breakthrough therapies now originate from biotech companies rather than big pharma's internal R&D, though large companies still contribute significantly through clinical development expertise

• **LaMattina's defense that industry innovation includes clinical development**: Largely validated—post-2012 approvals demonstrated that innovative trial designs and development strategies are indeed crucial innovative contributions

• **Author's suggestion that inflammatory rhetoric would continue generating attention**: Confirmed—pharma criticism remains a popular genre in books, media, and speaking circuits

• **Implicit prediction about industry's trajectory**: Mixed—big pharma did increasingly rely on acquiring innovation rather than internal R&D, but industry's ability to rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccines (2020-2021) demonstrated preserved capabilities

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4**

This article addresses a persistent debate in pharmaceutical policy and industry structure, but focuses more on personalities and rhetoric than substantive analysis, limiting its lasting analytical value.
