# More From Warp Drive Bio (And Less From Aileron?) (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses two Cambridge-based biotechnology companies founded by Greg Verdine. Warp Drive Bio, which was formed with an unusual founding structure that included a pre-existing deal with Sanofi, announced that Verdine was taking a three-year leave from Harvard to become CEO. The company's research strategy focused on unlocking "cryptic natural products" from bacteria by sequencing genomes to find biosynthesis genes that remain turned off in standard screening. The company claimed to have already sequenced 50,000 bacterial genomes, the largest such collection at the time, to identify rare natural products that could serve as drug candidates.

The article also mentions Aileron Therapeutics, Verdine's other venture focused on "stapled peptides" (a type of stabilized peptide therapeutic). However, there were concerns about Aileron's status, with reports of research cutbacks despite having brought their first compound through Phase I trials and raising additional funding. Verdine clarified that he had officially parted ways with Aileron in 2010 to avoid conflicts of interest.

## 2. HISTORY

**Warp Drive Bio:** The company's ambitious natural product discovery platform faced significant challenges despite its promising premise. After substantial investment and collaboration with Sanofi, Warp Drive Bio struggled to translate its massive genomic database into viable drug candidates. The "haystack problem" mentioned in the article - the difficulty of sorting through enormous amounts of data to find truly valuable compounds - proved more challenging than anticipated. The company later pivoted and was acquired by Revolution Medicines in 2018, effectively marking the end of the original approach described in the 2013 article. The core challenge remained: activating cryptic biosynthesis pathways at scale and identifying medically relevant compounds proved enormously complex.

**Aileron Therapeutics:** The stapled peptide technology faced a similar trajectory of high promise followed by clinical challenges. While several compounds progressed through clinical trials, including ALRN-6924 which reached Phase II trials, the company struggled with efficacy and delivery issues that are common to peptide therapeutics. The fundamental challenges of peptide stability, bioavailability, and manufacturing costs persisted despite the "stapling" approach meant to address these issues. Aileron's clinical programs encountered setbacks, and the broader field of stapled peptides has remained more niche than initially hoped, with relatively few approved drugs using this technology.

**Sanofi's involvement:** The pharmaceutical partner that helped launch Warp Drive Bio did not ultimately benefit significantly from the collaboration in terms of approved drugs reaching the market through this partnership. The natural products discovery space continued to face challenges with rediscovery of known compounds and difficulty in finding truly novel scaffolds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Warp Drive Bio's cryptic natural product discovery would yield valuable drug candidates:** The article expressed optimism that the "dark-matter universe of natural products" would be worth exploring, building on the historical success of natural products in drug discovery. **Outcome:** This prediction did not materialize as hoped. While the genomics approach was technically feasible, the practical challenges of activating pathways, characterizing the resulting compounds, and establishing medically relevant activity proved overwhelming. The company ultimately pivoted away from this strategy and was acquired at a fraction of the original investment and hype.

• **The "haystack problem" would be manageable:** The author suggested that sorting through the massive genomic data would be "masses of fun" and could be productively pursued. **Outcome:** The haystack problem proved more fundamental than anticipated. The bottleneck shifted from data generation to functional characterization and target validation, which remained rate-limiting steps in drug discovery.

• **Aileron's stapled peptide platform would succeed:** The article framed concerns about Aileron as potentially temporary ("circle-the-wagons phase") while noting their Phase I success and continued funding. **Outcome:** While Aileron continued operations and advanced compounds through clinical trials, the technology platform did not achieve the broad success initially envisioned. Clinical development proved more challenging than preclinical promise suggested, a common pattern in drug development.

• **Natural products discovery would rebound from diminishing returns:** The article suggested Warp Drive's approach could reinvigorate natural product drug discovery, which had been suffering from diminishing returns. **Outcome:** Natural products discovery remains challenging today. While genomic approaches have advanced, the fundamental issues of rediscovery, low yield, and complex synthesis have kept natural products as a relatively small component of modern drug discovery pipelines compared to synthetic and biologics approaches.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article captures an interesting moment of biotech venture creation and technology hype, with Warp Drive Bio representing a genomics-era approach to natural products and Aileron exemplifying peptide therapeutic innovation. Both ventures illustrate the significant gap between technological promise and clinical/commercial reality, making this a valuable case study in biotech translation challenges.
