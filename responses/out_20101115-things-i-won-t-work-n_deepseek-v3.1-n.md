# Things I Won't Work With: Nitrotetrazole Oxides (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a research paper about nitrotetrazole N-oxides, a highly explosive class of compounds. The author (Derek Lowe, writing under the "Things I Won't Work With"专栏) describes how adding nitro groups and N-oxide functionality to tetrazole rings creates exceptionally unstable molecules with strong tendencies to rapidly decompose into nitrogen gas. The paper reported that these compounds could be synthesized using relatively mild conditions (oxone at room temperature), which was surprising given the extreme instability of the products. Several salts of nitrotetrazole oxides were prepared with various counterions, ranging from merely explosive (guanidinium salts) to violently explosive (ammonium and hydroxyammonium salts). Some compounds showed detonation properties similar to RDX but with inadequate thermal stability for practical use. The author speculates that researchers might attempt similar N-oxide chemistry on even more unstable azidotetrazolate compounds, and declines to work with any of these materials himself due to safety concerns.

## 2. HISTORY
The research on nitrotetrazole oxides was part of ongoing high-energy materials chemistry rather than biotechnology. This work falls within defense and materials science, specifically energetic materials research, not pharmaceutical or medical applications. The 2010 paper was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society by researchers at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München and the University of Maryland.

**Subsequent developments:** Research on high-energy tetrazole derivatives continued in academic and defense research circles, but these specific nitrotetrazole oxides did not lead to commercially significant explosive materials due to their poor thermal stability. The fundamental issue Lowe identified—that ideal explosives need to be stable until intentionally detonated—remained unresolved for this class of compounds. 

The broader field of tetrazole chemistry in pharmaceuticals continued unaffected, as these explosive derivatives are entirely separate from the medically useful tetrazole compounds that remain important in drug development. No pharmaceutical companies adopted nitrotetrazole oxides, and no drugs resulted from this work, as expected given the article's focus on explosive properties rather than therapeutic applications.

The "Things I Won't Work With" blog系列 continued through 2016 on the Science website, with Lowe covering increasingly dangerous compounds, but the specific prediction about azidotetrazolate N-oxides did not appear to generate significant follow-up publications or breakthroughs in energetic materials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that researchers would try N-oxide chemistry on azidotetrazolate salts:** The article suggested this would be "a hoppin' bunch of compounds" and that progress could be monitored by "distant booming noises and the tinkle of glass." **Outcome:** Limited evidence of such research emerged in major journals, likely because the field of extremely unstable energetic materials faces publication and practical barriers beyond technical challenges.

• **Implication that these compounds wouldn't become practical explosives:** Lowe noted the poor thermal stability made them unsuitable for real-world applications. **Outcome:** Accurate—these compounds did not replace established explosives like RDX due to stability issues.

• **Suggestion that mild synthesis conditions might attract more researchers:** The oxone-based synthesis was presented as surprisingly accessible. **Outcome:** The inherent danger and limited practical applications appear to have limited broad adoption of this chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 2/9**

This ranks in the 20-30th percentile of interest. While entertainingly written, this was a niche article about a specialized area of chemistry with limited broader scientific, medical, or practical implications. It did not predict major breakthroughs, influence drug development, or address significant public health issues. The content was primarily of interest to specialists in energetic materials chemistry and readers of Derek Lowe's chemistry blog series.
