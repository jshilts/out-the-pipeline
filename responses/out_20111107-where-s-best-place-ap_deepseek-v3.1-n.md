# Where's the Best Place to Apply Modeling to Drug Discovery? (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2011 blog post discusses where computational modeling and simulation efforts would be most valuable in drug discovery. The author questions whether the "obvious" applications—lead generation and structure-activity relationship (SAR) development—are actually the most impactful. Instead, he suggests that the real rate-limiting steps in drug development are areas like toxicology and target selection, which at the time were much less amenable to computational approaches. An update mentions clinical trial design as another potential application area that addresses critical bottlenecks in the drug development process.

## 2. HISTORY

The landscape of computational drug discovery has evolved significantly since 2011, with major advancements in several key areas:

**AI/ML in Drug Discovery**: The period after 2011 saw substantial growth in computational approaches, particularly with the rise of machine learning and deep learning. Companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals emerged and went public, demonstrating that AI-driven drug discovery could identify viable clinical candidates. Large pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in computational platforms, with notable examples including Pfizer's partnerships with AI companies and Roche's acquisition of Flatiron Health for real-world evidence analysis.

**Structural Biology Revolution**: AlphaFold's release in 2021 transformed target selection and structure-based drug design by providing accurate protein structure predictions for millions of proteins. This directly addressed the "target selection" limitation mentioned in the article, making previously inaccessible targets druggable.

**Clinical Trial Innovation**: The article's suggestion about clinical trial design proved prescient. Post-2011 saw significant growth in adaptive trial designs, real-world evidence integration, and patient recruitment platforms like Antidote and Science 37. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of decentralized clinical trials and digital biomarkers.

**Regulatory Changes**: The FDA has increasingly accepted computational evidence and modeling in regulatory submissions, with guidance documents on model-informed drug development and the creation of the Digital Health Center of Excellence.

However, challenges persist: while computational methods have become widespread in early discovery, the overall drug development timeline hasn't dramatically shortened, and clinical failure rates remain high across the industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions and their outcomes:

- **"Lead generation and SAR development" as computational targets**: ✓ This indeed became one of the most successful applications of modeling, with AI platforms routinely generating novel molecular structures and predicting activity profiles
- **"Toxicology" and "target selection" not being amenable to modeling**: ✗/✓ These areas have seen limited but meaningful progress. While not fully solved, ML toxicity prediction and structure-based target validation have become valuable tools, particularly with AlphaFold expanding accessible target space
- **Clinical trial design as valuable application**: ✓ Strongly validated. The field has seen major investments in trial optimization, patient recruitment platforms, and adaptive designs, with measurable impacts on trial efficiency

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 8**

This article identified key bottlenecks that remained central challenges for another decade and highlighted areas where computational methods would have the most leverage. The discussion about feasibility versus importance correctly anticipated where resources should be focused, even if the specific solutions differed from what was envisioned in 2011.
