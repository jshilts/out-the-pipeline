# In Which I Reminisce About the Prins Reaction, Chemical Abstracts, and John Keats (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author recounts a graduate‑school episode from the spring of 1984. While trying to build a tetrahydropyran ring by a multi‑step route that stalled at a difficult neopentyl‑centered cyclisation, he turned to the printed **Chemical Abstracts** (CA) indices. By searching the empirical formula he discovered a 1970s *‑Tetrahedron* paper that described a **one‑step Prins cyclisation** that produced exactly the desired ring system from two inexpensive Aldrich reagents. He tried the reaction, succeeded, and the project moved forward. The story is used to illustrate two lessons: (1) never assume a published route is optimal, and (2) literature searching can uncover shortcuts that save time and material. The piece also nods to the author’s later return to photochemistry, contrasting the old paper‑based research workflow with the modern digital environment.

## 2. HISTORY  
### Evolution of literature searching  
* **Print CA discontinued** – The last printed “Chemical Abstracts” index was issued in 2010; the service has been fully digital (SciFinder‑n, CAS REGISTRY) for over a decade.  
* **Rise of searchable databases** – By the mid‑2010s, tools such as **SciFinder**, **Reaxys**, and **Google Scholar** offered structure‑based and sub‑structure searches, making the “empirical‑formula‑lookup” trick obsolete.  
* **Open‑access growth** – The proliferation of open‑access journals and pre‑print servers (e.g., ChemRxiv, arXiv) further reduced reliance on subscription‑only collections like *Tetrahedron* for routine synthetic precedents.

### The Prins reaction after 2011  
* **Catalytic and greener variants** – Since 2011, numerous reports have introduced **Lewis‑acid‑catalyzed** (e.g., Sc(OTf)₃, Yb(OTf)₃) and **organocatalytic** Prins cyclisations that operate under milder conditions and with lower catalyst loadings.  
* **Flow chemistry** – Continuous‑flow implementations of the Prins cyclisation have appeared, improving safety (especially when using HCl or H₂SO₄) and scalability for pharmaceutical intermediates.  
* **Synthetic applications** – The Prins cyclisation has been employed in the total syntheses of several complex natural products (e.g., (+)-cortistatin A, (+)-pseudolaric acid B) published between 2012 and 2023, confirming its continued relevance for constructing tetrahydropyran motifs.  
* **Photochemical Prins‑type reactions** – Emerging photoredox methods (visible‑light mediated) have enabled **radical‑initiated Prins cyclisations**, expanding the reaction’s scope to substrates that were previously unreactive under classic acid conditions.

### Photochemistry resurgence  
The author’s mention of returning to photochemistry aligns with the broader **visible‑light photocatalysis boom** that began around 2012 (e.g., MacMillan, Yoon, Stephenson). By 2020, photochemical steps had become routine in medicinal‑chemistry pipelines, and many companies now maintain dedicated photoreactor platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction mentioned or implied in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Literature searches will become faster and more reliable** (implied by the “need to update” comment) | Digital databases and AI‑assisted search tools now retrieve relevant reactions in seconds; the empirical‑formula index method is obsolete. |
| **The Prins reaction will remain a useful tool for building tetrahydropyrans** | The reaction continues to be used, with modern catalytic, flow, and photochemical variants expanding its utility. |
| **Photochemistry will re‑enter the author’s work** (the author hints at a “return”) | The field of synthetic photochemistry has indeed exploded; many academic and industrial labs now incorporate photoredox steps routinely. |
| **Printed Chemical Abstracts will become a relic** (implicit) | Printed CA ceased in 2010; all indexing is now electronic. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The anecdote is a vivid illustration of how a simple literature search can change a project, and it captures a transitional moment in chemical information management. However, the piece is largely personal and does not introduce novel scientific concepts, limiting its broader impact.
