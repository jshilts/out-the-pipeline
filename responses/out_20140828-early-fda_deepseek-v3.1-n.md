# The Early FDA (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article references a short video history of the FDA produced by BioCentury TV, highlighting the agency's early days under Harvey Wiley and the notorious "Poison Squad" experiments. The piece suggests these early regulatory approaches were "wild and alarming by today's standards," while acknowledging that the products available on the market during that era were equally concerning. The article appears to be part of Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" commentary series, which typically discusses pharmaceutical and biotechnology topics with a focus on drug discovery and development.

The context provided indicates this is essentially a commentary piece reflecting on FDA's historical origins, particularly the unconventional and dangerous methods used in early food and drug safety testing before modern regulatory frameworks were established.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this 2014 article, the FDA has continued to evolve significantly in regulatory approaches and public health impact:

**Regulatory Evolution**: The FDA has undergone substantial modernization, with increased focus on expedited pathways for breakthrough therapies, orphan drugs, and precision medicine. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) expanded FDA's flexibility in drug approval processes.

**Drug Approval Trends**: Post-2014 saw dramatic growth in novel drug approvals, including many first-in-class therapies and biologics. The period 2015-2020 marked some of the highest annual new drug approval rates in FDA history, with particular strength in oncology, rare diseases, and immunology.

**Impact on Biotechnology**: The biotech sector continued to expand significantly, with FDA approvals driving industry growth. However, this period also highlighted ongoing challenges with drug pricing, access issues, and the balance between accelerated approval and post-market safety monitoring.

**COVID-19 Response**: The pandemic catalyzed unprecedented FDA activity through Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) and rapid vaccine/drug development pathways, fundamentally shifting public perception of regulatory speed and flexibility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in biotechnology or FDA oversight. It was primarily retrospective, examining historical FDA origins rather than forecasting future trends.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article serves primarily as historical commentary with limited forward-looking analysis or deep biotechnology industry relevance, making it more of a niche historical piece than a substantive biotech industry analysis.
