# Puma and Neratinib Take Longer Than Expected (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Puma Biotechnology's drug neratinib, an irreversible kinase inhibitor for breast cancer treatment. When the article was published in December 2014, neratinib had recently shown promising Phase III results that surprised investors and caused Puma's stock to rise dramatically. However, the story had become more complicated by this point: neratinib failed to beat Herceptin in a head-to-head trial (a failure Puma had downplayed), and the company faced regulatory delays. A recent FDA meeting revealed that Puma needed to address preclinical carcinogenicity data, delaying their regulatory filing for at least a year. The company was also discussing changing their target patient population. Despite these setbacks, the drug still had potential to eventually make it through the regulatory process.

## 2. HISTORY
After this December 2014 article, neratinib continued its development journey. Puma Biotechnology eventually submitted their New Drug Application to the FDA, and neratinib (brand name Nerlynx) received FDA approval in July 2017 for extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer in patients who had previously received trastuzumab-based therapy. However, the drug's path to approval and commercial success faced continued challenges.

The drug did reach the market, but with significant limitations. The approval came with a boxed warning for severe diarrhea, requiring antidiarrheal prophylaxis for the first 56 days of treatment. Market uptake was slower than initially hoped, with sales falling short of early projections. The drug faced competition from other HER2-targeted therapies and had a challenging side effect profile. In subsequent years, Puma explored additional indications for neratinib, including metastatic breast cancer and other solid tumors, but commercial success remained modest compared to the initial investor enthusiasm of 2014.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several implicit predictions and uncertainties:

• **"Neratinib may well make it through fine after the delay"** - This ultimately proved correct. The drug did eventually receive FDA approval in 2017, though with delays beyond the initial timeline.

• **Implicit expectation of rapid FDA filing** - The article noted the original plan for FDA filing "just after the first of the year" (early 2015). This timeline was significantly delayed, with approval not coming until 2017.

• **Implicit prediction about commercial success** - The article's discussion of stock performance and investor uncertainty hinted at concerns about whether the drug would justify the market enthusiasm. This proved prescient, as commercial uptake was slower than expected post-approval.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

This article captures a common but important pattern in drug development: early enthusiasm followed by regulatory delays and reality checks. While neratinib eventually reached the market, the story illustrates the unpredictable nature of clinical development and serves as a useful case study in managing expectations for biotech investments and drug development timelines.
