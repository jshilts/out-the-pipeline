# Drug Approvals 2010 (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article provides a brief analysis of new drug approvals by the FDA in 2010, noting that the year saw 21 new drug approvals. This figure was lower than the previous two years (25 in 2009 and 24 in 2008), but better than 2007's 18 approvals, placing 2010 within the typical range observed over the preceding decade. The author characterizes 2010 as neither particularly good nor outstandingly bad for drug approvals, highlighting 2004 as an anomalous year with approvals in the low 30s for unclear reasons. The commentary concludes by suggesting that this level of drug development—while better than worst-case scenarios—remained insufficient given the concurrent cost-cutting and job reductions occurring in the pharmaceutical industry, making the maintenance of the decade's average approval rate "nothing to celebrate."

## 2. HISTORY

The article's publication in early 2011 preceded significant changes in FDA drug approval patterns over the subsequent decade:

**FDA Approval Trends (2011-2023):**
- 2011: 30 approvals (surpassed 2004's "weirdo" high)
- 2012-2015: Continued growth with 39, 27, 41, and 45 approvals respectively
- 2015: Marked the highest approval count since the article was written
- 2018: Another significant peak with 59 novel drug approvals
- 2023: 55 novel drugs approved

The period from 2011-2023 saw substantial increases in drug approvals compared to the 2000s baseline described in the article. FDA data shows a clear upward trend, with the decade average rising significantly above the "teens and low 20s" range referenced in the original post.

**FDA Policy Changes:**
The FDA implemented reforms that accelerated approvals, including expanded use of breakthrough therapy designations, accelerated approval pathways, and regulatory flexibility for serious and life-threatening conditions.

**Industry Impact:**
The steady increase in approvals correlated with growth in pharmaceutical R&D investment and pipeline expansion, though concerns about drug pricing and access intensified during this period. The biopharmaceutical sector experienced considerable growth, with many more approved therapies entering the market annually compared to the 2000s baseline.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Prediction:** The article suggested that drug approval rates would likely continue within the "recent range" of the previous decade (typically in the teens or low 20s).

**Actual Outcome:** This prediction proved inaccurate. Beginning in 2011, the very next year, drug approvals exceeded 30, breaking the historical pattern. The subsequent decade consistently saw approval rates well above the article's baseline expectations, often exceeding 40-50 approvals annually—more than double the rates from the 2000s.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article primarily serves as a brief historical data point with limited broader significance, documenting a momentary snapshot that was soon contradicted by subsequent FDA approval trends.
