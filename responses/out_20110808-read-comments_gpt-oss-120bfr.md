# Read the Comments (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a brief note dated 8 August 2011 urging readers to look at the comment thread attached to a Science Magazine “Pipeline” article titled “Bernard Munos rides again.” The author claims that the comments are “of extremely high quality” and that they contain the thoughts of many knowledgeable people about the problems facing the pharmaceutical industry and possible solutions. Apart from this recommendation, the post contains no substantive analysis or new information.

## 2. HISTORY  
After the 2011 discussion, the broader debate about drug‑development productivity that Bernard Munos helped spark continued to evolve:

* **Policy and funding:** The United States passed the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and increased NIH support for translational research, partly in response to longstanding concerns about the “valley of death” in drug development.  
* **Industry response:** Large pharma companies have gradually adopted more open‑innovation models, external collaborations, and adaptive trial designs, but the fundamental R&D cost curve has remained steep.  
* **Bernard Munos:** He remained an active commentator, publishing later papers (e.g., “The drug discovery and development landscape in 2020”) that reiterated many of the same critiques. No single policy or industry shift can be directly traced to the 2011 comment thread.  
* **Scientific discourse:** The Science Pipeline comment section became a frequently cited example of a high‑quality online discussion among experts, but it did not lead to a concrete, measurable change in practice or regulation.

Overall, the comment served as a pointer to a lively discussion rather than a catalyst for specific outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The comment itself does not contain explicit predictions, so there are none to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10** – The note is essentially a meta‑comment directing readers elsewhere; its intrinsic content is minimal, though the linked discussion was valuable to a niche audience.
