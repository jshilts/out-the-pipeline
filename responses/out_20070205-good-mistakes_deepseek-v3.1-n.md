# Good Mistakes? (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2007 commentary by Derek Lowe critiques a University of Rochester press release announcing a potential new class of anticancer drugs discovered through a laboratory mistake. The research found that PPAR-gamma antagonist compounds had unexpected toxic effects on tumor cell lines by disrupting the tubulin system—a structural protein critical for cell division and the target of existing cancer drugs like Taxol. The discovery suggested a novel mechanism for tubulin disruption different from known pathways, making it scientifically interesting.

However, Lowe expressed significant skepticism about the therapeutic potential. He noted that the effective concentrations used in cell culture were extremely high (10-100 micromolar), far beyond achievable blood levels in humans. Even the most potent compounds showed no activity below 1 micromolar. Lowe emphasized that while the scientific mechanism was worth investigating, the practical drug development prospects were poor given the dose requirements and the notorious complexity of PPAR nuclear receptor biology.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent history largely validated Lowe's skepticism and demonstrated the wisdom of his cautious analysis:

**PPAR-gamma Research Trajectory:**
- PPAR-gamma remained a challenging drug target due to its complex biology and pleiotropic effects on gene expression
- Despite ongoing research, no PPAR-gamma antagonists reached FDA approval for cancer treatment
- The field continued to struggle with the fundamental challenge Lowe identified: separating desired therapeutic effects from numerous off-target consequences

**Drug Development Reality:**
- The high-dose concern proved prescient; achieving 10-100 micromolar systemic concentrations in humans is generally not feasible or safe
- Many drug candidates fail during development precisely because of such pharmacokinetic and toxicity challenges

**Outcome for the Rochester Discovery:**
- The specific research did not lead to approved cancer drugs based on available information
- No major pharmaceutical development programs emerged from this mechanism for cancer therapy
- The work contributed to basic research understanding of tubulin biology but had limited translational impact

**Broader PPAR Field Developments:**
- PPAR-targeted drugs found some success in metabolic diseases (diabetes) rather than oncology
- Compounds like pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (PPAR-gamma agonists, opposite mechanism) were approved for diabetes
- The complexity Lowe described continued to limit PPAR drug development across therapeutic areas

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **Prediction**: The high concentrations required (10-100 micromolar) made this approach unlikely to succeed as a practical cancer treatment
  - **Outcome**: **CORRECT**. No drugs emerged from this approach, validating Lowe's concern about dose requirements

• **Prediction**: The PPAR system was too complex and unpredictable for reliable drug targeting
  - **Outcome**: **MOSTLY CORRECT**. PPAR-targeted drug development faced numerous failures, though some diabetes drugs succeeded

• **Prediction**: The real value was in understanding the mechanism rather than immediate therapeutic potential
  - **Outcome**: **CORRECT**. The research contributed to basic science but lacked translational impact

• **Prediction**: Other PPAR-targeting approaches would continue to show conflicting results (some helping cancer, others potentially worsening it)
  - **Outcome**: **CORRECT**. The field remained inconsistent, with different PPAR modulators showing varying and sometimes opposite effects

• **Implicit prediction**: Laboratory mistakes, while scientifically interesting, rarely translate directly to clinical success without extensive additional development
  - **Outcome**: **GENERALLY TRUE** across drug discovery, with very few "accidental discoveries" leading directly to approved drugs without substantial refinement

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This commentary demonstrates exceptional scientific literacy and predictive value, showcasing how expert knowledge in drug discovery can assess research claims against realistic development constraints. Lowe's ability to distinguish interesting science from viable therapeutics provided prescient analysis that time proved correct.
