# A Brief Note About Alzheimer's (Mar 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reports that Biogen and Eisai announced the termination of their Phase III trials of aducanumab, an anti‑amyloid monoclonal antibody, after an independent monitoring committee deemed further treatment futile. The piece reiterates the author’s long‑standing skepticism toward amyloid‑targeting therapies, arguing that repeated failures of such drugs demonstrate a fundamental flaw in the amyloid hypothesis. The author calls for a shift away from amyloid‑centric approaches, suggesting that the field has been “wrong for a long time.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑trial developments (2019‑2024)**  

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Oct 2019** | Biogen released a re‑analysis of the two halted trials (EMERGE and ENGAGE). EMERGE met its primary endpoint (clinical‑cognitive decline) at the highest dose, while ENGAGE remained negative. | Sparked renewed optimism and a decision to seek regulatory approval despite the earlier futility stop. |
| **Feb 2020** | Biogen submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for aducanumab (brand name **Aduhelm**). | Initiated the formal review process. |
| **Jun 2021** | The FDA granted **accelerated approval** to aducanumab, citing its ability to reduce amyloid plaques (a surrogate endpoint). | First disease‑modifying Alzheimer’s drug approved in the U.S. in decades; generated intense controversy over the evidentiary standard. |
| **2021‑2022** | Medicare’s Coverage Determination (CMS) initially denied routine coverage, limiting reimbursement to clinical‑trial settings. Several private insurers followed suit or offered limited coverage. | Restricted patient access and led to financial strain on Biogen; the drug’s market uptake remained modest (estimated < 5 % of eligible patients). |
| **Jan 2023** | **Lecanemab** (Leqembi), another amyloid‑targeting antibody (Eisai/Biogen), received traditional FDA approval after demonstrating a modest but statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline in a Phase III trial (CLARITY‑AD). | Demonstrated that at least one amyloid antibody could meet conventional efficacy thresholds, reinforcing a more nuanced view of the amyloid hypothesis. |
| **2023‑2024** | **Donanemab** (Eli Lilly) completed its Phase III trial (TRAILBLAZER‑ALZ 2) with positive results; FDA review is ongoing. | Adds further evidence that certain amyloid‑targeting strategies may be clinically beneficial when administered early and at appropriate dosing. |
| **Policy & industry** | The FDA’s accelerated‑approval pathway for aducanumab prompted congressional hearings and a 2022 FDA guidance clarifying evidentiary expectations for surrogate endpoints. | Influenced how future neuro‑degenerative therapies are evaluated and reimbursed. |
| **Business outcomes** | Biogen’s stock surged after the 2021 approval but fell sharply after CMS coverage limitations and mixed real‑world uptake; the company later wrote down billions of dollars related to aducanumab. | Highlighted the financial risk of betting heavily on a single amyloid antibody. |

Overall, the initial “failure” announced in March 2019 was later reframed as a partial success, leading to the first FDA‑approved amyloid antibody (aducanumab) and, subsequently, to the approval of lecanemab. While the clinical benefit remains modest, the field has not abandoned amyloid targeting; instead, it has refined patient selection (earlier disease stages) and dosing strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implicitly or explicitly made the following forecasts:

- **Prediction:** *All amyloid‑targeting antibodies will continue to fail; the amyloid hypothesis is fundamentally flawed.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially incorrect. Aducanumab received accelerated approval (2021) despite controversy, and lecanemab achieved traditional approval (2023) with a modest but real clinical effect. The amyloid hypothesis remains central, though now viewed as one component of a multifactorial disease model.

- **Prediction:** *Biogen/Eisai’s attempt would be a “futile” dead‑end, and the companies would suffer.*  
  **Outcome:** The companies did experience a major setback (stock volatility, CMS reimbursement limits, large write‑downs), but they also secured a historic FDA approval and retained a pipeline of amyloid antibodies (e.g., lecanemab). The “dead‑end” characterization was overstated.

- **Prediction:** *No future amyloid‑focused therapy would succeed, regardless of dosing or patient selection.*  
  **Outcome:** Incorrect. Both lecanemab and donanemab (pending) have shown that earlier intervention and optimized dosing can yield measurable benefits, suggesting that the hypothesis can be operationalized successfully under specific conditions.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article captures a pivotal moment— the abrupt halting of a high‑profile Phase III trial— and its hindsight analysis intersects with a dramatic regulatory reversal, making it highly relevant for understanding how scientific expectations, trial design, and policy interact in modern biotech.
