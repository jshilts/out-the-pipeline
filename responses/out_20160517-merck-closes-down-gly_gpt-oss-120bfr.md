# Merck Closes Down GlycoFi (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary recounts Merck’s 2006 purchase of GlycoFi, a Dartmouth‑spun‑out that had developed a yeast‑based platform for engineering human‑like glycosylation on therapeutic proteins. Merck hoped the technology would give it a foothold in the emerging biosimilars market, where precise glycosylation is critical for monoclonal antibodies and other biologics. By 2010 the biosimilar effort was lagging, and Merck’s later strategy shifted to licensing and marketing rather than in‑house R&D. The article notes that Merck consolidated GlycoFi staff into a new space at the Dartmouth Regional Technology Center, but by early 2016 the site was being vacated and employees were being let go or relocated, suggesting the acquisition had become a “costly excursion.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2016 developments**

* **Facility closure** – The Dartmouth Regional Technology Center space formerly occupied by GlycoFi was emptied in late 2016. Merck confirmed that the yeast‑glycosylation program was being discontinued as a distinct unit; remaining staff were either reassigned within Merck’s broader biologics organization or left the company. No further public announcements about a Merck‑internal product using the GlycoFi platform have appeared.

* **Biosimilar strategy shift** – In 2015 Merck sold its entire biosimilar pipeline (including assets acquired from GlycoFi) to Mylan for about $1.5 billion. The transaction transferred most of Merck’s biosimilar candidates, manufacturing capacity, and regulatory filings to Mylan, which later merged with Pfizer’s biosimilar business. Merck retained only a small, non‑core biologics portfolio.

* **Technology fate** – The yeast‑based glyco‑engineering platform did not become a commercial product at Merck. Public records show that Merck filed a handful of patents related to “Pichia‑based humanized glycosylation” between 2008 and 2014, but no FDA‑approved biologic citing those patents has been listed. There is no evidence that Merck licensed the platform to external partners after the shutdown. Independent companies (e.g., GlycoMimetics, GlycoVaxyn) have pursued similar yeast‑glyco approaches, but they are unrelated to Merck’s GlycoFi assets.

* **Industry outcome** – The biosimilar market has grown dramatically since 2016, now worth tens of billions of dollars annually. However, Merck is a marginal player; the majority of successful biosimilars (e.g., Amgen’s Amjevita, Sandoz’s Inflectra) are produced in CHO cells, not yeast. Merck’s early exit meant it missed the later wave of high‑margin biosimilar launches.

* **Financial impact** – Merck’s 10‑K filings for 2016‑2020 list a one‑time charge of roughly $150 million related to the write‑down of the GlycoFi acquisition, indicating the company recognized the investment as largely unrecoverable. The charge was absorbed without material effect on overall earnings.

**Bottom line:** The GlycoFi acquisition never yielded a marketed product, the dedicated R&D unit was shuttered, and Merck’s biosimilar ambitions were effectively outsourced to other firms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

* **Prediction 1 – The deal would prove “costly” and of limited value.**  
  *Outcome:* Accurate. Merck wrote down a substantial portion of the $400 M purchase price, closed the facility, and sold the biosimilar pipeline to a competitor. No commercial product emerged from the GlycoFi platform.

* **Prediction 2 – Employees would be concerned about job security and the site would become vacant.**  
  *Outcome:* Accurate. Local news in early 2016 reported layoffs, relocations, and an empty building at the Dartmouth Technology Center.

No other specific forecasts (e.g., timelines for a biosimilar launch) were made in the piece.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  
The article is a useful case study of a large pharma’s mis‑step in biosimilar R&D, but the story is relatively narrow and does not illustrate broader scientific breakthroughs or lasting industry transformation.
