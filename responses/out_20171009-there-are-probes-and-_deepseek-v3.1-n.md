# There Are Probes, And There Are Probes (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary critiques a Nature Oncology paper studying Rpn11, a metalloprotease deubiquitinating enzyme involved in protein degradation at the proteasome. The article highlights that while Rpn11 is a promising cancer drug target—especially for bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma—the researchers used ortho-phenanthroline (OPA), a non-selective metal chelator, as an "Rpn11 inhibitor" in both cell assays and mouse xenograft studies.

The author argues that calling OPA an "Rpn11 inhibitor" is misleading because it indiscriminately binds multiple metal ions and likely affects numerous cellular processes beyond Rpn11 inhibition. The commentary emphasizes the critical difference between a truly selective chemical probe and a crude tool, noting that a better, more selective Rpn11 inhibitor had already been developed and published, making the choice of OPA questionable for establishing therapeutic potential.

## 2. HISTORY
The Rpn11 target validation work continued after 2017, though with mixed translational outcomes. Several groups pursued selective Rpn11 inhibitors beyond the crude metal chelator criticized in the article:

- **Capz cargo** (the selective probe mentioned as already developed) demonstrated more convincing target validation in multiple myeloma models, avoiding the pan-metal chelating liabilities of OPA.

- **Clinical translation challenges**: Despite promising preclinical data with improved Rpn11 inhibitors, no Rpn11-targeting drug has received FDA approval for cancer treatment as of 2024. The proteasome inhibitor class remains dominated by bortezomib and its successors (carfilzomib, ixazomib), but these target the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity, not Rpn11.

- **Deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitor field growth**: While Rpn11 inhibitors stalled, other DUB inhibitors advanced further in clinical development for oncology, particularly USP7 and USP14 inhibitors.

- **Compound development**: Academic and pharmaceutical efforts produced additional Rpn11 inhibitors with improved selectivity profiles, but these have not translated into approved therapies.

- **Target validation confirmation**: Subsequent research confirmed Rpn11's importance in proteasome function and its potential as a cancer target, particularly in hematologic malignancies, but therapeutic exploitation remains challenging due to on-target toxicity concerns.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The commentary made several implicit predictions:

• **Prediction: Selective Rpn11 inhibitors would provide better therapeutic validation than crude metal chelators.**
  - **Outcome**: Largely **validated**. More selective inhibitors were developed and showed clearer mechanisms, though clinical development stalled.

• **Prediction: Referring to non-selective compounds as specific inhibitors creates problems for future literature interpretation.**
  - **Outcome**: **Validated**. The chemical biology field increasingly emphasized probe quality, with initiatives like the Chemical Probes Portal gaining importance.

• **Prediction: Better chemical probes were needed and would advance understanding more rapidly.**
  - **Outcome**: **Partially validated**. Improved probes were developed, but they did not lead to breakthrough therapies or rapid clinical translation.

• **Prediction: The field would need to address selectivity to develop viable Rpn11-targeting drugs.**
  - **Outcome**: **Validated in principle, but not in practice**. While the field improved selectivity, clinical translation has not occurred, suggesting additional barriers beyond compound selectivity.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 6/10**

The article remains relevant for highlighting the critical importance of probe quality and selectivity in target validation. The specific Rpn11 case illustrates a broader challenge in chemical biology and drug discovery that persists today, where compound selectivity and rigorous validation remains crucial.
