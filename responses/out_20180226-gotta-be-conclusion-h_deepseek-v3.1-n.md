# Gotta Be a Conclusion In Here Somewhere (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the unfolding scandal around Brian Wansink, an endowed chair at Cornell University and former head of the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion at the USDA, whose nutrition research was facing increasing scrutiny. The controversy began when Wansink described on his blog how a "failed study" with "null results" was reanalyzed repeatedly by a graduate student until "solutions that held up" emerged—a practice known as p-hacking or data dredging that violates proper research methodology.

This led to investigations revealing approximately 150 inconsistencies across four papers from Wansink's lab, with impossible statistical values (degrees of freedom larger than sample sizes, inconsistent F and t statistics). Multiple retractions followed in 2017, and subsequent reporting revealed that Wansink's lab systematically mined datasets for attention-grabbing results, strategized to publish subpar studies in low-standards journals, and framed findings specifically to generate viral media coverage. The article notes this as part of a broader reproducibility crisis in social science research, particularly problematic in human nutrition studies where measuring human behavior is inherently noisy and difficult.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the Wansink scandal continued to escalate significantly:

**Retractions and Investigations:**
- By 2020, Wansink had **18 papers retracted** and multiple others corrected, representing one of the largest retraction clusters in nutrition research history
- Cornell University conducted an investigation that found evidence of research misconduct, including falsification and fabrication of data
- Wansink **resigned from Cornell** in September 2018 and formally retired in June 2019

**Institutional Changes:**
- The scandal prompted broader discussions about research integrity in nutrition science and psychology
- Many of Wansink's widely-cited findings about eating behavior (such as smaller plate sizes reducing consumption) were called into question and failed to replicate
- The case became a textbook example in research ethics courses about p-hacking and questionable research practices

**Scientific Impact:**
- The field of nutrition research faced increased scrutiny regarding methodological rigor
- The reproducibility crisis in social psychology and nutrition studies became more widely acknowledged
- Wansink's extensive media presence, with appearances on major news outlets and popular books, meant these retractions had broader public impact on nutrition advice people had received

The scandal represented a concrete example of systematic research misconduct affecting policy recommendations, rather than a single isolated case, demonstrating the real-world consequences of poor research practices in nutrition science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about how this case would develop. Instead, it focused on describing an ongoing scandal that was already in progress when published in February 2018.

However, the article did implicitly suggest this type of research culture was more widespread than just one lab, noting "some of the other activity described is all too familiar" and wondering "what a lot of other labs' internal emails might look like if published at Buzzfeed." The broader concern about reproducibility issues in social science research was well-founded, though this particular case turned out to be more severe (involving clear misconduct) than typical questionable research practices.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article addresses a significant research misconduct scandal with real policy implications (given Wansink's USDA role) and exemplifies broader reproducibility problems in nutrition science. The case eventually resulted in one of the largest retraction clusters and led to institutional consequences at a major university, making it impactful beyond just a niche academic dispute.
