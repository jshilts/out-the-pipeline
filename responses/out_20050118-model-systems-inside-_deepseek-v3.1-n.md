# Model Systems, From Inside and Out (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article identifies a fundamental challenge in drug development: clinical compounds increasingly fail due to lack of efficacy rather than traditional pharmacokinetic or toxicity issues. The author notes that as drug discovery has become more mechanism-driven, failures result from incomplete understanding of disease biology rather than poor compound properties.

Key problems highlighted include:
- Reliance on mechanistically compelling targets that don't translate to clinical benefit (examples: dopamine D3 ligands for schizophrenia, leptin for obesity, renin inhibitors for hypertension)
- Poor predictive value of animal models, particularly in oncology where numerous models exist but don't reliably predict human efficacy
- The author cites Iressa (gefitinib) as an example—effective in animal models but with limited real-world success
- The piece references David Horrobin's critique comparing parts of drug discovery to Hesse's "Glass Bead Game"—intellectually elegant but disconnected from clinical reality

## 2. HISTORY

**Iressa's trajectory validated the article's concerns.** Gefitinib received accelerated FDA approval in 2003 for refractory non-small cell lung cancer based on surrogate endpoints, but confirmatory trials (ISEL, 2005) failed to show survival benefit in unselected populations. The drug was subsequently restricted in the US (2005) and withdrawn in many markets. Only later was it understood that Iressa works primarily in patients with EGFR activating mutations (discovered 2004-2005), explaining the discrepancy between models and clinical outcomes.

**The mechanistic failures cited proved prescient:**
- Dopamine D3 antagonists largely failed in schizophrenia clinical trials through the mid-2000s to early 2010s
- Leptin therapy had minimal efficacy for common obesity; understanding evolved to recognize leptin resistance mechanisms
- Renin inhibitors: Aliskiren (Tekturna) was approved in 2007 but showed limited advantages over existing RAS inhibitors and raised safety concerns in outcome trials (ALTITUDE, 2012), leading to restricted use
- Angiogenesis inhibitors: While bevacizumab succeeded in certain cancers, many highly targeted anti-angiogenic compounds under development in 2005 failed in subsequent trials, validating the author's skepticism

**Animal model limitations became more widely acknowledged.** The 2000s-2010s saw increasing recognition that rodent cancer models poorly recapitulate human tumor biology, particularly tumor microenvironment, immune context, and heterogeneity. This led to greater emphasis on patient-derived xenografts, humanized mouse models, and ultimately precision oncology approaches.

**The broader efficacy failure crisis deepened.** Industry data confirms that Phase II failure rates for lack of efficacy remained stubbornly high (around 60-70%) through the 2010s, with oncology having particularly poor success rates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

### **Prediction: Animal models in oncology would continue to poorly predict human efficacy**
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate.** The next 15+ years saw widespread acknowledgment that traditional xenograft models fail to predict clinical success. Multiple oncology drugs with excellent preclinical data failed in trials. The field gradually shifted toward more complex models (PDX, organoids, humanized mice), but predictive value remains limited.

### **Prediction: Mechanistically elegant targets (dopamine D3, leptin pathway, renin) would continue to disappoint**
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate.**
  - Dopamine D3 antagonists failed in multiple schizophrenia trials (2005-2015)
  - Leptin-based obesity therapies never achieved broad success
  - Aliskiren saw limited adoption due to modest benefits and safety concerns

### **Prediction: Iressa's model-versus-reality disconnect was symptomatic of broader issues**
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate.** Iressa's story became emblematic of precision medicine's importance—drugs work in molecularly defined subsets. This reinforced that "relevant models" must account for human molecular heterogeneity, not just tumor growth inhibition in standard models.

### **Prediction: Cancer therapeutic area needed "revamp" most urgently**
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate but oversimplified.** Oncology drug development did undergo transformation, but mainly through genomics-driven approaches rather than better animal models. Success rates improved modestly through biomarker-guided development, but overall Phase II success rates for oncology remained the lowest of any therapeutic area as of 2020.

### **Implied prediction: "Glass Bead Game" problem would worsen without fundamental changes**
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Partially accurate.** The issue persisted, but solutions emerged through different approaches than anticipated:
  - Better target validation using human genetics (e.g., GWAS, functional genomics)
  - Focus on human cellular models and organoids
  - Adaptive trial designs incorporating biomarkers
  - However, many drug discovery programs still rely heavily on internally consistent but clinically irrelevant model systems

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional prescience about core challenges in translational medicine that remained relevant for the next two decades. Its specific examples became textbook cases of drug development failures, and the fundamental issues identified—poor model predictivity and mechanism-reality gaps—became central themes in discussions of pharmaceutical R&D productivity through the 2010s and beyond.
