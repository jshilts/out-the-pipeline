# R&D Is For Losers? (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary argued that Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ “no‑R&D” strategy—cutting research staff, slashing internal discovery budgets, and growing mainly through acquisitions and aggressive price‑raising—could be a viable model for the whole industry. The author noted Valeant’s hostile bid for Cephalon and quoted CEO Michael Pearson’s claim that the company was “not into high‑science R&D; we’re into making money.” He suggested that the sector might eventually split into two camps: firms that focus on research and firms that act only as sales and licensing engines. The piece also mentioned that other big players (Pfizer, J&J, Merck) were moving in opposite directions, hinting at a possible bifurcation of strategies.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Valeant / Bausch Health  
* **Acquisition of Cephalon** – Valeant’s hostile bid never succeeded; instead, Cephalon was bought by **Teva Pharmaceutical Industries** in December 2011 for ≈ $6.8 billion.  
* **Growth through price hikes** – Between 2012 and 2015 Valeant’s share price rose > 400 % as it acquired niche drugs (e.g., **Xyrem**, **Kadian**) and dramatically increased their list prices.  
* **Regulatory and legal fallout** – In 2015 the U.S. Senate investigated Valeant’s pricing practices and its relationship with specialty pharmacy **Philidor**. The SEC and state regulators launched probes, leading to a 2016 settlement (≈ $45 million) and a sharp stock collapse (from ~ $260 to < $30).  
* **Leadership change & strategic shift** – Michael Pearson resigned in 2016; the company rebranded as **Bausch Health Companies** in 2018. The new management announced a “re‑balance” toward **organic R&D**, investing ≈ $1 billion annually by 2022 and acquiring a few early‑stage pipelines (e.g., **Aesther** in 2020).  
* **Current status (2024‑2026)** – Bausch Health still generates most revenue from legacy products and price‑driven sales; its internal pipeline remains modest, with only a handful of Phase II/III candidates (e.g., a topical anti‑inflammatory). The “no‑R&D” model has not been sustained as the sole growth engine.

### Industry‑wide R&D trends  
* **Continued heavy R&D spending** – From 2011 to 2023, the top ten pharma companies collectively spent > $150 billion on R&D, with the average R&D‑to‑sales ratio staying around 15‑20 %.  
* **M&A and in‑licensing** – While acquisitions remain common (e.g., **Pfizer‑Wyeth**, **J&J‑Actelion**, **Merck‑Immunex**), they are typically paired with internal development programs rather than pure “sell‑only” models.  
* **Rise of “virtual” biotech** – A growing number of small companies focus exclusively on discovery and outsource development, but they usually partner with large pharma that still maintains its own R&D infrastructure.  
* **Policy and pricing reforms** – The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced drug‑price negotiation for Medicare, curbing the profitability of pure price‑inflation strategies. European price‑control measures also intensified, reducing the attractiveness of Valeant‑style tactics.  

### Outcome of the “split” hypothesis  
* No major pharma has abandoned internal R&D in favor of a pure sales/licensing role.  
* Companies that attempted to minimize R&D (e.g., **Valeant**, **Mylan** pre‑2020) either reverted to research or faced severe market and regulatory backlash.  
* The industry has instead moved toward **hybrid models**: robust internal pipelines complemented by external in‑licensing, strategic collaborations, and acquisition of promising assets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Valeant could succeed by ditching R&D and focusing on acquisitions/price hikes** | Valeant grew rapidly for a few years but then collapsed under regulatory, legal, and reputational pressure; it later re‑added R&D and rebranded. | **Incorrect** – short‑term success, long‑term failure. |
| **Cephalon would become a Valeant asset** | Cephalon was acquired by **Teva**, not Valeant. | **Incorrect**. |
| **The industry might split into “R&D‑only” and “sales‑only” camps** | No clear bifurcation occurred. Large firms kept both functions; smaller “virtual” biotech emerged but still rely on big pharma for commercialization. | **Incorrect**. |
| **Merck would double‑down on its own research while others cut back** | Merck continued to invest heavily in R&D (e.g., Keytruda, Lenvatinib) and maintained a large pipeline; however, it also pursued many acquisitions (e.g., **AstraZeneca’s** oncology assets). | **Partially correct** – Merck kept R&D, but the industry overall did not polarize. |
| **Pfizer and J&J would pursue large acquisitions to compensate for R&D cuts** | Pfizer completed the **Wyeth** (2009) and later **Array BioPharma** (2019) deals; J&J acquired **Actelion** (2017) and **Cereno** (2022). Both continued sizable R&D programs. | **Partially correct** – acquisitions happened, but R&D was not abandoned. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of a controversial business model that sparked a high‑profile industry debate, and its predictions provide a clear case study of why a “no‑R&D” strategy is unsustainable at scale. It is not groundbreaking science, but its relevance to pharma strategy and subsequent scandals makes it notably interesting.
