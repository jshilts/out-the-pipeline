# Chemical Warfare in Syria? (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from December 2012 addressed growing concerns that Syria's government might deploy its chemical weapons stockpiles during the ongoing conflict. The author referenced warnings to the Syrian government not to use these weapons and cited their historical use primarily against defenseless populations—including mustard gas attacks in Morocco (1920s), Ethiopia (1930s), and Yemen (1960s), as well as Saddam Hussein's notorious nerve gas attacks on Kurdish populations in Northern Iraq. The author's thesis was that chemical weapons had proven largely ineffective against "competent and prepared opponents," with their historical deployment mainly constituting atrocities against vulnerable civilian populations who could not retaliate.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent years after this article's publication saw devastating and tragically prescient developments. In August 2013, less than a year after this commentary, the Ghouta chemical attack occurred in Damascus suburbs, killing hundreds to over a thousand civilians with sarin gas. Multiple sources, including UN investigations, attributed responsibility to Syrian government forces, directly contradicting the article's implication that chemical weapons would primarily be ineffective. This attack led to the Obama administration's threatened military intervention, which was averted through a US-Russia diplomatic agreement that resulted in Syria joining the Chemical Weapons Convention and ostensibly destroying its declared chemical weapons stockpile under Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) supervision.

However, chemical weapons use in Syria continued. Between 2014-2018, numerous attacks occurred, notably including chlorine gas attacks which were not covered by the initial disarmament agreement. The OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism later confirmed Syrian government responsibility for multiple chemical attacks. These incidents demonstrated that chemical weapons remained militarily relevant in the Syrian conflict context and that international disarmament efforts were incomplete.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: Chemical weapons would likely only be used against defenseless populations who "couldn't retaliate."  
  **Reality**: This prediction proved accurate—the deadliest uses (Ghouta 2013) primarily targeted civilian populations in rebel-held areas.

- **Implication**: Against "competent and prepared opponents," chemical weapons would be "essentially useless"  
  **Reality**: The Syrian conflict did not feature symmetrical warfare between equally equipped opponents, so this doctrine remained untested in the specific conflict dynamics.

- **Expressed hope**: "Let's hope that no one is going to add another entry to that list"  
  **Reality**: Tragically, numerous entries were added to the chemical weapons attack list between 2013-2018.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3/9**

The article addressed an imminent crisis with accurate historical framing but lacked the predictive power to anticipate the scale and persistence of chemical weapons use that would follow. While it correctly identified the pattern of targeting civilians, it underestimated both the military willingness to deploy these weapons and the limitations of international response mechanisms.
