# Going After Poor Published Research (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on John Ioannidis, known for exposing poorly reproducible published research, who is founding an institute at Stanford to improve research quality. The initiative plans to create a "journal watch" system to monitor scientific publishers and pressure them toward better practices. It also aims to educate policymakers and governments to prevent decisions based on flawed research. The center's mission is described as "Identifying and minimising persistent threats to medical-research quality," with the author expressing hope that this will lead to better research outcomes.

## 2. HISTORY
John Ioannidis did establish the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS) in 2014, focusing on research quality, reproducibility, and transparency. This coincided with and contributed to the growing "replication crisis" awareness across biomedical and psychological sciences.

In the decade that followed, several major developments occurred:
- **FDA policy changes**: The FDA increased scrutiny of published literature in regulatory submissions, implementing stricter evidence standards and requiring more transparency about study design, conflicts of interest, and data sharing.
- **Clinical impact**: Numerous high-profile cases emerged where published findings failed replication, affecting drug development programs. Several clinical trials based on published preclinical studies were halted or redesigned when foundational research proved unreliable.
- **Research practice reforms**: Major funders (NIH, Wellcome Trust) and journals implemented requirements for pre-registration, data sharing, and conflict-of-interest disclosures.
- **Industry adoption**: Pharmaceutical companies increased internal replication efforts and became more cautious about building drug programs solely on published academic findings.
- **The METRICS center**: Became a leading voice in meta-research, producing influential studies on research waste, publication bias, and methodological quality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **The "journal watch" monitoring system**: While no formal system exactly matching this description emerged, the principles influenced watchdog efforts like Retraction Watch and increased media scrutiny of scientific publishing.
• **Pressuring publishers for better behavior**: This largely materialized—major publishers (Nature, Science, Elsevier) implemented stricter peer review, reproducibility checks, and data availability requirements.
• **Influencing policymakers to avoid flaky studies**: Achieved partial success; regulatory agencies became more systematic in evidence evaluation, though policy decisions still sometimes rely on imperfect evidence.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 9/10**

This article highlights a critical turning point in research integrity that reshaped how biomedical research is conducted, regulated, and published over the subsequent decade, with direct consequences for drug development and patient care.
