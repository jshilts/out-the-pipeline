# Fix The Nobels Already (February 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques the evolution of the Nobel Prize system, particularly focusing on how the Chemistry Prize has increasingly recognized achievements in life sciences rather than traditional chemistry. The author cites a detailed academic paper that documents this shift, noting that the Chemistry Prize has effectively become a "Chemistry or the Life Sciences" award through deliberate committee decisions over decades.

The piece highlights historical inconsistencies in Nobel administration, including past posthumous awards (1931 Literature, 1961 Peace) that violated Nobel's will before rules were changed in 1974, and the 1968 addition of the Economics prize by the Swedish Central Bank. The article argues that since the Nobel Foundation has already modified prize administration multiple times, they should openly acknowledge and formalize these changes rather than maintaining a "patchwork" system that creates unfairness and controversy.

## 2. HISTORY

Since February 2020, there has been no public indication that the Nobel Foundation has implemented major structural reforms to address the concerns raised in this article. The Chemistry Prize has continued to recognize work at the chemistry-biology interface:

- **2020**: Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna won for CRISPR gene editing—a fundamentally biological/molecular biology breakthrough
- **2021**: Benjamin List and David MacMillan won for organocatalysis (asymmetric organocatalysis)—representing a return to more traditional chemistry
- **2022**: Carolyn Bertozzi, Morten Meldal, and Barry Sharpless for click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry—chemistry tools with biological applications
- **2023**: Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus, and Alexei Ekimov for quantum dots—materials chemistry/physics
- **2024**: Too recent for reliable analysis of trends

The pattern confirms rather than resolves the article's central concern: the Chemistry Prize continues to alternate between traditional chemistry and chemistry-applied-to-biology work, maintaining the ambiguity the author criticized.

No new prize categories have been established, and the "three or fewer laureates" rule remains unchanged. The Nobel Foundation has not announced any plans for the systematic modernization the article advocated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions about Nobel Prize reform:

• **"The question is not if but when. Today's packaging of the Nobel Prizes must change"** - This prediction of imminent structural reform has not materialized. Six years later, the Nobel system remains essentially unchanged in its categories, committee structure, and award limits.

• **The Chemistry Prize would continue its drift toward life sciences** - This prediction has been validated. While 2021 (organocatalysis) and 2023 (quantum dots) represented traditional chemistry, 2020 (CRISPR) and 2022 (click chemistry/bioorthogonal chemistry) continued the pattern of chemistry prizes for biological applications.

• **Without reform, controversies would continue cheapening the prizes** - This has partially played out. While the Chemistry Prize hasn't generated major public scandals, the broader Nobel system has faced ongoing controversies in Peace and especially Literature prizes, validating the author's concern about award credibility.

• **The Nobel Foundation would eventually need to openly acknowledge and formalize changes** - This has not happened. The Foundation continues to operate under the existing framework without the transparent modernization the author advocated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses a real and persistent issue in science recognition—the blurring boundaries between traditional disciplines and how award systems adapt (or fail to adapt) to evolving science. However, the topic is somewhat narrow (focusing on chemistry/life sciences overlap within one specific award) and the proposed reforms have not gained traction, limiting its broader impact.
