# 2018 Drug Approvals: A Closer Look (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines the FDA's 59 new drug approvals in 2018 (up from 46 in 2017), noting that about two-thirds were small molecules. The author highlights the heterogeneity of these approvals, contrasting long-delayed drugs like stiripentol (discovered 1978), amifampridine (used since the 1980s), and migalastat (isolated 1988) with breakthrough innovations like larotrectinib (approved in under four years from first-in-human) and patisiran (the first RNAi therapeutic).

A key observation is that 34 of the 59 approvals (over half) were for rare/orphan diseases, characterized as "amazing science one-offs" that help small patient populations at great expense but have limited public health impact. The article then examines the economic sustainability of drug development, citing IDEA Pharma data from 2013-2017 showing that even top-ten innovative companies averaged only one approval per year, with both top and bottom companies spending approximately $6 billion per approval. Of 217 drugs approved during that period, only 6 achieved cumulative sales of $6+ billion, and only 48 reached $1+ billion. The author questions whether the biopharma investment model is sustainable given that most approved drugs fail to recoup their R&D costs.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in this 2019 article largely continued or intensified in subsequent years:

**FDA Approval Patterns:**
- 2019-2021 maintained high approval numbers (48, 53, and 50-60 range respectively), continuing the trend of robust regulatory output.
- Orphan/rare disease drugs continued dominating: by 2021, orphan drugs represented approximately 50-60% of novel drug approvals, validating the article's observation about industry focus shifting toward rare diseases.
- RNAi therapeutics saw continued expansion with additional approvals beyond Onpattro (patisiran), including Givlaari (givosiran) in 2019 and Oxlumo (lumasiran) in 2020.

**Specific Drugs Mentioned:**
- **Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi)**: Maintained its TRK fusion tumor indication with growing evidence supporting its efficacy, though its patient population remained small (consistent with the "one-off" characterization). It became a poster child for tissue-agnostic approvals but generated modest sales due to limited patient numbers.
- **Patisiran (Onpattro)**: Successfully launched and established RNAi as a viable therapeutic modality. By 2021-2022, annual sales reached approximately $500-600 million, demonstrating viability for RNAi drugs but not achieving blockbuster status.
- **Migalastat (Galafold)**: Continued as a niche treatment for Fabry disease, competing with enzyme replacement therapies. Sales remained in the $300-400 million range annually—meaningful but not transformational.

**Economic Reality:**
- The "power law" distribution of drug revenues intensified. Through 2020-2022, the pattern held: a small number of blockbusters (COVID-19 vaccines/spike proteins, cancer immunotherapies, etc.) generated tens of billions, while most approvals struggled to reach $1 billion cumulative sales.
- The $6 billion per approval figure remained a topic of debate, with some analyses suggesting lower figures ($2-3 billion) when accounting for tax benefits and different accounting methods, but the fundamental problem persisted: most approved drugs don't recoup their development costs.
- Investment patterns evolved somewhat, with increased focus on platform technologies (gene therapy, cell therapy, RNA) rather than traditional small molecules, but the basic economic challenge remained.

**Policy Developments:**
- Accelerated approval pathways expanded, particularly during COVID-19, but also faced scrutiny with some accelerated approvals being withdrawn when confirmatory trials failed (e.g., certain checkpoint inhibitors).
- Orphan drug policies continued supporting rare disease development, maintaining the incentives driving the trend the article identified.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, but the trends it identified allow evaluation of implied trajectories:

- **Orphan drug dominance would continue**: ✓ **Accurate**. The proportion of orphan drugs among FDA approvals remained high through 2019-2023, with no reversal of this trend.
- **Economic sustainability concerns would persist**: ✓ **Accurate**. Pharma R&D productivity remained a consistent industry concern, with multiple analyses in 2020-2022 confirming that most approved drugs fail to achieve blockbuster status.
- **RNAi would expand beyond Onpattro**: ✓ **Accurate**. Additional RNAi drugs gained approval, validating the modality, though none achieved major blockbuster sales.
- **Larotrectinib's tissue-agnostic approach would inspire similar programs**: ✓ **Accurate**. Tissue-agnostic approvals became more common (e.g., entrectinib, dabrafenib/trametinib for BRAF fusions), establishing this as a viable regulatory pathway.
- **Investment flowing into biopharma hoping for "the next Gilead" might face disappointment**: ✓ **Accurate to mixed**. While some investors did face disappointments, the COVID-19 pandemic created new blockbuster opportunities (vaccines, antiviral drugs) that temporarily improved returns for some companies. However, the fundamental power-law distribution of drug revenues persisted.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provided a clear-eyed, quantitative assessment of drug approval trends and economic realities that proved prescient and relevant for subsequent industry developments. Its focus on the orphan drug shift and R&D economics identified persistent structural issues in biopharma that remained central concerns through 2023.
