# EMBL Chemical Biology: Progress in Oncology (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The talk by Paul Workman, presented at EMBL in September 2012, argued that classifying cancers solely by their anatomical site is outdated. He emphasized that tumor cells from different organs often share molecular drivers that are more relevant to therapy than the tissue of origin. Workman claimed that the historically high attrition rate of oncology drug programs was beginning to fall, and he warned against over‑reliance on the “Valley of Death” metaphor, suggesting the real bottleneck is the gap between a biologically validated target and a compound that works in patients. He also distinguished **chemical probes** from therapeutic drugs, insisting that probes must meet stricter selectivity and potency criteria because they are used to uncover biology, not to treat disease. A sub‑optimal probe, he argued, is an intermediate step rather than a failure.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Molecular classification replaces anatomy‑based taxonomy  
Since 2012, the oncology field has largely embraced molecular sub‑typing. Large consortia such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium have catalogued driver mutations, gene‑expression signatures, and epigenetic alterations across tumor types. Clinical practice now routinely uses biomarkers (e.g., HER2, EGFR, ALK, KRAS, BRAF, MSI‑H) to select therapies, confirming Workman’s view that “where a tumor sits” is a secondary descriptor.

### Attrition trends in oncology drug development  
Data from the 2020‑2023 FDA Oncology Review reports show that **phase‑II‑to‑phase‑III transition success rates** for oncology have risen modestly—from roughly 15 % in the early 2010s to about 20 % in the early 2020s. While this is an improvement, the overall **clinical‑development attrition** remains high; roughly 70 % of oncology candidates still fail before reaching approval. Thus, Workman’s optimism was partially correct but the decline has been modest rather than dramatic.

### The “Valley of Death” remains a focus of policy  
Funding mechanisms explicitly aimed at bridging the translational gap have expanded:

* **EU’s Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)** and **Horizon Europe** have launched multiple “valley‑of‑death” programmes (e.g., IMI‑2’s “New Medicines for Cancer”).
* In the U.S., **NCATS** and the **Cancer Moonshot** have created translational grants that de‑risk early‑stage projects.

These initiatives acknowledge the gap Workman described, but the metaphor persists because the underlying challenge—moving a validated target through chemistry, pharmacology, and early clinical testing—remains real.

### Successes of target‑driven oncology drugs  

| Target / Pathway | First FDA‑approved drug (year) | Clinical impact (2024) |
|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| PARP (DNA repair) | Olaparib (2014) | Now standard for BRCA‑mutated ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers; > $5 bn sales. |
| CDK4/6 (cell‑cycle) | Palbociclib (2015) | Combined with endocrine therapy in HR⁺/HER2⁻ breast cancer; > $2 bn sales. |
| PI3K‑α (PI3K pathway) | Alpelisib (2019) | Approved for PIK3CA‑mutated HR⁺ breast cancer; modest uptake due to toxicity. |
| KRAS‑G12C (RAS) | Sotorasib (2021) | First KRAS inhibitor; approved for KRAS‑G12C NSCLC, limited response rates (~30 %). |
| BCL‑2 (apoptosis) | Venetoclax (2016, hematology) – later explored in AML (2020) | Demonstrated that “undruggable” targets can be hit with selective probes → drugs. |

These approvals illustrate that **target‑centric drug discovery**—the paradigm Workman championed—has indeed yielded several new classes of oncology medicines.

### Chemical probes: standards and community resources  
The **Chemical Probes Portal** (launched 2015) now curates > 200 high‑quality probes, each vetted for potency (< 100 nM), selectivity (> 30‑fold over off‑targets), and cellular activity. Journals (e.g., *Nature Chemical Biology*) and funding agencies increasingly require “probe validation” statements, reflecting Workman’s call for stricter criteria. Nonetheless, many early‑stage probes still suffer from off‑target effects, and the community continues to debate the line between a “probe” and a “lead compound.”

### Broader shifts: immunotherapy and beyond  
While not a direct focus of the 2012 talk, the rise of **immune checkpoint inhibitors** (anti‑PD‑1/PD‑L1, anti‑CTLA‑4) and **CAR‑T cell therapies** has reshaped oncology. These modalities are less about small‑molecule target inhibition and more about harnessing the immune system, indicating that the field’s evolution is broader than the target‑centric view alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“Attrition rates are coming down in oncology.”*  
  **Outcome:** Modest improvement (≈ 5 % absolute increase in phase‑II‑to‑III success) but attrition remains high; the prediction was partially correct.

- **Prediction:** *“The ‘Valley of Death’ is largely a gap between what works and what doesn’t, not between academia and industry.”*  
  **Outcome:** Funding programs have explicitly targeted this translational gap, confirming the conceptual framing. The academic‑industry divide still exists, but the primary barrier is indeed the “work‑to‑clinic” transition.

- **Prediction:** *“Probe compounds must meet stricter selectivity/potency than drugs; a sub‑optimal probe is an intermediate step, not a failure.”*  
  **Outcome:** Community standards (Chemical Probes Portal, NIH guidelines) now enforce these stricter criteria. The view of probes as “intermediate steps” is widely accepted.

- **Implicit prediction:** *“Moving beyond tissue‑based classification will improve drug development.”*  
  **Outcome:** Molecular sub‑typing is now routine; many approved drugs are biomarker‑driven, supporting the prediction.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when precision oncology and translational funding began to reshape the field; its themes remain relevant, though some predictions were only partially realized.
