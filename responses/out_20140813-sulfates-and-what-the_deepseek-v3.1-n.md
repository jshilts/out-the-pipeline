# Sulfates, And What They Can Make (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses breakthrough research from the Sharpless and Fokin laboratories on sulfonyl fluoride/sulfate ester chemistry, specifically focusing on a new polymerization method. The work demonstrates that when a scaffold with two sulfonyl fluoride esters reacts with an OTMS-bearing monomer, it produces rapid and clean polymerization to form polysulfates—a structural class previously underinvestigated due to synthetic difficulties. The author notes this opens up an entirely new area of polymer chemistry with potential applications as bulk materials and fibers, possibly serving as more chemically resistant alternatives to polycarbonates. 

The broader argument made by Sharpless is that sulfates represent an underutilized class of functional groups in organic chemistry, despite their biological relevance. While biological molecules undergo sulfation at their edges in vivo, disulfate esters appear absent from biological systems. The author references Frank Westheimer's classic work "Why Nature Chose Phosphate" and speculates about why phosphates dominated early biochemistry over sulfates, while suggesting synthetic chemists should explore sulfates more aggressively since they can overcome energy barriers that nature cannot.

## 2. HISTORY

The sulfonyl fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry described in this 2014 article has indeed become a significant area of development in click chemistry, though with mixed practical impact.

**Scientific Development**: The SuFEx reaction has been widely adopted in academic chemistry research as a reliable click chemistry transformation. It has enabled the synthesis of diverse sulfonyl fluoride compounds and polysulfates, with numerous research groups incorporating these methods into their synthetic toolkits. The chemistry proved robust and found applications in materials science, particularly for creating polymers with enhanced thermal stability and chemical resistance.

**Commercial Applications**: However, the broad commercial breakthrough suggested in the article has been limited. Polysulfates did not displace polycarbonates in bulk applications, though they found niche uses in specialized materials. Several chemical companies explored these polymers for high-performance applications, but widespread industrial adoption has been modest.

**Pharmaceutical Relevance**: More significantly, sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as important tools in chemical biology and drug discovery. They serve as warheads for covalent inhibitors and activity-based probes, particularly in protease and enzyme inhibition. This represents a different direction from the polymer focus of the original article, but connects to the general sulfate chemistry theme.

**Business Impact**: While the chemistry gained scientific traction, it did not spawn major new industries or dramatically reshape materials markets. The companies involved remained primarily in the research phase, with limited commercial scaling of the bulk materials applications originally envisioned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions:

- **Prediction**: "You don't often get to see a whole new area appear like this. It'll be interesting to see what properties these have as bulk materials, when spun into fibers, and so on."
  - **Outcome**: The area did expand significantly in academic research, producing numerous publications on polysulfates and related materials. Properties were indeed investigated, showing enhanced thermal stability and chemical resistance.

- **Prediction**: "Right off, they look like more chemically resistant forms of polycarbonates, which would surely find some use"
  - **Outcome**: Partial success. The polymers showed improved chemical resistance but failed to displace polycarbonates in most applications. Niche uses emerged, but not the broad commercial adoption predicted.

- **Prediction**: "there are probably many other uses waiting out there as well"
  - **Outcome**: The most significant unexpected use emerged in pharmaceutical applications—sulfonyl fluorides as covalent drug warheads—which represented a different direction than the materials focus.

- **Prediction**: The article's overall suggestion that sulfates would become more widely used as functional groups
  - **Outcome**: True in academic chemistry and chemical biology, but limited success in industrial polymer applications. The principle was validated scientifically but with narrower commercial impact than anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captured an important development in click chemistry that did expand into a productive research area with genuine applications, though not the broad industrial breakthrough initially envisioned. It's notable for highlighting emerging chemistry that later found unexpected pharmaceutical relevance.
