# Roche Stalls For Time (Dec 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary from December 2008 discusses Roche's attempted acquisition of the remaining stake in Genentech, announced earlier that year. The article notes that the $45 billion deal was struggling due to the global financial crisis and frozen credit markets, making it increasingly difficult for Roche to secure the necessary financing through syndicated loans. 

The author questions Roche's timing in launching this bid just as the economy was collapsing, suggesting the company was "stalling for time" by repeatedly expressing confidence in securing financing while avoiding the alternative of using more equity and cash. The piece also raises concerns about the impact on Genentech employees, who had been living under uncertainty for months, potentially affecting morale and productivity. A concluding note mentions a Genentech VP's claim that morale was unaffected, which the author views with skepticism.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's concerns about the deal's viability proved prescient in the short term but ultimately premature. **Roche did successfully complete the acquisition of Genentech in March 2009**, though the path there was indeed complicated.

Rather than securing the massive $45 billion in debt financing that seemed impossible in late 2008, Roche ultimately financed the deal through a combination of about $42 billion in bonds, bank loans, and commercial paper, plus additional equity. They offered $95 per share (down from their earlier $89 offer that Genentech had rejected), and after some negotiation, the deal closed in March 2009.

The acquisition was widely seen as a success in the following years. Genentech maintained significant operational independence within Roche, continuing its strong track record of drug development. Key drugs like Avastin (bevacizumab), Herceptin (trastuzumab), and Rituxan (rituximab) continued to be major revenue drivers. The integration preserved much of Genentech's innovative culture while providing Roche with one of the industry's strongest oncology pipelines.

Subsequent years validated the strategic move, as Genentech's pipeline delivered multiple successful cancer treatments, making oncology Roche's strongest therapeutic area. By the mid-2010s, oncology drugs represented nearly half of Roche's pharmaceutical sales, largely driven by the Genentech portfolio.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Financing would be impossible/improbable**: The author strongly suggested that securing $45 billion in financing was nearly impossible given credit market conditions. **This was incorrect** - Roche did secure the financing in early 2009 through diverse sources including bonds, bank loans, and commercial paper markets that had begun to thaw.

• **Deal might never happen**: The tone strongly implied the deal might collapse entirely. **This was incorrect** - Roche completed the acquisition in March 2009.

• **Employee morale and productivity would be severely damaged**: The article predicted significant negative impact on Genentech staff. **This appears to have been overstated** - while some uncertainty existed, Genentech maintained productivity and continued developing successful drugs post-acquisition.

• **Roche's timing was "perfectly awful"**: The author criticized the timing of the deal announcement. **This evaluation proved shortsighted** - while announcing during the financial crisis created challenges, completing the acquisition in 2009 actually positioned Roche well for the subsequent decade, as Genentech's oncology pipeline became increasingly valuable.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While the article captures an interesting moment during the financial crisis, its core concerns were quickly resolved within months, making it primarily of historical interest rather than long-term importance to biotechnology. The deal did succeed, and worries about financing and employee morale proved manageable.
