# Medicinal Chemistry Books, 2019 (December 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a curated bibliography of medicinal chemistry books compiled in late 2019, building on the author's previous recommendation posts. The list is organized into approximately 20 categories, ranging from broad histories and general medicinal chemistry references to specialized topics like fragment-based drug discovery, fluorine chemistry, bioisosteres, protein-protein interactions, ADME/toxicity, process chemistry, formulations, biostatistics, computational chemistry (including early mentions of machine learning), and career guides bridging academia and industry. The author notes the absence of significant new histories since 2011's "The Evolution of Drug Discovery" and highlights recent editions such as the third edition of "Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry" and updated textbooks by Graham Patrick and Erland Stevens.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to December 2019, several trends and concrete developments reshaped the field. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed rapid advances in antiviral drug discovery and repurposing, with drugs like remdesivir gaining Emergency Use Authorization and later approval, while mRNA vaccine platforms demonstrated unprecedented speed. Targeted protein degradation (PROTACs) moved from niche research toward clinical application, with Arvinas's ARV-110 and ARV-471 advancing through trials. AI/ML adoption accelerated: DeepMind's AlphaFold2 (2020) transformed structural biology, and companies like Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, and Atomwise advanced AI-designed molecules into clinical testing. Machine learning now guides target identification, lead optimization, and toxicity prediction across major pharmas.

Fragment-based drug discovery continued maturing, with Vemurafenib and Venetoclax joined by additional approvals and a growing preclinical pipeline. Allosteric modulators gained traction in both discovery and development. Antibody-drug conjugates expanded with multiple FDA approvals. The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced drug price negotiations, affecting commercial strategy and R&D investment calculus. Eroom's law persisted, with rising trial costs and timelines, though decentralized trials and real-world evidence began streamlining some studies. Gene therapies (e.g., for sickle cell disease) and cell therapies achieved landmark approvals. Ketamine/esketamine and psychedelics entered mainstream psychiatric drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **New editions of core texts would continue appearing**: This happened as expected. Many listed titles (e.g., Silverman, Patrick, Kenakin, Goodman & Gilman) have seen newer editions or updates post-2019; "Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry" remains a major reference.
• **Computational chemistry and machine learning would grow in importance**: Correct. The article's brief ML mention preceded a major boom. Deep learning is now integral to drug design pipelines, quantum chemistry codes improved, AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold transformed structural prediction, and generative models for molecules/design became widespread.
• **Specialized topics (e.g., fragments, macrocycles, fluorine chemistry) would remain active**: Correct. Fragment-based methods and macrocycle design continue to produce clinical candidates; fluorination strategies are now routine in lead optimization.
• **Cheminformatics and bioinformatics tools would evolve rapidly**: Correct. The field shifted toward cloud platforms, more sophisticated ML models, and broader adoption of FAIR data principles. Books in this area do show their age quickly (as the author noted), but the underlying methods are now foundational.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This is a useful reference list for trainees and practitioners compiling a personal library, but it is not an original analysis of the biotech industry—it catalogs existing knowledge rather than forecasting or critiquing substantive developments, so it ranks in the bottom quintile for long-term importance in understanding the field's trajectory.
