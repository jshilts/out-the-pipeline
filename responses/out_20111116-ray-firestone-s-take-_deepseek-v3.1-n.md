# Ray Firestone's Take On Pharma's Plight (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

Ray Firestone published a commentary in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* reflecting on decades of experience in the pharmaceutical industry. The article argued that large pharmaceutical companies suffer from declining innovation and productivity due to organizational size and culture problems. Firestone specifically pointed to mergers between large companies as detrimental to innovative research environments, citing the 1989 Bristol-Myers-Squibb merger as a case study where power struggles, declining morale, talent loss, and favoritism led to dramatically reduced productivity.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends Firestone identified in 2011 continued and intensified in the subsequent decade. Major pharmaceutical mergers persisted: Pfizer acquired Wyeth (2009), then attempted the $160B acquisition of AstraZeneca (2014, failed), and successfully acquired Allergan in a $160B deal (2016, later unwound due to tax inversion rules). Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Celgene for $74B in 2019, and AbbVie acquired Allergan for $63B in 2020.

Despite these consolidations, R&D productivity challenges remained evident. Industry-wide data shows pharmaceutical R&D spending increased from ~$140B globally in 2010 to over $200B by 2020, while new drug approvals remained relatively flat. The FDA approved 21-53 new molecular entities annually from 2011-2021, with no clear upward trend despite massive R&D investment increases.

However, the period also saw growth in smaller biotech companies and alternative R&D models. Many promising therapies emerged from startups later acquired by large pharma, suggesting a continued role for smaller, more agile organizations in innovation. The rise of immunotherapy, CAR-T therapies, and successful rare disease drug development often originated from biotech companies rather than large pharma internal research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Large company mergers worsen innovative research culture and reduce productivity.
  
  **Reality**: Mergers continued throughout the 2010s, and while definitive causal studies are complex, industry-wide R&D productivity metrics showed pharmaceutical companies struggling with efficiency despite increased spending. However, some merged companies did achieve significant successes (e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb's immuno-oncology franchise).

• **Prediction**: Size is detrimental to innovative research culture.
  
  **Reality**: Mixed outcomes. Large pharma continued facing innovation challenges, but the ecosystem evolved toward a model where big pharma often acquires innovative smaller companies rather than relying solely on internal discovery. This suggests both models have roles in the ecosystem.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 6**

This article addresses persistent, systemic industry challenges that remained relevant for over a decade, though the specific merger examples were historical rather than predictive of major future developments that fundamentally altered the industry landscape.
