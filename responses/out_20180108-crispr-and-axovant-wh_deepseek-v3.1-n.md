# CRISPR and Axovant: What the Market Thinks (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary critiques two contemporaneous biopharma stories from early 2018. First, it assesses Axovant Sciences after its lead Alzheimer's candidate (intepirdine) failed in clinical trials, triggering sharp stock declines. The author characterizes Axovant's business model as acquiring discarded compounds and promoting them with excessive optimism, questioning both the scientific rationale and the financial structure surrounding Vivek Ramaswamy's companies.

Second, the article examines CRISPR gene-editing companies (Editas, Crispr Therapeutics, Intellia), noting how earlier investments had become profitable despite periodic scientific challenges. The piece focuses on a new bioRxiv paper suggesting pre-existing human immunity to Cas9 proteins from common bacterial exposure (Staphylococcus and Streptococcus), which could complicate in vivo CRISPR therapies while leaving ex vivo approaches (like bone marrow modifications) relatively safer. The author contemplates whether to sell CRISPR positions given the new uncertainty.

## 2. HISTORY
**Axovant's trajectory:** Following the January 2018 failure in Lewy body dementia, Axovant continued to struggle. The nelotanserin program referenced in the article did not deliver breakthrough results. By 2021, the company pivoted and rebranded as Sio Gene Therapies, shifting focus to gene therapies for GM1 gangliosidosis and GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs/Sandhoff diseases). The company delisted from NASDAQ in 2021 and was eventually acquired in 2022. The broader pattern of acquiring failed compounds and repackaging them did not prove to be a sustainable strategy.

**CRISPR clinical reality:** The immunity concerns raised in the 2018 paper proved partially relevant but surmountable. The most advanced CRISPR treatments have indeed leaned heavily on ex vivo approaches (where cells are edited outside the body), particularly for blood disorders. However, in vivo applications have also progressed—notably Intellia Therapeutics' NTLA-2001 for transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), which has shown clinically meaningful reductions in disease-causing protein in Phase I/II trials and represents the first systemically delivered CRISPR therapy in humans. Multiple CRISPR-based therapies are now in late-stage development, with some approaching regulatory approval.

**Market outcomes:** While volatility continued, the 10% premarket drop mentioned in the article proved temporary. All three companies (EDIT, CRSP, NTLA) maintained market presence and have substantially grown in valuation since 2018, supported by clinical progress and strategic partnerships. The successful clinical translation of CRISPR technology moved from speculative to demonstrated, particularly for inherited diseases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Axovant's viability**: The article's pessimistic assessment of Axovant's strategy proved prescient. The company's attempt to revive failed compounds through aggressive marketing rather than improved science did not succeed long-term, leading to acquisition and the abandonment of its original business model.

• **CRISPR clinical impact**: The author correctly identified ex vivo applications as more viable near-term prospects, which aligns with how the field advanced. However, the broader concern about Cas9 immunity being a major obstacle underestimated researchers' ability to engineer solutions, including modified Cas proteins and delivery mechanisms that mitigated immune responses.

• **Investment volatility**: The prediction of continued turbulence in CRISPR stocks was accurate. The sector experienced multiple boom-bust cycles tied to clinical updates, regulatory decisions, and competing technologies. The author's contemplation of taking profits reflected appropriate caution for a high-risk sector.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article demonstrates strong analytical foresight about both Axovant's weaknesses and CRISPR's fundamental challenges, capturing a pivotal moment when both hype and skepticism needed careful navigation.
