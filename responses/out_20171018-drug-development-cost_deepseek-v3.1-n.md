# Drug Development Costs Revisited (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article critiques a 2017 paper that estimated drug development costs at $648 million per approved drug, arguing this figure suffers from severe survivorship bias. The author aligns with Forbes journalist Matthew Herper's analysis showing that the study examined only companies that had succeeded in developing exactly one drug, failing to account for the broader failure rates in pharmaceutical R&D. The critique explains that when examining companies with multiple drug development programs, average costs per drug actually rise, reaching over $2 billion per approved drug. The article strongly defends the higher cost estimates (such as the Tufts Center's $2.7 billion figure) and introduces "Eroom's Law" – the inverse of Moore's Law – which describes how drug development costs have increased exponentially over decades while technology costs have decreased. The author challenges any future researchers claiming lower costs to rigorously engage with and refute the established analyses from Tufts, Scannell, Munos, and Herper rather than simply dismissing them.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2017 article, drug development cost research has largely validated the concerns raised about survivorship bias and the reality of escalating R&D expenses. The pharmaceutical industry has continued to grapple with the fundamental challenges identified, with development costs remaining persistently high through the late 2010s and early 2020s. 

Several major analyses since 2017 have reinforced rather than contradicted the higher cost estimates. Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development updated their landmark research, with cost estimates continuing to show figures in the $2-3 billion range when accounting for failures and opportunity costs. The phenomenon of Eroom's Law has been further documented, though some researchers have noted moderating factors in specific therapeutic areas. 

The biopharma industry structure has continued evolving, with the tension between innovative smaller companies and established large pharma persisting. Many smaller companies still face the statistical realities this article highlighted – succeeding with one drug doesn't mean the underlying cost structure is representative when most similar ventures fail entirely. 

Critiques of lower-cost estimates similar to the 2017 Prasad and Mailankody paper have become standard in health economics literature. The methodological issues this article highlighted – particularly survivorship bias and inadequate capture of failure rates – are now widely recognized as critical considerations in pharmaceutical R&D cost analysis. However, some therapeutic areas (notably rare diseases and oncology) have shown different cost profiles due to regulatory innovations and patient population characteristics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Challenge to future researchers claiming lower costs**: The article challenged authors to rigorously engage with established cost analyses. Since 2017, no widely accepted research has successfully refuted the high cost estimates. The methodological standards this article demanded have become more commonly expected in health economics research.

• **Validation of Eroom's Law continuation**: The fundamental trend of increasing drug development costs has largely continued, though with some moderating factors. The core insight that costs were rising while technology costs fell remained relevant through the late 2010s and early 2020s, even as the industry explored new efficiency approaches.

• **Industry structure and cost dynamics**: The tension between smaller single-drug companies and larger pharmaceutical firms that this article highlighted has persisted. The fundamental challenge of translating individual company successes into representative cost estimates remains a methodological concern that researchers continue to address.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses an important methodological debate in pharmaceutical economics with clear analytical arguments, but focuses primarily on one narrow controversy and lacks broader biotechnological implications or breakthrough scientific developments.
