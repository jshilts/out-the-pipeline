# Warp Drive Bio: Best Name or Worst? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the launch of Warp Drive Bio, a new biotechnology company founded by prominent figures Greg Verdine, Jim Wells, and George Church, which raised $125 million at launch with an existing collaboration deal already in place with Sanofi. The company's strategy centered on leveraging natural products drug discovery through what they called a "genomic search engine" - using genomics to identify hidden natural products from microbes that could serve as breakthrough treatments, based on the premise that nature produces the most powerful medicinal chemistry.

The author expresses both interest and skepticism about the approach, noting that while the concept of "cryptic natural products" wasn't inherently crazy, such compounds might be difficult to successfully develop and wonders aloud whether the approach would yield meaningful results. The piece also raises questions about Verdine's previous venture, Aileron Therapeutics, and whether his involvement in a new company indicated anything about Aileron's progress in the "stapled peptide" space.

## 2. HISTORY

Warp Drive Bio faced significant challenges and underwent substantial changes following its 2012 launch:

**Pipeline and Scientific Progress:** Despite the initial $125 million funding and Sanofi partnership, the company struggled to translate its genomic natural products approach into viable drug candidates. The proprietary "genomic search engine" did not yield the breakthrough treatments initially envisioned.

**Acquisition and Restructuring:** In 2016, Sanofi fully acquired Warp Drive Bio in a deal worth up to $750 million if certain milestones were met, but this acquisition did not signal success. Instead, it represented a strategic absorption after the company's independent approach proved challenging. By 2017-2018, Sanofi began restructuring and scaling back Warp Drive Bio's operations.

**Key Program Failures:** Warp Drive Bio's most advanced program targeted KRAS-driven cancers, particularly the oncogene KRAS G12C. However, this program failed to demonstrate sufficient clinical efficacy and was eventually discontinued. Other natural product-based programs similarly failed to advance significantly.

**Outcome:** By the late 2010s, Warp Drive Bio essentially ceased to exist as an independent entity or viable drug discovery engine. The natural products genomics approach, while scientifically interesting, did not produce the breakthrough drugs that were promised. Sanofi eventually wrote down much of the investment, and no major drugs from Warp Drive Bio's platform reached market approval or widespread clinical use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Author's skepticism about natural products discovery**: The author expressed doubt that "cryptic natural products" would be easy to develop into drugs, questioning whether useful compounds would have remained hidden. This skepticism proved largely correct - the approach was indeed "tricky to get to work" as predicted, with the genomic search engine failing to deliver breakthrough treatments.

• **Implicit expectation of data from Sanofi collaboration**: The article anticipated that the Sanofi partnership might yield convincing data. However, subsequent developments showed the collaboration did not produce the hoped-for results, leading to acquisition rather than successful partnership, and eventual program terminations.

• **Question about Aileron's status**: The author wondered whether Verdine's new venture indicated issues with his previous company Aileron. History validated this concern - while Aileron eventually went public in 2017, it struggled for years and achieved limited success with its stapled peptide platform, facing multiple clinical setbacks and eventually pivoting its strategy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article demonstrates reasonable foresight about the challenges facing natural products drug discovery, and Warp Drive Bio's story became an important cautionary tale about genomics-based approaches failing to deliver despite high-profile backing and substantial funding. However, it primarily serves as a snapshot of biotech startup hype rather than a watershed moment in drug development history.
