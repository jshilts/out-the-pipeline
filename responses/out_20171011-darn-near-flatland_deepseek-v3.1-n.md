# Darn Near Flatland (Oct 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article provides an overview of two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, describing the rapid expansion of the field since 2010. The author discusses the emergence of single-element 2D materials like phosphorene, borophene, germanene, silicene, and stanene, as well as compound materials such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂), boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides. The article emphasizes that this is a very new field still in an exploratory "land-rush phase," with most work occurring from 2014 onward. The author notes the significant synthetic challenges involved in producing these materials, especially those that don't occur naturally, and highlights the potential for creating novel stacked heterostructures with unpredictable properties.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2017, the field of 2D materials continued to expand significantly in several concrete directions:

**Research Growth**: The number of publications on 2D materials grew substantially, with thousands of papers published annually across materials science, physics, and chemistry journals. Research expanded from fundamental characterization to applications-focused studies.

**Commercial Development**: Several companies emerged or expanded focusing on 2D materials. Graphene production scaled up with companies like Graphenea and Applied Graphene Materials supplying research and industrial markets. Molybdenum disulfide and other transition metal dichalcogenides found applications in electronics research, though widespread commercial adoption remained limited.

**Scientific Advances**: Researchers successfully synthesized many of the materials discussed, including improved borophene growth techniques and characterization of germanene. The field moved toward understanding quantum properties, valleytronics, and heterostructure engineering.

**Barriers to Widespread Adoption**: Despite extensive research, practical applications remained limited. Challenges included high production costs, difficulty in large-scale manufacturing, integration issues with existing semiconductor processes, and maintaining material quality during device fabrication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictive elements:

• **General expectation that many predicted 2D materials would be synthesized**: This largely came true - borophene, germanene, and many transition metal compounds were successfully produced in laboratory settings.
  
• **Implication that computational modeling was insufficient**: This proved partially accurate. While computational methods improved significantly with machine learning approaches, predicting complex stacked heterostructure properties remained challenging.

• **Suggestion of unknown synthetic routes to be discovered**: This proved true as researchers developed novel chemical vapor deposition, liquid-phase exfoliation, and epitaxial growth techniques for various 2D materials.

• **Tacit expectation of industrial applications emerging**: This evolved more slowly than implied. While research applications expanded rapidly, commercial products incorporating 2D materials beyond graphene remained niche, with most applications in specialized sensors, flexible electronics research, and energy storage rather than mass-market consumer products.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article accurately captured an important moment in materials science when the field was rapidly expanding. It correctly anticipated continued growth in 2D materials research while acknowledging practical challenges. However, the long-term commercial impact has been more limited than the research excitement suggested, making it very good but not exceptional as a forward-looking analysis.
