# The Hideous Numbers of Compounds (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article explores the concept of "chemical space"—the total number of possible organic compounds that could theoretically exist within drug-like parameters (molecular weight under 500, compatible with living systems). The author uses a building-block analogy to illustrate how quickly the numbers escalate: with just 100 examples each of three simple subunits (aryl ring, ether, tertiary amine), one reaches a million possible combinations. The piece cites formal estimates ranging from 10^20 to 10^24 potentially synthesizable stable structures using known methods, with even more dramatic estimates reaching 10^60. The author notes this dwarfs both the actual number of compounds ever synthesized and the physical capacity of Earth to contain them, raising the philosophical question of whether large-scale compound screening represents meaningful exploration or simply "buying more lottery tickets" in drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

The chemical space concept articulated in 2009 continued evolving with significant real-world developments in the subsequent decade and a half:

**Computational Approaches Accelerated**: The recognition of vast chemical space drove substantial investment in computational drug discovery. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), mentioned implicitly through the building-block approach, became an established methodology. Companies like Astex Pharmaceuticals, which had pioneered FBDD, continued developing approved drugs using this approach, including Kisqali (ribociclib), approved by FDA in 2017 for breast cancer.

**DNA-Encoded Libraries (DEL) Matured**: This technology, which allows screening of billions of compounds simultaneously through DNA barcoding, became commercially viable. Companies like GSK heavily invested in DEL, leading to drug candidates entering clinical trials. DEL platforms could practically handle library sizes of 10^9 to 10^12 compounds—vastly larger than traditional HTS but still miniscule fractions of theoretical chemical space.

**Machine Learning Revolution**: The 2010s saw AI/ML transform chemical space navigation. Deep learning models could predict molecular properties, generate novel compounds, and prioritize synthesis candidates. Google's AlphaFold (2020) for protein structure prediction and subsequent small molecule design tools exemplified this shift. Companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, and BenevolentAI built platforms using AI for drug discovery, with Exscientia's DSP-1181 becoming the first AI-designed drug to enter human trials (2020).

**Drug Discovery Outcomes**: Despite expanded compound libraries, drug approval rates remained challenging. The industry continued facing ~90% failure rates in clinical trials, suggesting that simply accessing more compounds didn't solve fundamental biological complexity problems. Some high-profile computational approaches succeeded—notably COVID-19 antiviral drug discovery—but many AI-driven companies struggled to demonstrate clear advantages over traditional methods in terms of approved drugs reaching patients.

**Chemical Space Enumeration Advanced**: The theoretical estimates cited (10^20-10^24) were refined through projects like GDB-17 (generated database of 166 billion molecules up to 17 atoms), but practical considerations remained: synthesizability, drug-likeness, and cost constraints limited actual exploration to tiny fractions of theoretical space.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Prediction: Chemical space exploration through large libraries will drive drug discovery success**

- **What happened**: Large libraries did become standard (DEL libraries routinely exceed 1 billion compounds), and computational tools became essential, but success rates remained low. The industry discovered that sheer compound numbers didn't address fundamental issues in target validation, clinical trial design, and biological complexity. AI approaches showed promise but produced relatively few approved drugs by the early 2020s.

**Implicit Prediction: Fragment-based building block approaches will be productive**

- **What happened**: Fragment-based drug discovery proved successful and became a mainstream approach. Multiple FDA-approved drugs emerged from FBDD, including venetoclax (Venclexta, 2016) for leukemia and pexidartinib (Turalio, 2019) for rare tumors. The methodology worked particularly well for difficult targets with well-defined binding sites.

**Implicit Concern: "Buying more lottery tickets" might not be the right strategy**

- **What developed**: This concern proved prescient. While companies continued building larger screening libraries, the industry increasingly recognized that quality of compounds, appropriate target selection, and understanding disease biology mattered more than library size alone. The shift toward more targeted, hypothesis-driven discovery and phenotypic screening reflected this realization.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While the article articulated an important conceptual foundation for chemical space thinking, its impact was more philosophical than transformative. The vast-number problem it described was already recognized in drug discovery circles, though the article made it accessible. The more significant developments would come from how the field responded to these limitations with new technologies (DEL, AI/ML) rather than the quantitative estimates themselves. The article captures a moment of dawning recognition about the mismatch between theoretical possibility and practical drug discovery, which shaped subsequent technology development but didn't itself revolutionize the field.
