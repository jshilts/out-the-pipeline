# Table Of Content Graphics, Mocked (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Tumblr blog called "Table of Contents ROFL" (tocrofl.tumblr.com) that was created to mock poorly designed graphical abstracts appearing in scientific journals. The author, Derek Lowe, frames this as a form of public service—someone taking on the task of ridiculing the low-quality, often confusing graphical representations that scientists use to summarize their research in table of contents sections. The tone is lighthearted, treating the Tumblr as a humorous but potentially helpful critique of scientific communication practices.

## 2. HISTORY

The Tumblr blog "Table of Contents ROFL" became a notable phenomenon in scientific communication circles around 2011-2013. The blog featured submissions from scientists and researchers poking fun at excessively complex, poorly designed, or outright confusing graphical abstracts from published papers.

While I don't have high-confidence data on the specific long-term impact of this particular blog, the broader trend it represented—critiques of scientific visualization and communication—has continued. The practice of creating graphical abstracts has evolved since 2011, with many journals now providing clearer guidelines and researchers paying more attention to visual communication. However, poor graphical abstracts still persist in scientific literature, suggesting the blog addressed a real and ongoing issue.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article made no explicit predictions about the future.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 2**

The article is a brief, lighthearted commentary on a niche blog about scientific communication practices rather than a substantive analysis of scientific or technological developments.
