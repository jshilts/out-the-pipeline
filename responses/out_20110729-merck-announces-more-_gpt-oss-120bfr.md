# Merck Announces More Big Cutbacks (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In a July 2011 earnings release, Merck & Co. announced a plan to eliminate up to 13 000 jobs—about 12 % of its global workforce—over the next four years, with roughly a third to two‑thirds of the cuts in the United States. The announcement came after a series of restructuring moves that followed Merck’s 2009 acquisition of Schering‑Plough. The author of the commentary questioned whether the Schering‑Plough deal had been worthwhile, suggesting that the scale of the workforce reductions might indicate that the merger had created more problems than value.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Workforce reductions:** Merck carried out the announced cuts largely on schedule. By the end of 2015 the company reported having reduced its headcount by about 12 % (≈13 000 positions). Subsequent annual reports show a stabilized workforce of roughly 68 000–70 000 employees worldwide, down from a peak of ~78 000 in 2010.

**Integration of Schering‑Plough:**  
* **Vaccines:** The acquisition gave Merck a stronger human‑vaccine portfolio (e.g., Gardasil, MMRV). These products continued to generate steady revenue and positioned Merck as a major vaccine player, although the company later missed out on a COVID‑19 mRNA vaccine and instead pursued a protein‑subunit candidate with Johnson & Johnson in 2022.  
* **Animal health:** Schering‑Plough’s animal‑health business was folded into Merck Animal Health, which has become a leading global supplier of veterinary medicines and vaccines, contributing roughly $5 bn in annual sales by 2023.  
* **Small‑molecule pipeline:** Some late‑stage assets from Schering‑Plough (e.g., the cholesterol‑lowering drug *torcetrapib* had already failed before the merger) did not translate into major new products. However, the merger gave Merck access to a broader chemistry platform that later supported the development of several oncology candidates.

**Key therapeutic successes:** The most consequential post‑2011 development was the launch of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in 2014. Keytruda’s checkpoint‑inhibitor mechanism quickly expanded to multiple tumor types, and by 2022 it generated >$15 bn in annual sales, becoming Merck’s flagship product and a primary driver of revenue growth. This success was unrelated to the Schering‑Plough assets but helped offset the cost‑cutting pressures highlighted in the 2011 article.

**Financial performance:** After a dip in 2011‑12, Merck’s revenue grew from $45 bn (2012) to $58 bn (2022). Net income recovered, and the company returned >$30 bn to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in the decade following the cuts.

**Strategic acquisitions:** Merck continued to expand its biotech pipeline through acquisitions such as Avidity Biosciences (2021, $3.7 bn) and a 2022 stake in the RNA‑based vaccine developer Moderna (minor). These moves indicate that the company remained financially capable of investing despite the earlier workforce reductions.

**Overall assessment:** The 2011 workforce cuts were executed as planned and contributed to cost savings, but Merck’s long‑term trajectory turned positive, largely driven by immuno‑oncology (Keytruda) and a solid animal‑health business. The Schering‑Plough merger, while not a blockbuster source of new human drugs, delivered valuable vaccine and animal‑health assets that have persisted as revenue streams.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
* **Prediction in the article:** *“The Schering‑Plough deal may have been a mistake; the scale of the cuts suggests Merck got little value from it.”*  
  * **Outcome:** Partially incorrect. The merger did not produce a breakthrough human‑drug pipeline, but it gave Merck a durable vaccine portfolio and a leading animal‑health division, both of which remain profitable. The company’s later success with Keytruda was independent of the merger, but the overall financial health of Merck improved, contradicting the notion of a net loss from the acquisition.

* **Implicit prediction:** *“If Merck continues cutting staff, it may struggle to sustain R&D momentum.”*  
  * **Outcome:** False. Despite the reductions, Merck’s R&D spending stayed near $9–10 bn annually, and the company launched several high‑impact products (Keytruda, Gardasil‑9, and later oncology candidates). The cuts were largely in non‑core functions and did not impede major R&D achievements.

* **Implicit prediction:** *“The large US‑centric layoffs could signal weakening of Merck’s domestic market position.”*  
  * **Outcome:** Not borne out. Merck’s US sales grew, driven by Keytruda and vaccine revenues, and the company maintained a leading market share in several therapeutic areas in the United States throughout the 2010s.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of a pivotal restructuring moment for a major pharma firm; its relevance is heightened by the later contrast between the short‑term cost‑cut narrative and Merck’s subsequent blockbuster success, making it moderately high‑interest for understanding industry dynamics.
