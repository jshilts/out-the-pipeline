# The Sames / Sezen Fraud Case: Holy Cow (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 C&EN commentary described a federal‑government investigation into the Ph.D. work of Bengü Sezen, a former graduate student in Professor Sames’s organic‑chemistry group at Columbia University.  The reports alleged that Sezen repeatedly fabricated NMR spectra—sometimes by logging into the spectrometer under a former group member’s credentials and then “correcting” the output with white‑out—and also falsified reaction‑product claims and laboratory notebooks.  According to the article, Columbia was moving to revoke Sezen’s doctorate, and the author highlighted the case as one of the most extensive examples of data fraud in modern organic chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑publication developments (2011‑present)**  

* **Ph.D. revocation** – Columbia University formally revoked Sezen’s doctorate in 2012 after the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) and the university’s own investigation confirmed the misconduct.  The revocation was announced in a university press release and recorded in Columbia’s public list of degree revocations.  

* **Legal outcome** – No criminal charges were filed; the matter remained an administrative/academic proceeding.  The ORI issued a finding of research misconduct but did not impose a federal sanction beyond the degree revocation.  

* **Impact on the Sames laboratory** – Professor Sames continued at Columbia for several years after the case, publishing normally.  He later left Columbia (around 2015) and accepted a faculty position at the University of Michigan, where he remains active in synthetic methodology.  There is no public record of formal disciplinary action against him related to the Sezen case.  

* **Policy and cultural ripple effects** – The case reinforced existing calls for stricter data‑integrity practices in chemistry departments.  While it did not trigger new federal regulations, many institutions (including Columbia) tightened internal audit procedures for spectroscopic data, encouraged the use of electronic lab notebooks, and required more frequent raw‑data archiving for graduate‑student work.  The episode is frequently cited in research‑ethics courses as a concrete example of “fabricated data” and of the importance of supervisory oversight.  

* **Broader scientific impact** – No drug candidates, patents, or commercial products were tied to the fraudulent work, so the case had no direct effect on the biotech pipeline.  Its lasting influence is primarily pedagogical and procedural rather than technological.  

* **Public awareness** – The ChemBark blog series and the original C&EN article remain the most detailed public accounts.  The story is occasionally referenced in media pieces on scientific misconduct, but it has not re‑emerged as a headline‑making scandal since the 2012 revocation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The 2011 article implied or explicitly stated several expectations.  Their outcomes are listed below.

| Prediction (as implied in the article) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Columbia would revoke Sezen’s Ph.D.** | Columbia revoked the degree in 2012, confirming the prediction. |
| **Further documents would surface (Part III of the investigation)** | No additional “official” reports were released after the two FOIA‑obtained documents; the public record remained limited to the two reports and the university’s revocation notice. |
| **The case would become a landmark example of long‑running fraud in organic chemistry** | The case is now routinely cited in ethics curricula and in discussions of data integrity, matching the author’s expectation of lasting notoriety. |
| **The misconduct would lead to broader policy changes** | While no new federal regulations were enacted, many chemistry departments (including Columbia) adopted stricter data‑management policies, aligning with the article’s suggestion of concrete institutional impact. |
| **Professor Sames might face disciplinary action** | No public disciplinary action against Sames has been documented; he continued his academic career and later moved institutions. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

*Reasoning*: The case is a vivid, well‑documented instance of scientific fraud that continues to be used as a teaching tool for research integrity, giving it lasting relevance despite the lack of broader technological or commercial consequences.
