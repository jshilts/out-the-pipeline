# Trouble With Stapled Peptides? A Strong Rebuttal (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a sharp rebuttal by Loren Walensky's group at Dana-Farber and colleagues to a Genentech paper (Okamoto et al.) that reported problems with hydrocarbon-stapled peptides. The Genentech study found that a specific BIM BH3 stapled peptide showed neither improved binding nor cellular penetration compared to unmodified peptides, suggesting the stapling technique didn't guarantee enhanced biological activity.

Walensky's rebuttal argued that the Genentech team had used a deliberately weakened construct originally designed for NMR studies, not for cellular applications. This particular peptide had low α-helicity (only 39% helical), overall negative charge, and poor cellular penetrance—properties that the original authors had already documented and recommended against using in cellular studies. The heated response emphasized that successful stapled peptide design requires careful attention to multiple factors including charge, hydrophobicity, and helical structure, and that the technique was already being tested in clinical trials.

## 2. HISTORY

The scientific and clinical trajectory of stapled peptides after this 2014 controversy provides important context for evaluating both papers:

**Clinical outcomes:**
- **ALRN-6924** (developed by Aileron Therapeutics, founded by Walensky's collaborator): This stapled p53 peptide entered multiple clinical trials. While some early results showed promise, the drug faced significant setbacks. In 2020-2021, Aileron reported that ALRN-6924 failed to meet primary endpoints in two Phase 2 trials for peripheral T-cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. In October 2022, Aileron announced it was exploring strategic alternatives, including potential sale or merger of the company, due to clinical trial failures and financial constraints.

**Scientific developments:**
- The field continued developing stapled peptides despite the controversies. Research groups published improved designs with better pharmacokinetic properties, and the basic understanding of structure-activity relationships advanced significantly.
- The Walensky group and others continued publishing on optimized stapled peptide designs, addressing issues like proteolytic stability, cell permeability, and target engagement.

**Commercial impact:**
- Aileron Therapeutics saw its market position decline substantially after clinical failures, with its stock price falling from highs around $20+ in 2017-2018 to under $1 by 2022.
- The controversy highlighted in the 2014 article didn't kill the field, but it did establish that stapled peptides require much more sophisticated optimization than initially hoped—precisely the point Walensky's rebuttal tried to make.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions from the article and how they compared to reality:**

• **Stapled peptides would succeed as therapeutics with proper design optimization** ✓ **Mixed outcome**
  - While ALRN-6924 reached clinical trials as predicted, it ultimately failed in Phase 2 studies, showing that even optimized designs faced significant clinical hurdles not fully appreciated in 2014.

• **Clinical testing would validate the approach** ✗ **Partially wrong**
  - Clinical trials did proceed (supporting the "potential" claim), but the failures of ALRN-6924 demonstrated that significant challenges remained beyond just proper design methodology.

• **The field needed careful study of pharmacokinetics, selectivity, and properties** ✓ **Accurate**
  - The emphasis on rigorous characterization proved prescient, as later research and clinical experience showed these molecules require extensive optimization and have complex behavior.

• **The Genentech paper represented an unfair test of the technology** ⚠ **Difficult to fully evaluate**
  - While Walensky's defense was scientifically sound regarding the specific peptide studied, the broader clinical failures suggest the technology faced deeper challenges than just avoiding "bad" peptide designs.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important scientific controversy about a promising therapeutic modality at a critical juncture, providing insight into both the technical complexities of peptide stapling and the dynamics of scientific debate when commercial interests are at stake.
