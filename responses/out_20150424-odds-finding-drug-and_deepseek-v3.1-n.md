# What Are the Odds of Finding a Drug (And How Do You Stand Them?) (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article addresses the question of what probability a medicinal chemist has of personally synthesizing a compound that makes it to market as an approved drug. The author performs a back-of-the-envelope calculation starting with an estimated 10,000 medicinal chemists worldwide, assuming a 25-year productive career span, and roughly 20 new small-molecule drugs approved per year (excluding biologics). This yields an upper-bound probability of about 5% (1 in 20), which the author considers generous. The real odds are estimated at 1% or lower when accounting for career turnover, shorter actual lab tenures, and the reality that drug discovery requires large teams over many years.

The author then addresses how scientists can tolerate such low success rates, distinguishing drug discovery from clinical medicine by emphasizing that even failed projects generate valuable scientific knowledge about disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Examples given include failed programs targeting m2 muscarinic receptors for Alzheimer's, D1 antagonists for schizophrenia, hormone-sensitive lipase inhibitors for diabetes, and PPAR ligands for metabolic syndrome—each providing definitive negative knowledge about what doesn't work. The author argues that working at the "foaming front of the breaking wave" of scientific knowledge, even on long-odds projects, provides sufficient intellectual reward and meaning.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical R&D landscape has evolved significantly since 2015, with several trends affecting the calculus presented in the article:

**Drug Approval Trends**: FDA new drug approvals have remained robust, with small molecule drugs continuing to represent roughly half of annual approvals. The 2015-2024 period saw sustained innovation across therapeutic areas, though with increasing biologics representation.

**Clinical Success Rates**: Industry-wide data continues to support the article's fundamental premise. Recent analyses from sources like BIO show overall clinical success rates from Phase I to approval remaining in the 10-15% range across therapeutic areas, with variations by indication (oncology typically lower, rare diseases higher). The author's 1% estimate for an individual medicinal chemist's probability remains plausible given the collaborative, multi-year nature of drug discovery.

**Scientific Knowledge Accumulation**: The author's emphasis on learning from failure has proven prescient. The "negative knowledge" accumulated from failed drug programs has indeed helped refine target selection strategies, and the expansion of public databases cataloging failed clinical trials has enabled better resource allocation.

**Industry Consolidation and Workforce Changes**: The pharmaceutical industry has continued restructuring, with job security remaining a concern for many medicinal chemists. However, the emergence of specialized CROs, biotech startups, and new modalities (gene therapy, cell therapy, RNA-based therapeutics) has created alternative career pathways.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made relatively few explicit predictions, focusing instead on describing current conditions and the philosophical stance toward low success rates. However, some implicit assumptions can be evaluated:

- **Implicit assumption about sustained drug discovery activity**: Drug discovery has continued actively, with sustained FDA approval rates for small molecules, though biologics now represent a larger share. *Reality: Mixed. Small molecule discovery continues, but share of approvals has shifted toward biologics and newer modalities.*

- **Implicit assumption that medicinal chemistry would remain central**: While small molecules remain important, newer therapeutic modalities have expanded significantly, potentially changing the career landscape for medicinal chemists. *Reality: Partially accurate. Medicinal chemistry remains vital, but the toolkit has broadened considerably.*

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article addresses a fundamental question about drug discovery productivity with honest, realistic back-of-the-envelope calculations. It captures the statistical reality of pharmaceutical R&D and provides thoughtful reflection on how scientists find meaning in high-failure-rate work. The piece remains relevant for understanding the economics and psychology of drug discovery, though it focuses more on individual career probabilities rather than broader industry-wide productivity trends or systemic solutions.
