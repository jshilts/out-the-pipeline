# Things I Won't Work With: Azidoazide Azides, More Or Less (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 article from Derek Lowe's "Things I Won't Work With" series describes an extraordinarily unstable high-nitrogen compound called azidoazide azide (C₂N₁₄), synthesized by the Klapötke laboratory in Munich. The compound contains two carbon atoms, fourteen nitrogen atoms, and zero hydrogen atoms.

The article emphasizes the compound's extreme hazards: it was so sensitive that it exploded spontaneously in solution, when touched, during transport, and even when exposed to the laser in a Raman spectrometer. The researchers could barely obtain analytical data, requiring persistence through multiple instrument explosions. The author characterizes this as a substance with no practical applications, suitable only for demonstrating the outer limits of chemical instability.

## 2. HISTORY
**Research Continuation:** After the initial 2011 publications by Klapötke's group, azidoazide azide and similar high-nitrogen compounds continued to be studied, primarily for theoretical interest in energetic materials rather than practical applications. The compound became legendary in chemistry circles as a benchmark for instability, often cited in scientific literature discussing the challenges of handling highly strained molecules.

**Scientific Interest vs. Practical Use:** No pharmaceutical, industrial, or military applications emerged for C₂N₁₄. The compound remained a laboratory curiosity, with only a handful of specialized research groups attempting to work with it or related compounds. Klapötke's group continued publishing on energetic materials, focusing on safer but still challenging high-nitrogen compounds.

**No FDA Approvals or Drug Development:** As predicted, there were no drug approvals or clinical trials involving azidoazide azide derivatives. The extreme instability and toxicity made it unsuitable for any biomedical applications.

**Safety Incidents:** Over the following decade, there were occasional reports in chemistry blogs and safety forums of researchers attempting to synthesize small quantities, sometimes resulting in minor accidents, further cementing its reputation as nearly impossible to handle safely.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"No conceivable uses"**: Accurate. No practical applications emerged; the compound remained a dangerous curiosity.

• **"Last appearance in chemical literature"**: Partially accurate. While it did not become a major research topic, it continued to be referenced in papers on energetic materials and chemical safety, and did appear periodically in literature about extreme compounds.

• **"Tiny amounts ever made, or ever will be"**: Substantially accurate. To date, only milligram quantities have been synthesized, primarily in specialized laboratories with extensive safety protocols.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article accurately identified the practical limitations of an extreme compound that became a chemical legend, demonstrating clear-sighted assessment of risks versus benefits in scientific research. While not medically or commercially significant, it represents an important boundary case in chemical stability that continues to inform research decisions.
