# If It's Not One Thing. . . (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog reflects on the increasing challenges and safety hurdles facing drug development in the mid-2000s. The author highlights how advancing analytical technologies like mass spectrometry were revealing previously undetectable toxic metabolites (epoxides, quinone precursors), creating new worries that didn't exist when these compounds were invisible. The article catalogs multiple "gates" that drug candidates must pass: Ames test screening for mutagenicity, two-week rat toxicity studies where microscopic tissue damage can emerge despite normal behavior, and the relatively new concern of QT prolongation—a cardiac side effect that had recently become a major regulatory focus.

The author expresses skepticism about whether small startup companies with limited resources could adequately navigate all these safety checkpoints, questioning their ability to match the comprehensive testing infrastructure available to large pharmaceutical companies.

## 2. HISTORY

**Regulatory Landscape Evolution (2006-Present):**

The concerns raised in 2006 about QT prolongation proved prescient and intensified. In 2005, the FDA had already begun implementing thorough QT (TQT) studies as a formal requirement, and this became standard practice for most new drugs. The ICH E14 guidance, finalized in 2005, mandated that nearly all drugs undergo comprehensive cardiac safety assessment.

**Technology Impact:**
Advanced mass spectrometry did not retreat to the "old days"—instead, it became even more sophisticated. By the 2010s, high-resolution MS platforms were standard, and regulatory agencies like the FDA began requesting even more extensive metabolite identification (the "MIST" guidance on metabolites in safety testing emerged around 2008-2010).

**Industry Structure:**
The startup skepticism expressed in the article reflected real tensions, but the subsequent 18 years showed a more complex picture. Small companies continued to enter clinical trials, often relying on CROs (contract research organizations) that democratized access to sophisticated safety testing. However, the "valley of death" for drug development remained very real—failure rates in Phase 1 and Phase 2 remained high, often due to safety or toxicity issues.

By the late 2000s and 2010s, regulators became even more demanding on front-loading safety assessment. Studies like the two-week rat tox tests became standard, but were supplemented with additional requirements, including longer-term studies and more sophisticated cardiac, hepatic, and renal monitoring.

**Specific Drug Outcomes:**
Numerous drugs faced intensified scrutiny exactly as predicted. QT prolongation concerns led to withdrawal or restricted use of drugs like cisapride, terfenadine, and grepafloxacin. The "impressive list" of pre-existing drugs mentioned in 2006 faced retrospective safety reviews and label updates throughout the late 2000s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** "I'm starting to wonder how we're going to get many drugs even as far as the clinic these days" due to accumulating safety hurdles.
  - **Reality:** Drug development costs continued to rise dramatically. The estimated cost to bring a drug to market increased from ~$800M in the early 2000s to over $2.6B by the 2010s. Clinical trial failure rates remained high, especially in early phases where safety issues frequently terminated programs.

• **Prediction:** Concern that improved analytical methods would create more worry by revealing "toxic beasts" previously invisible.
  - **Reality:** This became institutionalized. The FDA and EMA increasingly expected detailed metabolite profiling and structure elucidation for safety assessments, codified in formal guidance documents through the late 2000s and 2010s.

• **Prediction:** Implicit concern that QT prolongation screening would become a significant gatekeeper and burden.
  - **Reality:** QT assessment became mandatory and consumed substantial resources. The thorough QT study became a standard requirement, costing millions per drug and lengthening development timelines.

• **Prediction:** Skepticism about small companies' ability to adequately conduct comprehensive safety testing compared to large companies.
  - **Reality:** This proved partially true in practice. While CROs enabled small companies to contract much of this work, inadequate safety assessment remained a key cause of failures. Small companies' success rates remained lower than large pharma's, and many were acquired partly because they couldn't afford late-stage safety studies.

• **Prediction:** Implicit expectation that safety standards would continue tightening rather than relaxing.
  - **Reality:** Correct—regulatory requirements for drugs continued to increase through the 2000s-2010s, not decrease, with expanded safety monitoring requirements across all phases of development.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a critical inflection point in drug development regulatory science with remarkably clear foresight about challenges that would dominate the next two decades, making it historically significant for understanding the evolution of pharmaceutical development constraints.
