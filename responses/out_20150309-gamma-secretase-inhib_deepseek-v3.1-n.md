# Gamma-Secretase Inhibitors: The Wrong Way Around? (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Harvard/Mass General/Brigham & Women's study published in *Neuron* that challenged the prevailing theory about gamma-secretase's role in Alzheimer's disease. The enzyme gamma-secretase had long been targeted because it was believed to cleave amyloid precursor protein to generate beta-amyloid, the toxic protein aggregate characteristic of Alzheimer's pathology. Pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, had invested heavily in developing gamma-secretase inhibitors, believing that blocking this enzyme would reduce amyloid formation.

The article highlights Eli Lilly's clinical experience with a gamma-secretase inhibitor that not only failed to show efficacy but actually appeared to worsen patient outcomes. This puzzling result had been attributed to various factors including insufficient potency, off-target effects, or side effects from disrupted Notch signaling (gamma-secretase also processes Notch proteins). The new research suggested a paradigm shift: rather than overactivating gamma-secretase, familial Alzheimer's-causing presenilin mutations actually impaired the enzyme's function. Mouse models with these mutations showed reduced gamma-secretase activity but increased production of the toxic 42-amino-acid beta-amyloid species, recapitulating human-like Alzheimer's pathology.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade largely validated the article's central concern about gamma-secretase inhibitors. Multiple pharmaceutical programs targeting this enzyme faced clinical failures:

**Clinical Trial Outcomes:**
- **Eli Lilly's semagacestat** trials were terminated after showing worse cognitive outcomes in patients
- **Bristol-Myers Squibb's avagacestat** failed in Phase II trials due to lack of efficacy and safety concerns
- **Merck's MK-0752** and other candidates faced similar challenges with Notch-related toxicity

**FDA Approvals and Patient Impact:**
No gamma-secretase inhibitor has received FDA approval for Alzheimer's treatment as of 2024. The focus shifted toward beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors, though these also faced widespread clinical failures, and monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid aggregates.

**Policy and Research Direction Changes:**
The repeated failures of gamma-secretase inhibitors, combined with disappointing results from other anti-amyloid approaches, led to significant soul-searching in the Alzheimer's research community. Research funding and pharmaceutical investment began shifting toward alternative mechanisms including tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and metabolic approaches.

**Business Impact:**
Companies that had heavily invested in gamma-secretase programs experienced substantial financial losses and pipeline restructuring. The failures contributed to increased caution about amyloid-targeting therapies overall, though research continues with modified approaches including selective gamma-secretase modulators designed to avoid Notch-related toxicity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Implicit prediction that gamma-secretase inhibitors would continue facing challenges (✓ ACCURATE):** The article's suggestion that blocking gamma-secretase might be "the last thing you'd want to give Alzheimer's patients" proved prescient. Every major gamma-secretase inhibitor program ultimately failed in clinical trials.

**• Prediction that other gamma-secretase compounds in development would face reconsideration (✓ ACCURATE):** Multiple pharmaceutical programs either halted or significantly modified their gamma-secretase approaches following these revelations, though some companies continued with modified strategies focused on selective modulators rather than pure inhibitors.

**• Implicit prediction about the validity of the amyloid hypothesis (⚠ PARTIALLY ACCURATE):** While the specific mechanism involving gamma-secretase inhibition proved problematic, the broader amyloid hypothesis has had mixed validation. More recent antibodies like aducanumab (controversially approved) and lecanemab (approved 2023) show modest clinical effects but nothing approaching disease modification.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience about a major therapeutic approach and identified fundamental flaws in the prevailing Alzheimer's research paradigm years before widespread clinical validation. It highlighted how basic research can prevent costly clinical failures while illustrating the complexity of translating biological understanding into effective therapies.
