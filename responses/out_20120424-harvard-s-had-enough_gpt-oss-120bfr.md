# Harvard's Had Enough (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The memo circulated among Harvard faculty in April 2012 warned that the university’s subscription costs for “big‑name” scientific journals—especially electronic titles from legacy publishers such as Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer—were becoming financially unsustainable.  The Faculty Advisory Council to the Library concluded that maintaining the status‑quo would force cuts elsewhere in the library’s collection budget.  To counter this, the council asked faculty to **“move prestige”** to open‑access (OA) venues: publish in OA journals, deposit manuscripts in the institutional repository, and generally support a shift away from the traditional subscription model.  The memo was paired with a Guardian editorial that argued the internet had rendered the historic publishing service obsolete and that publicly funded research data should be freely available for scientific scrutiny and public accountability.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Harvard’s own policy actions**  
* **2012 – Faculty‑wide OA mandate** – In the months after the memo, Harvard’s Faculty of Arts & Sciences adopted a “Harvard Open Access Policy” (effective July 2012) requiring that all peer‑reviewed articles authored by faculty be deposited in the Harvard DASH repository within a year of publication, unless a publisher’s embargo exceeded that period.  The policy was later extended university‑wide (2018).  *[high confidence]*  

* **Negotiated read‑and‑publish agreements** – Beginning in 2015 Harvard entered into “read‑and‑publish” contracts with major publishers (Elsevier 2018, Wiley 2020, Springer Nature 2021).  These deals bundle subscription access with a publishing fee that covers OA for Harvard‑affiliated authors, dramatically increasing the proportion of Harvard‑authored papers that appear OA (from ~15 % in 2012 to > 70 % by 2023).  *[moderate confidence]*  

**Broader sector developments**  
* **U.S. public‑access mandates** – The NIH Public Access Policy (2008) and the 2013 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum (requiring federal agencies to make research results publicly available within 12 months) reinforced the push that Harvard’s memo echoed.  By 2022 most U.S. federal agencies had adopted similar policies.  *[high confidence]*  

* **Plan S (2018)** – A coalition of European funders launched Plan S, mandating immediate OA for funded research.  Although not a U.S. initiative, Plan S accelerated the global shift toward OA and pressured publishers to adopt transformative agreements, many of which Harvard later joined.  *[high confidence]*  

* **Growth of OA journals and platforms** – The number of fully OA journals indexed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) grew from ~ 7,000 in 2012 to > 15,000 in 2023.  Prominent OA venues (e.g., *eLife*, *PLOS Biology*, *Nature Communications*) have become “high‑prestige” publishing options, directly countering the “prestige” argument in the 2012 memo.  *[high confidence]*  

* **Financial impact on libraries** – While OA growth has reduced some subscription spend, libraries still face high costs for hybrid‑journal APCs and for read‑and‑publish deals.  Harvard’s overall serials budget fell modestly (≈ 10 % between 2012 and 2022) but was offset by increased APC expenditures.  The “unsustainable” subscription trajectory described in the memo was partially mitigated, but the overall cost pressure on academic libraries persists.  *[moderate confidence]*  

* **Data‑sharing mandates** – Major funders (NIH, NSF, European Commission) now require deposition of underlying data in public repositories (e.g., GEO, Dryad, Zenodo).  Harvard’s own data‑management policies (first issued 2015, updated 2021) reflect the memo’s call for “data in the public domain.”  *[high confidence]*  

**Outcomes for the publishing ecosystem**  
* The proportion of Harvard‑affiliated articles that are OA (Gold or Green) rose from ~ 15 % (2012) to > 70 % (2023).  
* Several “prestige” journals (e.g., *Cell*, *Nature*, *Science*) now offer fully OA tracks that are widely used by Harvard researchers.  
* The overall market share of subscription‑only articles has declined, but publishers have largely shifted revenue to APCs and institutional agreements rather than disappearing.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from memo or contemporaneous commentary) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Faculty will “move prestige” to OA journals, making them the primary venue for high‑impact work.** | By 2023, many high‑impact OA journals (e.g., *Nature Communications*, *Science Advances*, *eLife*) host a substantial share of Harvard’s top‑cited papers. However, traditional “prestige” journals still dominate the most‑cited slots (e.g., *Nature*, *Science*, *Cell*). | Partially fulfilled – OA prestige grew, but legacy journals remain dominant. |
| **Subscription costs will become untenable, forcing libraries to cut other collections.** | Harvard’s serials budget modestly decreased, but cuts were offset by reallocating funds to APCs and transformative agreements. No major “collection collapse” occurred. | Not fully realized – financial pressure eased via new contracts rather than drastic cuts. |
| **Open access will become the norm for publicly funded research.** | U.S. federal agencies now require public access within 12 months; many European funders require immediate OA. OA proportion for U.S. research is > 50 % (2022). | Largely fulfilled. |
| **Data from publicly funded research will be openly available.** | NIH and other agencies now mandate data deposition; Harvard’s data‑management policies enforce this. Compliance rates are still variable (~ 70 % for NIH‑funded projects). | Mostly fulfilled, though compliance is not universal. |
| **The “big‑publisher” model will collapse or be replaced quickly.** | Major publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer Nature) have survived by shifting to hybrid and read‑and‑publish models; they remain financially robust. | Not fulfilled. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The memo captures a pivotal moment in the open‑access movement and directly influenced Harvard’s subsequent policies; its relevance endures, though the predictions were only partially realized.
