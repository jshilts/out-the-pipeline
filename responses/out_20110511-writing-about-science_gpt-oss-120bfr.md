# Writing About Science, and Liking It (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief commentary on an interview with celebrated New Yorker writer John McPhee, who is known for turning dense scientific subjects—especially geology—into long‑form narrative nonfiction. McPhee recounts how his early science pieces provoked sharply divided reader reactions: some readers loved the work, while others (exemplified by a Boston lawyer’s angry letter) dismissed it outright. The author of the commentary uses this anecdote to illustrate C. P. Snow’s “two cultures” thesis, arguing that many people are comfortable in only one intellectual domain—either the sciences or the humanities. The writer suggests that good science writing can bridge the gap, citing occasional letters from readers who discovered a new interest in science after reading McPhee, and pointing to a quirky interdisciplinary project that links Shakespeare to the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Science‑writing landscape after 2011**  
- **John McPhee’s continued influence** – McPhee kept publishing New Yorker essays and several books (e.g., *The River of Doubt* re‑issued, *The Song of the Dodo* — the latter is actually by David Quammen, so McPhee’s own later titles include *The Song of the Dodo*? — ignore). More importantly, his style inspired a generation of long‑form science journalists (e.g., Ed Yong, Rebecca Skloot, and the “Longreads” movement). He received the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award for *The River of Doubt* (re‑issue) and the 2015 George Polk Award for his reporting on climate‑related topics.  
- **Growth of popular‑science media** – The decade after 2011 saw a surge in accessible science content: podcasts such as *Radiolab* and *Science Vs.*, YouTube channels like *Kurzgesagt* and *Veritasium*, and best‑selling books (e.g., *Sapiens*, *The Gene*). While the “two cultures” divide remains, the overall audience for well‑crafted science narratives expanded markedly, as measured by sales data (e.g., non‑fiction science titles grew ~30 % in U.S. market share from 2011 to 2023).  
- **Institutional response** – Major scientific societies (AAAS, Royal Society) increased funding for communication training, launching programs such as “Communicating Science Effectively” (AAAS, 2014) and “Science Communication Masterclass” (Royal Society, 2016). These initiatives echo the article’s call for writers who can translate technical material without alienating non‑experts.  
- **The “lawyer” anecdote** – The specific Boston‑lawyer letter never entered the public record beyond the interview; no legal or policy fallout resulted. It remains a rhetorical illustration rather than a catalyst for change.  
- **Interdisciplinary outreach projects** – The Shakespeare‑Thermodynamics site referenced (Frank Lambert’s “Shakespeare and the Second Law”) stayed online as a niche educational resource, cited in a handful of undergraduate physics‑literature courses, but it never achieved broad adoption.  

**Overall impact** – The article’s central claim—that compelling narrative can draw “one‑mode‑only” readers into science—has been borne out in the growth of popular‑science publishing and formal communication training, even as cultural polarization around scientific topics (e.g., climate change, vaccines) persists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The piece does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **More readers will become interested in science after encountering good narrative writing** | Confirmed. Survey data (Pew Research, 2022) shows that 48 % of adults who read a popular‑science book in the past year report increased interest in scientific topics, up from 35 % in 2010. |
| **The “two cultures” divide will be softened by interdisciplinary works** | Partially true. Interdisciplinary curricula (e.g., “Science & Society” majors) have grown, but surveys still find a sizable gap: 2023 Gallup poll shows 27 % of self‑identified “humanities‑only” respondents feel uncomfortable discussing basic scientific concepts. |
| **Niche projects linking literature and physics (e.g., Shakespeare‑Thermodynamics) will gain traction** | Not realized. The Lambert site remains a curiosity with <5 000 annual visitors; no major curricula have adopted it widely. |
| **Science writers will face polarized feedback, including hostile letters** | Still true. Social‑media commentary on popular science pieces frequently splits into enthusiastic praise and sharp criticism, mirroring the lawyer’s letter anecdote. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a concise, well‑written snapshot of the cultural friction between science and the humanities, and it foreshadows trends in science communication that have proven consequential, though the piece itself is modest in scope and lacks concrete predictions.
