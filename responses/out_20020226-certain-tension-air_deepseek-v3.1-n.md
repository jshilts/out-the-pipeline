# A Certain Tension in the Air (February 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the regulatory crisis facing ImClone and its partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) regarding their cancer drug Erbitux (cetuximab). The FDA meeting was scheduled to determine the path forward after an initial rejection, with options including reworking existing data, supplementing with additional information (possibly from European partner Merck KGaA), or conducting new clinical trials. 

The author notes that while Erbitux likely works as an effective cancer treatment, the fundamental problem was ImClone's submission of inadequate clinical trial data—doing "the absolute minimum they thought they could get away with." There's criticism that BMS should have caught these deficiencies before submission. The article highlights tension between regulatory standards and companies trying to minimize development costs and timelines.

## 2. HISTORY
The ImClone/Erbitux saga became one of the most significant FDA regulatory scandals of the early 2000s. Here's what actually transpired:

**Regulatory Outcome**: The FDA issued a "refuse to file" letter in December 2001, essentially rejecting ImClone's submission as incomplete and inadequately designed. The agency ultimately required new clinical trials, specifically demanding better-controlled studies with clearer efficacy endpoints.

**Erbitux Approval and Adoption**: After conducting proper Phase III trials (the famous "BOND" trial for metastatic colorectal cancer), Erbitux (cetuximab) gained FDA approval in February 2004—nearly two years after this article. The drug proved genuinely effective for metastatic colorectal cancer with EGFR-expressing tumors and later gained additional approvals for head and neck cancer. It became a standard treatment option, though with notable side effects including skin rash and infusion reactions.

**Stock Market and Legal Consequences**: ImClone's stock collapsed from over $70 to under $10 following the FDA rejection. This triggered insider trading investigations, ultimately leading to Martha Stewart's conviction for lying to investigators about her stock sale. Samuel Waksal, ImClone's CEO, pleaded guilty to securities fraud and served prison time.

**Corporate Developments**: BMS eventually restructured their partnership with ImClone but took a substantial financial hit. ImClone continued as an independent company until 2008, when Eli Lilly acquired it for $6.5 billion—a testament to Erbitux's eventual commercial success despite the rocky regulatory path.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several implicit predictions about how the situation would unfold:

• **Prediction: Possible data supplementation from Merck KGaA**
   - **Outcome**: This approach proved insufficient. The FDA maintained its position that ImClone's own trial data was fundamentally flawed in design, not just incomplete. European data couldn't salvage the application.

• **Prediction: Experienced BMS regulatory affairs people might enable reapplication without new data**
   - **Outcome**: Incorrect. Despite BMS's regulatory expertise and resources, the FDA's objections were too fundamental. The agency required entirely new, properly designed clinical trials.

• **Prediction: If new trials required, expect "now-we're-really-mad statements from BMS"**
   - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. BMS did express significant frustration and financial concern, but the public focus shifted more to the legal and insider trading aspects as the scandal unfolded.

• **Prediction: Erbitux likely works despite regulatory problems**
   - **Outcome**: Correct. Once proper trials were completed, Erbitux demonstrated clear efficacy. This validation of the underlying science is notable—the drug was sound, but the clinical development strategy was flawed.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article offers remarkable prescient analysis of one of biotech's most dramatic regulatory failures, correctly identifying both the scientific merit of the drug and the corporate mismanagement that nearly derailed it. The piece captures a pivotal moment where regulatory standards, business practices, and scientific reality collided with lasting consequences for drug development oversight and public trust in biotech.
