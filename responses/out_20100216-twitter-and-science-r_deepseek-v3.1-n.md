# Twitter and Science, Revisited (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a brief personal reflection by the author about their relationship with Twitter as a platform for science communication. The author acknowledges receiving feedback from others about their use of Twitter and describes their current setup where tweets serve primarily as alerts when new blog posts are published. Despite considering creating a separate science-focused Twitter account, the author expresses skepticism about having time to engage meaningfully with the platform or respond to messages sent via Twitter.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2010 article, Twitter evolved into a significant platform for scientific communication and discourse. The scientific community's adoption of Twitter accelerated substantially, with researchers, journals, institutions, and conferences establishing active presences. By the 2020s, Twitter had become a venue for scientific discussions, paper sharing, conference live-tweeting, collaborations, public engagement, and real-time commentary on scientific developments. Major scientific organizations, journals, and researchers built substantial followings. However, the platform also faced challenges including the spread of misinformation and significant changes under Elon Musk's ownership starting in 2022, which led some scientists to reduce activity or migrate to alternative platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Limited personal engagement**: The author predicted they wouldn't have time to actively engage with Twitter or respond to messages - This largely reflected the reality for many scientists; even as the platform grew in scientific importance, individual capacity for engagement remained constrained
• **Alert-focused usage**: The author planned to continue using Twitter primarily as a notification system for blog posts - This represented one legitimate but narrow use case among many that evolved in scientific Twitter

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **2/10**
The article captures an early moment of personal skepticism about Twitter's scientific utility, but it lacks substantive analysis of the platform's actual potential impact on science communication, research collaboration, or public engagement with science.
