# Avastin At the FDA Today: Passion Should Lose (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post was written on the second day of the FDA’s public hearing on whether to keep the **accelerated‑approval** of **bevacizumab (Avastin)** for **metastatic breast cancer (MBC)**. The author argued that the FDA’s original 2008 provisional approval was questionable, that later phase‑III trials had failed to show a meaningful overall‑survival or quality‑of‑life benefit, and that the drug’s serious toxicities (e.g., hypertension, bleeding, wound‑healing problems) outweighed any modest progression‑free‑survival gain.  

The piece also warned against letting emotional patient testimony drive regulatory decisions, insisted that a drug’s **risk‑benefit ratio** must be grounded in solid statistics, and suggested that the FDA should be free to rescind an accelerated approval if confirmatory data are negative. Price was dismissed as a secondary issue; the author maintained that even a free Avastin would not be justified for MBC.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome (2011‑present)**  
* **June 2011:** After the hearings, the FDA **withdrawn** the breast‑cancer indication for bevacizumab. Roche/Genentech’s appeal was denied in **November 2011**.  
* **European Union:** The European Medicines Agency (EMA) followed suit, revoking the MBC indication in **2011** after a similar review of the data.  
* **Subsequent trials:** Additional phase‑III studies (e.g., **AVADO**, **RIBBON‑1**, **MERiDiAN**) continued to show modest progression‑free‑survival improvements but no overall‑survival benefit and higher toxicity. None led to a new submission for MBC approval.  
* **FDA supplemental NDAs:** Roche submitted a supplemental NDA in **2015** and again in **2020** seeking to restore the indication for HER2‑negative MBC. Both were **rejected** on the same grounds—insufficient overall‑survival benefit and an unfavorable safety profile.  
* **Current status (2024):** Bevacizumab is **not approved** for any breast‑cancer indication in the United States or the EU. It remains approved for several other solid tumours (colorectal, NSCLC, glioblastoma, ovarian, renal, and cervical cancers).  

**Impact on policy and practice**  
* The Avastin‑MBC episode became a **landmark case** for the FDA’s accelerated‑approval pathway. It reinforced the principle that **accelerated approvals must be revocable** when confirmatory trials fail, a stance cited in FDA guidance updates (e.g., 2014 “Accelerated Approval” guidance).  
* The controversy spurred **greater scrutiny of surrogate endpoints** (progression‑free survival) in oncology approvals, leading to more stringent requirements for overall‑survival or validated patient‑reported outcomes.  
* Patient‑advocacy groups, after the 2011 hearings, shifted toward **evidence‑based advocacy**, emphasizing the need for transparent data rather than purely emotional appeals.  

**Commercial consequences**  
* Roche’s **global sales of Avastin** declined after the loss of the breast‑cancer label, but the drug’s revenue remained robust due to its other indications (≈ $5 billion annually worldwide in 2023).  
* Some **biosimilar competitors** entered the market (e.g., **Mvasi**, **Zirabev**) after 2019, but they are marketed only for the FDA‑approved indications, not for breast cancer.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the article (or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **The FDA will ultimately withdraw the MBC indication** | FDA withdrew the indication in June 2011 and upheld the decision after appeal. | Correct. |
| **Roche’s appeal will fail** | The appeal was denied in November 2011; later supplemental NDAs were also rejected. | Correct. |
| **Avastin’s benefit in MBC is insufficient to outweigh its risks** | Confirmatory trials showed no overall‑survival benefit and higher rates of hypertension, bleeding, and wound complications; FDA judged the risk‑benefit ratio unfavorable. | Correct. |
| **Provisional/accelerated approvals must be revocable** | FDA policy now explicitly states that accelerated approvals can be withdrawn if confirmatory data are negative; the Avastin case is frequently cited as precedent. | Correct. |
| **Patient‑emotion should not influence regulatory decisions** | While patient testimony remains part of the advisory‑committee process, the FDA’s final decision was data‑driven; the case reinforced the principle of evidence‑based rulings. | Largely correct; the decision aligned with the author’s view. |
| **Price is not the central issue for this indication** | The drug’s price remained high (≈ $5,000 per month in the U.S.) but the FDA’s decision was based on efficacy/safety, not cost. | Correct in the sense that price did not drive the withdrawal, though cost‑effectiveness debates continued in health‑policy circles. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in oncology drug regulation; the ensuing FDA reversal reshaped accelerated‑approval practice and remains a reference point for debates on surrogate endpoints and patient advocacy. It is highly relevant to biotech policy and drug‑development strategy, though the specific scientific content is limited to a single drug.
