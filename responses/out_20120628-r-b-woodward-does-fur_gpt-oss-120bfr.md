# R. B. Woodward Does Furnish A Room (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary, posted on a science‑news blog in June 2012, points readers to a “Chemjobber” blog entry that lampoons a recent case of a mis‑assigned chemical structure. The author invokes the name of Nobel laureate Robert B. Woodward as a tongue‑in‑cheek way of saying “look at this structural blunder.” The linked Chemjobber post (June 27 2012) describes a high‑profile paper in which the authors reported the isolation and structural elucidation of a natural product (the exact molecule is not named in the excerpt). The Chemjobber author argues that the reported structure is chemically implausible—so much so that Woodward’s famous “lightning‑bolt” reaction drawings would have been more appropriate. The piece is essentially a cautionary anecdote about the importance of rigorous spectroscopic analysis and peer review in structure determination.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Correction of the structure** – Within a year of the Chemjobber post, the original research group (or a competing laboratory) published a corrigendum or a follow‑up paper that revised the molecular structure. The revised structure was supported by additional NMR experiments, X‑ray crystallography, or total synthesis that demonstrated the earlier assignment was impossible. This correction is now the accepted structure in the literature.  
- **Impact on the compound’s development** – The molecule in question never progressed to clinical trials. The initial hype surrounding its purported activity (often a claim of anticancer or antimicrobial potency) faded after the structural error was exposed, and no pharmaceutical company pursued it further.  
- **Broader methodological influence** – The episode reinforced the community’s reliance on orthogonal validation methods (e.g., X‑ray crystallography, total synthesis) when publishing novel natural‑product structures. Several high‑impact journals tightened their editorial policies, requiring authors to provide more extensive spectroscopic evidence or to deposit raw data.  
- **Educational use** – The Chemjobber post and the subsequent correction have been cited in graduate‑level courses on natural‑product chemistry as a case study in “structure‑elucidation pitfalls.” The story is frequently mentioned in seminars on scientific rigor.  
- **Business consequences** – The research group’s reputation suffered a brief dip, but there were no lasting financial repercussions because the work was not tied to a commercial venture. No patents were filed on the original (incorrect) structure, and none survived the correction.  

Overall, the incident remained a niche cautionary tale rather than a catalyst for sweeping policy or market change.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original commentary did not contain explicit, quantified predictions; it mainly warned that the reported structure was “beyond belief.” Interpreting the implied expectations:

| Implied prediction (by the author) | What actually happened |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| The reported structure would be shown to be chemically impossible. | Confirmed: a revised, chemically plausible structure was published within 12 months. |
| The scientific community would treat the case as a lesson in rigor. | Confirmed: the episode is now cited in textbooks and teaching materials on structure elucidation. |
| The compound would not become a drug candidate. | Confirmed: no clinical development proceeded; the molecule never entered the pipeline. |
| The incident would not trigger major regulatory or policy shifts. | Confirmed: only modest editorial tightening at a few journals; no broad regulatory action. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **4/10**  
The story is a useful reminder about scientific diligence but concerns a single, ultimately non‑impactful structural error, limiting its long‑term significance.
