# Pushing Onwards with CETP: The Big Money and the Big Risks (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2011 commentary discusses the continued pursuit of CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibitors for cardiovascular disease following Pfizer's high-profile Phase III failure of torcetrapib in 2006. The article explains that despite torcetrapib's catastrophic failure—which showed increased mortality in the treatment group—three major pharmaceutical companies (Merck, Roche, and Eli Lilly) were still advancing their own CETP inhibitors: anacetrapib, dalcetrapib, and evacetrapib respectively.

The central uncertainty was whether raising HDL cholesterol through CETP inhibition would actually reduce cardiovascular events, since the biochemical rationale remained sound but human lipidology was "not nearly as well worked out as some people might think." The article frames this as a high-stakes gamble where companies were risking hundreds of millions to potentially make billions, highlighting the fundamental questions that remained unanswered about both CETP inhibitor safety and whether the HDL hypothesis itself was valid.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2011 article, the CETP inhibitor field experienced a series of decisive clinical failures that ultimately validated the earlier concerns:

**Roche's dalcetrapib** was the first to fall. In May 2012, just months after this article, Roche announced it was terminating the Phase III dal-OUTCOMES trial after an independent monitoring board found the drug showed no clinically meaningful benefit in reducing cardiovascular events. The trial had enrolled over 15,000 patients but was stopped for futility.

**Eli Lilly's evacetrapib** suffered a similar fate. In October 2015, Lilly announced it was halting Phase III development after the ACCELERATE trial of over 12,000 patients showed the drug provided no reduction in cardiovascular events despite effectively raising HDL cholesterol by over 130%. The drug was safe but ineffective.

**Merck's anacetrapib** became the sole survivor with a mixed outcome. The REVEAL trial, completed in 2017 with over 30,000 patients, showed a modest 9% relative risk reduction in major coronary events. However, the drug accumulated in adipose tissue with a half-life of 2-4 years, raising long-term safety concerns. In 2017, Merck announced it would not seek FDA approval due to these concerns and the drug's marginal benefit, effectively ending anacetrapib's development despite the technically positive trial result.

By 2024, no CETP inhibitor has reached the market. The class demonstrated that simply raising HDL cholesterol levels through CETP inhibition—even when done safely—does not meaningfully improve cardiovascular outcomes. The failures fundamentally challenged the HDL hypothesis that had driven decades of research, suggesting that HDL function and particle characteristics matter more than absolute HDL cholesterol levels.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions about CETP inhibitor development:

• **"Will anyone make it through?"** - The article's central question. **Outcome**: Technically Merck's anacetrapib "made it through" with positive Phase III results, but the drug was never approved or marketed, so functionally the answer was no.

• **"Will they fail for tox like Pfizer did, telling us that we don't understand CETP inhibitors?"** - **Outcome**: This proved mostly incorrect. The successors addressed the specific toxicity mechanisms (blood pressure and aldosterone issues) seen with torcetrapib, showing that the safety problems were compound-specific rather than class-wide.

• **"Will they make it past that problem, but not help patients as much as expected, telling us that we don't understand CETP itself, or HDL?"** - **Outcome**: This prediction was remarkably prescient. This is precisely what happened—the drugs were generally safe but provided minimal to no clinical benefit, revealing fundamental gaps in understanding about HDL biology and cardiovascular disease.

• **"Will all three work as hoped, and arrive in time to split up the market ferociously"** - **Outcome**: Completely incorrect. None of the three drugs reached the market with meaningful efficacy.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article captures a critical turning point in cardiovascular drug development with unusual prescience about the central scientific question. It illustrates the high-risk nature of pharmaceutical R&D while correctly identifying the fundamental uncertainty that ultimately doomed a multi-billion dollar research effort across multiple major companies.
