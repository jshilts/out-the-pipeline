# And a Quick Political Note (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a brief political commentary piece written during the early days of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. The author notes that one of the co-authors of a scientific paper previously discussed is based at Cairo University, making him directly affected by the unfolding political upheaval. The article references Iran's 2009 Green Movement protests and expresses support for the toppling of authoritarian regimes while acknowledging uncertainty about what might replace them. The author mentions that the Egyptian government had shut down internet access nationwide, rendering earlier advice about using Tor relays ineffective.

## 2. HISTORY
The Egyptian Revolution of 2011 (part of the broader Arab Spring) successfully forced President Hosni Mubarak's resignation on February 11, 2011, just two weeks after this article was published. However, the subsequent decade brought significant instability rather than democratic consolidation. The Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi was elected president in 2012 but was overthrown by a military coup in 2013 led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has governed as an authoritarian leader since then. Internet shutdowns became a more widely used tactic by authoritarian governments worldwide in subsequent years. The hoped-for democratic transition did not materialize as many had hoped in early 2011.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"there will be more [Iran unrest], I'm sure"** - This proved accurate. Iran experienced major protests in 2017-2018, 2019-2020, 2022, and ongoing unrest since 2022, driven by economic crises and the Mahsa Amini protests.
• **Tor relays wouldn't help in Egypt's complete internet shutdown** - This was observationally correct. Egypt's government successfully shut down ~93% of internet traffic by pressuring telecommunications providers, demonstrating the vulnerability of circumvention tools when faced with infrastructure-level blocking.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
While historically notable as contemporaneous commentary on the Arab Spring, this brief blog post has minimal scientific or biotechnological substance and limited long-term analytical value.
