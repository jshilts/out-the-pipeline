# Hexacyclinol Retracted. It Only Took Six Years. (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary reports the formal retraction of the LaClair hexacyclinol synthesis paper in Angewandte Chemie, six years after its original publication. The retraction was triggered by insufficient Supporting Information—specifically missing experimental procedures, characterization data for synthetic intermediates, and NMR spectra that prevented validation of the synthetic claims.

The article expresses frustration with the journal's six-year delay in retracting the paper, noting that these deficiencies were apparent immediately upon publication. The author points out that while Angewandte Chemie rarely issues retractions, the problems with this paper were obvious from the start. The piece references earlier coverage of the hexacyclinol controversy from 2009 and notes that an entire undergraduate-to-PhD timeline had elapsed during the period it took to formally retract the flawed work.

## 2. HISTORY
The hexacyclinol saga represents a significant case study in scientific controversy and retraction processes. The original 2006 paper by LaClair claimed the total synthesis of hexacyclinol, a complex natural product isolated from mushrooms, but skepticism emerged almost immediately within the organic chemistry community due to inadequate experimental evidence.

In the years following this 2012 retraction, several important developments occurred. The case became a textbook example in discussions of scientific integrity and journal responsibility. Retraction policies at major chemistry journals evolved to become more responsive to concerns about data availability and reproducibility. The hexacyclinol controversy also contributed to broader conversations about the need for more transparent peer review processes and the importance of robust supporting information requirements.

However, the specific field impact was limited. Hexacyclinol was neither a commercial drug target nor a therapeutic compound—it was primarily of academic interest as a synthetic challenge. No drugs were developed or abandoned based on this work, and the retraction primarily served as a cautionary tale about verification standards in natural product synthesis. The lack of clinical or commercial applications meant the practical consequences were confined to academic discussions about research integrity rather than affecting patient care or drug development pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments, focusing instead on retrospective criticism of the delay in retraction. The implicit expectation was that journals would improve their responsiveness to concerns about problematic publications, which has indeed occurred to some extent through enhanced retraction policies and greater emphasis on data availability requirements across major chemistry journals since 2012.

## 4. INTEREST
Score: 6/9

This article addresses important issues of scientific integrity and publication ethics, making it moderately interesting within the chemistry community. However, its broader significance is limited by the fact that hexacyclinol had no clinical or commercial applications, restricting its impact primarily to academic discussions about verification standards rather than affecting public health or biotechnology development.
