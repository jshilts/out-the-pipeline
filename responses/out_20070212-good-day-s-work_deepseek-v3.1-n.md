# A Good Day's Work (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the biotech investment landscape through two contrasting examples from early 2007. The article opens by referencing a New York Times piece describing Xoma's 25-year history of losing $700 million, illustrating the high-risk nature of biotech investing. The author then presents the counterexample: Onyx Pharmaceuticals surged 90% in a single day after reporting positive data for Nexavar (sorafenib) in treating hepatic cancer, in partnership with Bayer.

The central argument is that biotech stocks attract investors for the same reason lottery tickets do—the potential for dramatic, unexpected returns. However, the author contends that biotech has a long-term advantage because "we're learning what we're doing" through trial and error, even though cancer remains poorly understood and trial outcomes are often surprising. The Nexavar case exemplified this unpredictability: the drug had previously failed in melanoma trials, making the liver cancer success unexpected.

## 2. HISTORY

**Nexavar's Subsequent Development:**
Nexavar (sorafenib) did receive FDA approval for hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in November 2007, validating the positive trial results mentioned in the article. It became the first systemic therapy approved for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, representing a significant breakthrough. The drug also maintained its approved indications for advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer).

However, the article's characterization of liver cancer as "a bigger market than anything that Nexavar is approved for" proved accurate only in terms of patient numbers. While hepatocellular carcinoma affects hundreds of thousands globally, treatment adoption faced challenges due to the drug's significant side effects and modest survival benefits (typically extending life by 2-3 months). Over the subsequent decade, Nexavar generated substantial revenue for Bayer—reaching peak annual sales of approximately $1 billion—but faced increasing competition from newer therapies.

**The Competitive Landscape:**
In the decade following this article, several other targeted therapies and immunotherapies emerged for liver cancer, including regorafenib, lenvatinib, and checkpoint inhibitors. By the mid-2010s, first-line treatment options had expanded beyond Nexavar, though sorafenib remained an important standard of care. The drug's patent expired in major markets around 2020-2021, leading to generic competition.

**Company Outcomes:**
Onyx Pharmaceuticals, the company that surged 90% on the news, was eventually acquired by Amgen in 2013 for $10.4 billion—a significant return for long-term investors. Xoma, the cautionary example mentioned in the article, continued its struggles but shifted its business model toward out-licensing antibody technologies rather than drug development, eventually achieving more stable financial footing through this strategic pivot.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Biotech stocks continue to get buyers - for the same reason that lottery tickets do. It would be interesting to know which one has returned more money over the years"** - This comparison proved apt. While successful biotech investments (like Onyx) generated enormous returns, the sector as a whole remained highly volatile through the next decade, with approximately 90% of clinical trials failing. However, major breakthroughs in immunotherapy and targeted therapies during the 2010s did ultimately deliver substantial returns for investors who picked winners.

• **"Long-term, biotech has the edge, because (slowly and with infinite pains) we're learning what we're doing"** - This proved prescient. The period from 2007-2020 saw remarkable advances in cancer treatment understanding: immunotherapy's breakthrough success (checkpoint inhibitors approved starting 2011), CAR-T cell therapy approval (2017), improved understanding of tumor biology, and precision medicine approaches. However, cancer treatment remained—and remains—incremental rather than revolutionary, with most new therapies offering modest improvements rather than cures.

• **"Liver cancer is a bigger market"** - This was empirically true in terms of disease prevalence, but the market dynamics proved more complex. While hepatocellular carcinoma affects hundreds of thousands annually, treatment challenges (late diagnosis, comorbidities, patient access) meant that revenue potential didn't directly correlate with patient numbers. Pharmaceutical economics revealed that smaller markets with better reimbursement (like certain rare diseases) could be more profitable than larger markets with access barriers.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article accurately captured the high-risk, high-reward dynamics of biotech investing through the lens of a specific moment, and its cautious optimism about long-term learning proved justified. However, it covers relatively standard investment themes without deeper scientific insight, and the Nexavar story, while illustrative, was not paradigm-shifting compared to subsequent immunotherapy breakthroughs.
