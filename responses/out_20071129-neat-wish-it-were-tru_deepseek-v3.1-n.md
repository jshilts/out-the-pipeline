# Wish It Were True! (29 Nov 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on an embarrassing retraction incident in synthetic organic chemistry. Two papers in *Angewandte Chemie* (2007) and *Organic Letters* (2006) claimed to have synthesized unusual 12-membered diazaannulene rings from dinitrophenyl pyridinium salts and primary amines. However, Professor Manfred Cristl of Würzburg recognized that the authors had actually rediscovered a 100-year-old reaction producing simple pyridinium salts instead of the novel structures they claimed. Both groups admitted their error after Cristl challenged them, with spectral data confirming the compounds were previously known pyridinium derivatives rather than the claimed cyclic structures.

The article criticizes the breakdown in scientific rigor on multiple levels: inadequate literature searching by the researchers, insufficient analytical chemistry (relying only on quick NMR and LC/MS), and poor peer review by referees at both prestigious journals who lacked sufficient knowledge of heterocyclic chemistry to catch the fundamental error.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2007 incident became part of a broader narrative about quality control issues in scientific publishing, particularly in high-impact journals. The retraction story circulated widely in chemistry blogs and discussion forums, contributing to ongoing concerns about peer review reliability.

However, the article's broader concern about systemic problems in chemical literature appears prescient when viewed against subsequent developments. The 2010s saw increasing attention to the "reproducibility crisis" across scientific fields, with chemistry being no exception. Major initiatives emerged to address research quality, including:

- Enhanced post-publication review processes
- Greater emphasis on supplementary data availability
- Development of automated literature searching tools
- Increased scrutiny of spectacular claims in high-impact journals
- Growing recognition of confirmation bias in peer review

The specific reactions described (forming pyridinium salts rather than novel macrocycles) remained well-understood chemistry, and no subsequent revival of the retracted claims occurred.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the consequences and implications of this incident:

• **Peer review quality concerns would persist** - ✓ **Correct**. This incident contributed to ongoing discussions about peer review reliability, particularly in high-impact journals. The subsequent decade saw numerous high-profile retractions and continued debate about review quality.

• **Journals would face reputational damage from sloppy reviewing** - ✓ **Partially correct**. While *Angewandte Chemie* maintained its high impact factor, the incident added to broader concerns about rapid publication pressures compromising thorough review. The chemistry community continued using these journals but with greater awareness of the need for critical reading.

• **Specialized knowledge gaps would continue causing problems** - ✓ **Correct**. The prediction that referees chosen based on author specialization would share their knowledge gaps proved accurate. This became part of larger discussions about interdisciplinary work and the challenges of finding appropriate reviewers for novel claims.

• **Better literature searching would become essential** - ✓ **Correct**. The following years saw significant improvements in chemical literature databases, search algorithms, and citation analysis tools, partly driven by recognition that inadequate literature review was enabling avoidable errors.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses fundamental issues in scientific publishing quality control that remained relevant, though its specific case study was relatively narrow in scope compared to broader reproducibility or misconduct issues that emerged more prominently in subsequent years.
