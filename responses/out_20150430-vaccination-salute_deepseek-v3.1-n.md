# A Vaccination Salute (April 2015)

## 1. Summary

This article celebrates the elimination of rubella (German measles) from the Americas, announced in April 2015, framing it as a major public health triumph achieved through vaccination. The author, who identifies as working in small-molecule drug discovery, emphasizes that vaccines represent one of humanity's greatest medical achievements, alongside clean water infrastructure, in preventing suffering and death.

The article contrasts this success with anti-vaccination activists, noting their tendency to minimize the devastating impact of diseases like smallpox and polio that vaccines have controlled or eliminated. The author acknowledges that vaccine safety should be examined carefully but argues that the overwhelming benefits of vaccination are undeniable, having prevented countless deaths, disabilities, and birth defects. The piece concludes by saluting healthcare workers who continue vaccination efforts, sometimes at personal risk.

## 2. History

The 2015 rubella elimination announcement marked a milestone in a decades-long vaccination campaign. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine had been in widespread use since the 1970s in many countries, with the Americas region adopting aggressive vaccination strategies through PAHO (Pan American Health Organization).

However, subsequent years showed a more complex picture. While rubella remained eliminated in the Americas, **measles made a concerning resurgence**. In 2018-2019, the United States experienced its largest measles outbreak in decades, with over 1,200 cases, driven largely by undervaccinated communities and imported cases. The WHO reported that global measles cases surged in 2019 to their highest levels in 23 years, reversing previous progress.

The growing anti-vaccination movement mentioned in the article became more visibly impactful after 2015. The 2016 US election and subsequent years saw vaccine hesitancy become more politically polarized. The COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020 brought vaccine debates to the forefront of public discourse, with mRNA vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 achieving unprecedented speed (authorized in under a year) but also facing intensified opposition and misinformation campaigns.

By the 2020s, public health officials increasingly recognized vaccine hesitancy as a major threat to disease control. The WHO listed "vaccine hesitancy" as one of the top ten global health threats in 2019. Policy responses varied, with some jurisdictions implementing stricter vaccine mandates for school entry, while others faced legal challenges to such requirements.

## 3. Predictions

The article contained implicit rather than explicit predictions about future vaccine developments, but several themes emerged:

• **Continued vaccine development and deployment at personal risk to healthcare workers**: This has largely continued as predicted. The Ebola outbreaks in Africa, SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and ongoing polio eradication efforts in Pakistan and Afghanistan have indeed involved healthcare workers facing significant personal danger. However, the author perhaps underestimated how vaccine campaigns themselves would become flashpoints for violence and political conflict.

• **The threat posed by anti-vaccination movements**: The article's implicit concern about anti-vaccination impact has proven prescient. Measles resurgence in the US and Europe, along with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, showed these movements could meaningfully impact public health outcomes. The author's assessment that these movements "ignore or misrepresent" vaccine benefits accurately predicted how misinformation would evolve and spread through social media platforms in subsequent years.

• **The magnitude of vaccine-preventable suffering**: The article's claim about "untold millions" of prevented deaths and disabilities continued to be supported by data through the 2015-2020s period, particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic where vaccines substantially reduced mortality and severe disease. However, the author may not have anticipated how vaccine equity would become a major global issue, with wealthier countries achieving high vaccination rates while many lower-income nations struggled with access.

## 4. Interest

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important public health milestone (rubella elimination) with thoughtful commentary on vaccination's broader significance, but it primarily synthesizes known information rather than presenting novel insights. The prescient concern about anti-vaccination movements gives it modest relevance for understanding later developments, but overall it represents competent but not exceptional commentary for its time. The piece gains some retrospective relevance from the vaccine debates that intensified after 2015, making it more interesting in hindsight than it might have appeared originally.
