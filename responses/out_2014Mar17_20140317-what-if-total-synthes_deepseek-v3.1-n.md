# Analysis of "What If Total Syntheses Had Only 25 Steps to Work In?" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a provocative paper by Johann Mulzer (from the Corey group) that questioned the relevance and direction of total organic synthesis in modern chemistry. Mulzer argued that the field had become obsessed with "heroic" first syntheses of complex natural products, regardless of practicality, often requiring excessive resources, time, and personnel. He contended this approach was wasteful and potentially blocked development in more relevant chemical areas.

The central proposal was establishing a 25-step limit for synthetic routes - arguing that if a target molecule couldn't be synthesized within approximately 25 steps, it wasn't worth pursuing as it would never be efficient or practical. The article frames this as a call for the field to prioritize shorter, more efficient syntheses over brute-force "first syntheses" that could only be achieved by throwing massive resources at challenging targets.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) has largely validated Mulzer's concerns and seen a significant shift in synthetic chemistry priorities:

**Academic Response**: The synthetic community increasingly embraced efficiency metrics beyond just "first synthesis." This period saw growing emphasis on step economy, atom economy, and sustainability in route design.

**Automation and AI Integration**: The emergence of retrosynthesis software (including AI-driven platforms) made route analysis and optimization more systematic. Companies like Chematica (acquired by Merck) developed algorithms that could rapidly evaluate thousands of potential synthetic routes for efficiency.

**Automated Synthesis Platforms**: The period saw significant advances in flow chemistry, automated synthesis platforms, and high-throughput experimentation, making shorter syntheses not just theoretically desirable but practically necessary for scalable production.

**Pharmaceutical Industry Trends**: The biotech/pharma industry increasingly moved away from complex natural products toward more synthetically accessible compounds, driven partly by cost pressures and the need for scalable manufacturing.

**Synthetic Biology**: Alternative production methods for complex molecules - particularly engineered biosynthesis and metabolic pathway engineering - became increasingly viable, offering routes to complex natural products that bypassed traditional synthetic challenges entirely.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions**:
- **Sustainability Focus**: Mulzer correctly predicted the need for more efficient, resource-conscious synthesis. The field has indeed moved toward valuing step economy and practical scalability.
- **First Synthesis Obsolescence**: The idea that "first synthesis" alone wasn't sufficient justification has largely been validated. Modern synthetic papers increasingly emphasize efficiency metrics alongside novelty.
- **Need for Reorientation**: The field did undergo significant reorientation, with more emphasis on methodology development, catalysis, and sustainable chemistry.

**Inaccurate Predictions**:
- **The 25-Step "Iron Maxim"**: This rigid cutoff proved too dogmatic. While efficiency matters, some complex molecules of biological importance justified longer routes when no alternatives existed. The principle evolved into more nuanced efficiency considerations rather than absolute step limits.
- **Obsession Narrative**: The characterization of "obsession with almost any natural product" may have been overstated. Many challenging natural product syntheses led to important methodological advances that benefited broader chemistry.

**Mixed Outcomes**:
- **Alternative Technologies**: While Mulzer framed this as traditional synthesis needing reform, he didn't fully anticipate how synthetic biology and biotechnology would provide alternative routes to complex molecules, changing the competitive landscape entirely.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article earns a high interest score for several reasons:

**Prescience**: The piece anticipated major trends in synthetic chemistry that would unfold over the next decade, including the shift toward sustainability and efficiency metrics.

**Catalytic Effect**: It contributed to important discussions about the direction and purpose of synthetic chemistry, influencing how the field evaluates and prioritizes research.

**Balanced Critique**: Coming from an experienced practitioner (Corey group alumnus), it carried weight and wasn't easily dismissed as outsider criticism.

**Relevance to Broader Trends**: The tensions discussed - between blue-sky research and practicality, between academic achievement and real-world impact - reflect broader questions about scientific priorities and resource allocation.

**Continued Relevance**: The issues raised remain relevant today as chemistry faces increasing pressure to address sustainability, climate change, and practical applications.

The article's limitations - particularly the somewhat arbitrary 25-step limit - don't diminish its importance in sparking necessary conversations about the direction and purpose of synthetic organic chemistry. It successfully challenged prevailing assumptions and contributed to a healthier, more self-critical research culture in the field.
