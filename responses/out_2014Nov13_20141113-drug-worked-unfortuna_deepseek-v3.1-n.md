# Retrospective Analysis: "The Drug Worked, Unfortunately" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article described OXiGENE's Phase II trial of fosbretabulin (combretastatin A-4 phosphate) in combination with Avastin for recurrent ovarian cancer. The trial showed positive results with increased progression-free survival compared to Avastin alone, particularly in platinum-resistant patients. However, the piece highlighted a critical strategic problem: Roche was simultaneously running trials to get Avastin approved for this indication, and Roche's combination data appeared superior to OXiGENE's results. The author warned that OXiGENE faced a catch-22: if Roche's Avastin+chemo treatment gained approval, it would become the standard-of-care comparator against which OXiGENE's combination would likely show inferiority; if Roche failed to get approval, OXiGENE's entire dataset would be based on an unapproved therapy, rendering it worthless. The article framed this as a cautionary tale about drug development strategy, where "successful" clinical results might still lead to commercial failure.

## 2. HISTORY

**OXiGENE's trajectory:** Subsequent to the article, OXiGENE's fosbretabulin program faced continuing challenges. The company conducted several trials across different indications, including anaplastic thyroid cancer and various solid tumors, but struggled to achieve clear regulatory success. In 2016, OXiGENE announced that its Phase 3 trial (FACT study) for anaplastic thyroid cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival improvement. This failure led to significant restructuring, layoffs, and a shift in corporate strategy.

By 2017-2018, OXiGENE had effectively abandoned fosbretabulin's development and pivoted toward other pipeline assets, eventually rebranding as **Mateon Therapeutics** (changing its ticker from OXGN to MATN). The company attempted to reposition itself around immuno-oncology and tumor microenvironment modulation. However, these efforts also struggled, and in 2020, Mateon merged with **Oncotelic Inc.** (OTLC), effectively ending OXiGENE's independence. The merger created Oncotelic Therapeutics, which continued working on various oncology programs, but fosbretabulin had effectively been shelved.

**Roche's Avastin in ovarian cancer:** As predicted in the article and updated, Roche did receive expanded FDA approval for Avastin in combination with chemotherapy for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. Avastin became (and remains) an important treatment option in this setting, consolidating its position as a standard-of-care backbone therapy.

**Combretastatin derivatives:** While fosbretabulin specifically failed, the broader class of vascular disrupting agents continued to be explored, with some later-generation compounds showing more promise in niche applications. However, the field largely moved away from single-agent vascular disruption toward combination strategies and immuno-oncology approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Correct predictions:**
- ✓ Roche did receive approval for Avastin in platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer
- ✓ OXiGENE faced extremely difficult strategic decisions regarding Phase III trial design
- ✓ The company was indeed "up the creek" if they continued pursuing fosbretabulin in this indication
- ✓ The article correctly identified the catch-22 strategic trap OXiGENE was caught in
- ✓ Superior data from Roche did make OXiGENE's combination appear inferior by comparison

**Most prescient prediction:** The article's central thesis proved entirely correct—OXiGENE's "success" in Phase II was pyrrhic because they had backed themselves into a strategic dead-end where positive data still led to commercial failure.

**What played out differently:**
- OXiGENE's eventual pivot and merger trajectory wasn't explicitly predicted, though the article's implicit forecast was the company would face severe challenges
- The dramatic outcome (company rebranding and eventual acquisition) represents an even more extreme version of "not good enough" than the article suggested
- fosbretabulin's complete removal from the pipeline across all indications exceeded the article's focus on the ovarian cancer program specifically

**Structural insight accuracy:** The article correctly identified a crucial but often overlooked dimension of drug development—strategic positioning relative to emerging standards of care. Even genuinely effective drugs can fail commercially if their development timeline and trial designs don't account for shifting regulatory baselines.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5/9**

This article ranks in the sixth decile of interest (5/9). While it addresses a moderately important topic in biopharma strategy and provides accurate analysis, its long-term importance is limited by several factors.

**Reasons for moderate interest rating:**
- **Sector-specific focus:** This is primarily a business strategy piece about a small-cap biotech company rather than a broader scientific or medical breakthrough
- **Limited generalizable lessons:** The specific strategic trap OXiGENE faced was somewhat unique to their situation, though the broader lesson (timing and comparator selection matters) is valuable
- **Niche commercial/regulatory focus:** Most of the general public wouldn't find this directly relevant, as technical biopharma development/approval strategy details are relatively specialized

**Strengths elevating the score:**
- **Predictive accuracy:** The article's forecasting about Roche's approval and OXiGENE's challenges was highly accurate
- **Educational value about drug development complexity:** Reveals important aspects of regulatory strategy that outsiders rarely appreciate
- **Quality of analysis:** Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of FDA approval dynamics and competitive positioning in biotechnology

**Limitations preventing higher score:**
- **Bounded timescale relevance:** The analysis had importance in its immediate context (2014-2017) but doesn't represent a long-term scientific or medical breakthrough
- **Company-specific focus:** While the company's eventual fate makes for an interesting case study, it's not a major biopharma development story that would interest broad audiences
- **Technical/field evolution:** Drug development strategies and FDA approval pathways have evolved substantially since 2014, making some aspects dated

The article serves well as a cautionary case study in biotech strategy but doesn't reach the level of scientific discoveries or major medical advances that would rank in higher deciles.
