# A New Journal (With Bonus Elsevier‑Bashing) (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece argues that the traditional subscription‑based publishing model is beginning to crumble. It highlights the Wellcome Trust’s announcement (in partnership with the Max Planck Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute) of a new high‑profile, fully open‑access journal called **eLife**, which the author expects to rival Nature and Science. The article praises eLife’s free‑to‑read policy and notes that Wellcome is even considering “sanctions” for researchers who do not make their papers openly available within six months.  

In contrast, the author lambasts Elsevier, portraying it as resistant to change, riddled with technical glitches, and willing to charge exorbitant subscription fees while offering only minimal quality control. A series of sarcastic links are used to illustrate alleged misbehaviour by Elsevier and its subsidiaries.

## 2. HISTORY  

### eLife’s evolution  
* **Launch (2012‑2013).** eLife began publishing research articles in 2012, initially as a hybrid journal: authors could publish under a subscription model or pay an article‑processing charge (APC) for immediate open access.  
* **Growth and reputation.** Within a few years the journal attracted high‑impact work in cell biology, neuroscience, and genetics, earning an impact factor of ~7–8 by the early 2020s. It became a respected venue, though it never displaced Nature or Science as the primary “prestige” outlets.  
* **Full open‑access transition (2021).** After a community‑wide consultation, eLife announced that from 2021 onward all content would be published under a Creative Commons BY licence with no APCs for authors; the journal is funded directly by its founding institutions and a charitable endowment.  
* **Operational changes.** eLife introduced a “review‑first” workflow that decouples peer review from journal branding, a model that has been adopted by a handful of other publishers (e.g., *eLife*’s “eLife Lens” and the *eLife* “review‑transfer” system).  

### Funding‑agency OA policies  
* **Wellcome Trust.** The Trust’s 2012 policy required articles to be made freely available within six months of publication; this was later tightened to immediate OA for all research it funds (2020). No direct financial “sanctions” were imposed, but compliance became a condition for grant renewal.  
* **Broader landscape.** The European Commission’s **Plan S** (launched 2018) and similar mandates in the US (e.g., NIH’s public‑access requirement) reinforced the shift toward immediate OA, echoing the article’s prediction of growing pressure on subscription models.  

### Elsevier’s response and market shifts  
* **Hybrid and “read‑and‑publish” deals.** Elsevier expanded its portfolio of hybrid journals and, from ~2018 onward, negotiated large institutional “read‑and‑publish” agreements that bundle subscription access with OA publishing rights.  
* **Open‑access journals.** Elsevier launched several fully OA titles (e.g., *Cell Reports*, *The Lancet Digital Health*) and acquired existing OA platforms (e.g., *Mendeley Data*).  
* **Boycott and negotiations.** The “Cost of Knowledge” boycott, begun in 2012, persisted for several years but never achieved a mass exodus. Many institutions now maintain subscription contracts while also supporting OA mandates.  
* **Quality control.** While the article suggested a decline in editorial standards, Elsevier’s flagship journals (e.g., *The Lancet*, *Cell*) have retained high impact factors and citation metrics. Some high‑profile retractions (e.g., the 2018 *Lancet* hydroxychloroquine paper) sparked debate about peer‑review rigor across the industry, not solely at Elsevier.  

### Overall market outcome  
The publishing ecosystem has become **hybrid**: a mix of subscription, fully OA, and transformative agreements. The “breakup” of the old model is real, but it has been gradual and mediated by large publishers adapting rather than disappearing. Open‑access mandates now cover the majority of publicly funded biomedical research in Europe and increasingly in the US and Asia.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **eLife will directly compete with Nature and Science as a top‑tier venue.** | eLife is respected and publishes high‑impact work, but Nature/Science remain the dominant prestige journals with far larger submission volumes and impact factors. | Partially true – eLife is influential but has not displaced the top tier. |
| **Wellcome Trust will sanction researchers who ignore its OA policy.** | Wellcome made OA compliance a grant‑renewal condition; no monetary penalties were imposed, but non‑compliance can jeopardize future funding. | Broadly accurate in spirit; the “sanctions” were softer than implied. |
| **Elsevier will cling to subscription models and resist change.** | Elsevier has embraced hybrid models, read‑and‑publish contracts, and launched many OA journals. It still earns most revenue from subscriptions, but it is actively adapting. | Prediction overstated; Elsevier is shifting, albeit cautiously. |
| **The publishing model will fragment in stages, becoming inevitable.** | The market has indeed fragmented: subscription, hybrid, fully OA, preprint servers, and community‑run platforms (e.g., *bioRxiv*, *medRxiv*) now coexist. | Correct. |
| **Technical glitches and poor quality control at Elsevier will persist.** | Elsevier’s platform reliability has improved (e.g., migration to modern content‑delivery systems). Quality‑control issues are now comparable across publishers; no systematic decline has been documented. | Not supported by evidence. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the transition toward open access and correctly anticipates many structural changes, making it historically interesting. Its hyperbolic tone and some exaggerated claims lower the score, but the piece remains a useful snapshot of early‑2010s sentiment.
