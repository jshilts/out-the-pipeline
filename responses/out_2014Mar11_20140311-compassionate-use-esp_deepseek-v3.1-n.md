# Retrospective Analysis: "Compassionate Use: An Especially Tough Case" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article by Derek Lowe addressed a heartbreaking ethical dilemma that emerged in March 2014 when parents of a dying 7-year-old boy sought compassionate use access to brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral drug being developed by biotech company Chimerix. Lowe described this as an "especially tough case" that highlighted the fundamental tension between individual patient needs and the sustainability of small biotech companies.

The central argument Lowe makes is that small companies face potential bankruptcy if they attempt to fulfill all compassionate use requests, forcing an unenviable choice: either allow these companies to develop promising drugs without granting broad compassionate access, or effectively destroy them by mandating such access. He explicitly states he has "no good solution" to this structural problem. The piece briefly notes that Chimerix ultimately decided to provide the drug through a new 20-patient trial after discussions with the FDA, suggesting this may have been the least worst resolution available.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments significantly validated the article's framing of this as a systemic issue rather than an isolated case. The Josh Hardy case became a landmark moment that catalyzed ongoing policy discussions around compassionate use and Right to Try laws.

Chimerix's brincidofovir followed a complex trajectory. The drug ultimately failed its Phase 3 trials and was never approved by the FDA for its intended indication (treatment of adenovirus infections). Chimerix discontinued its development program, though the compound did show some efficacy in other viral infections. The company later rebranded and shifted its focus to oncology research.

More broadly, the compassionate use debate intensified after 2014. In 2018, President Trump signed the federal Right to Try Act, which aimed to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access experimental therapies without going through the FDA's expanded access program. However, the law's practical impact has been limited—most major pharmaceutical companies continue to prefer using the existing FDA expanded access framework, and relatively few patients have successfully accessed treatments through Right to Try pathways.

The fundamental tension Lowe identified persists largely unchanged. Small biotech companies still face the same resource constraints when balancing compassionate requests against clinical trial costs and regulatory requirements. The Josh Hardy case did not resolve this systemic issue, though it did increase public awareness of expanded access programs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions that held up:** Lowe's central prediction that this represented a systemic problem with no easy solutions proved prescient. The Josh Hardy case did not fundamentally alter the structural constraints facing small biotech companies, and similar dilemmas have continued to emerge. His assessment that companies like Chimerix could go bankrupt trying to meet compassionate use demands was realistic—though in this specific case, the company survived long enough for the drug to fail in trials for different reasons.

**Predictions that were wrong or incomplete:** While Lowe correctly identified the structural problem, he may have underestimated the potential for regulatory and policy responses to emerge (even if they ultimately proved inadequate). The federal Right to Try movement gained significant momentum in the years following the article, suggesting that political and public pressure could force some response, however imperfect. Additionally, the eventual failure of brincidofovir in clinical trials introduces a different dimension that wasn't anticipated in Lowe's analysis—the experimental drug that sparked this crisis of conscience ultimately didn't work anyway.

**Most prescient insight:** Lowe's recognition that "under the current system, we have a choice: let small companies try to discover drugs like this, without granting access, or wipe them out by making them grant it" accurately captured the durable structural reality that persists today. No satisfactory solution has emerged in the intervening decade.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article merits a decile score of 6, placing it in the upper middle range of interest and importance. While it doesn't rank among the most revolutionary or paradigm-shifting scientific commentaries, it addresses a persistent and deeply human challenge at the intersection of biotechnology, ethics, and policy.

Its elevated interest stems from several factors: It addresses a genuinely tragic human situation that forced difficult questions about resource allocation and corporate responsibility in drug development. The case became a national news story and influenced policy debates about Right to Try laws. The underlying tension Lowe identified—between individual compassion and systemic sustainability—remains unresolved a decade later and continues to surface in discussions about drug pricing, experimental therapies, and access to care.

However, the article falls short of the highest decile because the specific case ultimately receded from public attention, the drug in question failed, and no transformative solutions emerged from the crisis. While intellectually honest about the dilemma, the piece doesn't offer revolutionary insights or catalyze fundamental changes in the system it critiques.
