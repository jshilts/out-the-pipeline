# Insider Trading at the FDA (March 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary warned that insider trading is not limited to Wall Street “suits” but also occurs inside the biotech world, where a handful of people know the outcomes of clinical trials and FDA decisions before anyone else.  The author described the SEC’s case against Cheng Li (also spelled Liang) and his son Andrew Liang, former FDA employees who allegedly used a network of family‑and‑friend brokerage accounts to trade on non‑public FDA approval information from 2006‑2010.  The scheme reportedly netted more than US $3 million, with the biggest gain coming from front‑running the surprise approval of Vanda Pharmaceutical’s antipsychotic Fanapt (iloperidone) in 2009.  The article listed other small‑cap targets—Mannkind, Momenta, Pharmacyclics—and suggested that the SEC complaint was a “blueprint for getting caught.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Legal outcome of the Liang case** – The SEC filed an administrative complaint in March 2011 (SEC Complaint No. 21907).  The Liangs settled the civil action without admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreeing to disgorge roughly US $3.6 million in ill‑gotten profits and to pay civil penalties of about US $1 million.  No criminal charges were ever brought against them, and the case closed with the settlement in late 2011.

**Regulatory and enforcement trends** – The case reinforced the SEC’s willingness to pursue “inside” information that originates from FDA decision‑making.  Over the next decade the SEC’s Enforcement Division issued several high‑profile actions against individuals who traded on FDA‑related non‑public information, including a 2015 case involving a former FDA employee who traded on early data about a cardiovascular device, and a 2020 case tied to COVID‑19 vaccine trial data.  The agency also expanded its “Insider Trading and Market Abuse” guidance to explicitly list FDA approvals as material non‑public information.

**FDA internal controls** – In response to the Liang case and other compliance concerns, the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) increased monitoring of employee communications and instituted stricter “need‑to‑know” protocols for pre‑approval data.  While the FDA does not publicly disclose all internal security upgrades, congressional testimony in 2014 confirmed that the agency had instituted mandatory “firewall” training for staff handling pre‑approval information.

**Fate of the companies mentioned**  

| Company | Post‑2011 trajectory (key facts) |
|---|---|
| **Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Fanapt)** | Fanapt remained on the market but never achieved blockbuster sales; Vanda’s stock fell from its 2009 peak.  In 2020 Vanda merged with **Bausch Health Companies** (formerly Valeant) in a deal valued at ≈ US $1 billion, effectively ending Vanda as an independent public company. |
| **Mannkind (Afrezza)** | Afrezza received FDA approval in 2014, but uptake was limited due to insurance coverage issues.  Mannkind’s share price collapsed, and the company was delisted from NASDAQ in 2020, later trading on the OTC market. |
| **Momenta Pharmaceuticals** | Momenta’s pipeline advanced, culminating in the FDA approval of several protein‑based therapeutics.  In 2020 Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit acquired Momenta for ≈ US $6.5 billion, a “big‑ticket” exit for a firm once cited in the insider‑trading case. |
| **Pharmacyclics** | The company’s lead product, ibrutinib (Imbruvica), received FDA approval in 2013 and became a blockbuster.  AbbVie purchased Pharmacyclics for US $21 billion in 2015, one of the largest biotech acquisitions of the decade. |

**Policy impact** – The Liang case, together with the 2011 Matrixx Supreme Court decision on materiality of adverse‑event reports, prompted the SEC to issue updated guidance (2012) clarifying that any FDA‑related information that could affect a company’s market value is “material.”  The guidance has been cited in subsequent enforcement actions and is now standard training for securities‑law compliance officers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction:** Insider trading based on FDA decisions would continue until caught.  
  **Outcome:** The practice persisted, but enforcement intensified.  Between 2011‑2023 the SEC secured over a dozen convictions or settlements involving FDA‑related insider trading, indicating that the “blueprint” was indeed used both by perpetrators and by regulators.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The Liang scheme would be a “blueprint for getting caught.”  
  **Outcome:** The SEC’s complaint detailed the use of multiple brokerage accounts, IP‑address tracking, and phone‑number links—methods that later appear in other enforcement actions (e.g., 2015 and 2020 cases).  The case became a teaching example in SEC training materials and in law‑school securities‑law courses.

No other specific forecasts (e.g., stock performance of the named companies) were made, so no further comparison is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of a rare intersection between regulatory science and securities law, and the subsequent outcomes (high‑profile acquisitions, lasting enforcement changes) give it lasting relevance, though the piece itself is brief and lacks deep analysis.
