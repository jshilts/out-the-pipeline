# A Science Center, This Is a Disgrace (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary by Derek Lowe criticizes the Connecticut Science Center for displaying a nonsensical, fake chemical structure in its exhibits. The author expresses frustration that a science-focused institution would use scientifically illiterate graphics, arguing this reflects an attitude of "close enough" that undermines credibility. He compares this to other hypothetical errors (like mislabeled maps or fake languages) that would draw public complaint, emphasizing that scientific accuracy should receive the same respect. Lowe calls for the Center to demonstrate it actually cares about science by correcting such errors. The article concludes with an update noting the Center apologized and committed to removing the problematic graphics.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2014 incident, the Connecticut Science Center responded promptly by acknowledging the error and removing the inaccurate chemical graphics. This episode occurred during a broader period when science communication and science centers were gaining renewed public attention - the 2009 opening of the new Hartford facility mentioned in the article represented significant investment in science education infrastructure.

The incident highlighted ongoing tensions between making science accessible and maintaining scientific accuracy in public-facing materials. While this specific case resolved quickly, the underlying issue of scientific accuracy in science communication continued to be relevant in subsequent years, particularly as social media enabled rapid public scrutiny of scientific errors in public institutions.

No major policy changes or regulatory developments stemmed specifically from this incident, but it contributed to ongoing discussions within the science communication community about the responsibility of science institutions to model accuracy. The Connecticut Science Center continued its operations and programming without significant reputational damage from this corrected error.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in biotechnology or broader scientific trends. The commentary focused primarily on a present-day concern about maintaining scientific accuracy in science education settings. Since this was a critique rather than a forward-looking analysis, the piece did not make testable predictions about drug development, clinical trials, regulatory changes, or market developments that could be evaluated against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the article raises a legitimate concern about scientific accuracy in public education venues, it focuses on a minor, localized incident that was quickly resolved and lacks broader implications for biotechnology, drug development, or major scientific policy. The content is too narrow and time-bound to rank highly among articles of long-term importance in science and biotechnology discourse.
