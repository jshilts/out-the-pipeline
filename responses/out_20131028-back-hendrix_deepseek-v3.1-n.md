# Back to Hendrix (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article is a personal reflection piece written by a chemist returning to his alma mater, Hendrix College, to speak to students. The author describes the surreal experience of being in the same classroom where he took his first college chemistry course 34 years earlier, noting the extensive renovations and expansion of the campus facilities. He reflects on the passage of time and how his perspective has shifted, observing that current students appear more poised than he remembers his own cohort being.

The piece provides detailed observations about the evolution of chemistry infrastructure at the institution, including upgrades from 60 MHz NMR instruments to 400 MHz equipment, and mentions faculty changes such as the addition of Professor Chris Marvin to work alongside his former mentor Tom Goodwin. The author also touches on his current research involving ruthenium-catalyzed photochemistry and reflects on how technology and academic environments have transformed over the decades.

## 2. HISTORY

This is a personal blog post reflecting on a college visit, not an article about biotechnology industry developments, scientific breakthroughs, or drug development. As such, there are no subsequent FDA approvals, clinical trials, business outcomes, or policy changes to analyze in relation to this content.

The article's purpose was nostalgic reflection rather than scientific reporting or prediction. The mention of ruthenium-catalyzed photochemistry and NMR technology upgrades were contextual details within a broader personal narrative about returning to an alma mater.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contains no predictions about scientific developments, biotechnology trends, drug pipelines, or industry outcomes. It is exclusively a retrospective personal reflection piece.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This article is a purely personal blog post about a college reunion visit with no scientific, biotechnological, or industry-relevant content. It falls outside the scope of commentary about biotechnology developments and contains no analytical value for understanding the field.
