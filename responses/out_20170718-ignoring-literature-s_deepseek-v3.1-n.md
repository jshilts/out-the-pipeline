# Ignoring the Literature, Selectively (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a Nature Reviews Cancer perspective by Kevan Shokat on validating chemical probes for drug discovery. The author highlights Shokat's three criteria for probe validation: dose-response data, crystal structure evidence of the probe bound to the target protein, and follow-up studies showing improved versions of the molecule. Shokat notably argues against requiring animal model efficacy data too early, warning that premature animal studies lead to false-positive claims of target inhibition. The commentary endorses Shokat's view that lack of follow-up publications is a red flag—if no improved molecules or additional target engagement data appear within several years, the original molecule likely represents an artifact rather than a genuine probe.

The author contextualizes this advice within broader scientific methodology, noting how this selective approach differs from Feynman's famous strategy of working from first principles while ignoring literature. Unlike physics, biology lacks clean first principles, forcing researchers to engage with literature while maintaining skepticism about its quality. The piece advocates for critical evaluation of published work rather than wholesale acceptance or rejection, emphasizing that both naive credulity and complete literature avoidance lead to research paralysis.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2017 article, the issues Shokat identified about early-stage validation have gained significant attention in drug discovery. The decade saw increased focus on target validation and the "reproducibility crisis" in biomedical research, with numerous high-profile failures where promising preclinical discoveries failed to translate into effective drugs.

Several developments reinforced Shokat's warnings. Increased scrutiny emerged around early-stage cancer drugs, particularly kinase inhibitors and targeted therapies, where many compounds showing impressive animal model results failed in human trials. Academic and industry researchers increasingly adopted more rigorous validation standards, with journals implementing stricter requirements for chemical probe characterization before publication. The Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) and other organizations expanded efforts to develop well-validated chemical probes with comprehensive characterization data readily available to the research community.

However, challenges persisted. The pharmaceutical industry continued grappling with high attrition rates in drug development, with 2017-2024 seeing continued debate about target validation and the quality of preclinical research. The rise of open-access preprint servers like bioRxiv (mentioned in the article) actually expanded the volume of early-stage research that might lack thorough validation, making Shokat's criteria for critical evaluation even more relevant.

Notably, the growing emphasis on artificial intelligence and machine learning in drug discovery added new dimensions to these validation challenges, as AI-generated drug candidates required the same rigorous experimental validation as traditional approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's predictions and recommendations were largely validated by subsequent developments:

• **Shokat's criteria for rejecting studies without follow-up**: This principle gained acceptance in drug discovery. By 2024, funding agencies and journals increasingly expected multi-stage validation, with many research groups explicitly following Shokat's approach of seeking improved second-generation compounds as proof of genuine target engagement.

• **Warning against premature animal efficacy studies**: Continued high failure rates of drugs that showed promise in animal models supported this caution. The 2017-2024 period saw expanded discussion of "translational gaps" and calls for better preclinical models, validating concerns about over-interpreting early animal data.

• **Importance of structural data and dose-response relationships**: These remained cornerstone requirements in drug discovery programs, with structural biology becoming even more integral to understanding drug-target interactions through techniques like cryo-EM.

• **Skeptical approach to literature**: The reproducibility movement gained momentum, with systematic efforts to replicate published findings and greater recognition that much published biomedical research may not be robust. This validated the article's balanced approach of engaging literature while maintaining critical distance.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses fundamental issues in drug discovery validation that remain highly relevant, offering practical criteria that researchers continued to apply. Its balanced perspective on literature engagement—neither wholesale acceptance nor rejection—provides enduring methodological wisdom.
