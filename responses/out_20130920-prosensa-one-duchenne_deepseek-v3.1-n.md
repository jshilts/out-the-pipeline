# Prosensa: One Duchenne Therapy Down (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the Phase III clinical trial failure of drisapersen, an exon-skipping antisense therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The therapy was being developed by Prosensa in partnership with GSK. The drug failed to meet its primary endpoint of improving the six-minute walking distance test versus placebo after 48 weeks of treatment, with no positive signals in secondary endpoints either.

The author highlights the therapeutic similarity between drisapersen and Sarepta's competing drug eteplirsen, noting that Prosensa's failure could be interpreted as either good news for Sarepta (eliminating a competitor) or bad news (casting doubt on the broader exon-skipping approach for DMD).

## 2. HISTORY
Looking at what happened after this September 2013 article:

**Drisapersen (Prosensa/GSK):** The failed Phase III trial led to the discontinuation of the program. GSK returned rights to Prosensa in 2014. Despite the Phase III failure, BioMarin acquired Prosensa in 2015 for $680 million, believing the data warranted further investigation. However, drisapersen was ultimately rejected by the FDA in 2016 and by the European Medicines Agency, leading to its abandonment.

**Eteplirsen (Sarepta):** In contrast to drisapersen's failure, eteplirsen received controversial FDA approval in September 2016 with accelerated approval pathway, despite concerns about limited efficacy data. The drug demonstrated modest dystrophin production but more questionable clinical benefits, leading to ongoing debates about regulatory standards. Eteplirsen remained on the market but with continued questions about its effectiveness.

**DMD Treatment Landscape:** The field saw the eventual approval of several exon-skipping therapies and other mechanisms. Sarepta developed additional exon-skipping drugs targeting different exons, and other companies developed different therapeutic approaches including gene therapies and other antisense drugs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Sarepta's stock reaction**: The author speculated about immediate investor reactions - whether Sarepta's stock would rise (from competitor elimination) or fall (from mechanism doubts). *This was unknowable at the moment and likely saw mixed reactions depending on investor interpretation.*

- **Therapeutic mechanism viability**: The underlying concern was whether Prosensa's failure indicated fundamental problems with exon-skipping antisense approaches for DMD. *Eteplirsen's subsequent approval suggested the mechanism could work, albeit with imperfect efficacy - though whether drisapersen's chemistry or trial design differences explain the different outcomes remains debated.*

- **Company viability implications**: The suggestion that Prosensa's failure might represent "betting the whole company" proved accurate - after the failure, the company was acquired at a significant discount to pre-failure valuations, showing how pivotal trial results are for biotech companies.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 8/10**

The article highlights the high-stakes nature of rare disease drug development and the complex interplay between competing therapies targeting the same mechanism. The subsequent divergent fates of drisapersen (failure/abandonment) versus eteplirsen (regulatory approval despite controversy) makes this a particularly interesting case study in therapeutic development and regulatory decision-making.
