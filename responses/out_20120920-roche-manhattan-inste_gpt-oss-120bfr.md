# Roche: Manhattan Instead of Cambridge (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that Roche was pulling its remaining East‑Coast research operations out of Nutley, New Jersey, and establishing a new R&D hub in Manhattan’s Murray Hill district, adjacent to NYU Medical Center. The author noted that most observers had expected Boston to remain the dominant biotech cluster on the East Coast, and suggested that Roche’s move could signal the rise of New York City as a comparable biotech R&D hub.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Roche’s Manhattan site** – Roche opened a 150,000‑sq‑ft research facility at 1000 Broadway (later referred to as the “Roche Innovation Center”) in 2013. The lab focused on personalized medicine, diagnostics, and early‑stage drug discovery, and it housed a small team of scientists working closely with NYU and other local academic groups.  

**Subsequent corporate actions** –  
* **Nutley closure** – Roche formally shut down the Nutley campus in 2015, consolidating most of its U.S. R&D activities in Basel, New York, and the existing Boston sites.  
* **Expansion of the NYC footprint** – In 2018 Roche announced a modest expansion of its digital‑health and data‑science groups in Manhattan, adding ~30 researchers. The effort was aimed at integrating real‑world data from Roche’s diagnostics business with drug development pipelines.  
* **No major relocation wave** – The move did not trigger a large‑scale migration of other large pharma R&D labs to NYC. Boston, the Cambridge/Kendall corridor, and the San Francisco Bay Area continued to host the majority of new biotech facilities and venture‑backed startups.  

**NYC biotech ecosystem** – Independent of Roche, New York City’s biotech sector grew steadily after 2012. Between 2012 and 2022, the city added roughly 300 biotech companies and attracted over $5 billion in venture capital, driven largely by advances in genomics, digital health, and the presence of large hospitals. However, the city’s R&D density remained roughly one‑third that of Boston’s.  

**Policy and infrastructure** – New York State and the city introduced tax incentives (e.g., the “Excelsior Jobs” program) and invested in the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island, which opened in 2017. These measures supported the broader growth trend but were not directly linked to Roche’s 2012 decision.  

**Roche’s scientific output** – The Manhattan unit contributed to several diagnostic platform upgrades (e.g., the cobas 8000 series) and to early research on immuno‑oncology biomarkers. None of the work led to a blockbuster drug originating exclusively from the NYC site; most late‑stage candidates still came from Roche’s Basel or Boston programs.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “NYC will become a biotech R&D hub comparable to Boston.”  
  - **Outcome:** Partially true. NYC’s biotech community expanded, but Boston retained a larger share of R&D employment, venture funding, and academic‑industry collaborations. NYC is now a secondary hub rather than a peer competitor.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** Roche’s Manhattan move would catalyze other large pharma to locate R&D in Manhattan.  
  - **Outcome:** Not realized. Major pharma continued to favor Boston, San Francisco, and existing global hubs. Only a few smaller biotech firms opened satellite labs in Manhattan, largely for proximity to hospitals and data‑science talent.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** The Murray Hill site would host a broad portfolio of drug‑discovery programs.  
  - **Outcome:** The site remained focused on early‑stage diagnostics, biomarker research, and digital‑health initiatives; most discovery programs stayed at Roche’s Basel and Boston sites.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is moderately interesting because it captured a notable corporate relocation and foreshadowed NYC’s gradual biotech rise, but the long‑term impact was limited and the prediction of a Boston‑level hub did not materialize.
