# Throwing Out the Files (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This personal essay describes the author's experience clearing out physical filing cabinets while moving offices, reflecting on how scientific information practices changed dramatically between the late 1980s and early 2010s. The author estimates throwing away 80% of accumulated paper files, organized into categories like disease research, synthesis methods, and medicinal chemistry. 

The core insight is that pre-internet researchers needed to hoard paper copies of useful papers because finding them again was difficult—this led to extensive handwritten indexing systems and "pack-ratting." However, the rise of digital databases (Chemical Abstracts, SciFinder, Reaxsys, PubMed, Google) made comprehensive, searchable literature access instantaneous. Consequently, folders full of 10-20 year old biomedical reviews or synthesis methods became obsolete, since current reviews and searchable databases provide better, more up-to-date information with less effort. The author argues that searchability has proven fundamentally more valuable than manual tagging/filing systems.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2014 article, the digitization of scientific literature accelerated dramatically:

**Database Evolution**: SciFinder, PubMed, and Google Scholar became more powerful and comprehensive. New platforms emerged including semantic search tools, AI-powered literature discovery (e.g., Semantic Scholar, launched 2015), and systematic review automation platforms. Chemical structure and reaction searching improved significantly.

**Digital Workflow Integration**: Tools like Zotero (mentioned in the article) evolved and were joined by reference managers with cloud synchronization (Mendeley, EndNote), lab notebook software (Electronic Lab Notebooks), and collaborative platforms (Overleaf for manuscripts). The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of cloud-based collaborative tools across research.

**Access Models**: While paywalls persist for many journals, open access publishing continued growing. Preprint servers (bioRxiv launched 2013, chemRxiv launched 2017) became standard practice in many fields. Scientists increasingly rely on immediate digital access rather than personal archives.

**Full-Text Search**: Modern researchers can search across millions of papers instantly by keyword, author, citation network, or chemical structure—functionality the author in 2014 was beginning to take for granted has become even more powerful.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes implicit rather than explicit predictions:

• **Implicit: Physical filing systems would continue declining** - **VINDICATED**: Research workflows became overwhelmingly digital, accelerated by cloud storage, mobile access, and collaborative platforms.

• **Implicit: Searchability would remain more valuable than manual tagging** - **VINDICATED**: Modern literature tools prioritize full-text search, citation networks, and AI-powered discovery over manual folder organization.

• **Implicit: Old literature would remain findable digitally** - **VINDICATED**: Retrospective digitization continued, though gaps remain for older niche publications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While personally reflective and historically illuminating about pre-digital research practices, the article describes a transition that was already largely complete by 2014 and offers limited forward-looking insights for biotechnology development or scientific discovery.
