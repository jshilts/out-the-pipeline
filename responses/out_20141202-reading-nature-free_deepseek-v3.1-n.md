# Reading Nature For Free (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Nature Publishing Group's 2014 experiment to make papers from Nature and 48 other journals freely viewable online, though not downloadable or printable. The initiative used ReadCube, a platform similar to iTunes, to host read-only PDF versions of articles. Under this policy, institutional subscribers could share links to read-only versions of papers dating back to 1869, while personal subscribers had access from 1997 onward. The PDFs could be annotated and saved to a free desktop version of ReadCube, but not printed. The author characterizes this as a middle-ground approach in the "open-access war" that might please neither strong advocates nor opponents of open access.

## 2. HISTORY

Nature's 2014 experiment represented an early attempt at "read-only" access rather than true open access. However, this initiative did not fundamentally change the scientific publishing landscape. The broader open access movement continued to gain momentum, with Plan S launching in 2018, requiring publicly funded research to be published in open access journals. Major funders including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and numerous European funding agencies adopted these mandates. 

The ReadCube platform mentioned in the article continued to exist but faced significant competition from other reference management tools like Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote. It did not become the dominant platform for scientific collaboration as envisioned. By 2021, ReadCube was acquired by Digital Science, a technology company that also owns Altmetric, Figshare, and Dimensions.

Following Nature's experiment, traditional subscription models increasingly offered various hybrid options, but the most significant development was the explosive growth of preprint servers, particularly bioRxiv (launched in 2013) and medRxiv (launched in 2019). These platforms allowed researchers to share manuscripts immediately without peer review or paywalls. Many journals, including Nature, eventually began accepting submissions that had been preprinted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The ReadCube platform would benefit from this initiative and potentially become a major collaboration tool for scientists sharing annotated manuscripts.

- **Reality**: ReadCube remained a niche reference management tool and never achieved the widespread adoption or collaborative ecosystem envisioned. Other platforms like Zotero and Mendeley maintained larger user bases for reference management, while preprint servers became the primary venue for early scientific sharing and collaboration.

- **Prediction**: This approach would represent a "split the difference" solution in the open-access debate.

- **Reality**: The read-only access model proved insufficient for most researchers' needs and did not satisfy open-access advocates. The scientific community increasingly demanded full open access with rights to download, print, and reuse content, leading to stronger open-access mandates from funders and institutions.

## 4. INTEREST

**6/9**

This article captures an important transitional moment when major publishers were experimenting with access models, but the approach described ultimately represented a detour rather than the future path of scientific publishing.
