# Pharmville: Good Grief, This Looks Awful (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief, skeptical commentary on a Facebook‑based “drug‑discovery” game launched by Boehringer Ingelheim (often referred to as “Pharmville”). The author argues that, while the game may be entertaining, it cannot realistically convey the complexity, cost, or time required for real‑world pharmaceutical R&D. Consequently, any educational value about drug development would be outweighed by the misleading impression that discovery is a simple, gamified process. The tone is dismissive, suggesting that serious scientific work cannot be captured in a casual social‑media game.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Game launch and lifespan** – Boehringer Ingelheim released the Facebook game in late 2012. Within a year the game was removed from the platform; by early 2014 it was no longer accessible to the public. User numbers were modest (estimates in the low‑hundreds of thousands) and engagement dropped quickly.  
- **Impact on R&D** – There is no evidence that any compounds or ideas generated in the game entered Boehringer’s research pipeline, nor that the game contributed to published scientific findings. The initiative was treated internally as a marketing/branding exercise rather than a serious crowdsourcing effort.  
- **Broader industry trend** – The “Pharmville” experiment did not spark a wave of similar pharma‑focused Facebook games. Instead, the industry’s gamification efforts have largely shifted toward patient‑support apps, adherence tools, and serious‑game platforms aimed at education (e.g., *Foldit* for protein folding, *Eterna* for RNA design). Those later platforms have produced concrete scientific outputs, but they are typically run by academic or nonprofit groups rather than large pharma companies.  
- **Boehringer’s subsequent outreach** – After the game’s discontinuation, Boehringer Ingelheim continued to explore digital engagement (e.g., disease‑awareness campaigns, virtual reality experiences for clinicians) but has not relaunched a drug‑discovery game. The company’s R&D strategy has remained focused on traditional pre‑clinical and clinical pipelines, with no public indication that gamified crowdsourcing plays a role.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but the author’s implicit predictions can be extracted:

- **Prediction:** *A Facebook game cannot realistically model drug discovery and will therefore be of limited educational value.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. The game was short‑lived, attracted limited attention, and did not influence any real‑world drug‑development decisions.

- **Prediction:** *The game would fail to sustain player interest because realistic pay‑offs are impossible to simulate.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. User engagement fell rapidly, and the platform was withdrawn within roughly a year.

- **Prediction (implied):* *Serious scientific progress will not emerge from such a casual platform.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. No peer‑reviewed publications, patents, or pipeline candidates trace back to “Pharmville.”

No other specific forecasts (e.g., about market size, regulatory changes, or business growth) were made in the article, so no further comparison is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The article captures an early, high‑visibility attempt at gamifying pharma R&D, which is historically interesting, but the initiative quickly fizzled and left little lasting impact on science or industry practice.
