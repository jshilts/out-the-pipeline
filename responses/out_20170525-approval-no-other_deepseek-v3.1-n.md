# An Approval Like No Other (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Merck's groundbreaking FDA approval for its Keytruda (pembrolizumab) antibody therapy in oncology. What made this approval unique and historically significant was that it was the first time the FDA approved a cancer treatment based solely on a tumor's molecular biomarker profile rather than its anatomical location in the body. The approval covered tumors with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), regardless of where in the body these tumors originated.

The author reflects on how this marks a paradigm shift in cancer classification, moving away from the traditional organ-based naming conventions (lung cancer, breast cancer, etc.) toward molecularly-defined categories. The piece speculates whether new acronyms based on biomarker profiles might enter popular vocabulary, similar to how "DNA" became a cultural shorthand, potentially changing how society talks about and understands cancer.

## 2. HISTORY

The May 2017 FDA approval described in the article proved to be a watershed moment in precision oncology:

**Clinical Impact and Adoption:**
- The approval for MSI-H/dMMR solid tumors regardless of tumor location became known as the first "tissue-agnostic" or "site-agnostic" cancer approval in history
- MSI-H/dMMR occurs in approximately 4% of advanced solid tumors across multiple cancer types, including colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and others
- Subsequent data showed that pembrolizumab achieved overall response rates of approximately 39-40% in MSI-H/dMMR tumors, with durable responses

**Regulatory Precedent and Follow-up Approvals:**
- This approval established the regulatory pathway for tissue-agnostic cancer drugs
- Merck's Keytruda received additional tissue-agnostic approvals, including for tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) solid tumors in 2020 (though this indication was later voluntarily withdrawn in 2023)
- Other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, Genentech's Tecentriq) also pursued tissue-agnostic development pathways
- The FDA approved entrectinib (Rozlytrek) in 2019 for NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, another tissue-agnostic approval

**Real-world Uptake and Clinical Practice:**
- Tumor biomarker testing for MSI/dMMR status became standard practice across multiple tumor types
- Comprehensive genomic profiling and next-generation sequencing panels increasingly became integrated into oncology workflows
- While MSI-H/dMMR testing is now routine, the actual percentage of patients eligible for tissue-agnostic therapies remains relatively small compared to traditional organ-specific indications

**Business and Market Impact:**
- Merck's Keytruda became the top-selling oncology drug globally, reaching approximately $25 billion in annual sales by 2024
- The tissue-agnostic approach influenced pharmaceutical R&D strategies toward biomarker-driven drug development
- Companion diagnostics and biomarker testing companies saw increased demand

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "Will people refer to a diagnosis of 'MIMR' cancer...and will calling it by a body part come to sound old-fashioned?"**
- **Outcome**: This prediction partially materialized but not completely. Medical literature and oncology practice now routinely use biomarker classifications like "MSI-H tumors" or "dMMR cancers" alongside traditional organ-based terminology. However, body part terminology remains dominant in medical practice and public discourse, supplemented rather than replaced by biomarker classifications. The "MIMR" acronym never caught on—the established terms became "MSI-H" and "dMMR."

**Prediction: "The way that we talk about cancer has just started to change, as of this week"**
- **Outcome**: Accurate prediction. The article correctly identified a turning point. The 2017 approval catalyzed fundamental changes in how oncologists discuss, classify, and treat cancer. Tumor boards and treatment decisions increasingly incorporate molecular profiling alongside traditional pathology. The change occurred both in clinical practice and in pharmaceutical marketing, with companies emphasizing biomarker-defined populations rather than organ-specific claims.

**Implicit prediction about biomarker-based treatment becoming widespread:**
- **Outcome**: Substantially validated. The tissue-agnostic approval paradigm became established, with multiple subsequent approvals following similar pathways. However, the scale remains smaller than traditional indications, as only a minority of patients have the specific biomarkers that qualify for tissue-agnostic therapies.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article identified and articulated the significance of a genuinely transformative regulatory decision that reshaped cancer drug development and clinical practice. The approval it described became a landmark case study in precision medicine's evolution, making the piece prescient in recognizing the moment's historical importance.
