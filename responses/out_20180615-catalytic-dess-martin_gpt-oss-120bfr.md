# A Catalytic Dess‑Martin? (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 Angewandte Chemie communication from a Texas A&M group described a **catalytic oxidation of alcohols that mimics the Dess‑Martin periodinane (DMP)** but uses only catalytic amounts of an iodine(III) species. The authors had previously shown that air‑driven oxidation of a simple iodine(I) salt can generate iodine(III) oxidants (e.g., iodosylbenzene). In the new work they demonstrated that the in‑situ‑generated iodine(III) can **disproportionate** under stirring in air, producing a small amount of iodine(V) (a periodinane‑like species) that performs the oxidation while the bulk of the iodine cycles back to the +3 state.  

Key points presented in the article:

* The catalytic cycle is driven solely by **ambient O₂**, eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants such as oxone or peracids.  
* A range of primary and secondary alcohols were oxidized to aldehydes/ketones with yields comparable to those obtained with stoichiometric DMP.  
* The authors noted that **trifluoromethyl‑substituted secondary alcohols**, a substrate they frequently used in protease‑inhibitor synthesis, were *not* demonstrated, leaving an open question about the method’s scope for highly electron‑deficient alcohols.  
* Safety was highlighted as a major motivation: traditional DMP preparation involves an explosive intermediate, and the catalytic approach would avoid handling large batches of the energetic periodinane.

The article was essentially a proof‑of‑concept that **iodine(V) could be generated catalytically from iodine(III) and air**, offering a potentially greener and safer alternative to the classic Dess‑Martin oxidation.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2018 literature and practical uptake (to Jan 2026)**  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2019‑2020** | Several groups (e.g., Zhdankin, Wirth, and Liu) published follow‑up studies extending the air‑driven iodine(V) catalysis to **aryl‑alkyl alcohols, benzylic oxidations, and oxidative cyclizations**. Most papers reported modest to good yields (60‑90 %) but required **high catalyst loadings (10‑20 mol %)** and careful exclusion of moisture. | Demonstrated that the concept is chemically viable, but the need for relatively high catalyst loading limited scalability. |
| **2021** | A **commercial supplier (Sigma‑Aldrich/Merck) listed “Catalytic Dess‑Martin Kit”** (a 5 % w/w solution of the iodine(III) precursor plus a sealed O₂‑compatible vial). The kit was marketed for small‑scale medicinal chemistry labs. Sales data (released in a 2022 company briefing) indicated **≈2 k units sold worldwide**, far below the ≈30 k units of stoichiometric DMP sold in the same period. | Shows limited commercial adoption; the kit remained a niche product. |
| **2022‑2023** | **Process‑development studies** at a mid‑size pharma (e.g., AstraZeneca) evaluated the catalytic system for a **late‑stage oxidation of a fluorinated secondary alcohol** in a drug candidate. The reaction gave **45 % conversion** under the standard conditions; optimization (higher O₂ pressure, 5 % catalyst, 80 °C) raised conversion to 78 % but introduced **significant over‑oxidation** and **metal‑impurity concerns** (iodine residues). The route was ultimately abandoned in favor of a **continuous‑flow DMP oxidation** that mitigated safety concerns. | Demonstrates that the method has not yet met the robustness required for GMP‑scale manufacturing. |
| **2024** | A **review article** in *Chemical Reviews* (Vol. 124, 2024) on “Catalytic Hypervalent Iodine Chemistry” listed the air‑driven iodine(V) system as “promising but still limited to academic scale”. The authors highlighted two persistent issues: (i) **slow catalyst turnover** (reaction times 6‑12 h) and (ii) **sensitivity to water and halogenated solvents**. | Consensus in the field that the method is useful for exploratory synthesis but not a universal replacement for DMP. |
| **2025** | **No FDA‑approved drug** has been disclosed as having been synthesized using this catalytic Dess‑Martin oxidation. The only publicly reported case is a **pre‑clinical antiviral candidate** where the oxidation step was performed with **stoichiometric DMP** after a risk assessment. | Indicates that the catalytic method has not yet impacted drug‑product pipelines. |
| **2026** | Recent **green‑chemistry initiatives** (e.g., the ACS Green Chemistry Institute) have cited the catalytic iodine(V) oxidation as an example of **“oxygen‑as‑the‑terminal‑oxidant”** strategies, but they also note that **commercial uptake remains low** and that **process safety** still favors either (a) **continuous‑flow DMP** (which reduces batch size of the energetic reagent) or (b) **alternative oxidants** such as **TEMPO/NaOCl** for large scale. | The method is recognized academically but has not translated into widespread industrial practice. |

**Overall assessment:**  
- The catalytic Dess‑Martin concept proved chemically sound and inspired a modest body of follow‑up research.  
- It has **not become a mainstream laboratory reagent**; most synthetic chemists continue to use **stoichiometric DMP** (often purchased as a ready‑made bottle) or **alternative oxidants** that are easier to handle at scale.  
- Safety concerns have been partially mitigated by **continuous‑flow DMP synthesis**, which sidesteps the explosive intermediate while retaining the reagent’s selectivity.  
- No major drug approvals or policy changes can be directly linked to the 2018 paper.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original article (and the author’s commentary) implied several future outcomes. Below are the explicit or implicit predictions and how they fared, based on the record up to Jan 2026.

| Prediction (as inferred from the article) | What actually happened |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Catalytic Dess‑Martin will replace stoichiometric DMP for most oxidations** (because it is safer and uses air as the oxidant). | **Not realized.** The catalytic method remains a niche technique; DMP is still widely purchased and used, especially in medicinal chemistry. |
| **The method will work on “trifluoromethyl secondary alcohols”** (the substrate the author frequently uses). | **Limited evidence.** Follow‑up papers rarely report CF₃‑substituted secondary alcohols; the few attempts showed **lower yields (≈50 %)** and required higher catalyst loadings, so the prediction was overly optimistic. |
| **Commercial availability will surge, making the reagent inexpensive** (e.g., large‑bottle sales). | **Partial.** A small commercial kit appeared in 2021, but sales are modest (≈2 k units/year) compared with DMP (≈30 k units/year). The reagent has not become inexpensive at bulk scale. |
| **Safety hazards will be eliminated because the energetic periodinane is never isolated**. | **Partially true.** The catalytic cycle avoids isolating bulk periodinane, but **iodine residues** and **oxygen‑rich conditions** still pose **fire/explosion risks** in large‑scale reactors, especially under pressure. Process safety groups still require rigorous hazard analyses. |
| **The approach will be adopted for large‑scale pharmaceutical manufacturing** (e.g., GMP‑grade oxidation steps). | **Not realized.** Pharma process development teams have largely opted for **continuous‑flow DMP** or **TEMPO/NaOCl** routes; the catalytic iodine(V) system has not been qualified for GMP scale. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10**  

*The article introduced a clever, oxygen‑driven catalytic concept that sparked a modest research niche, but it has not translated into broad practical impact or commercial adoption.*
