# Real Reactions, From Real Lab Notebooks (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes real-world chemical reactions being run in pharmaceutical company labs based on electronic notebook databases. The data reveals that Buchwald-Hartwig amination is the most frequently used reaction, followed by reduction of nitro groups to amines, Williamson ether synthesis, N-acylation, and sulfonamide formation. The author notes that these "workhorse" reactions are deliberately chosen for their reliability rather than novelty, as drug discovery already involves enough uncertainty in biological testing stages (primary assays, toxicology, Phase I/II clinical trials). The preference for proven, dependable chemistry reflects a pragmatic industry focus on minimizing synthetic failures when downstream development already carries substantial risk.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated this industrial chemistry landscape. The featured reactions—especially Buchwald-Hartwig amination, Suzuki couplings, and reliable amine syntheses—became even more entrenched in medicinal chemistry workflows. Academic research did advance more "exciting" methods (C-H activation, photoredox catalysis, late-stage functionalization), but industrial adoption remained cautious. By the late 2010s, companies increasingly emphasized synthetic robustness, high-throughput chemistry platforms, and predictive tools to de-risk synthesis. Biocatalysis grew significantly for chiral synthesis and green chemistry but retained niche roles compared to conventional methods. The rise of DNA-encoded library synthesis created new chemistry demands favoring robust reactions. Overall, the tension between academic novelty and industrial reliability persisted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction**: The author suggested Suzuki coupling would likely rank among the top reaction types. **Actual outcome**: Suzuki couplings remained a cornerstone of medicinal chemistry throughout the 2010s-2020s for fragment coupling and analog synthesis; the prediction proved accurate.

**• Implicit prediction**: That the "dull" workhorse reactions would remain essential due to reliability requirements in drug development. **Actual outcome**: Strongly validated. Despite academic advances, these methods dominated industrial practice for the next decade, particularly with costs of clinical development and regulatory timelines.

**• Implicit prediction**: That the list of top reactions would settle into a stable hierarchy across organizations. **Actual outcome**: Partially borne out. The same core reactions persisted, but increasing molecular complexity (macrocyclics, PROTACs) introduced new synthetic demands in parallel.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a fundamental truth about industrial drug discovery that remains highly relevant. It provides empirical grounding for understanding why pharmaceutical chemistry prioritizes reliability over novelty, offering insights that withstand a decade of subsequent technological change.
