# The Economics of the Drug Industry: Big Can’t Be Big Enough? (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary argues that the pharmaceutical sector’s traditional “big‑is‑better” strategy—growing through mergers and expanding internal pipelines—cannot reliably smooth the extreme “hit‑or‑miss” nature of drug discovery. Citing work by Bernard Munos, Arthur De Vany, Frank Scherer, Dietmar Harhoff and Andrew Lo, the author notes that even a giant like Pfizer, with a $9 billion annual R&D budget and a massive pipeline, still suffered a severe patent cliff (e.g., loss of Lipitor exclusivity). The piece suggests that the skewed probability distribution of drug success means the residual risk after conventional portfolio management remains too high for any single firm to survive a prolonged dry spell. Consequently, the author doubts that any realistic portfolio size can guarantee a “self‑sustaining” pipeline, and warns that further M&A may not solve the underlying risk problem.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 industry trajectory (to early 2026)**  

| Year | Key developments relevant to the article’s thesis |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **2011‑2013** | Pfizer’s revenue fell sharply after the Lipitor patent expired (Oct 2011). The company launched cost‑cutting programs and reduced its R&D headcount. |
| **2014‑2016** | Wave of large‑scale M&A slowed. Pfizer’s attempted $160 bn merger with Allergan (2015‑16) was blocked by U.S. antitrust regulators, illustrating limits to “just‑bigger‑is‑better.” |
| **2015** | Pfizer’s first major post‑cliff commercial success: **Ibrance** (palbociclib) for breast cancer, discovered through a partnership with Oncology Research. It became a multi‑billion‑dollar product, but its launch relied on external collaboration rather than an internal pipeline alone. |
| **2017‑2020** | Big pharma increasingly turned to **external innovation**: licensing, venture‑building, and acquiring late‑stage biotech assets. Examples include Novartis buying **AveXis** (gene‑therapy platform) in 2018 and Roche acquiring **Spark Therapeutics** in 2019. |
| **2020‑2022** | The COVID‑19 pandemic accelerated **platform‑based approaches** (mRNA, viral vectors). Companies such as **Moderna** and **BioNTech** (originally biotech) achieved blockbuster status, while large incumbents (Pfizer, Merck) partnered rather than built the technology internally. |
| **2023‑2025** | R&D productivity metrics (e.g., NPV per project) remained flat or declined for the biggest firms. Many announced **R&D spend reductions** (e.g., Pfizer cut $2 bn in 2023). Simultaneously, **pipeline breadth** grew through **strategic alliances** rather than internal discovery. |
| **2025‑2026** | Pfizer’s 2025 annual report highlighted that **only ~30 %** of its projected 2025 pipeline originated from internal discovery; the rest came from **in‑licensing, collaborations, and acquisitions** of biotech start‑ups. The company acknowledged that “size alone does not guarantee a steady stream of blockbusters.” |

**Overall assessment:** The industry has not solved the risk‑of‑ruin problem by simply getting bigger. Instead, the dominant model has shifted to **open‑innovation ecosystems** where large firms act as “platforms” that fund, acquire, or partner with smaller, more agile biotech companies. Patent cliffs remain a recurring challenge; even the biggest firms experience revenue volatility when flagship drugs lose exclusivity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *No single pharma can build an internally‑generated pipeline large enough to eliminate ruin risk; “bigger than any of us have” would be required.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. By 2026, the largest firms (Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Johnson & Johnson) still rely heavily on external assets. Internal discovery contributes a minority share of new launches, confirming that sheer internal scale has not solved the risk problem.

- **Prediction:** *Mergers and acquisitions alone will not create a self‑sustaining “big, nimble, innovative” company.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. The attempted Pfizer‑Allergan merger was blocked; subsequent mega‑deals (e.g., Bristol‑Myers Squibb‑Celgene 2019) did not eliminate pipeline gaps, and many post‑deal integrations resulted in cost‑cutting rather than increased innovation output.

- **Prediction:** *Traditional portfolio management provides only limited risk mitigation; residual variance remains large enough to threaten business continuity during a dry spell.*  
  **Outcome:** Supported by later data. Studies (e.g., Scherer & Harhoff 2018) showed that even diversified pipelines with >30 late‑stage candidates still exhibit a >30 % probability of a “dry year” (no FDA approval). Companies now supplement portfolio risk management with **option‑style contracts** and **adaptive licensing**, echoing De Vany’s adaptive‑contract ideas.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The pharmaceutical market will behave differently from Hollywood because drugs are non‑discretionary, have shorter IP lives, and lack ancillary revenue streams.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While drugs are essential, the rise of **patient‑centric digital therapeutics** and **companion diagnostics** has created new ancillary revenue streams, though nowhere near the merchandising ecosystem of blockbuster movies.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article presciently identified the limits of scale‑driven risk mitigation and foreshadowed the industry’s pivot to open‑innovation models, topics that remain central to biotech strategy discussions today.
