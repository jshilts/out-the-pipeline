# Have Pfizer's Investors Had Enough? (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article criticizes Pfizer's long-standing acquisition strategy that has destroyed shareholder value over the previous decade. The author points to the abrupt departure of CEO Jeffrey Kindler as evidence that institutional investors were finally recognizing the board as "value destroyers." A comparison shows Pfizer stock tracked the S&P 500 until 2004, then lagged significantly worse than the broader market through 2010. The author notes they had been criticizing Pfizer's "acquire-acquire-acquire" approach since 2003, which led to employee disruption and facility closures with little return on investment.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2010 article, Pfizer undertook several major strategic shifts. In 2011, Pfizer announced it would divest its animal health and nutrition businesses to focus on pharmaceuticals. Most significantly, in 2013 Pfizer attempted a $118 billion acquisition of AstraZeneca, which failed after political opposition. The company split into innovative and established products businesses in 2014 but kept them under one corporate structure. 

Under CEO Ian Read (2011-2018), Pfizer continued large-scale M&A with the $15 billion acquisition of Hospira in 2015, the $14 billion purchase of Medivation in 2016, and the attempted $160 billion merger with Allergan in 2016 (which collapsed due to US Treasury anti-inversion rules). The strategy shifted toward focus on innovative drugs rather than just scale. 

Most notably, Pfizer under CEO Albert Bourla (2019-present) successfully developed and commercialized the COVID-19 vaccine with BioNTech, generating approximately $36 billion in 2021 revenue, demonstrating successful R&D capability alongside their M&A strategy. From 2010 to 2024, Pfizer stock generally underperformed the broader market, with the company trading at lower multiples than more R&D-focused peers, though the COVID vaccine provided a significant temporary boost.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: Institutional investors forming "angry committee" would pursue "strategic barn-door-closing initiatives" - **Reality**: While investors did pressure management, major strategic changes occurred through leadership transitions rather than activist investor actions driving immediate transformation.
• **Prediction**: The pattern of value destruction would continue - **Reality**: Mixed. Pfizer continued large acquisitions (Hospira, Medivation) but also demonstrated innovation success with COVID vaccine, though overall stock performance remained mediocre compared to peers focused purely on innovative R&D.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

The article captures an important critique of Pharma's M&A-driven growth strategy at a key inflection point, but focuses narrowly on shareholder value rather than broader industry transformation.
