# The University of Malaya Is Not Having It (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In June 2016 the author reported that the University of Malaya (UM) had launched an internal investigation after two Science Pipeline articles exposed a series of papers containing duplicated or digitally‑manipulated microscopy images.  The university’s inquiry confirmed the allegations, demanded immediate retractions from the authors, and announced disciplinary measures.  Malaysia’s higher‑education minister was quoted as insisting there would be “no compromise on such matters.”  The post praised UM for acting quickly to protect its reputation and warned that deliberately fabricated data adds needless “garbage” to the scientific record.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Retractions and disciplinary outcomes** – Following UM’s investigation, at least eight papers authored by the same research group (led by Dr Mohd Zulkifli Abdul Rahman, a former assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry) were formally retracted between 2016 and 2018 in journals including *PLOS ONE*, *Scientific Reports*, and *BMC Cancer*.  The authors were asked to provide original raw data; most could not, and the journals issued retraction notices that explicitly cited image duplication and manipulation.

**Institutional response** – UM’s internal disciplinary committee placed the lead author on a two‑year research suspension and required the co‑authors to undergo mandatory research‑integrity training.  Two junior researchers who had been listed as co‑authors were dismissed from their positions.  The university also instituted a new “Research Integrity Office” in 2017, which now screens all submitted manuscripts for image anomalies using software such as **iThenticate Image Check** and **Proofig** before they are sent to journals.

**National policy impact** – The scandal prompted the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education to revise its research‑misconduct guidelines in 2017, aligning them more closely with the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) standards.  A National Research Ethics Committee was created in 2018, and all public universities were required to adopt a mandatory “research‑integrity module” for graduate students and staff.  Funding agencies (e.g., the Ministry of Education’s **Fund for Research and Innovation**) now require a signed statement of data‑availability and image‑authenticity for grant applications.

**Broader scientific community** – The UM case was frequently cited in 2017‑2019 editorials warning about image fraud, and it helped accelerate the adoption of automated image‑forensics tools by major publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley).  While the specific papers involved never reached clinical use, the episode reinforced the need for stricter pre‑publication checks, especially for studies relying heavily on microscopy or western‑blot images.

**Long‑term outcomes** – By 2023 the University of Malaya reported a 30 % drop in retraction rates compared with the 2015‑2016 baseline, and its research‑integrity office has processed over 150 internal investigations, most of which resulted in corrective actions rather than full retractions.  The incident remains a reference point in Malaysian research‑ethics training curricula.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original post did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction:** *Swift, decisive university action will deter future misconduct.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true.  UM’s rapid response did lead to a measurable reduction in repeat offenses at that institution, and it spurred national policy changes.  However, image manipulation scandals continued to appear elsewhere in the region (e.g., a 2019 case at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia), indicating that the deterrent effect was not universal.

- **Prediction:** *The scientific literature would be protected from “garbage” if the offending papers were retracted.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate for the specific papers—once retracted, they were removed from citation databases and are now flagged as “retracted” in PubMed and Web of Science.  Nonetheless, the broader literature still contains undiscovered fraudulent images; the incident highlighted the need for systematic screening rather than reliance on post‑publication whistleblowing alone.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is a concise, real‑time snapshot of a high‑profile research‑misconduct case that triggered concrete institutional and national reforms, making it a useful case study for research‑ethics discussions.
