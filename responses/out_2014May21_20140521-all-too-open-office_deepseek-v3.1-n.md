Of course. Here is a thoughtful and critical analysis of the article "This All Too Open Office" using the benefit of hindsight.

---

### 1. SUMMARY

The article is a critical commentary on the trend of open-plan offices, specifically within scientific and pharmaceutical research. The author, Derek Lowe, dissects an argument made by an architect, Bill Odell, who was promoting the benefits of open-plan science buildings. Lowe finds Odell's claims—particularly one about movable walls allowing lab space to be converted into office space as a drug candidate progresses—to be nonsensical from a practical standpoint. He also refutes Odell's argument that younger generations inherently prefer and thrive in open environments, labeling it a "Dig the New Breed" sales pitch used to push a trend driven by cost-cutting rather than genuine productivity benefits.

Ultimately, Lowe argues that the primary, and perhaps only, real driver for the adoption of open-plan labs is economic: they are "cheaper to construct and operate." He remains deeply skeptical of the purported benefits of increased collaboration and productivity, viewing them as post-hoc justifications. He notes the irony that the executives who champion these designs never seem to adopt them for their own offices.

### 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2014 article has been marked by a dramatic reversal in the perception and implementation of open-plan offices. Far from fading away, the "dislike" that Odell predicted would disappear has intensified and become a mainstream consensus among workers and researchers in many fields, including science.

**The Trough of Disillusionment (Mid-2010s to Late 2010s):** A growing body of scientific research began to empirically confirm what many workers already suspected.
*   **Decreased Productivity:** A landmark 2018 study in the *Journal of Applied Psychology* by Banbury & Berry found that office noise, a primary feature of open plans, significantly disrupts the cognitive performance of employees.
*   **Reduced Face-to-Face Interaction:** In a stunning 2018 *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* paper, researchers Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban used sociometric badges and digital data to show that a company's move to an open-plan office *reduced* face-to-face interaction by a staggering 70%, while digital communication increased. This directly contradicted the theory that open plans foster collaboration.
*   **Increased Stress and Sick Days:** Studies also linked open-plan environments to increased levels of stress, conflict, and even higher rates of sick leave.

**Major Defection and Reversal:** The backlash was not just academic. High-profile companies that had once championed the open plan began to publicly reverse course. In 2023, both Meta and Google, giants who had built their identities around vast, amenity-filled open-plan campuses, announced plans to remodel offices to include more dedicated, private workspaces and "neighborhood" concepts, explicitly citing employee feedback about the need for focus and privacy.

**The COVID-19 Catalyst (2020-Present):** The pandemic served as a massive, unplanned experiment that sealed the fate of the open-plan office as a universal solution. With much of the workforce moving to remote or hybrid models, the open office's failure to support deep-focus work became undeniable. The "collaboration" it was meant to foster proved to be replicable online for meetings, while the "serendipity" was exposed as an unpredictable and low-value benefit when compared to the constant, draining cost of noise and distraction. Post-pandemic return-to-office strategies have had to grapple with employee demands for choice and privacy, effectively ending the era of the open-plan mandate.

### 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Spectacularly Right:**

The article's core thesis has been overwhelmingly validated by subsequent history.

1.  **It was a cost-driven fad:** Lowe's assertion that the main driver for open-plan offices is that "they are cheaper to construct and operate" is now the accepted historical analysis. The "collaboration and productivity" narrative has been largely debunked and exposed as a retroactive justification for a real estate and facilities management decision.
2.  **Skepticism of "New Breed" arguments:** The author's criticism of the "kids these days" generational argument was prescient. The dislike for open offices is now known to be universal across age groups, as the fundamental needs for concentration and cognitive control are human constants, not generational fads. The headphones worn by younger employees in open offices were not a sign of thriving, but a desperate attempt to create the acoustic privacy the environment denied them.
3.  **Skepticism of specific, inflated claims:** Lowe's instinct to call "bullshit" on the architect's specific claim about movable walls was entirely correct. The concept shows a profound misunderstanding of the immense infrastructural differences between a wet chemistry lab and an administrative office. This kind of pie-in-the-sky, one-size-fits-all design thinking has been thoroughly discredited.

**What the Article Got Wrong (Implicitly):**

1.  **The scale of the backlash:** While the author was deeply skeptical, the article doesn't quite predict the *magnitude* of the eventual backlash. It frames the issue as a matter of debate and questionable evidence. History has proven it to be more one-sided: the open-plan office for knowledge work went from being a dominant trend to a widely despised and counterproductive failure. The "open question" Lowe referred to has been largely answered with a firm "no."

### 4. INTEREST

**Score: 8**

This article deserves a high-interest score (a rating of 8 out of 9) because it serves as a near-perfect time capsule of a critical moment of technological and social hype. It demonstrates exceptionally clear-eyed skepticism in the face of a trend backed by corporate momentum and the architectural consulting industry.

Its long-term importance lies in its use as a case study for how to think critically about claims related to workplace trends and technology.
*   It correctly identifies **cost reduction as the primary driver** of a change that was being marketed as a productivity enhancement.
*   It correctly deconstructs the **"generational difference"** argument as a manipulative sales tactic, a lesson applicable far beyond office design.
*   It correctly insists on **grounding claims in physical and practical realities** (you can't just turn a lab into an office).

The article's core lesson—that when a new model is sold with appeals to "collaboration," "culture," and "the way the new generation works," one should first look for the cheaper-to-construct-and-operate reality—is more relevant than ever in an age of AI hype and techno-solutionism.
