# Cash For Vaccines (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reviews a Wall Street Journal series examining why pharmaceutical companies historically underinvested in vaccines and antibiotics despite public health needs. The piece acknowledges that market failures exist: new antibiotics face limited revenue potential because they are reserved for resistant infections, and vaccine development carries substantial liability risks from lawsuits. Rather than criticizing pharmaceutical companies, the article frames this as a structural economic challenge requiring policy intervention. The core argument is that incentive mechanisms—such as direct cash payments, guaranteed purchase agreements, or extended market exclusivity—could realign market dynamics to stimulate private-sector R&D. The author opposes government-led research, arguing that competition between multiple drug companies drives faster, more efficient innovation than a single government entity could achieve.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent two decades largely validated the article's analysis and saw several key policy responses. The 2006 creation of the **Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)** within HHS institutionalized the incentive model through guaranteed purchase agreements and public-private partnerships for pandemic preparedness. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic accelerated this approach, leading to expanded vaccine stockpiling contracts.

The **2007 FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA)** strengthened post-market surveillance but also highlighted ongoing antibiotic market challenges, prompting the 2012 **GAIN Act (Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now)**. GAIN provided five additional years of market exclusivity for qualified infectious disease products—directly implementing one of the WSJ article's proposed incentives.

Two critical pieces of legislation followed: the **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** created the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD), enabling smaller trials for targeted antibiotics, while the **DISARM Act (Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms)** proposed reforming hospital reimbursement but faced legislative hurdles.

**COVID-19 became the ultimate validation** of the incentive-driven model. Operation Warp Speed's combination of guaranteed purchases (over $18 billion pledged), direct R&D funding, and liability protections enabled unprecedented speed in vaccine development and manufacturing at scale—with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines achieving EUA within 11 months.

However, significant challenges persisted. Novel antibiotics like **Zemdri (plazomicin)** and **Xenleta (lefamulin)** achieved FDA approval but faced poor commercial uptake, confirming the article's warning about economic viability even with scientific success. Pfizer's 2016 acquisition of AstraZeneca's early-stage vaccines business demonstrated consolidation trends, and GSK's 2015 exit from malaria vaccine development after 30 years showed that major companies still abandoned unprofitable areas without adequate incentives.

**Vaccine liability frameworks did evolve**, with the 2006 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act providing immunity during declared emergencies—directly addressing the article's liability concern.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Market alone won't deliver needed vaccines/antibiotics because economic incentives aren't aligned (reserve antibiotics and liability exposure drive away investment).

• **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurately predicted**. GAIN Act, DISARM efforts, and continued recognition of antibiotic market failure (Nottingham University's 2021 analysis showed 78% drop in antibiotic R&D investments since 2000) validated this.

• **Prediction**: Government incentives (cash, guaranteed purchases, exclusivity extensions) could make the economics work for private companies.

• **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurately predicted**. BARDA (2006), GAIN Act exclusivity extensions (2012), Operation Warp Speed ($18B+ guaranteed purchases, 2020), and PREP Act liability protections have become mainstream policy tools.

• **Prediction**: Competition between multiple companies drives faster innovation than government doing research directly.

• **Outcome**: ✓ **Largely validated**. Operation Warp Speed succeeded through parallel competing approaches (Moderna vs. Pfizer-BioNTech vs. J&J vs. Novavax), and Project BioShield's guaranteed purchase model pre-committed to diverse candidates.

• **Prediction**: Having companies "ambling over to pick up prizes" without competition is the biggest risk of incentive programs.

• **Outcome**: **Partially observed**. Operation Warp Speed avoided this through multi-company parallel development, but some smaller incentive programs (like BARDA contracts for specific countermeasures) have suffered from limited competition and dependency on single suppliers.

• **Broader mechanism validation**: The article's underlying thesis—that incentives could overcome market failures—was validated at massive scale during COVID-19, while the ongoing struggles with antibiotic development ($1.2B antibiotic company acquisitions collapsing in 2019-2021, such as Melinta and Achaogen) confirm the market failure analysis was correct.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable foresight about the structural economic problems that would shape infectious disease R&D for two decades. Its framing of incentive-based policy solutions predated and arguably influenced major legislative developments (GAIN Act, Operation Warp Speed). The analysis has proven durable and increasingly relevant, particularly the warnings about antibiotic market viability and the emphasis on liability protections.
