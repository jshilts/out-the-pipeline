# Back on the Air (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post is a administrative/blog maintenance update rather than a substantive biotechnology article. The author announces that their blog is operational again after technical issues with Movable Type. They mention having a backlog of topics to cover, including Pfizer and Dichloroacetate, and note they will soon be unemployed but plan to continue blogging. Additionally, they provide an update on a manuscript called "Vial Thirty-Three," stating that its publication has been delayed due to proprietary company data that needs to wait before disclosure.

## 2. HISTORY
This appears to be a personal blog administrative post with minimal substantive biotechnology content. The Pfizer reference lacks context, and Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a compound that has been studied for various conditions including cancer and metabolic disorders, though with mixed research outcomes over the years. The "Vial Thirty-Three" manuscript referenced has no apparent public record or significance in the biotechnology literature. The post does not contain sufficient technical or scientific content to analyze for concrete biotechnology industry impact.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No substantive predictions about biotechnology development, drug approvals, clinical outcomes, or industry trends were made in this brief administrative post.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **0/10**
This is an administrative blog maintenance announcement with no substantive biotechnology content or analysis, making it irrelevant for biotechnology industry commentary or hindsight analysis.
