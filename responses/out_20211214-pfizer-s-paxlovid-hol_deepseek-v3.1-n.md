# Pfizer's Paxlovid Holds Up (December 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Pfizer's final Phase 2/3 trial results for Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir), a SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor, showing sustained 89% efficacy in preventing hospitalization among high-risk COVID-19 patients—consistent with earlier interim data. This contrasted sharply with Merck and Ridgeback's molnupiravir, which showed declining efficacy in later trial stages. The analysis highlighted several key findings: treatment effectiveness remained strong whether started within 3 or 5 days of symptom onset; high-risk patients (unvaccinated with additional risk factors) showed clear clinical benefit with 44 hospitalizations and 9 deaths in the placebo group versus 5 hospitalizations and 0 deaths in the treatment group; standard-risk patients showed reduced viral load but didn't reach statistical significance for hospitalization reduction due to fewer events overall. The article also addressed pharmacology concerns: Paxlovid requires co-administration with ritonavir (which inhibits drug metabolism) posing potential drug-interaction risks for patients on other medications, and noted manufacturing limitations—200,000 treatment courses for 2021 and 80 million for 2022—suggesting the need to prioritize high-risk patients. Good activity against the Omicron variant was expected due to limited protease mutations.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this December 2021 report, FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Paxlovid on December 22, 2021, for treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk adults and pediatric patients. Real-world deployment began in early 2022. During 2022, Paxlovid saw substantial uptake in high-risk populations despite early challenges including drug interaction concerns with common medications and "Paxlovid rebound"—some patients experiencing recurrent symptoms after initial improvement. By mid-2022, prescribing expanded as supply improved. The drug demonstrated effectiveness across variants including Omicron and its subvariants, with observational studies generally supporting trial findings of reduced hospitalization, though some real-world effectiveness estimates were lower than the 89% trial figure. In May 2023, FDA granted full approval to Paxlovid for adults at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Merck's molnupiravir did receive authorization but showed more limited real-world effectiveness, and never achieved comparable market uptake to Paxlovid. However, concerns about antiviral resistance did materialize to some extent by late 2023 and 2024, though not at pandemic-threatening levels, in part because of focused use in high-risk populations as recommended in the article. The manufacturing targets were largely met, helping transition COVID-19 therapeutics from scarce resources to more available treatments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Quick regulatory approval predicted**: Predicted "quick regulatory approval" for Paxlovid. *Outcome:* FDA granted EUA 8 days after this article, fully validated.

- **Resistance development through widespread use**: Expressing concern that "the more people who take this drug, the better the chances of resistance developing." *Outcome:* Some resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants did emerge over 2023-2024, but broad clinical resistance did not become widespread, in part because guidelines focused use on high-risk patients as originally suggested.

- **Manufacturing constraints justifying restriction to high-risk patients**: The article correctly predicted that 80 million treatment courses in 2022 "isn't in the face of worldwide demand" would necessitate prioritization. *Outcome:* This matched actual practice—health authorities issued prescribing guidance prioritizing high-risk populations, and widespread prophylactic use never materialized.

- **Molnupiravir's uncertain future**: Stated "I have to wonder if [molnupiravir] is ever going to see clinical use at all" after its efficacy declined. *Outcome:* Molnupiravir did receive regulatory authorization and some limited use, but never reached widespread adoption or achieved comparable clinical or market success to Paxlovid.

- **Combination therapy with molnupiravir would be undermined**: Hoped for combination therapy of Paxlovid with molnupiravir to prevent resistance, but acknowledged it unlikely given molnupiravir's declining data. *Outcome:* No such combination therapy entered routine clinical use, as molnupiravir never established itself as a robust therapeutic partner.

- **Exclusion of vaccinated low-risk patients**: The author said "I wouldn't think that a fully vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection should be taking it at all unless they have significant risk factors." *Outcome:* This aligned with subsequent real-world practice—most guideline-makers advised reserving Paxlovid for patients with significant underlying risk factors, and mass "walking around with a 'Pax-pack'" never became a reality.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional foresight about both clinical trial interpretation and realistic deployment challenges for a breakthrough therapeutic—accurately anticipating regulatory success, manufacturing constraints, appropriate targeting to high-risk patients, and molnupiravir's limitations.
