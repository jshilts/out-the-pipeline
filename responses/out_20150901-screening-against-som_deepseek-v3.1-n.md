# Screening Against Some of the Worst Organisms (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an alternative strategy for combating infectious diseases: rather than targeting the pathogen directly (which applies selective pressure and drives resistance), target host pathways that pathogens depend on. It highlights a UCLA/Stanford/Army study that screened 1,581 approved drugs for protection against anthrax and diphtheria toxins using cell-based assays.

The major finding was that 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials—especially amodiaquine (AQ)—showed strong protection by inhibiting cathepsin B, which blocks the endosomal/lysosomal entry pathway used by multiple pathogens. The drug demonstrated complete protection in rat anthrax toxin challenge studies. Since many dangerous pathogens use this same entry mechanism (including Ebola, SARS, rabies, and others), AQ represented a promising broad-spectrum repurposing candidate. Notably, the authors had already shared their findings with Médecins Sans Frontières, who observed a 31% reduction in Ebola mortality with AQ administration in West Africa.

## 2. HISTORY

**Amodiaquine and Ebola:** The most concrete outcome was the MSF observational study during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic showing AQ associated with 31% mortality reduction. However, *no large randomized controlled trials were completed* to definitively establish efficacy. Subsequent Ebola outbreaks saw primary reliance on monoclonal antibody therapies (like Inmazeb and Ebanga, FDA-approved in 2020) and vaccines (Ervebo, approved 2019), not AQ repurposing.

**Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19:** This became highly relevant when chloroquine (a related 4-aminoquinoline) gained attention for COVID-19. Initial enthusiasm driven by the endosomal interference mechanism described in this article led to widespread off-label use and emergency authorizations in some countries (2020). However:
- Large randomized trials (RECOVERY, Solidarity, WHO) showed **no clinical benefit** for hospitalized patients
- Multiple meta-analyses confirmed lack of efficacy for treatment or prevention
- FDA revoked emergency use authorization (June 2020)
- The "repurposing failure" consumed substantial research resources and became controversial

**Mechanism validation:** The cathepsin B/endosomal pathway targeting concept gained broader recognition. Subsequent research explored cathepsin inhibitors and endosomal trafficking modulators for various viral infections, though clinical translation remained challenging.

**Anthrax countermeasures:** The primary anthrax treatments remain antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, doxycycline) plus antitoxin monoclonal antibodies (raxibacumab, obiltoxaximab - approved 2012, 2016). Host-targeted approaches like AQ did not become standard of care.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction:** "AQ is a natural candidate for repurposing" and could serve as "broad-spectrum clinical agent" against pathogens using the endosomal route (Ebola, SARS, etc.).

**Reality:** Partial validation for Ebola (observational data only, never proven in RCTs), but major failure for SARS-CoV-2 despite initial enthusiasm. The mechanism proved biologically plausible but clinical efficacy did not materialize in rigorous trials.

**• Prediction:** The screening approach could be extended to "large collection of molecules" to find additional compounds targeting this pathway.

**Reality:** The field did pursue endosomal pathway modulators and cathepsin inhibitors for various indications, but no breakthrough broad-spectrum antiviral emerged from this strategy.

**• Prediction:** "A deeper look would seem warranted" given the pathway's importance.

**Reality:** The pathway received extensive research attention (accelerated by COVID-19), but therapeutic targeting proved more complex than anticipated, with limited clinical success.

**• Implicit prediction:** Host-targeted therapies would avoid resistance issues better than pathogen-targeted drugs.

**Reality:** While theoretically sound, this advantage didn't overcome the challenge of demonstrating clinical efficacy in rigorous trials. Resistance benefits remained largely theoretical for this mechanism.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article highlights an important therapeutic strategy (host-targeted therapy) with a specific mechanism that gained significant attention, particularly during COVID-19. However, the subsequent mixed results and clinical trial failures prevent a higher rating, despite the topic's historical relevance.
