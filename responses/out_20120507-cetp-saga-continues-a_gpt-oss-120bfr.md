# The CETP Saga Continues (And It's Not Getting More Entertaining) (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports that Roche stopped its Phase III trial of the CETP inhibitor **dalcetrapib** after interim analyses showed no meaningful reduction in cardiovascular events. It recalls the earlier failure of Pfizer’s CETP inhibitor **torcetrapib** (2006), which was halted because the drug raised blood pressure and caused excess mortality despite markedly increasing HDL‑C. The author questions whether simply raising HDL is sufficient for cardiovascular benefit and notes that the lack of efficacy, rather than safety, doomed dalcetrapib. The piece points out that **Merck** (anacetrapib) and **Eli Lilly** (evacetrapib) were still pursuing their own CETP inhibitors and predicts that both companies would publicly reaffirm confidence while quietly re‑evaluating their programs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 clinical outcomes**

| Drug | Company | Key trial(s) & outcome | Consequence |
|------|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Anacetrapib** | Merck | **REVEAL** (Phase III, 30 000 pts, 2017) showed a 9 % relative reduction in major coronary events but no mortality benefit; modest LDL‑C lowering and HDL‑C rise. | Merck decided **not to seek regulatory approval** (2018) because the absolute risk reduction was small, the drug accumulated in adipose tissue, and the commercial case was weak. |
| **Evacetrapib** | Eli Lilly | **ACCELERATE** (Phase III, 12 500 pts, 2015) was stopped early for futility; no difference in cardiovascular outcomes despite large HDL‑C increase and LDL‑C reduction. | Lilly **abandoned the program** and wrote off the asset. |
| **Dalcetrapib** | Roche | After the 2012 halt, Roche conducted a **genetics‑guided sub‑study (dal‑GenE)** that identified a small subgroup (≈5 % of patients) with a favorable APOA1 genotype. The follow‑up trial (2017) failed to demonstrate benefit. | Roche **did not revive** the drug; the program was terminated. |
| **Torcetrapib** | Pfizer | Catastrophic Phase III failure in 2006 (excess mortality, hypertension). | Program terminated; CETP inhibition entered a “black‑box” period. |

**Broader impact on the field**

* The collective failures demonstrated that **pharmacologic HDL‑C elevation via CETP inhibition does not translate into cardiovascular benefit** unless accompanied by substantial LDL‑C lowering.  
* The modest benefit seen with anacetrapib reinforced the view that **LDL‑C reduction remains the primary driver of risk reduction**, and that any HDL‑C effect is, at best, ancillary.  
* After 2017, **major biotech and pharma companies largely exited CETP inhibitor research**. No CETP inhibitor has reached market approval as of 2024.  
* The episode accelerated interest in **alternative ways to raise functional HDL** (e.g., apoA‑I mimetics, infusion of reconstituted HDL) but none have achieved regulatory success either.  
* Regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) have cited the CETP experience when evaluating surrogate‑endpoint‑driven lipid drugs, emphasizing the need for hard‑outcome data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several expectations. Their actual outcomes are listed below.

- **Prediction:** *Merck will continue development of its CETP inhibitor with confidence.*  
  **Outcome:** Merck completed the REVEAL trial (2017) showing modest benefit, but **chose not to file for approval** and discontinued the program (2018). Confidence waned after the modest effect and commercial concerns.

- **Prediction:** *Eli Lilly will press ahead with its CETP inhibitor, maintaining optimism.*  
  **Outcome:** Lilly’s evacetrapib trial (ACCELERATE, 2015) was stopped for futility; the company **abandoned the candidate** shortly thereafter.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The CETP field might still yield a successful cardiovascular drug if the right molecule is found.*  
  **Outcome:** No CETP inhibitor has been approved to date (2024). The field is essentially dormant, indicating that the “right molecule” has not materialized, or that the therapeutic premise is flawed.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *HDL‑C elevation alone could be a viable strategy for reducing CV events.*  
  **Outcome:** The collective data (torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, evacetrapib, anacetrapib) demonstrate that **HDL‑C raising without substantial LDL‑C lowering does not confer clinical benefit**.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The article captures a pivotal moment in lipid‑drug development, and the subsequent history provides a clear lesson about surrogate endpoints versus hard outcomes. Its relevance persists for anyone studying drug‑target validation, but the piece is narrowly focused on a class that ultimately failed, limiting broader appeal.
