# Dysfunctional Disclosure (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article critiques the widespread problem of inadequate disclosure in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patent applications. The author describes frustration with competitors' patents that bury key information under excessive legalistic language, making it difficult to understand the actual invention. The piece specifically targets the "best mode" requirement in patent law—while inventors must theoretically disclose the best way to practice their invention, the current system allows them to make this information nearly impossible to extract.

The author identifies three problematic practices: (1) Companies filing patents for extremely broad chemical structures with vague claims about inhibiting unspecified enzymes like "reverse whateverase" or "ya-ya kinase" for general treatment purposes; (2) The use of a "plus-mark" system where compounds are rated with one, two, or three plus symbols for activity levels without providing any quantitative data; (3) Patents that describe detailed assay methods but then vaguely state that compounds "were found to be active and stuff" without providing actual results. The author questions whether patent offices should continue accepting such inadequate disclosures.

## 2. HISTORY
While this specific article has limited subsequent actionable impact, the broader issues it raised were reflected in significant developments from the time. Vague disclosure was already a known problem in 2005, and the field has evolved since then.

The biotech industry changed significantly over the decade following 2005, but these changes centered around technology and commercialization rather than major regulatory reforms to disclosure rules. By the mid-2010s, new therapies had emerged for conditions like cancer and genetic disorders, though these were mostly driven by advances in molecular biology.

The drug development pipeline expanded globally, with more companies pursuing targeted therapies. However, structural issues with patent law persisted. Patent offices generally maintained existing disclosure standards, and there were no major legislative reforms to the "best mode" requirement during this period. 

While the article highlighted important transparency issues, it did not lead to concrete policy changes or widespread industry reforms regarding patent disclosure practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained no explicit forward-looking predictions about future developments, drug approvals, or policy changes. It focused instead on describing and criticizing existing patent disclosure practices without speculating about how these issues might evolve. Because the author did not make predictions, this retrospective analysis cannot evaluate their accuracy.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
The article addresses an important industry issue, but its relevance is narrow and focused primarily on patent law practices rather than broader scientific or clinical developments. The content is moderately interesting for those concerned with patent strategies, but it lacks the broader scientific impact that would appeal to a wider biotechnology audience.
