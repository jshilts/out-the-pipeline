# Analyst Report: Nutley Demolished (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article documents the demolition of Hoffman-LaRoche's former R&D facility in Nutley, New Jersey, which had been closed as a research site. The company was marketing five buildings for sale to smaller biopharma companies while demolishing the remainder of the campus, with plans to redevelop the property into office and retail space.

The piece draws a parallel to the author's personal experience with Schering-Plough's former Bloomfield research site, which similarly failed to find research-oriented buyers despite attempts to sell or donate the labs to institutions like Rutgers. That property was ultimately demolished and replaced with commercial retail, specifically a Home Depot. The article notes this pattern of abandoned pharmaceutical facilities (termed "Phormer Pharma sites") as a broader trend affecting both the US and Europe, with New Jersey having a significant concentration of such sites.

## 2. HISTORY

The Hoffman-LaRoche Nutley campus closure reflected a major pharmaceutical industry restructuring trend during the 2010s. Large pharma companies significantly reduced R&D footprints and internal discovery capabilities, shifting toward smaller, more focused research organizations and increased outsourcing. The Nutley site's demolition was emblematic of broader cost-cutting and pipeline optimization strategies across the industry.

As predicted in the article, the property did transition to mixed-use development. However, rather than solely office and retail, the former Nutley campus became part of a broader redevelopment pattern where pharmaceutical campuses were converted into innovation districts, life sciences hubs, or residential/commercial complexes. This transformation was not unique to Roche; similar fates befell numerous pharmaceutical facilities as the industry consolidated R&D operations.

The "smaller biopharma" acquisition model mentioned in the article proved accurate, as regional biotech clusters emerged in former pharma strongholds. However, these smaller companies typically leased rather than purchased entire campuses, resulting in more fragmented reuse of pharmaceutical infrastructure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions about the Nutley site and broader industry trends:

• **Five buildings sold to smaller biopharma**: The prediction that smaller biopharma companies would acquire the buildings was directionally correct, though the scale and terms likely differed from initial expectations given the complexity of repurposing pharmaceutical manufacturing and research facilities.

• **Redevelopment as office and retail space**: This materialized, though the actual development timeline and final use mix would have been influenced by local zoning, market conditions, and environmental remediation requirements typical of former industrial sites.

• **Continued pattern of abandoned pharma sites**: This prediction proved highly accurate. The trend of pharmaceutical facility closures and demolitions continued throughout the 2010s and beyond, with companies like Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Novartis all closing major research sites and either demolishing or repurposing them.

• **New Jersey maintaining high concentration of former sites**: This remained true, as New Jersey's historical role as "the medicine cabinet of the world" meant numerous legacy facilities faced closure during industry consolidation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article offers a snapshot of ongoing pharmaceutical industry restructuring but focuses primarily on real estate rather than scientific, clinical, or business transformation. While it captures an important economic trend, it lacks the scientific depth or predictive insight that would make it highly interesting from a biotechnology perspective.
