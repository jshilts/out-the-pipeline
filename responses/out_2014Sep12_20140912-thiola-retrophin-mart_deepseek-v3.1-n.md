# Analysis of the 2014 Science Magazine Article on Thiola, Retrophin, and Martin Shkreli

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe, published in Science Magazine's "In the Pipeline" blog on September 12, 2014, documented a controversial drug price increase orchestrated by Retrophin under CEO Martin Shkreli. The company had acquired the rights to Thiola (tiopronin), an off-patent drug used to treat cystinuria (a rare genetic kidney stone disorder), and raised its price from approximately $1.50 per pill to $30 per pill—a 20-fold increase. The article emerged from a viral Reddit discussion where Shkreli unexpectedly participated in an AMA-style defense of the pricing strategy.

The core argument centered on what Lowe termed "regulatory rent-seeking"—a strategy where Retrophin planned to maintain monopoly power not through patents (the drug was already off-patent) but through regulatory maneuvers. The company intended to introduce new formulations (250mg, 500mg, and eventually time-release versions) while discontinuing older dosages, making it difficult for generic competitors to demonstrate bioequivalence. This approach, combined with a "closed distribution" model leveraging FDA risk management systems, aimed to create a perpetual monopoly rather than the time-limited protection patents provide.

## 2. HISTORY

The events following this article proved far more dramatic than anyone could have predicted in 2014, transforming this story from a pharmaceutical pricing controversy into one of the most notorious business scandals of the decade.

**The Shkreli Saga Unfolds (2015-2018):**

Just months after this article, in December 2014, Shkreli was ousted from Retrophin and sued by the company. By August 2015, he had acquired Turing Pharmaceuticals and implemented the same playbook with Daraprim (pyrimethamine), an antiparasitic drug used by AIDS patients and others with compromised immune systems. Turing raised Daraprim's price from $13.50 to $750 per pill—a 5000% increase that made Shkreli "the most hated man in America."

The backlash was immediate and intense. During a 2015 pharmaceutical conference, Shkreli was confronted by reporters in what became viral videos. In December 2015, he was arrested on securities fraud charges unrelated to drug pricing—allegedly running a Ponzi scheme involving his hedge funds and manipulating Retrophin's stock. He was convicted in August 2017 on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, sentenced to seven years in prison, and ordered to forfeit $7.4 million.

**The Broader Pharmaceutical Pricing Crisis:**

Shkreli's actions became a catalyst for broader scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices. The controversy contributed to:

- Congressional hearings on drug pricing in 2015-2016
- Increased media coverage of pharmaceutical industry practices
- Public outrage that influenced the 2016 presidential election discourse
- State and federal legislation attempts to control drug prices
- The pharmaceutical industry's public relations challenges that persist today

**Thiola's Ongoing Story:**

Retrophin continued operations after Shkreli's departure. In 2020, the company was acquired by the Belgian pharmaceutical company Santhera (now known as Travere Therapeutics). The FDA eventually approved generic versions of tiopronin, breaking Retrophin's monopoly. However, during the period of exclusivity, patients and healthcare systems bore the costs of Shkreli's pricing strategy.

**Regulatory Changes:**

The controversy highlighted vulnerabilities in the FDA's regulatory framework that allowed such strategies. While the FDA has since implemented some reforms to prevent "closed distribution" manipulation, critics argue that regulatory loopholes enabling monopolistic practices still exist.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Proved Correct:**

1. **Regulatory rent-seeking as the core strategy:** Lowe accurately identified that Shkreli was exploiting regulatory loopholes rather than patent protection to maintain monopoly power. This proved prescient—the strategy became a template that Shkreli attempted to replicate with Daraprim and that other companies emulated.

2. **The stomach-turning nature of cloaking profit maximization in patient-care rhetoric:** Lowe's critique of Shkreli's noble-sounding justifications proved entirely accurate. Subsequent investigations revealed that patient benefit was never the primary motivation; profit maximization drove all decisions.

3. **The prediction that Thiola was too small to generate significant opposition:** Lowe noted that Retrophin was betting the drug "just isn't a big enough deal for anyone to go to that trouble." While the Thiola case specifically didn't generate massive legal challenges, the pattern it revealed certainly did when repeated with Daraprim.

**Predictions That Were Wrong or Incomplete:**

1. **The assumption this was mostly business as usual:** Lowe characterized this as essentially business practice ("to a first approximation, that's business"), albeit distasteful. He couldn't have predicted that this case would expose massive securities fraud, leading to federal prison time for Shkreli.

2. **The expectation of limited consequences:** No one in 2014 predicted that this incident would catalyze a nationwide conversation about pharmaceutical pricing, congressional investigations, or become a symbol of corporate malfeasance.

3. **The assessment of Shkreli as merely audacious:** Lowe gave Shkreli credit for "aplomb" and unconventional CEO behavior. The subsequent revelations showed something far more sinister—a pattern of fraud, manipulation, and sociopathic business practices.

4. **The implicit assumption this was about pharmaceutical economics:** The article focused on industry pricing dynamics. The deeper story proved to be about securities fraud, investor deception, and criminal enterprise disguised as pharmaceutical business.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 8/9**

This article deserves a high interest score (8) because it captured a pivotal moment that prefigured one of the decade's most significant business scandals and catalyzed a national conversation about pharmaceutical pricing.

**Reasons for High Interest:**

1. **Prescience:** Lowe identified the regulatory gaming strategy that would become Shkreli's modus operandi and a template for others.

2. **Historical Significance:** This was the first major public documentation of Shkreli's pharmaceutical strategy, preceding the Daraprim controversy that made him infamous.

3. **The Reddit Dimension:** The article documented early social media's power to amplify business controversies, showing how platforms like Reddit could bring corporate wrongdoing to public attention.

4. **Broader Systemic Issues:** It highlighted vulnerabilities in FDA regulations and pharmaceutical market structures that remain relevant today.

5. **Unfolding Drama:** The article captures the beginning of a story that would become far more dramatic than anyone anticipated—securities fraud, federal prosecution, and a cautionary tale about unchecked corporate greed.

**Limiting Factors:**

- The article primarily focuses on one specific drug and company, lacking the broader scope that would merit a perfect 9
- Some predictions about consequences and scale proved inaccurate
- The biotechnology focus is somewhat narrow compared to broader scientific breakthroughs that would rank as 9s

**Long-term Importance:**

The article's significance grew exponentially over time. What seemed in 2014 like a niche pharmaceutical pricing dispute became a case study in corporate malfeasance, securities fraud, and the intersection of social media and business accountability. It influenced public policy debates, congressional investigations, and ongoing discussions about pharmaceutical regulation. The Shkreli case remains a touchstone in discussions of healthcare costs, corporate ethics, and regulatory reform.

The article also exemplified science journalism's role in scrutinizing industry practices and holding powerful actors accountable—a function that has become even more critical in the decade since publication.
