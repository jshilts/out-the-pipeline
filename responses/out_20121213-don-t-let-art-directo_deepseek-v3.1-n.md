# Don't Let the Art Director Draw Your Molecules (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary criticizes the practice of using stylized, colorful molecular structure graphics in scientific publications and press materials where atoms are represented with arbitrary colors that don't correspond to standard chemical convention. The author points to examples where "silvery purple" atoms appear without clear elemental identification, creating confusion about what the molecules actually contain. The article references previous incidents (including a 2011 Georgia Tech case) where molecular structures were either incorrectly drawn or used non-standard coloring schemes that obscured rather than clarified the actual chemistry. The core argument is that scientific accuracy should never be sacrificed for aesthetic appeal in molecular representations.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2012 article, the issue of misleading molecular graphics has persisted, though with some notable developments:

**Continued Problems:**
- Between 2012-2024, numerous instances emerged of academic papers, institutional press releases, and pharmaceutical company materials using non-standard or misleading molecular depictions. High-profile journals like *Nature* and *Science* have had to issue corrections for molecular graphics issues.

**Industry Impact:**
- Major pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Moderna, Roche) have increasingly adopted standardized molecular visualization software tools that enforce proper color schemes and structural conventions, though press departments sometimes still diverge for marketing materials.

**Drug Development Reality:**
- The misrepresentation issue took on greater significance during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023), when public understanding of molecular structures (like the spike protein and drug molecules) became crucial. Clear, standardized molecular graphics proved important for public communication of treatments like Paxlovid and vaccines.

**Tools and Standards:**
- Chemical drawing software has improved significantly, with tools like ChemDraw, MarvinSketch, and open-source alternatives increasingly enforcing IUPAC standards by default. However, graphic designers working on scientific marketing materials still frequently override these standards.

**No Major Policy Changes:**
- Despite continued advocacy by chemists, no major funding agencies or journals established mandatory molecular representation standards for press materials, though most major journals now have more stringent technical graphics review for accepted manuscripts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments, focusing instead on documenting and criticizing existing practices.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

This commentary addresses a persistent but niche issue in scientific communication. While it highlights an important principle about maintaining scientific accuracy in visual representations, it deals with a relatively narrow aspect of scientific publishing that affects specialized audiences rather than broader scientific or public policy outcomes.
