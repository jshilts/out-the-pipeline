# The Latest on Drug Failure and Approval Rates (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary examined the “success” statistics that underpin modern drug discovery. It noted that, despite a record‑high 59 FDA approvals in 2018, the probability that a molecule entering Phase I reaches the market has stayed just under 10 % for decades. The author highlighted two points that could signal change: (1) the Phase III‑to‑approval conversion, historically a little under 50 %, appeared to be climbing in the 2015‑2017 cohorts; and (2) the number of compounds in early‑stage (pre‑clinical/Phase I) pipelines had been falling steadily since the 2009‑2011 period, suggesting that companies might be pursuing fewer, higher‑quality projects. Therapeutic‑area breakdowns were also mentioned—CNS and cardiovascular programs had the lowest Phase III success, while respiratory, metabolic and anti‑infective projects fared better. Finally, the piece observed a gradual decline (since 2013) in the share of new approvals coming from the largest pharmaceutical firms, though the trend had not yet broken the 2010 baseline.

## 2. HISTORY  

### FDA approval volume (2019‑2025)  
- **2020**: 53 NMEs (new molecular entities) – the highest annual count on record, driven in part by COVID‑19 therapeutics and vaccines.  
- **2021**: 50 NMEs, a modest dip but still well above the pre‑pandemic average (~30‑35).  
- **2022**: 37 NMEs, reflecting a return to a more typical pipeline flow after the pandemic surge.  
- **2023**: 38 NMEs, with a noticeable increase in biologics and gene‑therapy products.  
- **2024** (pre‑final data): ~45 NMEs, driven largely by oncology, rare‑disease, and mRNA‑based platforms.  
- **2025** (early reports): approvals remain in the low‑40s, with a continued rise in first‑in‑class biologics.

Overall, the “record‑haul” of 2018 was not an isolated spike; the 2020‑2024 period has sustained a higher baseline than the early 2010s, though the numbers fluctuate year‑to‑year.

### Success‑rate trends  
- **Phase I → launch**: The Tufts CSDD 2022 and 2024 reports place the overall probability of success (PoS) at **≈ 9 %** for INDs entering Phase I, essentially unchanged from the 2010‑2017 estimate cited in the article.  
- **Phase II → launch**: PoS has hovered around **15‑17 %**, with little systematic drift.  
- **Phase III → launch**: Cohorts entering Phase III in 2018‑2020 show a **PoS of 55‑58 %**, a modest but statistically significant rise over the 45‑50 % range reported for 2015‑2017. The improvement is most evident in oncology and rare‑disease biologics, where adaptive trial designs and biomarker enrichment have reduced late‑stage failures.  

The rise in Phase III success is real, but it does not translate into a large shift in the overall pipeline because the number of candidates reaching Phase III remains a small fraction of the total INDs.

### Early‑stage pipeline size  
- **IND filings** (US) peaked around 2014‑2015 (~2,300 new INDs per year) and have **declined by ~10‑12 %** to roughly 2,000 per year in 2023. The drop is driven mainly by large pharma, which has trimmed its pre‑clinical discovery budgets.  
- **Biotech activity**: The number of biotech start‑ups filing INDs has risen modestly, offsetting part of the large‑pharma contraction.  

Thus the article’s observation of a “steady drop” in early‑stage projects holds true, though the decline has slowed in the last few years.

### Share of approvals by company type  
- **Large pharma (≥ 10 % of global revenue)**: Their share of NMEs fell from **≈ 55 % in 2013** to **≈ 38 % in 2023**.  
- **Mid‑size pharma & biotech**: The complementary rise has been driven by companies such as **Moderna, BioNTech, Gilead’s subsidiary, and numerous rare‑disease specialists**.  
- **M&A impact**: Several high‑profile acquisitions (e.g., **Novartis‑Molecular Partners, Pfizer‑Seagen**) have temporarily boosted large‑pharma pipelines, but the underlying trend of external innovation remains.

### Therapeutic‑area outcomes  
- **Oncology**: Despite historically low Phase III PoS, the absolute number of approvals has risen (≈ 12‑15 per year 2020‑2024) because of a flood of checkpoint‑inhibitor and CAR‑T candidates.  
- **CNS**: Success rates remain the lowest (Phase III PoS ≈ 30 %); only a handful of novel CNS NMEs have reached market since 2019 (e.g., **soticlestat**, **pimavanserin**).  
- **Cardiovascular**: PoS stays near 35 %; few new first‑in‑class agents have been approved, with most recent successes in lipid‑lowering (e.g., **bempedoic acid**) and heart‑failure (e.g., **sacubitril/valsartan** extensions).  
- **Anti‑infectives**: The COVID‑19 pandemic added several antivirals (e.g., **molnupiravir**, **paxlovid**) and vaccines, temporarily inflating the anti‑infective success rate to > 60 % for the 2020‑2022 cohorts.  

Overall, the therapeutic‑area hierarchy described in 2019 persists, with CNS and cardiovascular still lagging, while anti‑infectives and oncology dominate approvals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *Phase III success rates would continue to rise, potentially indicating a real trend.*  
  - **Outcome:** A modest increase to ~55 % was observed for 2018‑2020 cohorts, largely driven by oncology and rare‑disease biologics. The upward move has plateaued; 2022‑2024 data show no further jump, suggesting the 2019 observation captured a short‑term effect rather than a sustained trend.

- **Prediction:** *Early‑stage pipeline size would keep shrinking, implying “fewer but better” projects.*  
  - **Outcome:** IND filings have indeed declined (~10 % from the 2015 peak) and large‑pharma discovery budgets have been cut. However, the rise of biotech start‑ups and the expansion of AI‑driven target identification have kept the total number of early‑stage candidates from falling dramatically. The “fewer but better” narrative is partially true for big pharma but not for the industry as a whole.

- **Prediction:** *The share of new drugs launched by large pharma would keep falling, potentially reshaping the market.*  
  - **Outcome:** The share dropped from ~55 % (2013) to ~38 % (2023). The trend continues, with biotech and mid‑size firms now responsible for the majority of NMEs. Large pharma remains the dominant commercializer of blockbuster biologics, but its role as the primary source of first‑in‑class chemistry has diminished.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Therapeutic‑area success patterns would stay roughly the same.*  
  - **Outcome:** CNS and cardiovascular PoS remain the lowest; anti‑infectives and oncology continue to dominate approvals. No major reversal has occurred up to 2025.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in drug‑development analytics, correctly flagging a subtle rise in Phase III success and a real contraction of early‑stage pipelines. Its observations have been largely borne out, making it a useful reference for anyone tracking long‑term industry efficiency, even though the piece itself is a brief commentary rather than a deep data study.
