# Analysis of "Rule of Ten?" (Science Magazine, August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a presentation at an ACS meeting in San Francisco where a speaker proposed a "Rule of 10" for orally available macrocycles in drug development. This rule suggested that effective macrocyclic drugs should have: (1) ring size greater than 10, (2) molecular weight under 1000, and (3) clogP around 10. 

The author expresses skepticism about this proposed rule, arguing that the percentage of compounds meeting these criteria that are actually orally active would likely be quite small—probably much smaller than the success rate with traditional Lipinski Rule of Five criteria. The author suggests that orally available macrocycles probably depend on poorly understood internal hydrogen bonding mechanisms, and that given the complexity of hydrogen bonding, there are "far more ways to get it wrong than to get it right."

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in 2014, the field of macrocyclic drugs has seen significant advancement and refinement of understanding. Rather than adopting a simple "Rule of 10," subsequent research has revealed a much more nuanced picture:

**Evidence against the rule's general applicability**: By the mid-to-late 2010s, it became clear that while some macrocycles do fall within these parameters, many successful macrocyclic drugs deviate significantly from these guidelines. The proposed limits were found to be overly restrictive and didn't capture the diversity of macrocycles that could achieve oral bioavailability.

**Continued research into intramolecular hydrogen bonding**: The article's speculation about internal hydrogen bonding proved prescient. Research in the late 2010s and early 2020s has indeed shown that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in making macrocycles cell-permeable and orally bioavailable, often by masking polar groups and reducing the effective polarity.

**Clinical pipeline growth**: Despite concerns about complexity, macrocycles have become an increasingly important drug class. By 2020, there were over 100 macrocyclic drugs either approved or in clinical development, spanning areas from antibiotics to cancer therapeutics to immunosuppressants.

**Computational advances**: Progress in computational chemistry and structural biology has helped researchers better understand macrocycle conformational dynamics and preorganization, moving beyond simple rule-based approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the article got right:**

- *Skepticism about the "Rule of 10"*: The author's doubts about the proposed rule were well-founded. Subsequent research showed it to be an oversimplification, and the field never widely adopted these specific criteria as a reliable guideline.

- *Importance of intramolecular interactions*: The speculation that internal hydrogen bonding is crucial for macrocycle bioavailability proved accurate. Later studies confirmed that such interactions are indeed key to understanding why some macrocycles can violate traditional drug-likeness rules while remaining orally available.

- *Difficulty of prediction*: The author correctly anticipated that macrocycle behavior would be harder to predict than smaller molecules following Lipinski rules.

**What the article underestimated:**

- *The potential success of macrocycles*: The field has seen more successful macrocyclic drug development than the article's skeptical tone might have suggested. While challenging, the macrocycle space has proven more fertile than implied.

- *Diversity of successful structures*: Success has been achieved with macrocycles across a much wider range of molecular weights, ring sizes, and lipophilicities than the "Rule of 10" would suggest.

- *Scientific understanding*: Our comprehension of macrocycle structure-property relationships has advanced more rapidly than implied, though it remains incomplete.

## 4. INTEREST SCORE: 5/9

This article falls in the 5th decile—moderately interesting with reasonable staying power. While it addressed an important emerging area in drug discovery, most of its value came from expressing appropriate scientific skepticism about oversimplified rules rather than presenting groundbreaking insights.

**Strengths of interest:**
- Captured a moment of scientific debate about drug design heuristics
- Questioned hype appropriately with sound chemical reasoning  
- Presciently identified internal hydrogen bonding as a key mechanism
- Contributed to important discussions about extending drug-likeness rules

**Limitations:**
- The "Rule of 10" never became a major movement in the field, so the article's target declined in relevance
- While the technical points were sound, the impact was more incremental than transformative
- The field quickly moved beyond simple rule-based approaches to more sophisticated computational methods

The article represents solid scientific journalism—questioning oversimplified claims and pointing toward the real complexity of drug discovery—but it didn't foresee the broader advances that would make macrocycles a vibrant, growing area of pharmaceutical research.
