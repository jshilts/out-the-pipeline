# Simulating the Brain. Sure Thing. (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques the European Union's Human Brain Project (HBP), a ten-year initiative that began in 2013 with the goal of simulating the human brain through large-scale neuron modeling. The author strongly questions the project's feasibility, arguing that we lack fundamental understanding of how brains work at multiple levels. The piece cites the example of C. elegans, a roundworm with only 302 neurons whose complete wiring diagram is known, yet scientists still cannot explain how this simple brain actually functions. The article warns that without understanding the underlying principles of neural computation, brain simulation efforts are like "cargo cult science" - creating superficially similar structures that cannot actually think or operate like real brains.

## 2. HISTORY

The Human Brain Project faced significant challenges and controversies in the years following this article's publication. In 2015-2016, the project was restructured following criticism from neuroscientists about its management and scientific approach, with project leadership changes made in response to an open letter from over 150 researchers. The HBP formally concluded in 2023 with a final budget of approximately €607 million over its ten-year lifespan. While the project produced various neuroinformatics tools, databases, and publications, it did not achieve its original ambitious goal of whole-brain simulation or fundamental breakthroughs in understanding cognition. 

The field of brain simulation has seen continued but more incremental progress. Successes include more detailed mapping of specific brain circuits in model organisms and improved computational models of neural networks, but comprehensive brain simulation remains elusive. The fundamental criticisms raised in this article - about the gap between data collection and mechanistic understanding - have been validated by the field's continued challenges in bridging this divide, though progress in machine learning has provided alternative approaches to some neural computation problems.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Brain simulation won't succeed without understanding underlying principles**: This prediction proved largely accurate. A decade later, comprehensive brain simulation remains an unsolved challenge, and the gap between neural data and functional understanding persists as a fundamental problem in neuroscience.

- **The Human Brain Project would face fundamental problems**: This was validated by the project's mid-course restructuring in 2015-2016 and the ongoing scientific debate about its approach and outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**8/10**

The article demonstrated remarkable prescience about the fundamental challenges facing large-scale brain simulation projects, correctly identifying core scientific and methodological problems that persisted throughout the Human Brain Project's lifespan and remain relevant today in neuroscience and AI research.
