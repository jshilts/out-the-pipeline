# Go Spread It On the Rosebushes (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Pfizer CEO Jeffrey Kindler's comments at the November 2009 Reuters Health Summit regarding the company's recently completed acquisition of Wyeth. Kindler claimed that Pfizer had successfully integrated and reorganized the research and development operations of both companies within just 20 days of the October 15, 2009 merger completion. He contrasted this swift reorganization with previous pharmaceutical mergers that had taken "literally years" to complete, suggesting this merger avoided the typical "distractions, disruptions and delays" that had plagued such deals in the past.

## 2. HISTORY

The Pfizer-Wyeth merger faced significant challenges despite the initial optimism. Key developments that followed:

**R&D Integration and Productivity**: The promised rapid integration did not translate into improved research productivity. Pfizer continued to struggle with R&D output in subsequent years, facing multiple high-profile clinical trial failures and patent cliffs on blockbuster drugs like Lipitor.

**Leadership Changes**: Jeffrey Kindler unexpectedly resigned as CEO in December 2010, just over a year after making these statements, after Pfizer's stock declined significantly during his tenure.

**Post-Merger Restructuring**: Rather than the streamlined operation promised, Pfizer implemented major cost-cutting measures including significant R&D site closures and workforce reductions. In 2011, Pfizer announced plans to close eight research sites.

**Clinical Pipeline Challenges**: The combined pipeline failed to deliver the promised innovation. Multiple late-stage candidates failed, including the highly anticipated cholesterol drug torcetrapib (before the merger) and later cardiovascular drugs.

**Further Consolidation**: The pattern continued with Pfizer attempting another major acquisition - the failed 2014 bid for AstraZeneca, and successfully acquiring Hospira in 2015 and eventually acquiring Allergan in 2016 (though the latter deal was structured as a tax inversion that ultimately unraveled).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions that can be evaluated:

- **Prediction**: That rapid 20-day R&D integration would avoid "distractions, disruptions and delays" typical of pharmaceutical mergers
  - **Reality**: The integration was followed by years of restructuring, multiple R&D site closures, and continued pipeline challenges
  
- **Prediction**: That the swift reorganization approach would lead to better research outcomes
  - **Reality**: R&D productivity remained low, leading to further major restructuring and leadership changes
  
- **Prediction**: That this merger model would be more successful than previous pharmaceutical mega-mergers
  - **Reality**: The merger did not fundamentally change Pfizer's R&D challenges or prevent the need for additional major acquisitions and restructuring

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides insight into the disconnect between pharmaceutical merger announcements and their actual outcomes, making it moderately interesting as a case study in corporate communications versus reality in the biotech/pharma sector.
