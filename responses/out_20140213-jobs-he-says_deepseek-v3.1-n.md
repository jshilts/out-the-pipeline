# Jobs, He Says (Feb 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a Forbes op-ed by Eli Lilly CEO John Lechleiter promoting the STEM skills gap narrative, where he claims there are over 600,000 unfilled U.S. manufacturing jobs due to insufficient STEM-trained workers. The author characterizes this as "perfectly conventional wisdom" that is hard to oppose without sounding anti-education. However, the article exposes a significant contradiction: while Lechleiter advocates for more STEM education to fill job vacancies, Eli Lilly has systematically reduced its workforce over the preceding decade, shrinking from 45,835 employees in July 2004 to "over 37,000" by early 2014—a net loss of roughly 12,000 jobs, accounting for acquisitions. The company had also recently announced a billion-dollar R&D budget cut, suggesting further layoffs were imminent, making Lechleiter's claims about struggling to hire ring hollow amid widespread workforce reductions.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following this 2014 article revealed a more complex reality about STEM job markets and pharmaceutical industry employment patterns:

**Eli Lilly's Workforce Trajectory**: Despite Lechleiter's 2014 narrative about struggling to find qualified STEM talent, Eli Lilly continued to face significant business challenges that shaped their actual hiring practices. The company's overall employment remained relatively flat or declined in subsequent years, partly due to patent cliffs on major drugs like Cymbalta and Evista, which expired in 2013-2014. However, the company did experience growth in specific therapeutic areas; Lilly's investment in diabetes drugs (particularly Trulicity, approved in 2014) and later in cancer therapies eventually led to workforce stabilization and targeted hiring in R&D areas aligned with these growth platforms.

**STEM Gap Debate Evolution**: The broader debate about STEM skills gaps versus employment realities intensified after 2014. Multiple studies published in the following years provided more nuanced perspectives on whether genuine shortages existed or whether labor market dynamics were driven by factors like suppressed wages, insufficient on-the-job training by employers, and mismatches between academic credentials and industry needs. The discussion shifted from simple shortage claims to examining geographic, skill-level, and field-specific variations in supply and demand.

**Clinical Research Workforce Changes**: The pharmaceutical industry underwent significant restructuring between 2014-2020. Many companies, including Lilly, moved away from traditional full-time employment models toward more flexible contract-based arrangements, increased reliance on CROs (contract research organizations), and geographic diversification of research capabilities. This trend aligned with the outsourcing patterns the original article described, which continued to affect employment stability for STEM professionals.

**Policy and Immigration**: Interestingly, the immigration policy angle Lechleiter referenced became more salient. The H-1B visa program and its caps remained a contentious issue affecting pharmaceutical and biotech companies' ability to recruit international talent, particularly for specialized research roles. This provided some validation to industry concerns about accessing global talent pools, though it didn't necessarily support the domestic shortage framing.

**Manufacturing Sector Reality**: The 600,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs claim warrants scrutiny. While certain advanced manufacturing sectors did face genuine skill shortages, many traditional manufacturing jobs were being automated or offshored during this period. The pharmaceutical manufacturing sector specifically saw increased automation and productivity improvements that reduced labor requirements per unit of output, even as production volumes grew.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions about future developments but instead highlighted the apparent contradiction between Lechleiter's public statements and Lilly's employment practices at the time. However, Lechleiter's Forbes piece made implicit predictions that can be evaluated:

- **STEM talent scarcity would worsen without educational intervention**: Academic studies and labor market analyses published in subsequent years generally found mixed evidence for broad STEM shortages, with variations by field, experience level, and geographic region. While some specialized areas (e.g., data science, AI/ML) did experience tight labor markets, the narrative of pervasive shortages across STEM fields became increasingly disputed by researchers examining wage trends, unemployment rates, and degree completion data.

- **U.S. would face increasing difficulty filling manufacturing positions**: Manufacturing employment patterns evolved with automation playing a greater role than anticipated talent gaps. The pharmaceutical industry specifically saw continued offshoring of manufacturing to lower-cost locations like Ireland, Puerto Rico (which faced economic crises), and Asia, alongside automation investments that reduced workforce requirements.

- **Biopharmaceutical firms would struggle to replace retiring Baby Boomers**: The intergenerational workforce transition did occur, but companies adapted through various strategies including delayed retirements, knowledge transfer programs, and reconfigured organizational structures. The predicted crisis didn't materialize in the catastrophic form suggested.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures the intellectual dishonesty of corporate messaging about skills gaps while simultaneously pursuing cost-cutting and workforce reduction strategies. The STEM shortage narrative remains relevant today across multiple industries, and understanding the gap between public relations framing and actual labor market practices is crucial for students, policymakers, and workers navigating career decisions.
