# Trouble with CRISPR? Maybe, But Maybe Not (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a controversial Nature Methods paper published in 2017 that reported unexpectedly high numbers of mutations in CRISPR-treated mice. The study found that two mice treated with CRISPR-Cas9 showed substantially more insertions/deletions (indels) and single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) than expected - with one mouse showing 164 indels and 1,736 SNVs, and the other 128 indels and 1,696 SNVs. These numbers were dramatically higher than spontaneous mutation rates (3-4 indels and 90-100 SNVs per generation).

The paper caused significant concern because the off-target mutations didn't match software predictions of likely CRISPR target sites, suggesting unpredictability in CRISPR's effects. The news led to immediate stock price drops for CRISPR-focused companies like Editas and CRISPR Therapeutics. However, the article also notes serious methodological concerns raised by other scientists, including questions about whether the mutations were actually from CRISPR treatment versus pre-existing genetic variations in the mouse lineage, the use of plasmids instead of direct protein/RNA delivery, and the very small sample size (n=2 treated mice, 1 control).

## 2. HISTORY

The 2017 study's dramatic claims did not hold up to scientific scrutiny. Subsequent research and careful analysis revealed significant flaws in the original study's methodology. The broader CRISPR field continued to advance and has seen remarkable clinical and commercial success in the years since.

**Clinical and Regulatory Success:**
- **CTX001 (Casgevy)**: In November 2023, the UK's MHRA approved CTX001, developed by CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex, for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia - making it the first CRISPR-based therapy to receive regulatory approval. The FDA approved it in December 2023. This marked a milestone as the first CRISPR gene-editing therapy to reach patients.
- **Exagamglogene autotemcel (Exa-cel)**: This therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in clinical trials, essentially curing patients of sickle cell disease symptoms by editing hematopoietic stem cells to produce fetal hemoglobin.

**Continued Scientific Validation:**
Multiple laboratories replicated more careful CRISPR experiments and found that with proper controls and methodology, off-target effects were manageable and substantially lower than the 2017 paper suggested. The scientific consensus emerged that the original study suffered from inadequate controls for pre-existing genetic variation in the mice.

**Commercial Impact:**
- Editas Medicine and CRISPR Therapeutics recovered from the stock dips and continued drug development
- The field expanded with additional companies and therapeutic targets
- Significant investment continued flowing into CRISPR-based therapies

**Technological Advances:**
Researchers developed improved Cas variants (like high-fidelity Cas9), better guide RNA design algorithms, and more sophisticated off-target detection methods, addressing the unpredictability concerns raised in 2017.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself made relatively few specific predictions, instead emphasizing caution about drawing premature conclusions. However, the underlying implications and concerns can be evaluated:

- **Implication: CRISPR therapeutics might face major safety obstacles due to unpredictable off-target mutations**
  - **Outcome**: While off-target effects remain an important consideration in CRISPR therapeutics, they have proven manageable. The first FDA-approved CRISPR therapy (CTX001) demonstrated acceptable safety profiles in clinical trials and real-world use. The field successfully developed better prediction tools and modified enzymes to reduce off-target rates.

- **Implication: The study's findings (if valid) would severely impact commercial CRISPR companies**
  - **Outcome**: The initial stock market reaction was dramatic, but both Editas and CRISPR Therapeutics recovered and continued successful development. CRISPR Therapeutics achieved the landmark first approval with CTX001, validating the commercial viability.

- **Implicit concern: The unpredictability of off-target effects would make clinical translation difficult**
  - **Outcome**: Clinical translation proceeded successfully. By 2023, multiple CRISPR therapies were in advanced clinical trials or approved, demonstrating that the scientific community successfully addressed the methodological and safety concerns raised in 2017.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important moment in CRISPR's development - when legitimate scientific concerns about safety needed careful resolution - and smartly highlighted both the concerning results and methodological reasons for skepticism. The episode became a case study in how scientific controversy gets resolved through careful replication and methodological improvement.
