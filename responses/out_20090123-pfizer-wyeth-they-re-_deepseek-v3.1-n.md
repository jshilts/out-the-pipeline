# Pfizer / Wyeth: They're Going to Take Us All Down With Them (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Pfizer's negotiations to acquire Wyeth, which the author notes had been rumored and therefore doesn't come as a complete surprise. The author expresses skepticism about Pfizer's strategy of continuing an "amoeboid lifestyle" through acquisitions, while acknowledging the company may have had limited alternatives. The commentary reflects a critical view of Pfizer's business model, suggesting that the company would likely continue reducing headcount for years rather than expanding organically. The author mentions having shared similar critical views publicly, including in a local newspaper, acknowledging this stance would likely prevent future employment opportunities at Pfizer.

## 2. HISTORY

The Pfizer-Wyeth merger was completed in October 2009 for approximately $68 billion, creating the world's largest pharmaceutical company at the time. The deal did indeed lead to significant job cuts, with Pfizer eliminating roughly 19,000 positions (about 15% of the combined workforce) over several years following the merger.

In terms of drug pipeline outcomes: Wyeth brought important assets including Prevnar 13 (pneumococcal vaccine), which became one of Pfizer's most successful products, and Enbrel (rheumatoid arthritis treatment). However, the merger coincided with the looming patent cliff for Pfizer's blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), which lost patent protection in 2011, causing massive revenue declines.

The merger did not fundamentally solve Pfizer's long-term growth challenges. The company continued pursuing major acquisitions, including the attempted takeover of AstraZeneca in 2014 (which failed) and the successful acquisitions of Hospira in 2015, Medivation in 2016, and eventually the much larger deal with Allergan in 2015 that was later abandoned due to tax inversion rules. Pfizer would go on to acquire Wyeth's nutritional business to Nestlé in 2012 as part of portfolio optimization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Who thinks that Pfizer will be doing anything but shedding head count for several years to come?"** - ✓ Accurate. Pfizer did eliminate approximately 19,000 positions after the Wyeth merger and continued workforce reductions in subsequent restructurings.

• **Implied prediction that the "amoeboid lifestyle" (acquisition strategy) would continue** - ✓ Highly accurate. Pfizer completed multiple major acquisitions after Wyeth: Hospira ($17 billion, 2015), Medivation ($14 billion, 2016), Array BioPharma ($11.4 billion, 2019), and is currently pursuing Seagen ($43 billion, announced 2023).

• **The author's general skepticism about the merger's long-term strategic value** - ✓ Partially validated. While the Wyeth acquisition did bring valuable assets like Prevnar and maintained Pfizer's scale, it didn't resolve the fundamental patent cliff challenges or create sustainable organic growth, leading to continued reliance on major acquisitions through the 2010s and into the 2020s.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The commentary demonstrates foresight about Pfizer's continued reliance on large-scale acquisitions as a business strategy, accurately predicting workforce reductions and the company's ongoing struggles with R&D productivity and patent expirations.
