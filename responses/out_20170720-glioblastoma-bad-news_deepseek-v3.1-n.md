# Glioblastoma Is Bad News, Period (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article explains why Senator John McCain’s glioblastoma (GBM) diagnosis is particularly grim. It contrasts his case with former President Jimmy Carter’s metastatic melanoma, which responded well to immunotherapy (PD-1 inhibitors), by highlighting that GBM remains a much harder problem. The standard of care is the DNA-alkylating chemotherapy temozolomide, a brain‑penetrating prodrug whose active principle resembles dacarbazine and even releases diazomethane‑like species—described as a “primitive” approach that underscores the lack of progress in GBM. Locally implanted carmustine wafers (Gliadel) had not shown clear survival advantage in randomized trials. The article emphasizes GBM’s extreme genomic instability and intra‑tumor heterogeneity as key reasons no single therapy has succeeded, and it mentions a then‑promising preclinical lead: a GSK3 kinase inhibitor combined with radiation.

## 2. HISTORY
Senator McCain died on August 25, 2018, about 13 months after diagnosis, consistent with typical GBM outcomes. Subsequent developments in GBM treatment remained limited; no breakthrough therapy emerged to meaningfully change median overall survival (mOS) in newly diagnosed GBM. 

- **Immunotherapy in GBM did not replicate melanoma’s success**: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) largely failed to show survival benefit in multiple GBM trials. CheckMate-143 (nivolumab vs bevacizumab in recurrent GBM) did not meet its primary endpoint. More recent trials (e.g., CheckMate-498 and CheckMate-548 in newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated and methylated GBM) also failed to demonstrate improved survival.
- **Temozolomide (TMZ) plus radiotherapy** remains the standard first‑line regimen. Efforts to improve it (e.g., dose‑dense TMZ, or tumor‑treating fields) provided modest gains. Tumor‑Treating Fields (Optune) added to TMZ showed a modest survival benefit (~4–5 months mOS improvement), though adoption has been mixed and debated.
- **Gliadel (carmustine wafers)** did not become standard of care, constrained by unclear overall survival benefit outside specific subgroups and procedural risks; use declined over time.
- **GSK3 inhibitor + radiation** did not translate into an approved GBM therapy from the pre‑clinical lead mentioned.
- **No major policy shifts** specific to GBM occurred as a direct result of Senator McCain’s diagnosis. Expanded access to experimental therapies and right‑to‑try remained topics of discussion, but outcomes in GBM did not substantively improve overall.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction that GBM is a “tough” problem unlikely to yield quick breakthroughs**: Accurate. Immunotherapies generally failed in GBM; targeted therapies (e.g., EGFR, VEGF inhibition with bevacizumab) showed transient effects without durable survival gains.
- **Hope that the GSK3 inhibitor + radiation might be efficacious in humans**: Not realized. Published human trials did not confirm survival benefit for GSK3 inhibitors in GBM.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
The article accurately framed GBM’s intractability and contrasted it with melanoma’s immunotherapy success, a lesson underscored by later negative Phase 3 results in GBM spanning PD‑1 inhibitors, vaccine, and other modalities; while no new curative therapies emerged, the piece correctly anticipated the difficulty of making headway in this tumor type.
