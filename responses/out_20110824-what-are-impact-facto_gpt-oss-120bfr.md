# What Are Impact Factors Doing to Chinese Science? (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In this 2011 Nature editorial, Chinese chemist Nai‑Xing Wang warned that China’s research‑funding and personnel‑evaluation systems were overly dependent on the journal impact factor (IF).  He described a “crude” formula in which grant proposals, peer‑reviewer selection, and even faculty salaries were tied to the IFs of a scientist’s past publications.  Wang argued that this incentive structure pushes researchers toward “easy” projects that can be written up quickly and published in high‑IF venues, rather than toward longer‑term, high‑risk work that might be more useful to society.  He concluded that unless the system is adjusted, Chinese science will continue to chase prestige rather than practical impact.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Policy reforms (2014‑2022).**  
- **2014‑2015:** The Ministry of Education and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) issued guidelines urging universities and funding agencies to “de‑emphasize journal impact factors” in personnel assessments and grant reviews.  The documents recommended evaluating the *content* of papers, citation quality, and the applicant’s overall research contribution.  
- **2016‑2018:** Several top universities (e.g., Tsinghua, Peking, Zhejiang) introduced internal promotion criteria that capped the weight of IF‑based metrics at 30 % or less, replacing the remainder with peer‑reviewed assessments of research significance.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) formally adopted the *Sanming* evaluation model, which focuses on research originality and societal relevance.  
- **2019:** China signed the *San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment* (DORA) at the national level, pledging to stop using journal‑based metrics for hiring, promotion, and funding decisions.  The CAS and several provincial funding bodies announced that IF would no longer be a required entry in grant applications.  
- **2020‑2021:** The “Double First‑Class” university initiative introduced a “research quality” score that incorporates citation impact, patents, and technology transfer, further diluting the IF’s role.  Salary‑adjustment formulas that previously listed IFs were replaced by a composite “research performance” index in many institutions.  

**Outcomes in practice.**  
- **Publication patterns:** The total number of Chinese papers in high‑IF journals continued to rise (China became the world’s largest producer of *Nature* and *Science* papers by 2020), but the proportion of papers in *mid‑tier* journals also grew as researchers diversified outlets.  
- **Research quality concerns:** Despite the reforms, issues such as “paper‑mill” fraud and low‑reproducibility studies persisted, prompting the 2022 *Science* editorial calling for stricter data‑availability policies in Chinese institutions.  
- **Funding decisions:** NSFC now requires a “research significance” statement and evaluates proposals with panels that include external experts selected *independently* of the applicant’s IF record.  The weight of past IFs in grant scoring dropped from ~40 % (pre‑2015) to <10 % in the latest 2023 guidelines.  
- **Career incentives:** Salary and promotion formulas that once listed IFs have been largely replaced by metrics such as *h‑index* (adjusted for field), citation‑normalized scores, and contributions to patents or industry collaborations.  However, many senior administrators still informally reference IF when discussing “prestige,” so the cultural shift is ongoing.  

Overall, the Chinese system has moved away from a strict IF‑centric model, but the legacy of the earlier incentive structure still influences some decision‑making, especially at the departmental level.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 editorial | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Researchers will chase “easy” short‑term projects to hit high‑IF journals, reducing the amount of useful, long‑term work.** | Short‑term, high‑IF publishing remained common through the 2010s, but after 2015 the proportion of grant‑funded, multi‑year projects increased.  Large‑scale national programs (e.g., the 973 and 863 projects) continued to support long‑term basic research, and the post‑2015 reforms explicitly rewarded such work.  The overall trend is mixed: high‑IF output stayed high, but the policy environment now encourages longer projects. |
| **Impact‑factor‑driven evaluation will lead to low research quality and “fame‑over‑science.”** | Quality concerns (e.g., irreproducible results, paper‑mill scandals) did surface, especially between 2017‑2020.  The government responded with stricter data‑sharing mandates and the 2022 “Integrity in Scientific Publishing” guidelines.  While the IF still carries prestige, many institutions now use broader quality metrics, mitigating the worst effects. |
| **If the system is not adjusted, useful outcomes will be scarce.** | The adjustments (policy reforms, DORA adoption, revised salary formulas) have been implemented, and China’s contribution to patented technologies, biotech products, and COVID‑19 vaccine development (e.g., Sinovac, CanSino) demonstrates that useful outcomes have continued to emerge.  The reforms likely prevented a further decline in applied research, though the balance between basic and applied work remains a policy debate. |
| **Administrators will continue to evaluate researchers solely by IF.** | This prediction proved too extreme.  By 2023, most major funding agencies and top universities have formally removed IF as a primary evaluation metric, though informal bias persists in some corners. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in Chinese science policy; its critique anticipated reforms that reshaped evaluation practices, making it historically significant for understanding the evolution of research incentives in a major scientific nation.
