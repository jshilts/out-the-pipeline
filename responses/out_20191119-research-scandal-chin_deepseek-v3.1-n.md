# A Research Scandal in China (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article discusses a major research integrity scandal involving Xuetao Cao, a prominent Chinese researcher who served as head of China's Research Integrity initiative, former head of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and president of Nankai University. The scandal emerged when over 50 papers co-authored by Cao were flagged on PubPeer for containing duplicated images, including manipulated Western blots and microscopy images across multiple publications spanning many years.

The situation was particularly sensitive because Cao had recently given a mandatory live-streamed address on research integrity to thousands of researchers across China from the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, just as evidence of problematic papers from his own laboratory was surfacing. The article notes that Cao publicly apologized on PubPeer, acknowledging lapses in supervision while maintaining confidence in the scientific conclusions. The author draws parallels between mandatory corporate compliance training and China's top-down approach to research ethics, suggesting both are ineffective when leadership fails to model appropriate behavior.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the publication of this article, the Xuetao Cao case evolved into one of the most significant research misconduct scandals in Chinese scientific history:

**Immediate Consequences (2019-2020):**
- Cao's laboratory underwent extensive investigations by multiple Chinese institutions
- Nankai University, where Cao served as president, conducted its own internal review
- Many of the flagged papers underwent corrections or retractions, though the process was gradual

**Longer-term Impact (2020-2022):**
- Cao stepped down from his position leading China's Research Integrity initiative
- The scandal prompted broader discussions within China about research oversight and integrity systems
- China's Ministry of Science and Technology and other regulatory bodies strengthened research integrity policies and enforcement mechanisms

**Broader Consequences:**
- The case became a landmark example in discussions about research integrity globally
- It led to increased scrutiny of Chinese research publications in international journals
- Chinese universities and research institutions implemented more rigorous internal review processes
- The scandal contributed to ongoing reforms in how China approaches scientific research oversight

**Individual Outcomes:**
- Cao remained at Nankai University but with reduced public roles in national research policy
- The extensive PubPeer discussion continued, with additional papers being flagged over time
- Many co-authors on the problematic papers faced career repercussions

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations that can be evaluated:

• **"The government may be prepared to throw Cao under the bus"** - **Accurate**: Chinese authorities did allow significant coverage of the scandal and Cao faced substantial consequences, though not complete professional destruction. The government's response suggested they recognized the damage to China's scientific reputation.

• **The "foreign forces discrediting Chinese research" angle wouldn't be the main response** - **Mostly Accurate**: While some nationalist voices used this framing, the mainstream response focused on addressing the actual integrity issues rather than dismissing them as external attacks.

• **Implicit prediction that heavy-handed mandatory training wouldn't solve fundamental integrity issues** - **Accurate**: The subsequent years showed that China continued grappling with research integrity challenges despite increased training and oversight programs, suggesting the problem required deeper systemic solutions beyond top-down mandates.

• **The reputation damage to Chinese research** - **Accurate**: The scandal contributed to increased skepticism about Chinese research publications internationally, though it also prompted meaningful reforms within China's scientific establishment.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a significant research integrity case that had lasting implications for China's scientific reputation and policy. While the specific scandal involved one individual, it exemplified broader systemic challenges in research oversight and had measurable impact on both Chinese science policy and international perceptions.
