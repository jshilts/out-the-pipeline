# What STEM Shortage? Where? How? (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article challenged the widespread narrative that the U.S. faced a crippling shortage of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) workers. Published in Science's blog in January 2014, it pointed to specific employment data showing that fields like chemistry and electrical engineering were experiencing job losses and limited growth, contradicting constant headlines about STEM shortages. The piece highlighted a 10% decline in employed electrical engineers, modest software developer job growth, and elevated unemployment rates for developers at 2.7%. The author questioned whether claims of STEM shortages reflected reality or served the interests of companies seeking cheaper labor through H-1B visas, industry lobbying groups like PhRMA, technology executives like Mark Zuckerberg, and educational institutions benefiting from increased STEM enrollment. The core argument suggested a disconnect between public rhetoric about STEM shortages and actual labor market conditions, raising the question of whether the issue was truly a lack of skilled workers or rather a shortage of inexpensive skilled labor.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 article, the STEM workforce debate continued to evolve with mixed outcomes that partially validated both sides of the argument. The tech industry experienced unprecedented growth from 2014-2021, with software developer employment expanding significantly beyond the modest 1.75% growth cited in the article. However, the pattern of offshoring and H-1B visa utilization that the author questioned continued, with major tech companies maintaining substantial visa programs.

The broader STEM educational pipeline did not contract as might have been expected if the shortage narrative was entirely false. Instead, STEM degree production increased, and computer science enrollments surged at universities. Yet employment outcomes varied dramatically by subfield—while software engineering and data science saw strong demand and compensation growth, traditional chemistry and some engineering disciplines faced persistently challenging job markets, validating the article's caution against treating "STEM" as monolithic.

The COVID-19 pandemic created new dynamics, with accelerated digital transformation driving increased demand for tech workers while also normalizing remote work and global talent competition. By the 2022-2024 period, major tech companies faced significant layoffs for the first time in years, suggesting that boom periods could be cyclical rather than indicating permanent shortages. Policy discussions around H-1B reforms and STEM education funding continued throughout this period, reflecting ongoing tensions between industry demands and worker advocates about whether shortages were genuine or manufactured.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Predicted continuation of electrical engineering job decline**: The article noted a 10% drop in employed electrical engineers. While some traditional EE roles faced challenges, the field adapted with growth areas in power electronics, embedded systems, and semiconductor design, though not at dot-com boom levels.
- **Predicted modest software developer job growth**: The article cited only 1.75% growth for software developers. This proved significantly underestimated as the 2014-2021 period saw explosive growth in software engineering jobs, though with notable volatility and layoffs in 2022-2024.
- **Predicted continued disconnect between industry claims and labor market reality**: This largely persisted, with technology companies and industry groups continuing to promote STEM shortage narratives while simultaneously conducting mass layoffs during economic downturns and maintaining controversial visa programs.
- **Predicted ongoing H-1B visa utilization patterns**: The article's concerns about H-1B visa programs continued, with major technology companies remaining among the largest users of H-1B visas throughout 2014-2024, though policy debates and some reforms occurred.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article captured a prescient skepticism about STEM shortage narratives that proved increasingly relevant as the debate evolved, correctly identifying tensions between industry rhetoric and labor market realities while offering a nuanced view that avoided treating diverse STEM fields as monolithic.
