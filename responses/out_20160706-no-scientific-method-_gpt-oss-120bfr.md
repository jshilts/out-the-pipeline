# No Scientific Method, They Say (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The opinion piece argues that the phrase “scientific method” is misleading because systematic inquiry is not unique to science. The author, philosophy professor James Blachowicz, likens the stages of scientific investigation to the creative process of writing a poem and to the Socratic definition of abstract concepts such as “courage.” He contends that science’s reliability stems from dealing with highly quantified variables rather than from any superior methodological principle. The article also downplays the historical novelty of experimental isolation of variables, suggesting that systematic investigation has always been a default human habit. The writer concludes that treating ideas and physical objects as interchangeable is “bizarre” and that the notion of a distinct scientific method is, at best, a convenient shorthand.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since the article’s publication, the broader conversation about what constitutes a “scientific method” has continued, but the piece itself has left little trace in scholarly or policy circles. The most notable developments in the relevant arena are:

* **Reproducibility crisis (2010s‑2020s).**  Across the life‑sciences, psychology, and some areas of physics, large‑scale replication projects (e.g., the Open Science Collaboration’s 2015 psychology replication, the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, 2018‑2020) highlighted that merely following a checklist of steps does not guarantee reliable results. This reinforced the view that methodological rigor—pre‑registration, transparent data sharing, statistical best practices—is essential, supporting the article’s claim that “quantified precision” matters more than a vague “method.”

* **Rise of “open science” practices.**  Funding agencies (NIH, EU Horizon Europe) and journals have instituted policies requiring data availability, code sharing, and preregistration. These institutional changes treat the scientific method as a set of concrete, enforceable practices rather than an abstract philosophical notion, aligning with the article’s emphasis on measurable variables.

* **Philosophy of science scholarship.**  Recent textbooks (e.g., *Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction*, 2022) and histories (e.g., *The Invention of Science* by David Wootton, 2015) continue to stress that modern experimental methodology is a relatively recent cultural development. No major revision of that narrative has emerged since 2016.

* **Public discourse.**  The New York Times opinion piece was cited sporadically in blog posts and philosophy‑of‑science forums, but it did not spark a lasting debate or policy shift. The discussion of “no scientific method” remains a niche philosophical argument rather than a mainstream scientific concern.

Overall, the article’s central claim—that systematic inquiry is not exclusive to science—remains philosophically defensible, while the practical emphasis on quantification and reproducibility has become even more pronounced in the years after 2016.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not lay out explicit, testable predictions, but it implies two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Science’s reliability will continue to rest on quantifiable variables rather than on any special “method.”** | The reproducibility crisis and subsequent open‑science reforms have indeed shown that reliability hinges on transparent measurement, statistical rigor, and data sharing—not on a mystical method. |
| **Systematic, experimental investigation is a recent cultural invention, not an ancient universal habit.** | Historical scholarship (e.g., Wootton’s work, later reviews in *Isis* and *British Journal for the History of Science*) continues to affirm that modern experimental protocols emerged in the 16th–17th centuries. No new evidence has overturned this view. |

Both implied predictions have held up; the empirical record supports the author’s historical claim and the practical importance of quantification.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10** – The article raises a classic philosophy‑of‑science point that is intellectually tidy but has had minimal impact on scientific practice, policy, or subsequent scholarly debate. Its relevance is modest, and it is largely of niche interest to philosophers and occasional blog readers.
