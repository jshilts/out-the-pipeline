# Avandia: Trouble, Run Head to Head (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a retrospective study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine comparing cardiovascular safety outcomes between Avandia (rosiglitazone) and Actos (pioglitazone) in approximately 14,000 Medicare patients aged 65+ from 2000-2005. The study found that Avandia patients had a 15% higher all-cause mortality rate and 13% higher heart failure rate compared to Actos patients, though no significant differences were observed in strokes or heart attacks (though the authors noted potential undercounting of these events). Both drugs are PPAR-gamma agonists used to treat Type II diabetes with similar mechanisms of action but nuanced differences in gene transcription effects.

The author notes that while GlaxoSmithKline disputed these findings and called for randomized clinical trials, no head-to-head trials had been conducted between the two drugs. The article suggests both manufacturers likely avoided comparative trials due to expense and uncertainty about demonstrating meaningful differences in efficacy, while potentially exposing safety concerns. This retrospective comparison represented the best available evidence at the time for comparing the drugs' safety profiles.

## 2. HISTORY

**Regulatory Actions and Market Impact:**
- **September 2010**: FDA significantly restricted Avandia use, requiring a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program limiting the drug to patients who couldn't control their diabetes with other medications
- **November 2011**: FDA further strengthened label warnings based on accumulating cardiovascular safety data
- **May 2011**: Avandia was suspended in Europe by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
- **2013**: GSK settled approximately 50,000 lawsuits related to Avandia for around $700 million
- **November 2015**: FDA lifted some restrictions after reviewing additional data, though the drug's use remained highly limited

**Clinical Trial Evidence:**
The RECORD trial (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes), a randomized controlled trial published after this article, showed mixed results but ultimately contributed to regulatory restrictions. Meta-analyses continued to show increased cardiovascular risk with rosiglitazone.

**Market Outcomes:**
- Avandia sales plummeted from peak annual revenues of approximately $3 billion to minimal sales following restrictions
- Actos (pioglitazone) faced its own safety concerns, including bladder cancer warnings from the FDA in 2011, but remained on the market with warnings
- The controversy contributed to increased FDA scrutiny of diabetes drug cardiovascular safety and influenced regulatory approaches to post-market surveillance

**Research Impact:**
The Avandia controversy accelerated development of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) for diabetes drugs. Newer diabetes medications (GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors) now routinely include cardiovascular safety assessments in their development programs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Implicit prediction that retrospective observational data would be the best rosi-to-pio comparison available**
- **Outcome**: ACCURATE. While the RECORD randomized trial was eventually completed and published, it had design limitations and controversies. Post-marketing observational studies and meta-analyses remained crucial evidence for regulatory decisions. No definitive head-to-head randomized trial was ever conducted between the two drugs.

**• Implicit prediction that GSK would "have to live with" unfavorable safety data**
- **Outcome**: ACCURATE. Despite GSK's ongoing defense of Avandia's safety profile, regulatory restrictions, market withdrawal in Europe, and massive litigation settlements demonstrated that the company ultimately had to accept the accumulating evidence of cardiovascular risks.

**• Implicit prediction about absence of manufacturer-sponsored head-to-head trials**
- **Outcome**: ACCURATE. No manufacturer-sponsored head-to-head randomized trial comparing Avandia and Actos was ever conducted. The closest approximation was independent meta-analyses and observational studies, confirming the author's skepticism about industry willingness to pursue such comparisons.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient analysis of pharmaceutical safety controversies and correctly anticipated that retrospective data would drive regulatory outcomes despite industry resistance. The Avandia case became a landmark example of post-market drug safety evaluation, fundamentally influencing regulatory approaches to diabetes drug approval and monitoring.
