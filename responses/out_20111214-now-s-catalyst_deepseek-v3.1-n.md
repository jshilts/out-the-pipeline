# Now That's A Catalyst (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" commentary discusses an unusual chemical catalyst. Lowe references his earlier post about uranium catalysts and shares a paper forwarded by Ben Warner from Los Alamos National Laboratory about using plutonium as a catalyst for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction reaction - an alternative to the more commonly used aluminum compounds. The tone is humorous and ironic, with Lowe joking that "uranium (III) just doesn't cut it" compared to plutonium.

## 2. HISTORY
The Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction is a well-established method for reducing carbonyl compounds that has existed since the 1920s, typically using aluminum or other main-group metal catalysts. The Los Alamos research mentioned in this 2011 post explored actinide elements (uranium, plutonium) as exotic alternatives. After 2011, there is no evidence that plutonium-catalyzed MPV reductions entered widespread laboratory use or became a standard method in organic synthesis. The safety, regulatory, and cost barriers to using plutonium in routine chemical synthesis are prohibitive. The MPV reaction itself remains a known but somewhat niche transformation, largely superseded by more modern reducing agents like borohydrides and aluminum hydrides for practical applications. No commercial drugs or industrial processes resulted from this plutonium catalysis approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments, applications, or market impact. The tone was clearly meant as chemical humor rather than a serious research forecast.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 1**

This ranks in the bottom 10-20% of interest because it's essentially a humorous chemical curiosity with no practical implications, no follow-up research impact, and no broader relevance to biotechnology or drug development.
