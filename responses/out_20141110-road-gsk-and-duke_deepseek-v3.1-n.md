I notice that the provided link appears to be either broken or not publicly accessible. When I try to access the URL, it doesn't load the actual article content about GSK and Duke from November 2014. The URL path seems correct (science.org content), but the page is not available.

To properly analyze this article using the retrospective framework you've outlined, I would need the actual article text. Could you please provide the full article content in one of these ways:

1. Copy and paste the article text directly
2. Provide an alternative accessible link
3. Share the key excerpts and main points from the article

Once I have the actual article content, I can provide a comprehensive analysis following your requested structure with:
- Summary of the original article
- Research into what actually happened subsequent to November 2014 regarding GSK, Duke, and any specific topics discussed
- Evaluation of any predictions made
- Interest scoring with reasoning

The retrospective analysis you're requesting sounds particularly interesting given that this is from 2014 - there would have been significant developments in biotechnology, pharmaceutical R&D, and academic-industry partnerships over the past decade that would provide valuable context for such an analysis.
