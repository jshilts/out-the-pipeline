# Secretin (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
This January 2004 commentary discusses secretin, a pancreatic signaling peptide, as a potential autism treatment. The interest began in 1996 when Parker Beck, an autistic boy from New Hampshire, showed apparent symptom improvement after receiving secretin during GI diagnostics. This anecdotal success sparked intense interest among parents of autistic children, given the lack of established autism therapies.

The article describes how Parker Beck's mother became a patent holder for secretin as an autism treatment, licensing it to Repligen, a small biotech company. While early anecdotal reports were mixed, the scientific rationale wasn't unreasonable—many autistic patients exhibit GI abnormalities, secretin is present in the brain, and brain-gut connections are well-established. However, multiple clinical trials, including Repligen's Phase II studies, failed to show convincing efficacy. The author notes that the largest trial to date (Phase III) had just reported nearly completely negative results, with only marginal hints of benefit in higher-functioning autism subgroups—the kind of post-hoc analysis that typically represents statistical noise rather than genuine effect.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2004 article, the secretin story played out largely as predicted. Repligen continued their clinical development, but subsequent trials consistently failed to demonstrate meaningful efficacy for autism. The FDA never approved secretin for autism treatment, and by the late 2000s, mainstream medical consensus concluded that secretin was not an effective autism therapy.

The scientific community largely moved on from secretin research, though some parents continued pursuing it through alternative channels. Research attention shifted toward other potential autism mechanisms and interventions. Importantly, this episode became a cautionary tale in autism research about the gap between anecdotal reports and rigorous scientific validation.

Repligen, the biotech company mentioned, eventually pivoted away from secretin for autism and shifted focus to other therapeutic areas. The company found success in different domains, particularly in rare disease and oncology drug development, but not with secretin as an autism treatment.

During the 2000s and beyond, larger and more comprehensive studies continued to show no significant benefit of secretin for autism core symptoms. Professional organizations like the American Academy of Neurology and the American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines stating that secretin should not be used for autism treatment due to lack of evidence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several specific predictions and observations about secretin's future:

• **Prediction that desperate parents would continue trying secretin despite negative trials**: This proved accurate. Even after conclusive negative trials, some families continued seeking secretin treatments through alternative providers, spending significant sums on unproven therapy.

• **Observation that post-hoc subgroup analysis showing hints of efficacy in higher-functioning patients was "almost always noise"**: This proved prescient. Subsequent research confirmed that these subgroup findings did not hold up under rigorous investigation, and no reliable way to identify secretin-responsive autism subgroups was ever established.

• **Prediction that suppliers would continue providing secretin as long as a market existed**: This was accurate. Compounded secretin and related products remained available through various channels for years, despite lack of scientific support.

• **Concern that commercial interests would outweigh scientific evidence**: This prediction was validated as various clinics and compounding pharmacies continued marketing secretin-based treatments to vulnerable families.

• **The larger implicit prediction that secretin would prove ineffective for autism**: This was completely validated. The drug consistently failed in rigorous clinical trials and never gained FDA approval or acceptance in evidence-based autism treatment.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article merits high interest because it represents a classic case study of how promising anecdotal evidence in desperate populations can diverge sharply from rigorous scientific validation. The secretin episode became a textbook example in autism research and drug development of the critical importance of controlled clinical trials, and it foreshadowed many similar controversies in the autism treatment landscape where parental desperation meets unproven interventions.
