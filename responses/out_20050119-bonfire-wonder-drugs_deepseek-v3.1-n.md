# Bonfire of the Wonder Drugs (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the academic publishing landscape in medicinal chemistry circa 2005. The author discusses journal selection strategies, focusing on the contrast between *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* (J. Med. Chem.) and newer competitors like *Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters* (BOMCL). The central gripe is that J. Med. Chem. insists on combustion analysis (CHN analysis) for compound characterization in full papers—a time-consuming and resource-intensive requirement the author considers outdated for drug discovery workflows. In industrial settings, teams rely instead on faster methods like NMR, HPLC, and mass spectrometry to characterize compounds for patents and project decisions. The author notes J. Med. Chem. had begun loosening requirements (allowing alternatives like high-resolution MS or dual-HPLC), but still found the combustion analysis demand a cumbersome bottleneck. The piece frames the friction between traditional analytical purity standards and the practical pace of drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

**Publishing & data standards:** In the years following 2005, J. Med. Chem. further relaxed its analytical requirements, and combustion analysis ceased to be a strict prerequisite. Many journals in medicinal chemistry and organic chemistry moved toward accepting modern spectroscopic and chromatographic data as sufficient for characterization. High-quality NMR and HRMS became standard evidence of compound identity and purity in industrial and academic publications.

**Industrial workflow impact:** NMR, HPLC, and mass spectrometry remained—and remain today—the core techniques for routine compound characterization in medicinal chemistry teams. Combustion analysis is not routinely applied in day-to-day drug discovery due to time, cost, and sample-amount constraints. The author's implicit prediction that these practical methods would persist has been validated by mainstream practice.

**Regulatory and IP context:** Patent offices and regulatory agencies (including the FDA) widely accept modern analytical data for compound identification and purity. Countries previously cited as outliers gradually aligned with internationally recognized characterization standards, though I lack confident specifics on Taiwan's exact timeline; in general, modern spectroscopic methods became globally acceptable for patent applications.

**Broader research trends:** The decade that followed saw accelerated timelines in drug discovery, with a premium on rapid synthesis and testing (including high-throughput synthesis and screening). Workflow efficiency became paramount, favoring analytical methods that fit iterative design–make–test cycles. Combustion analysis remained valuable in niche contexts (e.g., confirming solvates, hydrates, or for specific regulatory or academic purity benchmarks), but it did not become a routine, project-wide requirement in discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"I'll let the combustion lab do the work: if I'm going to be sending J. Med. Chem. anything this year, I'd better start getting ready for a Wonder Drug Barbecue."**
  - **Outcome:** Combustion analysis did not become a widespread bottleneck or "barbecue" of drug candidates. Journals grew more flexible, and industrial workflows largely bypassed the technique for routine compound characterization. Drug discovery continued to rely on NMR, HPLC, and MS, and the "bonfire" scenario did not materialize at scale.

- **"I won't be sending any of this year's papers to [Science, Nature, Cell]"**
  - **Outcome:** This was personal to the author's output that year; no broader prediction was made about the field's trajectory or publishing strategies.

- **Implicit prediction about journal competition:**
  - **Outcome:** Competitor journals (including BMC and others) continued to attract industrial and academic contributions with streamlined review and submission models. J. Med. Chem. adapted its requirements over time to remain competitive, validating the author's implied view that inflexible standards would push submitters elsewhere.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This piece captures a niche, institution-specific friction around analytical standards in 2005-era drug discovery publishing rather than a long-term, transformative trend in biotech or pharmaceutical science. Its interest is largely historical and process-oriented rather than broadly scientific.
