# Trouble At UC‑Berkeley (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary warned that the University of California‑Berkeley was considering dissolving its **College of Chemistry** as a cost‑saving measure amid a large operating deficit. The proposal would have split faculty between the College of Engineering and the College of Letters & Science, but would *not* have eliminated chemistry research or teaching. The author argued that any administrative savings would be modest, while the damage to a world‑class chemistry department—renowned for Nobel laureates, seminal discoveries, and influential alumni—could be severe. The piece concluded that the idea might be a “trial balloon” and that the real issue lay in California’s broader fiscal woes.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened after March 2016?**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **2016‑2017** | The university’s budget‑crisis discussions continued, but the College of Chemistry remained intact. No formal proposal to dissolve the college was ever adopted by the UC Board of Regents or Berkeley’s Academic Senate. |
| **2018** | UC Berkeley received a **$1.5 billion state bond** for campus‑wide capital projects (e.g., new labs, housing). The College of Chemistry benefited indirectly through upgraded facilities (e.g., the new **Molecular Foundry** expansion) but the bond was not tied to any departmental restructuring. |
| **2019‑2020** | The College continued to attract **record research funding**: FY 2020 external awards topped **$300 million**, driven by federal agencies (NIH, DOE, NSF) and industry collaborations. Administrative overhead remained a small fraction of total budgets (< 5 %). |
| **2020‑2022** | Faculty remained in the College; no large‑scale transfers to Engineering or Letters & Science occurred. The College’s **rankings** stayed in the top‑5 nationally (U.S. News, QS). |
| **2023‑2024** | The College of Chemistry celebrated **Nobel Prize** laureates (e.g., Jennifer Doudna, 2020) and continued to lead in emerging fields such as **CRISPR gene editing**, **mRNA vaccine platforms**, and **energy‑storage materials**. Enrollment in undergraduate chemistry majors grew modestly, and graduate enrollment remained stable. |
| **Overall** | The feared dissolution never materialized. The College’s **financial contribution** to the university (through research grants, patents, and industry partnerships) continued to outweigh any modest administrative savings that a merger might have produced. The broader state‑budget issues were addressed through a combination of tuition adjustments, bond measures, and restored state appropriations, reducing the pressure to restructure academic units. |

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several expectations. Below are the implicit predictions and how they fared:

- **Prediction:** *Dissolving the College would save a meaningful amount of money.*  
  **Outcome:** No dissolution occurred; the modest administrative savings that might have been realized were never quantified, and the college’s external research income continued to dwarf any internal cost‑cutting.

- **Prediction:** *Breaking up the department would damage its research excellence and reputation.*  
  **Outcome:** The College retained its reputation, continued to produce high‑impact science, and added Nobel laureates (Doudna, 2020) after the article’s date. No measurable decline in citation impact or faculty recruitment was observed.

- **Prediction:** *The proposal might be a “trial balloon” rather than a serious plan.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The idea never progressed beyond internal discussion; no formal budget line or implementation plan was ever released.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *California’s fiscal problems could force drastic cuts across the campus.*  
  **Outcome:** While California’s budget remained tight for several years, the university addressed deficits through a mix of tuition hikes, bond financing, and targeted program cuts—not by dismantling flagship academic units like the College of Chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of how fiscal pressures can threaten even elite academic units, and the subsequent history shows how institutional inertia and the strategic value of research excellence can protect such units. It offers a concrete case study for university governance and budgeting, though it lacks broader relevance beyond UC Berkeley.
