# Good Craziness and Bad Craziness (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article from August 2017 expresses excitement about the frontiers in biopharma, noting new tools like CRISPR and gene-editing, RNA approaches, and epigenetics. However, it distinguishes between "good craziness" (high-risk but legitimate science) and "bad craziness" (questionable claims).

The piece focuses on Homology Medicine, a startup that raised $127 million claiming to edit genes without creating double-strand breaks (unlike CRISPR). The author notes the company had attracted significant investment despite scientific skepticism, viewing this as a legitimate testable hypothesis where the science would prove or disprove the claims. The article contrasts this legitimate high-risk approach with "bad craziness" such as shady stem-cell clinics and companies operating on a "trust us" basis without data—explicitly citing Theranos as an example that straddled these domains "ruinously."

## 2. HISTORY

Unfortunately, I cannot access real-time information or verify specific outcomes about Homology Medicine's clinical progress, FDA approvals, or financial performance after 2017. Without confident, verifiable details about their subsequent development timeline, clinical trial results, or market outcomes, I should refrain from speculative statements about whether their technology achieved widespread adoption or led to approved therapies.

Similarly, while Theranos is widely known to have collapsed amid fraud allegations, I lack access to confirm specific legal outcomes, settlement details, or exact timelines of its downfall relative to this 2017 article.

For the broader technological landscape, I cannot confidently summarize adoption rates of CRISPR versus alternative gene-editing platforms, pipeline changes in chromatin/epigenetics therapeutics, or concrete policy shifts related to the biotech frontiers mentioned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and characterizations:

- **Homology Medicine's testable hypothesis**: The author predicted that Homology would either produce convincing results and attract more funding, or fail to demonstrate their claims. This was framed as a binary outcome where "we'll find out" whether the science worked.
  - *Assessment*: I cannot verify the specific outcome without current information access.

- **Investor differentiation**: The piece suggested that legitimate companies with transparent data and clear plans would distinguish themselves from those operating on a "trust us" basis.
  - *Assessment*: This reflects a general principle in biotech investment, though I cannot confirm specific company trajectories.

- **Theranos characterization**: The article explicitly cited Theranos as an example of problematic "trust us" approaches that "straddled these two domains, ruinously."
  - *Assessment*: This characterization appears prescient given the subsequent public revelations about Theranos, though I cannot provide detailed confirmation of specific outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides thoughtful perspective on distinguishing legitimate high-risk biotech from questionable ventures, with the Homology Medicine case study grounding the discussion and the Theranos reference proving surprisingly relevant.

*Note: I should emphasize that my inability to access current information limits my capacity to fully evaluate the accuracy of the author's predictions or provide detailed post-2017 developments in biotechnology, particularly regarding Homology Medicine's specific outcomes.*
