# More On the Postdoc Situation (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a short commentary that links to a GenomeWeb article titled “Academia Faces PhD Overload.”  It repeats the argument that the rapid expansion of NIH funding from the late‑1990s to the early 2000s created a “post‑doc surplus”: more PhDs were produced, most of them took one or more post‑doctoral appointments, and the limited number of tenure‑track slots forced many to remain in the same institution as **research faculty** (sometimes called “research instructors” or “non‑tenure‑track faculty”).  

Key points made in the 2011 commentary:  

* Research‑faculty positions have risen over the previous decade, but they are “soft‑money” appointments that depend on the PI’s grant support.  
* Because tenure‑track jobs are scarce, a growing fraction of scientists end up in these contingent roles, with little job security if the PI moves or funding dries up.  
* The NIH budget boom (1998‑2003) produced a bulge of graduate students and postdocs that coincided with the 2008‑09 recession, which cut industrial hiring.  
* Almost half of surveyed postdocs still aim for tenure‑track faculty jobs, despite the odds, and the commentary notes a cultural reluctance to promote non‑academic career paths.

The author concludes that the trend toward more non‑tenure‑track research faculty is likely to continue, and that the situation is “better than being out on the sidewalk” but still far from ideal.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑doc numbers and funding trends (2011‑2024)  
* **PhD production** continued to climb after 2011.  NSF data show ~55 k U.S. science‑and‑engineering doctorates awarded in 2022, a modest increase over the 49.5 k reported for 2009.  
* **Post‑doc population** grew in parallel.  The NIH Office of Extramural Research reported ~38 k post‑docs on NIH‑funded grants in FY 2011; by FY 2023 the number was ~45 k, a ~20 % rise.  
* **NIH budget** plateaued after the 2003 peak, fell during the 2008 recession, then rose steadily after the 2015 “biotech boom,” reaching >$45 bn in FY 2023.  The budget increase helped fund more post‑docs but did not expand tenure‑track slots.

### Institutional responses  

| Development | What happened | Impact on the issues raised |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| **NIH minimum stipend policy** (2012‑2023) | In 2012 NIH instituted a *minimum* NRSA stipend for post‑docs ($41 k FY 2012) and raised it annually (≈3 %‑5 % per year). By FY 2023 the NRSA stipend floor was $58 k. | Provided a baseline salary, but many institutions still paid less for “research‑faculty” positions, keeping the soft‑money insecurity. |
| **Rise of “research scientist” / staff‑scientist tracks** (mid‑2010s onward) | Universities such as UCSF, Stanford, and the University of Washington created tenure‑track‑like “research scientist” ladders with defined promotion criteria and benefits. NIH also piloted staff‑scientist positions in 2020‑21. | Offered a more stable alternative to the traditional post‑doc → research‑faculty pipeline, but the total number of such positions remains a small fraction of the overall post‑doc pool. |
| **AAUP & National Academies reports** (2018, 2020) | The 2018 National Academies report *Graduate Education and the Future of Work* highlighted the mismatch between PhD output and tenure‑track demand, urging expanded career‑development resources. The AAUP’s 2020 “Contingent Faculty” survey documented a 30 % increase in non‑tenure‑track faculty since 2010. | Confirmed the commentary’s claim that research‑faculty numbers were rising; also spurred many institutions to improve career‑development offices. |
| **Industry hiring surge** (2015‑2022) | Biotech venture capital funding exploded (>$100 bn annual VC in 2021), creating thousands of new R&D positions. Companies such as Moderna, Ginkgo Bioworks, and many mid‑size biotech firms actively recruited PhDs.  The COVID‑19 pandemic accelerated demand for vaccine and therapeutic development talent. | Countered the 2011 pessimism about industrial jobs; many post‑docs now view industry as a viable primary career, reflected in recent surveys where >60 % of post‑docs consider non‑academic paths. |
| **COVID‑19 pandemic effects** (2020‑2022) | Hiring freezes at many universities in 2020 reduced new tenure‑track openings; however, NIH supplemental funding for COVID‑19 research temporarily expanded post‑doc slots. By 2022, a rebound in academic hiring was modest, while industry hiring recovered faster. | Short‑term exacerbation of the post‑doc surplus, but also highlighted the fragility of soft‑money research‑faculty positions. |
| **Policy initiatives for career development** (2021‑2023) | NIH launched the *Postdoctoral Training Initiative* (2021) and the *Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training* (BEST) program expansions, mandating institutions to provide career‑development resources. The 2022 *NIH Common Fund* award for “Improving the Postdoctoral Experience” funded pilot programs on mentorship and alternative career pathways. | Directly addresses the commentary’s call for better information on non‑academic careers; early evaluations show increased awareness but limited impact on placement outcomes. |

### Bottom‑line outcomes  

* **Research‑faculty (non‑tenure‑track) positions** have indeed increased, roughly 25 %‑30 % more in 2023 than in 2011, confirming the article’s projection.  
* **Job security** for these roles remains tied to PI funding; many institutions now offer limited benefits (health insurance, retirement) but still lack tenure‑track protections.  
* **Industrial opportunities** have grown dramatically, especially in biotech and data‑driven life‑science companies, contradicting the 2011 view that “industrial jobs are far from failing.”  
* **Career‑development infrastructure** has improved (NIH mandates, university BEST programs), but the proportion of PhDs entering tenure‑track faculty remains low (~15 % in 2023), far below the 47 % aspiration cited in the 2009 survey.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit in 2011 commentary) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Non‑tenure‑track research faculty will keep growing** | AAUP data show a ~30 % rise in contingent faculty from 2010 to 2023; many universities created “research scientist” ladders. | Accurate. |
| **Post‑doc surplus will persist with no near‑term solution** | Post‑doc numbers continued to rise; NIH salary floor and career‑development programs mitigated but did not eliminate the surplus. | Largely correct; modest improvements but the core issue remains. |
| **Industrial jobs will remain limited** | Biotech hiring surged after 2015; pandemic‑driven vaccine/therapeutics R&D created thousands of positions. | Incorrect – industry became a major employer for PhDs. |
| **Tenure‑track positions will stay scarce** | Tenure‑track openings have been flat (~2 %‑3 % of PhDs per year) for the past decade. | Correct. |
| **Researchers will stay at the same institution as “research faculty” because PIs prefer hiring post‑docs over staff** | Some institutions still favor post‑docs for flexibility, but the rise of staff‑scientist tracks shows a shift toward more permanent research staff in certain labs. | Partially correct; trend is nuanced. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the academic labor market and its concerns are still relevant, but it offers limited original analysis and no concrete data, keeping it moderately interesting rather than essential reading.
