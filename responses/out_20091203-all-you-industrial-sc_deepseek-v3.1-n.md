# All Of You Industrial Scientists: Out Of the Room (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2009 commentary addresses new accreditation policies by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) that prohibited continuing education (CE) providers from involving scientists employed by commercial/industry organizations in educational programming. 

The author highlights a letter from the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ASCPT) explaining that these 2006 policies, implemented in January 2009, required CE activities to be "independent of any commercial interest, including presentation by industry scientists." Since nearly 50% of ASCPT's membership were industry scientists who contributed significantly to their annual meeting programming, the organization faced an impossible choice: either eliminate CE credit and continue involving industry scientists, or maintain CE accreditation by excluding half their membership from presenting or participating in planning. ASCPT chose to stop offering CE credit for their 2009 meeting and anticipated difficulties providing CE in the future. The author argues this blanket exclusion wrongly assumes all industry participation constitutes inappropriate influence, lamenting the loss of legitimate scientific expertise from clinical pharmacologists and researchers who happen to work in industry.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2009 article, significant developments occurred regarding industry participation in continuing medical education:

**Policy Evolution (2010-2020):**
ACCME's 2006 "Standards for Commercial Support" represented the strictest interpretation of industry separation. However, subsequent years saw more nuanced approaches. Rather than blanket exclusion, accreditation bodies increasingly focused on managing conflicts of interest while still allowing industry expertise when properly disclosed and mitigated.

**Professional Society Adaptations:**
Organizations like ASCPT and similar societies developed mechanisms to maintain CE accreditation while preserving industry participation through enhanced disclosure requirements, independent content validation processes, and clear separation between educational activities and promotional content.

**Broader Industry-Physician Relationship Reforms:**
This period coincided with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (2010, implemented 2013), which increased transparency but also reinforced the need for clear boundaries between education and marketing. CME became more strictly regulated but didn't completely exclude industry scientists—rather, it required robust conflict-of-interest management and independent content validation.

**Practical Outcomes:**
Neither extreme—complete exclusion of industry scientists nor unfettered promotional education—prevailed. Instead, the CME landscape evolved to emphasize independence through peer review, evidence-base requirements, and transparent disclosure of industry relationships, allowing qualified industry researchers to contribute while maintaining educational integrity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article's implicit predictions:**

• **Prediction:** Professional societies like ASCPT would face an irreconcilable choice between CE accreditation and industry scientist inclusion, potentially splitting scientific communities.  
**Reality:** ✓ Initially accurate - ASCPT did stop CE credit temporarily. ✗ However, the dichotomy proved false—societies developed hybrid approaches allowing both CE accreditation and managed industry participation.

• **Prediction:** Blanket exclusion would unnecessarily eliminate valuable expertise from qualified clinical pharmacologists simply because they worked in industry.  
**Reality:** ✓ Correct concern - but solution evolved toward conflict-of-interest management rather than blanket exclusion. Industry scientists can participate with proper safeguards.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured a real tension point in CME policy evolution, highlighting legitimate concerns about overly broad solutions to conflict-of-interest problems. However, its long-term importance is moderate—it documented a transitional moment rather than fundamentally reshaping understanding of industry-medicine relationships.
