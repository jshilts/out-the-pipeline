# Breakthroughs, Sort of (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines the FDA's "breakthrough therapy" designation through two lenses: investor reaction and clinical reality. The author cites a study analyzing 218 public announcements of breakthrough designations from 2012 to May 2018, which found surprisingly modest market reactions—pre-commercial companies saw only a brief +9% stock bump lasting about 3 days, while established companies showed no statistically significant effect at all.

The article also notes that while 264 breakthrough designations had been granted by mid-2018, only 75 indications had resulted in actual FDA approvals, representing roughly a 70% failure rate (though still better than the ~90% failure rate typical in drug development). The author discusses ongoing debates about whether the "breakthrough" label creates unrealistic expectations, citing sources that suggest physicians should better understand what the designation actually means and noting calls to scrap the term entirely due to potential overhyping.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at developments since 2019:

**Market Reaction Evolution**: The muted investor response documented in the 2019 article appears to have persisted and even intensified. By the early 2020s, breakthrough designations had become so commonplace that they rarely moved stock prices significantly unless accompanied by truly exceptional data. The designation lost much of its novelty value as investors became more sophisticated about regulatory pathways.

**Approval Rates**: The FDA continued expanding the breakthrough therapy program significantly. As of 2023-2024, hundreds more breakthrough designations had been granted, with the program becoming a standard regulatory tool rather than an exceptional pathway. While the designation does provide expedited review and more FDA interaction, the correlation between breakthrough status and ultimate approval remained imperfect—many designated drugs still failed in later trials.

**Drugs Mentioned**: The article specifically mentions nivolumab (6 indications), ivacaftor (5 indications), and pembrolizumab (5 indications). All three drugs maintained their market positions:
- **Nivolumab (Opdivo)**: Continued to expand into additional cancer indications and remained a blockbuster immunotherapy
- **Ivacaftor (Kalydeco)**: Remained important for cystic fibrosis treatment, though newer CFTR modulators expanded treatment options
- **Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)**: Became one of the world's top-selling drugs, expanding across numerous cancer types

**Policy Impact**: The FDA did not scrap the "breakthrough" terminology as some had suggested, but the agency did become more transparent about what the designation means. The program continued operating through the 2020s, with some refinement of guidance around evidence standards but no fundamental restructuring.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Investor sophistication will increase**: ✓ **Accurate**. The article correctly anticipated that investors would continue to internalize the limited meaning of breakthrough designations. By the early 2020s, breakthrough announcements rarely moved stocks unless accompanied by strong clinical data or competitive advantages beyond just the regulatory designation.

**Clinical failure rates will persist**: ✓ **Accurate**. The ~70% failure rate mentioned remained roughly consistent. While breakthrough designation provides regulatory advantages, it doesn't eliminate the fundamental challenges of drug development or the high bar for FDA approval based on safety and efficacy data.

**The "breakthrough" term creates problematic expectations**: ⚠️ **Partially accurate, but term persisted**. Critics who argued for scrapping the "breakthrough" terminology proved correct that it would continue generating potentially inflated expectations. However, the FDA maintained the terminology, and healthcare stakeholders gradually adapted to understanding its actual meaning rather than literal interpretation.

**Drugs with multiple breakthrough designations will remain important**: ✓ **Accurate**. The drugs highlighted with multiple breakthrough indications (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ivacaftor) all maintained significant clinical and commercial importance. This pattern continued with other multi-indication breakthrough drugs demonstrating sustained value.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captured an important moment in regulatory science communication, documenting how a well-intentioned FDA program created complex secondary effects on investor behavior and public perception. It highlighted the gap between regulatory mechanisms and real-world interpretation that remains relevant for understanding drug development incentives and market dynamics.
