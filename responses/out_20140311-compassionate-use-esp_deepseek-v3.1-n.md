# Compassionate Use: An Especially Tough Case (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the ethical and economic dilemma faced by Chimerix, a small biotechnology company, when confronted with a compassionate use request for their investigational drug brincidofovir. A 7-year-old boy named Josh Hardy was dying from a viral infection after chemotherapy, and his family sought access to the drug outside of clinical trials.

The central conflict highlighted is that small companies like Chimerix face bankruptcy if they attempt to fulfill all compassionate use requests, as these programs are resource-intensive and can threaten regulatory pathways and financial viability. The author acknowledges there are no good solutions to this dilemma, noting that even large companies struggle with compassionate access decisions.

The article includes an update that Chimerix reversed their position and agreed to provide the drug through a new 20-patient open-label trial after discussions with the FDA.

## 2. HISTORY

**Chimerix and Brincidofovir Development:**
Following this incident, brincidofovir continued through clinical development for various viral infections. However, in 2016, Chimerix announced that brincidofovir failed to meet primary endpoints in Phase 3 trials for adenovirus infection and cytomegalovirus (CMV) prevention. This led to the drug never receiving FDA approval for these indications.

**Company Impact:**
The Josh Hardy case brought significant public attention to Chimerix and compassionate use policies. In 2016, Chimerix was acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals for approximately $203 million, though the company's value was substantially impacted by the brincidofovir clinical trial failures. The drug development setbacks and acquisition occurred within just a few years of this 2014 incident.

**Policy Developments:**
The case contributed to broader discussions about compassionate use policy reform. In subsequent years, various states passed "Right to Try" legislation, and in 2018, federal Right to Try legislation was signed into law, establishing alternative pathways for terminally ill patients to access investigational drugs. However, the fundamental tension between small company viability and patient access remains unresolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Company's Position Becoming "Impossible to Maintain":** ✓ Correct
- The prediction that Chimerix's position would become untenable was immediately validated when they reversed course and provided the drug within days of this article's publication.

**No Good Solution to the Fundamental Dilemma:** ✓ Correct  
- The author's acknowledgment that there are no easy answers to the compassionate use vs. company viability problem has proven accurate. While Right to Try laws were later passed, they have had limited practical impact, and the core economic challenges for small companies remain largely unchanged.

**Company Size and Bankruptcy Risk:** ✓ Valid Concern
- While Chimerix didn't go bankrupt directly from this incident, the broader point about small companies facing existential threats from resource-intensive compassionate use programs remains a valid concern in the biotechnology industry.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses a persistent ethical conflict at the intersection of pharmaceutical development, regulatory policy, and patient access that remains highly relevant today. While it captures a specific moment rather than long-term trends, the compassionate use dilemma continues to recur in similar forms, making this a thoughtful examination of ongoing structural challenges in biotech.
