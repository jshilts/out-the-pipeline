# Another Conservation Law (19 May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a fundamental challenge in scientific research management: the inverse relationship between the difficulty of a scientific problem and the predictability of its timeline. The author posits a "conservation law" where straightforward tasks can be planned to the day, harder ones estimated by quarter, but truly significant discoveries arrive infrequently and on no predictable schedule. 

The piece highlights several related problems: progress on tough problems occurs in irregular bursts, making quarterly budgeting and reporting difficult; long periods of apparent inactivity may represent valuable exploratory work or deep thinking rather than wasted time; and performance metrics designed for steady output poorly capture the reality of breakthrough research. The author cites Claude Shannon as an extreme example—revolutionary early work followed by years with few measurable outputs, yet his overall contribution remains monumental. The article suggests that managers must accept this uncertainty principle when aiming for high-impact research, focusing on verifying genuine effort rather than demanding predictable quarterly progress.

## 2. HISTORY

The core tension described in this 2015 article—between predictable timelines and breakthrough science—has only intensified in the subsequent decade, particularly in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research. The biotech industry experienced significant upheavals that highlighted this dynamic:

**Drug Development Reality**: Between 2015-2025, clinical success rates remained stubbornly low, with approximately 90% of drugs still failing in clinical trials. The average drug development timeline stayed at 10-12 years despite massive investment in efficiency tools. This reinforced the article's central thesis—truly novel therapeutics cannot be scheduled like engineering projects.

**COVID-19 Exception and Rule**: The rapid development of mRNA vaccines (2020-2021) appeared to contradict the article's premise, achieving in months what typically takes years. However, this success built on decades of prior research (mRNA technology had been developing since the 1990s), and subsequent variant-chasing demonstrated that even accelerated timelines face the same fundamental unpredictability when dealing with biological complexity.

**AI/ML Hype and Reality**: The integration of artificial intelligence into drug discovery after 2015 created new management challenges. Companies like DeepMind (AlphaFold 2021) and numerous AI-drug discovery startups promised accelerated timelines, yet concrete drug approvals from AI platforms remained elusive through 2025. This created tension between investor expectations for quarterly AI-driven breakthroughs and the reality that biological discovery still follows irregular, unpredictable patterns.

**Funding and Accountability Pressures**: The biotech funding boom of 2020-2021 increased pressure for quarterly milestones, leading to numerous companies going public with aggressive timelines. The subsequent biotech downturn of 2022-2024 saw many of these companies fail or restructure, partly because they had promised predictable progress on inherently unpredictable scientific challenges. This validated the article's warning about organizations unprepared for the uncertainty of breakthrough research.

**Regulatory and Policy Response**: Throughout this period, regulatory agencies like the FDA maintained their evidence-based standards, refusing to accelerate approvals without robust data regardless of commercial or political pressure. This institutional reality reinforced that even with tremendous resources, scientific validation cannot be rushed on demand.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific testable predictions about named technologies, companies, or regulatory policies. Instead, it presented a general principle about research management and scientific discovery timelines. Evaluating this framework:

• **Core Assertion (Difficulty-Predictability Relationship)**: The decade following 2015 strongly validated this principle across multiple domains. From CRISPR therapeutics facing unexpected biological complexity to AI drug discovery platforms struggling with real-world validation, the pattern held: the more ambitious the scientific goal, the less predictable the timeline. This proved not just in academic settings but in highly-resourced commercial environments.

• **Management Challenge**: The tension between quarterly reporting demands and breakthrough research timelines became more acute. The biotech investment cycles of 2020-2024 demonstrated exactly the dynamic the author described: organizations demanding predictable progress on transformative science experienced exactly the "bad time" predicted when trying to budget for steady quarterly accomplishments in fundamentally irregular discovery processes.

• **Performance Evaluation Problem**: The issue of distinguishing "unproductive thinking" from genuine progress remained unresolved. High-profile cases like Theranos illustrated the difficulty managers face in evaluating apparent scientific progress without deep domain expertise. Meanwhile, legitimate breakthrough research continued to require long gestation periods that traditional corporate metrics struggle to accommodate.

• **Claude Shannon Analogy**: The broader pattern held true—many significant scientific contributions continued to emerge from researchers who would fail conventional productivity metrics. The research ecosystem still lacks good mechanisms for supporting long-term, high-risk inquiry while maintaining accountability.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article captured a fundamental, enduring truth about scientific research that became only more relevant over the subsequent decade. The core insight transcends any specific technology or era, explaining why breakthroughs cannot be scheduled and why management approaches that ignore this reality consistently fail. The piece gains additional interest because its warnings precisely anticipated the challenges that would plague biotech and tech investment cycles in the years that followed.
