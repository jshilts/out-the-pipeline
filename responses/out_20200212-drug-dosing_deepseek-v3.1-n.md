# Drug Dosing (February 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the challenges and advancements in determining appropriate drug dosing for first-in-human clinical trials. The author explains that after a compound passes toxicity testing and becomes a clinical candidate, the critical question becomes how much to dose in human subjects. A major approach discussed is "allometric scaling" - extrapolating doses from animals to humans based on body weight, blood volume, half-life, and pharmacokinetic data. This has improved over the years, reflected in declining Phase I clinical failures. Patient compliance is noted as another important consideration, with once-daily oral dosing preferred over complex schedules or large "horse pill" sizes. The article describes how modern approaches combine pharmacokinetic (PK) data with pharmacodynamic (PD) considerations - understanding how much drug is needed, in which tissues, and for how long to achieve clinical efficacy. The author highlights case studies showing different approaches needed for different drug types, and argues that dose-finding techniques should be applied earlier in drug discovery, requiring organizations to integrate these capabilities into early-stage research rather than late preclinical development. The author notes this requires mindset shifts, as early-stage work needs rough-and-ready answers while late-stage requires strict GLP/GMP standards.

## 2. HISTORY

Since February 2020, several developments have occurred in drug dosing and clinical pharmacology:

**Regulatory and Methodological Advances:**
The FDA has continued to emphasize model-informed drug development (MIDD), including physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, which aligns with the article's emphasis on computational approaches to dose prediction. In 2020-2024, regulatory guidances have increasingly accepted modeling and simulation data to support dose selection, reducing the need for extensive clinical dose-ranging studies.

**Industry Implementation:**
Major pharmaceutical companies have increasingly adopted the article's recommended approach of front-loading dose-finding earlier in discovery. Companies like Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Roche have integrated PK/PD modeling teams into early drug discovery rather than keeping them confined to late-stage development. This has been facilitated by advances in computational tools and better understanding of target validation.

**Continued Decline in Phase I Failures:**
The trend mentioned in the article has largely continued. According to industry analyses (2018-2023), Phase I success rates have remained relatively stable or slightly improved, with approximately 60-70% of drugs progressing from Phase I to Phase II. However, the primary reasons for Phase I failures have shifted somewhat - while dosing-related issues have become less common due to better modeling, unexpected toxicity and safety concerns remain significant causes of failure.

**Technological Progress:**
Machine learning and AI approaches to dose prediction have gained traction since 2020, with companies developing computational platforms to predict human pharmacokinetics from preclinical data. However, the field has not achieved the article's aspirational goal of being able to "rip through a bunch of proposed structures and predict how they'll behave on oral dosing" with high accuracy - this remains challenging due to biological complexity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "Predictions of dosing will continue to become more and more computational"**
- **Outcome**: This has partially materialized. Computational approaches have indeed become more prominent in dose-finding, with increased use of PBPK modeling, machine learning, and quantitative systems pharmacology. However, the transformation has been more gradual than revolutionary, with clinical validation still required for most dosing decisions.
- **Specifics**: FDA guidances now explicitly mention MIDD approaches, and companies routinely submit modeling data. However, purely computational dose predictions without clinical validation remain supplementary rather than replacing clinical data.

**Prediction: "Dose-finding process is going to have to get less aligned with late preclinical development and more aligned with early-stage research"**
- **Outcome**: This organizational change has occurred in many companies, though not universally. Large pharmaceutical companies have increasingly integrated PK/PD expertise into drug discovery teams from the outset, rather than treating it as a late-stage gatekeeping function.
- **Specifics**: Organizations like Novartis, GSK, and Eli Lilly have reported restructuring to embed clinical pharmacologists earlier in the drug development process, enabling better target selection and lead optimization based on anticipated dosing requirements. Smaller companies often still follow the traditional model due to resource constraints.

**Prediction: "We cannot yet rip through a bunch of proposed structures and predict how they'll behave on oral dosing, but we can continue to make better predictions"**
- **Outcome**: Accurate. This remains true. While prediction capabilities have improved, particularly for certain drug classes with well-understood properties, the fundamental challenge of predicting oral bioavailability, tissue distribution, and clearance from molecular structure alone remains unsolved. Improvements have been incremental rather than transformative.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This is a thoughtful commentary on an important but often overlooked aspect of drug development. While not describing a breakthrough technology, it highlights a critical process issue affecting drug discovery success rates and patient outcomes, with practical recommendations that have proven relevant and actionable. The article's emphasis on organizational and mindset changes alongside technical improvements gives it lasting value beyond the specific technologies discussed.
