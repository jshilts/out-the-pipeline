# More Belts Tighten (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary discusses Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMS) announcement of cutbacks in December 2007. The article notes that while the layoffs were expected, they appeared to primarily target manufacturing rather than research staff, which the author views as a positive indicator for the company's future drug discovery capabilities. BMS was narrowing its focus to its current strong therapeutic areas and reallocating resources accordingly. The piece mentions that BMS was also planning to use freed-up capital for partnerships and acquisitions, though the author expresses caution about "Great Big Visionary Moves" in the pharmaceutical industry due to the long time lags in drug development. The article concludes by hoping BMS would stick to its strengths and correctly identify what those strengths were.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2007 article, Bristol-Myers Squibb embarked on a significant transformation that largely aligned with the strategic direction outlined in the piece. The company continued its focus on narrowing to core therapeutic areas, particularly oncology, cardiovascular diseases, and immunoscience.

BMS made several major strategic moves in the subsequent years. Most notably, the company acquired Medarex in 2009 for approximately $2.4 billion, gaining access to antibody technology that would later prove crucial. The Medarex acquisition brought ipilimumab (Yervoy), which received FDA approval in 2011 for metastatic melanoma, representing a breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy. In 2015, BMS continued its immuno-oncology focus with the FDA approval of nivolumab (Opdivo), which became one of the company's blockbuster drugs.

The company also divested non-core assets, including selling its wound care business in 2008 and its medical imaging business in 2010. These moves reflected the strategic focus suggested in the 2007 article. BMS survived the challenging period and maintained its status as a major pharmaceutical company, eventually growing through focused acquisitions and internal R&D. The company's market capitalization and revenue trajectory in the years following 2007 generally showed positive development, validating the strategy of concentrating on core therapeutic strengths while carefully managing resources.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several implicit predictions and strategic assessments:

• **Manufacturing cuts vs. research preservation as positive indicator**: This prediction held true. BMS did not gut its early-stage research capabilities and instead made strategic investments that led to significant drug approvals, particularly in oncology.

• **Focus on current strong therapeutic areas**: This proved accurate. BMS narrowed its focus to oncology, cardiovascular, and immunoscience, leading to successful drug launches like Eliquis (cardiovascular) and Opdivo/Yervoy (oncology).

• **Caution about "Great Big Visionary Moves"**: This was partially validated. BMS avoided massive transformational acquisitions but did make strategic bolt-on deals like Medarex, which proved successful. The company generally stayed within its established therapeutic areas rather than attempting dramatic strategic pivots.

• **Hope that BMS would stick to its strengths**: This largely materialized. BMS didn't get acquired as some speculated might happen, and continued pursuing focused organic growth combined with strategic partnerships and smaller acquisitions.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article provides insight into pharmaceutical industry strategy during a pivotal cost-cutting period, but its brevity and limited scope constrain its broader significance. The piece correctly identified key strategic considerations for BMS, making it moderately interesting as a retrospective case study in pharmaceutical company strategy.
