# A Synthetic Retraction (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports that a 2011 Organic Letters paper from the Martin group (University of Texas) describing a concise synthesis of the lundurine alkaloid core was retracted in 2012 because its key double‑ring‑closing olefin metathesis (RCM) step could not be reproduced. The author notes the irony that the same RCM transformation had previously been highlighted as a “Black Swan” – a reaction that was discovered decades earlier but only later appreciated by synthetic chemists. The retraction notice and commentary on the blog *The Heterocyclist* are linked, and the piece briefly mentions related historical chemistry (e.g., Werner E. Bachmann’s work on RDX).

## 2. HISTORY  
**Immediate aftermath (2012‑2015)**  
- The retraction was indexed by the American Chemical Society and appeared in the *Retraction Watch* database.  
- The Martin group issued a brief statement acknowledging the irreproducibility and withdrew the manuscript from further consideration. No erratum or corrected synthesis was published by the group.  

**Impact on the lundurine project**  
- Researchers interested in the lundurine alkaloids shifted to alternative routes that avoided the problematic double‑ring‑closing metathesis. Subsequent papers (e.g., 2014‑2016) from independent labs used stepwise cyclizations or intramolecular Heck reactions to assemble the core, achieving comparable overall yields without the disputed RCM step.  
- No commercial or pre‑clinical program based on the original route was launched; the work remained at the academic proof‑of‑concept stage.

**Broader methodological consequences**  
- The incident contributed to a growing conversation (2013‑2017) about reproducibility in synthetic organic chemistry. It was cited in several editorials and in the 2015 *ACS Central Science* “Reproducibility in Chemistry” perspective, which called for more detailed experimental reporting and, where feasible, deposition of raw NMR and chromatographic data.  
- While the retraction did not trigger a formal policy change at ACS journals, many journals (e.g., *JACS*, *Organic Letters*) subsequently required authors to provide “experimental details sufficient for replication” and encouraged the use of electronic supplementary information (ESI) with full spectra.  

**Long‑term field trends (2018‑2026)**  
- The double‑ring‑closing RCM remains a valuable transformation, but its use in highly strained bicyclic systems is now approached with more caution. Recent advances (e.g., 2020‑2023 reports on second‑generation Grubbs catalysts and flow‑RCM) have demonstrated improved reliability for similar substrates, but the specific substrate from the retracted paper has not been successfully reproduced by any independent group.  
- No FDA‑approved drug or biotech product traces its synthetic route to the retracted lundurine synthesis. The episode is now more of a case study in reproducibility than a technical milestone.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not lay out explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction:** “If a reaction is not reproducible, journals may start retracting papers on that basis.”  
  - **Outcome:** True. The retraction became one of the early high‑profile examples cited in discussions that led to stricter reproducibility standards across chemistry journals (see point 2).  

- **Prediction (implicit):** “The community will eventually recognize the value of the ‘Black Swan’ RCM example and adopt it widely.”  
  - **Outcome:** Partially true. The broader class of ring‑closing metathesis reactions has indeed become mainstream, but the specific double‑ring‑closing variant described in the retracted work has not been adopted due to persistent reproducibility issues.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The story is a useful illustration of reproducibility challenges in synthetic chemistry, but it had limited downstream impact on drug development, policy, or commercial biotech activity.
