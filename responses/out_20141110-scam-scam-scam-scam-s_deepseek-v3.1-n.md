# Scam, Scam, Scam, Scam, Scammity Scam, Wonderful Scam (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article exposes the predatory publishing ecosystem that flourished in the early-to-mid 2010s. The piece describes how fake journals, fake impact factors, and fraudulent academic services operated in a symbiotic network of scams. Key examples include the "American Based Researche Journal" (sic) soliciting submissions through poorly written spam emails, the absurdly named "Integrated Journal of British," and "Universal Impact Factor"—a service providing fabricated impact metrics to predatory journals. The article highlights how this ecosystem operated: journals charged authors publication fees while accepting or soliciting fake research, fake impact factor providers legitimized these journals for a fee, and the entire system became infected with additional spam operations (such as HTML spam for "online abortion pills" embedded in journal listing pages).

## 2. HISTORY
The predatory publishing problem documented in 2014 has persisted and in some cases worsened, though awareness and countermeasures have also grown:

**Continued Operation of Predatory Publishers**: Many predatory journals continued operating through the late 2010s and into the 2020s. Jeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers (maintained until 2017) documented hundreds of such operations. After Beall shut down his list under pressure, new initiatives like Cabell's Predatory Reports emerged to track these publishers.

**Regulatory and Institutional Responses**: In 2013, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed its first lawsuit against predatory publisher OMICS Group, culminating in a 2019 judgment requiring OMICS to pay $50.1 million (though collection remains difficult). Many universities and funding agencies implemented policies requiring researchers to avoid predatory journals, with some institutions creating "whitelists" of acceptable publication venues.

**Business Impact**: Predatory publishing became a multi-million dollar industry. Studies estimate these publishers collect tens of millions annually in article processing charges. Some major predatory publishers operate hundreds of journal titles simultaneously.

**Technology Evolution**: The tactics evolved to become more sophisticated, with predatory publishers using fake editorial boards, hijacked journal titles, and aggressive email marketing. The rise of AI writing tools (post-2020) created new challenges, though the article predates widespread AI-generated paper mills.

**Limited Actual Scientific Impact**: Despite the volume of papers published in predatory venues, these publications rarely influence legitimate scientific discourse or lead to regulatory approvals. The FDA does not base drug approvals on studies from predatory journals, and legitimate researchers generally ignore such publications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself made no explicit predictions about the future. It was primarily descriptive of the contemporary situation in 2014, focusing on documenting the absurdity and scope of the problem rather than forecasting its evolution.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

This article addresses a significant and persistent problem in academic publishing that affects research integrity, institutional budgets, and public trust in science. While the specific examples may seem humorous, the underlying issue of predatory publishing has only grown more complex and costly over the subsequent decade, making this early documentation valuable for understanding the ecosystem's origins and tactics.
