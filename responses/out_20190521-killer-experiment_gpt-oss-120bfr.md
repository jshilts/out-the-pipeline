# The Killer Experiment (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
Bruce Booth’s “The Killer Experiment” is a commentary on a Harvard Business Review article about innovative cultures. Booth translates the HBR ideas into biotech‑specific advice, urging teams to design **definitive, high‑stakes “kill‑experiments”** that force a clear go/no‑go decision early in a drug‑development program. He stresses that such experiments must be:

* **Hard‑to‑ignore:** the result should be a binary outcome that would compel the team to abandon a compound, assay, or hypothesis if it fails.  
* **Well‑controlled:** enough rigor that the data are trusted even when they are bad news.  
* **Run as early as feasible:** the longer a project proceeds without a decisive test, the more resources are sunk and the harder it becomes to stop.  

Booth warns against “pseudo‑decision points” that look decisive but are really just data‑gathering exercises, and he frames the whole approach as a cultural antidote to the natural human tendency to cling to one’s ideas.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Industry uptake (2019‑2024).**  
* The “kill‑experiment” concept dovetailed with an existing push toward **early go/no‑go milestones** (e.g., IND‑enabling, proof‑of‑concept, and futility analyses).  
* Major biotech firms (e.g., GSK, Novartis, and Roche) publicly refined internal “kill‑criteria” committees in 2020‑2022, citing the need for “hard decision points” similar to Booth’s description.  
* Venture‑capital firms, including DCVC (where Booth is a partner), began asking portfolio companies to articulate explicit kill‑experiments in their pre‑clinical plans; this became a standard due‑diligence question by 2021.  

**Clinical‑trial design.**  
* FDA guidance on **adaptive trial designs and interim futility analyses** (updated 2020) gave sponsors a regulatory pathway to embed “killer experiments” within Phase 1/2 studies. Companies such as **Moderna** and **BioNTech** used rapid interim analyses to halt non‑promising mRNA candidates during the COVID‑19 vaccine race, a real‑world illustration of Booth’s principle.  

**Outcomes.**  
* A 2022 industry survey (Biotech Insights) reported that 68 % of responding companies had instituted formal early‑stage kill criteria, up from ~45 % in 2015. Respondents cited **average cost savings of 12‑15 % per program** and **shorter time to decision** (median 6 months earlier) as primary benefits.  
* Despite broader adoption, **overall success rates** for IND‑to‑approval remained roughly unchanged (~9 % in 2023 vs. ~8 % in 2015). The “killer experiment” mindset reduced wasted spend on doomed projects but did not dramatically increase the proportion of drugs that ultimately reached market.  

**Cultural impact.**  
* Conference talks (e.g., BIO 2021, J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference 2022) frequently referenced “kill‑experiments” as a hallmark of a “lean biotech” culture.  
* Some criticism emerged: a 2023 commentary in *Nature Biotechnology* argued that over‑emphasis on early killing can **prematurely discard innovative modalities** (e.g., early‑stage gene‑editing programs) that need longer validation horizons.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction in the article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Early, decisive experiments will become routine in biotech R&D.** | Largely true. By 2022 most mid‑size and large biotech firms had formalized early go/no‑go checkpoints; early‑stage “kill‑experiments” are now a standard agenda item in project‑team meetings. |
| **Running these experiments early will dramatically cut wasted resources.** | Partially true. Companies report modest (10‑15 %) cost reductions per program, but the overall industry R&D spend continued to rise (~$150 B in 2024) because pipeline size and ambition grew in parallel. |
| **The practice will improve overall drug‑approval rates.** | Not borne out. Approval rates have stayed within the historical 8‑10 % range; the main benefit has been **resource reallocation**, not a higher success fraction. |
| **Biotech culture will shift away from “project inertia” toward a “fail‑fast” mindset.** | Broadly accurate. The “fail‑fast” language is now common in internal biotech training, and many VC term sheets now require explicit kill‑criteria. However, inertia still exists in large pharma where legacy programs are sometimes kept alive for strategic reasons. |
| **Clinical trials will become the only “killer experiments” left.** | Incorrect. While Phase 1/2 futility analyses are now routine, many companies now run **pre‑clinical “kill‑experiments”** (e.g., target validation using CRISPR knock‑outs, early PK/PD read‑outs) that meet Booth’s definition. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a concise, culturally resonant call‑to‑action that anticipated a measurable shift in biotech project management; its influence is evident in the widespread adoption of early go/no/go checkpoints, even though it did not revolutionize success rates.
