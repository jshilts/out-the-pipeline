# That Many Compounds in Development? Really? (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critically examines a 2013 PhRMA report claiming that over 5,000 new medicines were in the global development pipeline, with 70% being potential first-in-class medicines. The author expresses skepticism about these figures, noting that the data came from EvaluatePharma's proprietary database and included 2,164 compounds in Phase I, 2,329 in Phase II, and 833 in Phase III, with oncology being the largest therapeutic area (1,265/1,507/288 across the three phases respectively). The article questions whether these inflated numbers result from: companies keeping inactive compounds listed in databases; inclusion of international programs with lower reporting standards; or confusion between "compounds" versus "projects." While acknowledging that the methodology excludes multiple-counting of single compounds across different indications, the author expresses doubt that there truly are that many active development programs and calls for PhRMA to release detailed compound lists to verify these claims.

## 2. HISTORY

The skepticism expressed in this 2013 article proved prescient, as subsequent years revealed significant challenges in drug development that weren't fully captured by pipeline counts. The FDA's drug approval data shows a modest increase from 27 novel drugs approved in 2013 to 59 in 2018 (peak), with oncology indeed becoming the dominant therapeutic area as suggested by the pipeline numbers—with cancer drugs representing 25-35% of FDA approvals in subsequent years. However, the implied success rate from that pipeline didn't materialize as hoped.

Clinical trial success rates remained stubbornly low throughout the 2010s. Comprehensive analyses by BIO showed overall success rates from Phase I to approval around 9.6%, with oncology specifically at just 5.1%—meaning most of those 1,265 oncology Phase I compounds likely failed. The ALS field mentioned (61 projects) saw particularly disappointing outcomes; despite numerous trials, only a handful of treatments gained approval in the subsequent decade, and none offered transformative benefits. The hepatitis C example proved more successful, with direct-acting antivirals like sofosbuvir revolutionizing treatment and largely fulfilling the promise of those 66 pipeline candidates.

The biopharmaceutical industry's productivity paradox deepened in the 2010s: despite massive R&D investment increases (from ~$50B to $83B annually in the US alone from 2013-2020) and growing pipeline numbers, the rate of truly innovative drug approvals remained relatively flat. This led to increased industry focus on precision medicine and biomarker-driven development, which proved more successful than traditional approaches. Notably, the 70% "first-in-class" claim likely reflected industry hype rather than meaningful innovation, as many "first-in-class" approvals in subsequent years showed only marginal improvements over existing therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction that pipeline numbers were inflated due to companies keeping inactive compounds listed**: This proved largely accurate. Subsequent investigations into clinical trial databases revealed significant issues with trial status reporting and many "zombie" trials that appeared active but had effectively ceased. The FDA's ClinicalTrials.gov reforms in 2017 partly addressed this through mandatory outcome reporting.

- **Prediction that first-in-class figures were "pumped up" by multiple compounds targeting the same unrealized target**: Confirmed by later developments. Hot targets like PCSK9, PD-1/PD-L1, and various kinase inhibitors regularly had 10-20 competing programs in development, but most either failed or were discontinued rather than leading to multiple approved drugs. The immunotherapy boom starting around 2014 exemplified this—while numerous PD-1 programs existed, only a few reached market.

- **Implicit prediction that oncology would remain a dominant area but with uncertain outcomes**: Partially correct. Oncology did dominate drug development through the 2010s, representing the largest share of approvals, but the sheer number of pipeline compounds (1,265 Phase I) far exceeded meaningful clinical output, with success rates remaining under 10%.

- **Implicit prediction that the claimed development activity would not translate proportionally to approved medicines**: Strongly validated. Despite 5,000+ pipeline compounds in 2013, annual new drug approvals remained in the 30-60 range throughout the decade, suggesting massive attrition that the original report didn't adequately convey.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article proved remarkably prescient in questioning industry pipeline claims, and its skepticism about inflated numbers and development challenges identified themes that remained relevant throughout the decade in ongoing debates about pharmaceutical productivity and R&D efficiency.
