# A Bit About Biopharma Investing (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes two major biopharma investment failures from 2017 to illustrate the high risks and specialized knowledge required for biopharma investing. First, Merck's decision to abandon anacetrapib, its CETP inhibitor for cardiovascular disease, despite the drug meeting its primary endpoint in Phase III trials. Second, Axovant Sciences' Alzheimer's drug candidate (intepirdine) failure, which occurred despite the company's inflated stock valuation. The author uses these examples to argue that biopharma investors must understand clinical trial methodology, drug development history, and specific therapeutic areas to avoid being misled by press releases and market hype. The central warning is that superficial understanding and reliance on others' opinions lead to significant financial losses, as both cases demonstrate how "positive" trial results can be misleading without proper context.

## 2. HISTORY

**CETP Inhibitors**: The CETP inhibitor class suffered a complete collapse following 2017. This mechanism, designed to raise HDL ("good") cholesterol, produced five major failures:
- Roche's dalcetrapib (Phase III failure, 2012)  
- Pfizer's torcetrapib (Phase III failure, 2006)
- Merck's anacetrapib (abandoned 2017 despite meeting primary endpoint)
- Eli Lilly's evacetrapib (Phase III failure, 2015)

The fundamental premise that raising HDL cholesterol would reduce cardiovascular events proved incorrect. The $1 billion+ invested across these programs yielded zero approved drugs, demonstrating that meeting primary endpoints doesn't guarantee clinical benefit or approval.

**Axovant and Alzheimer's**: The Axovant story unfolded exactly as predicted. The company's stock crashed 75% in September 2017 when intepirdine (RVT-101) failed its Phase III MINDSET trial in Alzheimer's disease. The drug had already failed in a previous Alzheimer's study and shared the same 5-HT6 antagonist mechanism as two other failed drugs. Axovant's market cap had reached $2.8 billion before the collapse, despite the compound having been acquired from GSK for $5 million. The company later pivoted to gene therapy but was ultimately acquired by Neurim Pharmaceuticals in 2023, a classic example of the "reverse merger" survival strategy for failed biotech companies.

**Regulatory Impact**: The anacetrapib case reinforced FDA's increasingly stringent requirements for cardiovascular outcomes data. The CETP failures contributed to regulatory skepticism about surrogate endpoints (like cholesterol levels) and emphasized the need for actual cardiovascular outcomes improvement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The article warned that Axovant's stock would crash spectacularly due to the overwhelming evidence against 5-HT6 antagonists working in Alzheimer's, and that investors relying on superficial analysis would lose money.  
  **Outcome**: ✔️ **Correct**. The stock crashed 75% within days of the September 2017 announcement.

- **Prediction**: That CETP inhibitors would continue to fail despite positive-looking trial results, because the mechanism itself was flawed.
  **Outcome**: ✔️ **Correct**. No CETP inhibitor has reached market approval; the entire therapeutic approach has been abandoned.

- **Prediction**: That biotech investor patterns would continue to repeat - small companies with desperate diseases would attract speculative money, and the same mistakes would occur.
  **Outcome**: ✔️ **Correct**. The 2018-2022 biotech boom saw similar patterns with CAR-T, gene therapy, and Alzheimer's companies experiencing extreme volatility and frequent clinical failures despite investor enthusiasm.

- **Implicit Prediction**: The difficulty of interpreting "positive" trial results would remain a challenge for biopharma investing.
  **Outcome**: ✔️ **Correct**. The 2020s saw numerous cases of companies celebrating "statistically significant" results that lacked clinical meaningfulness.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates strong predictive insight into biopharma investment patterns that remain highly relevant today, using well-chosen contemporary examples to illustrate enduring industry dynamics.
