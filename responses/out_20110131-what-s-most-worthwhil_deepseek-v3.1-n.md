# What's the Most Worthwhile New Drug Since 1990? (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

In January 2011, Science magazine blogger Derek Lowe posed an open question to readers: "What's the most worthwhile new pharmaceutical brought to market since 1990?" Lowe sought reader nominations for medicines introduced in the previous twenty years that had made the most significant impact, leaving the definition of "worthwhile" intentionally open to interpretation—whether through improvement over existing therapies, opening new treatment areas, cost-effectiveness, or overall clinical benefit.

The tone of the piece was exploratory rather than prescriptive, with Lowe noting he would use reader responses to inform a longer future post. He acknowledged the 1990 cutoff was arbitrary but reasonable for assessing a generation of pharmaceutical innovation, and encouraged respondents to briefly justify their nominees. The article represents an informal poll of the biopharmaceutical community's perspective on landmark drug discoveries roughly spanning 1990-2010.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking back with 13 years of hindsight (2011-2024), several developments contextualize pharmaceutical innovation since that 1990 benchmark:

**Major Drug Classes and Breakthroughs Since 2011:**
- **Immuno-oncology**: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab approved 2014, nivolumab 2014) and CTLA-4 inhibitors fundamentally transformed cancer treatment
- **CAR-T cell therapies**: Kymriah (2017) and Yescarta (2017) commercialized for hematologic malignancies
- **Gene therapies**: Luxturna (2017) for inherited retinal disease, numerous others in development
- **mRNA vaccines**: The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed this platform on an unprecedented timeline (Comirnaty and Spikevax authorized 2020/2021)
- **Novel anticoagulants**: Direct oral anticoagulants like apixaban (Eliquis, 2012)
- **Hepatitis C cures**: Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi, 2013) and combination therapies achieving >90% cure rates
- **Alzheimer's disease**: Despite ongoing challenges, aducanumab (Aduhelm) and lecanemab (Leqembi) received accelerated approvals, though with ongoing controversy about effectiveness

**Clinical Impact Reality Check:**
- HCV treatments pioneered cure rates exceeding 95% for what was previously a chronic progressive disease
- Immuno-oncology dramatically improved long-term survival in advanced melanoma and lung cancer
- CRISPR-based therapeutic approaches (approved December 2023 with Casgevy for sickle cell disease) have moved from hypothetical to clinical reality
- Drug pricing pressures intensified, with specialty drugs reaching costs of hundreds of thousands annually
- The opioid crisis prompted fundamental reassessment of pain management strategies and regulatory oversight

**Business Developments:**
- Industry consolidation continued, with mega-mergers significantly reducing the number of major pharmaceutical companies
- Biotech sector saw explosive valuation growth followed by significant contraction in 2021-2022
- Pharma R&D productivity remained stubbornly challenging despite increased investment
- Regulatory pathways diversified with breakthrough therapy designations, priority reviews, and accelerated approvals

If one were to revisit Lowe's question in 2024 with the benefit of seeing 1990-2024, the list of nominees would likely include: statins (atorvastatin 1996), imatinib (Gleevec, 2001), HAART therapy for HIV (mid-1990s), sofosbuvir, CAR-T therapies, and COVID-19 vaccines. Whether these would be considered "most worthwhile" remains subjective.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself did not make explicit predictions but solicited nominations which implicitly represented judgments about which drugs would prove historically significant. Any retrospective evaluation would find:

- Reader nominations would likely have included drugs like statins, imatinib, HAART therapy, and biologicals—most of which have maintained clinical importance
- The reader poll format anticipated ongoing debate rather than consensus, which aligns with the reality that drug development's most impactful products are rarely obvious at launch
- Lowe's framing acknowledged the subjective nature of "worthwhile"—a prediction that evaluation criteria would remain contested, which proved accurate given subsequent debates over cost-effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, and real-world value beyond registration trials
- No single "most worthwhile" drug emerged from the piece, reflecting genuine disagreement about values-based clinical and economic assessments

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This piece represents a thoughtful but dated conversation starter that captures a specific moment in biopharmaceutical reflection. While the question remains permanently relevant to science policy and drug development, the format and timing limit broader historical insight.
