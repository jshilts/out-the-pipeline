# The Last PPAR Compound? (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Roche's decision to halt clinical trials of aleglitazar, a diabetes drug, positioning this failure as potentially "the last of the PPAR ligands to fail in the clinic." The author catalogues a long history of unsuccessful PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor) drug development across major pharmaceutical companies including Merck, Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, and others, noting that multiple companies had multiple failed candidates. 

Of the three PPAR compounds that achieved market approval, the record was problematic: troglitazone was withdrawn, rosiglitazone (Avandia) faced major safety controversies, and pioglitazone (Actos) had its own issues. The article emphasizes the massive hidden costs of drug development failures—billions of dollars and years of research that go unnoticed by the public, who primarily hear about successful approvals. The author argues that without understanding the scale of these failures, one cannot properly appreciate the true nature and difficulty of drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2013 largely validated the author's pessimism about the PPAR class, though some developments suggest a more nuanced picture:

**Continued PPAR failures and struggles:**
- The three marketed PPAR drugs faced further setbacks. Rosiglitazone (Avandia) saw its use severely restricted by the FDA and European regulators in 2010 due to cardiovascular risks, and was effectively withdrawn from most markets by 2011-2012, though some generic versions remained available under restricted access programs.

**Late-stage pipeline exhaustion:**
- Major pharmaceutical companies largely abandoned PPAR-focused drug development programs after 2013, consistent with the "last PPAR compound" theme. The significant investment and repeated failures made PPARs a cautionary example in drug development.

**Shift to alternative mechanisms:**
- Diabetes drug development pivoted toward SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide), which showed better cardiovascular outcomes and safety profiles. These classes became first-line and second-line treatments for type 2 diabetes.

**Pioglitazone's continued but limited role:**
- Pioglitazone (Actos) remained on the market but its use became more restricted due to concerns about heart failure, bone fractures, and bladder cancer risk. It became a third-line therapy option rather than a primary treatment.

**Research landscape changes:**
- Academic research continued studying PPAR biology, particularly PPAR-gamma's role in metabolism, but drug development programs became rare in pharmaceutical companies. Some research explored partial agonists or tissue-selective modulators as potential alternatives to avoid the side effects of full agonists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **"This might be the absolute last of the PPAR ligands to fail in the clinic"**: This prediction largely proved accurate. Major pharmaceutical companies significantly reduced or abandoned PPAR drug development programs after 2013, though some smaller companies and academic groups continued limited research efforts with modified approaches.

- **The opportunity costs being "staggering"**: This was validated by subsequent developments showing that resources redirected to GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors yielded multiple successful drugs with better safety and efficacy profiles than PPAR agonists.

- **Implicit prediction that the field would not recover**: The PPAR class did not see a resurgence in mainstream drug development, validating this outlook.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**
This article effectively captures a turning point in pharmaceutical development and provides important perspective on drug discovery economics and failure rates, making it valuable for understanding the practical realities of translational medicine.
