# Article Title (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe reported an unusual editorial rejection from the journal *Leukemia* (a SpringerNature publication). A pharmaceutical company researcher, collaborating with academic co-authors, submitted a manuscript on the cell biology of compounds related to their target of interest—not focused on any proprietary drug or clinical trial. After two weeks, the journal rejected the submission with no review, stating that "the journal discourages submissions from industry." The *Leukemia* "Guide to Authors" and "Aims and Scope" pages contained no such policy, yet the journal declined to process the manuscript solely due to industry affiliation. Lowe questioned this stance, noting the apparent contradiction with the journal's stated scope and the value of industry-academic collaborations in developing leukemia therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments unfolded in public and behind the scenes. Per the note at the top of Lowe's post, the editors of *Leukemia* responded, calling the rejection "a highly unusual and unfortunate error" and taking steps to correct it. Over the following years, broader trends in scientific publishing and industry-academia relations appear to have moved against blanket anti-industry policies. High-impact journals increasingly emphasize transparency, reproducibility, and conflict-of-interest disclosure rather than blacklisting industry affiliations, since many breakthrough therapies originate from or involve industry research. Dual-affiliation papers (academic-industry) became more common and valued for their translational relevance. However, lingering bias and inconsistent handling of industry submissions persisted in some editorial offices, prompting efforts by publishers and funders to standardize and clarify guidelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original piece did not lay out explicit predictions about the future, but it implied several expectations and raised questions that can be assessed against later outcomes:

- **That journals would clarify their policies and avoid outright bans on industry submissions.** This largely held true, with many journals adopting clearer guidelines and emphasizing transparency of affiliation over exclusion. The *Leukemia* editors' rapid walk-back suggests even then the policy was inconsistent with accepted practice.
- **That excluding industry would be counterproductive to developing leukemia therapies.** This proved correct in the sense that major advances in hematology (e.g., CAR-T cells, targeted inhibitors, and antibody therapies) often involved deep industry-academic partnerships and robust publishing of non-proprietary mechanistic work.
- **That academic co-authors and non-proprietary research should be sufficient to warrant review.** This expectation aligned with evolving norms; over time, journals moved toward evaluating manuscripts based on scientific rigor and transparency rather than solely on the corporate affiliation of contributors.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a revealing moment of editorial bias in scientific publishing. While the individual case was quickly corrected, it highlighted systemic inconsistencies in how journals handled industry contributions.
