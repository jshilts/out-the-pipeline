# The Move is Nigh (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a brief announcement from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which was hosted on the Corante platform. The post informs readers that the blog is migrating to a new location at Science Translational Medicine, with the final posts on Corante appearing that Friday and the new site launching the following Monday morning. The author warns readers that comments posted after noon on Friday would not be transferred to the new site, and commenting would be disabled on recent posts as a precautionary measure. The article represents a simple logistical announcement about a blog platform migration rather than any commentary about the biotechnology industry.

## 2. HISTORY

The "In the Pipeline" blog, written by pharmaceutical chemist Derek Lowe, successfully completed this migration in 2015 and has continued publishing at Science Translational Medicine (and later at other platforms) through the present day. Lowe's blog remains one of the most widely read and respected sources of commentary on pharmaceutical research, drug discovery, and the biotechnology industry. The blog has maintained its characteristic style of providing informed, critical analysis of drug development efforts, clinical trial results, and industry trends, often offering skeptical perspectives on overly optimistic claims while highlighting genuinely promising scientific advances.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There were no scientific or industry predictions in this article, as it was purely a logistical announcement about blog migration.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This article has minimal interest for analysis as it contains no scientific content, industry commentary, or predictions about biotechnology—it is simply an administrative announcement about changing blog platforms.
