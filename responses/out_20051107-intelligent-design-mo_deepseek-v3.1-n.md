# Intelligent Design, Molecule By Molecule (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a commentary by Derek Lowe arguing against Intelligent Design (ID) from a molecular/biochemical perspective. The author examines several features of human genetics and biochemistry that appear poorly designed: degraded remnants of viral DNA in the genome; repetitive DNA sequences that are prone to breakage and cause hundreds of diseases; specific point mutations (like the Swedish and Dutch mutations in amyloid precursor protein) that cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease; the inability of humans and some animals to synthesize vitamin C; counterproductive metabolic responses (like excess glucose production in Type II diabetes); and autoimmune diseases where the body attacks itself. The author concludes that biological systems appear to be complex but jury-rigged assemblages that evolved through opportunistic tinkering rather than deliberate design.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2005 article, several major developments occurred:

**Intelligent Design Legal Status**: Just one month after this article (December 2005), the Dover trial concluded with Judge John E. Jones III ruling that Intelligent Design is not science but religion, and its teaching in public schools violated the Establishment Clause. This effectively ended attempts to teach ID in public schools and marginalized ID in mainstream scientific discourse.

**Genomics Advances**: The cost of DNA sequencing plummeted dramatically (from ~$10 million per human genome in 2006 to under $1000 by 2015). Large-scale projects like the ENCODE project (2007-2012) and the 1000 Genomes Project (2008-2015) revealed even more complexity in non-coding DNA, repetitive elements, and genomic "dark matter."

**Disease Mechanism Understanding**: Research on the specific mutations mentioned (Swedish and Dutch APP mutations) continued, but clinical trials for Alzheimer's treatments targeting amyloid-beta largely failed between 2008-2019, leading to major reassessments of the amyloid hypothesis.

**Evolutionary Genomics**: The field of comparative genomics expanded dramatically, providing overwhelming evidence for common ancestry through shared pseudogenes, endogenous retroviruses, and non-functional DNA elements—exactly the "bad design" evidence highlighted in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made implicit rather than explicit predictions:

- **That ID would continue to be scientifically indefensible**: ✓ **Correct**. ID remained scientifically marginal; no peer-reviewed research established it as a viable scientific theory.

- **That genomic sequencing would reveal more examples of "bad design"**: ✓ **Correct**. Subsequent research revealed extensive examples: shared non-functional pseudogenes across species, conserved non-coding elements with no apparent function, endogenous retroviruses fixed in identical genomic locations across primate species, and complex regulatory networks with redundant or inefficient features.

- **That the molecular evidence would increasingly support evolutionary explanations**: ✓ **Correct**. The next two decades saw exponential growth in genomic data supporting common ancestry and evolution, including detailed phylogenetic reconstructions and molecular clocks.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 6/10**

The article provides a clear, compelling molecular argument against Intelligent Design, but its immediate policy relevance diminished after the 2005 Dover ruling essentially settled the legal question.
