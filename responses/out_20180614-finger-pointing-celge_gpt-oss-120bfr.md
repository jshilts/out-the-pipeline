# Finger‑Pointing at Celgene (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary complained that Celgene’s NDA for ozanimod – a sphingosine‑1‑phosphate‑receptor (S1PR1) modulator intended for multiple‑sclerosis (MS) and ulcerative colitis – was rejected with a “refusal‑to‑file” (RTF) notice.  The author argued that the FDA’s refusal was puzzling because the submission apparently lacked adequate data on an active human metabolite that was produced far more in people than in pre‑clinical species.  The piece also highlighted a recent failure of Celgene’s antisense drug Mongersen and suggested that the problem stemmed from poor integration of the Receptos acquisition (the company that originally discovered ozanimod).  The tone was critical, implying that Celgene’s regulatory affairs and post‑acquisition oversight were deficient.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Regulatory outcome** – After the June 2018 RTF, Celgene (still an independent company at the time) prepared a revised NDA that included a full pharmacokinetic and safety package on the metabolite (the active form, RP101075).  The new filing was accepted for review in early 2019, and the FDA approved ozanimod (brand name **Zeposia**) on **23 March 2020** for relapsing forms of MS.  In **May 2020** the same label was expanded to treat ulcerative colitis.  The drug is now marketed by **Bristol‑Myers Squibb (BMS)**, which completed its acquisition of Celgene in **November 2019**.

**Commercial performance** – Zeposia generated roughly **$1 billion** in worldwide sales in 2022, with the majority coming from the MS indication.  It has become a solid, though not dominant, competitor to Novartis’s fingolimod (Gilenya) and the newer S1PR modulators siponimod and ponesimod.

**Mongersen** – The antisense drug mentioned in the article failed to meet its primary endpoint in a Phase 3 trial for Crohn’s disease in **2017**; the failure was confirmed in 2018 and the program was terminated.  No further development has been pursued.

**Celgene’s corporate fate** – The acquisition of Celgene by BMS closed on **7 November 2019** for **$74 billion**.  Post‑acquisition, the integrated R&D organization continued to advance ozanimod, and the regulatory misstep was largely resolved under BMS’s broader regulatory infrastructure.

**Industry impact** – The ozanimod episode reinforced the importance of early, thorough metabolite characterization, especially for pro‑drugs.  FDA guidance on “human metabolite” data (issued in 2019) cites the ozanimod case as a cautionary example.  The episode also illustrated that “refusal‑to‑file” notices, while rare, can be overcome with a more complete data package rather than being a career‑ending event.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** *“Celgene will have to re‑file next year; the setback will cost the company billions.”*  
  **Outcome:** Celgene (later BMS) did re‑file in early 2019, and the drug was approved in 2020.  The “billions” loss was mitigated; Zeposia’s sales have contributed positively to BMS’s revenue, though the RTF delayed market entry by roughly two years.

- **Implicit prediction:** *The metabolite issue indicated a systemic regulatory‑affairs weakness that would hinder future acquisitions.*  
  **Outcome:** Post‑acquisition, BMS’s integrated regulatory team successfully shepherded ozanimod through approval, suggesting the problem was specific to the Celgene‑Receptos hand‑off rather than a chronic cultural flaw.

- **Implicit prediction:** *With Biogen’s S1PR1 program (amiselimod) gone, ozanimod would become the sole next‑generation S1PR competitor.*  
  **Outcome:** While ozanimod did capture a share of the market, other companies (Novartis, Janssen, and Roche) later launched siponimod (May 2020), ponesimod (2021), and ozanimod’s own competitor, **cenerimod**, remains in development.  The field stayed competitive.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The article is a useful snapshot of a rare FDA “refusal‑to‑file” and of integration challenges after a biotech acquisition—issues that remain relevant for drug‑development strategy, even though the specific drama has been resolved.
