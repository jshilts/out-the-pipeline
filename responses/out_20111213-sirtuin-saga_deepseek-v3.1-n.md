# The Sirtuin Saga (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a Science magazine piece examining the growing controversies surrounding sirtuins—proteins initially celebrated for their potential role in aging and longevity. The sirtuin field had become embroiled in scientific disputes, with researchers (many from Leonard Guarente's MIT lab) engaged in bitter disagreements over fundamental questions about sirtuin biology. The controversy extended to Sirtris, a company founded to develop sirtuin-based therapies, which had been acquired by GlaxoSmithKline. The article characterizes the field as exemplifying the complexity and difficulty of translating fundamental biological discoveries into therapies, with basic questions about sirtuin function, mechanism, and therapeutic potential still unresolved despite years of intensive research and significant investment.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2011 article, the sirtuin field continued to be marked by controversy and largely failed to deliver on its therapeutic promises. **Sirtris and GSK**: Despite high hopes, Sirtris struggled to develop effective sirtuin-activating drugs. GlaxoSmithKline eventually shut down Sirtris in 2013, taking a substantial write-down on the $720 million acquisition. The lead compound resveratrol and synthetic analogs failed to demonstrate consistent benefits in clinical trials.

**Scientific Replication Issues**: Many key findings about sirtuins' role in longevity proved difficult to replicate, particularly claims about lifespan extension in organisms beyond yeast. The field became divided between researchers who maintained that sirtuins play important roles in metabolism and aging, and skeptics who argued that early findings were overstated or artifact-prone.

**Drug Development Outcomes**: No sirtuin-activating drugs received FDA approval for aging, diabetes, or metabolic diseases. While research on sirtuins continued, the therapeutic pipeline effectively dried up as major pharmaceutical companies deprioritized sirtuin-based approaches.

**Scientific Impact**: Sirtuin research shifted focus from lifespan extension to more nuanced roles in metabolic regulation, DNA repair, and cellular stress responses. The field became more cautious about therapeutic claims, with research continuing at a reduced scale compared to the peak enthusiasm of 2005-2010.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article mentioned several predictions, though many were implied rather than explicit:

• **That Sirtris could still become "a big diabetes/metabolism/oncology success story"** → This did not materialize. Sirtris was shut down, and no sirtuin-based drugs achieved commercial or clinical success in these indications.

• **That the sirtuin field exemplified the challenge of translating fundamental biology into therapies** → This proved accurate. The sirtuin saga became a well-documented case study in the difficulty of drug development, particularly for complex processes like aging.

• **Implied prediction that the controversy would eventually resolve with clear scientific consensus** → The field remained divided, though the therapeutic hype largely dissipated. Basic scientific questions about sirtuin mechanisms remained partially unresolved, even as clinical enthusiasm waned.

• **That engineering approaches to biology remained far from formalism** → This assessment proved prescient. The sirtuin story became frequently cited as evidence that biological complexity remains a major barrier to predictable therapeutic development.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article represents an important case study in the sociology and economics of biomedical research, capturing a field at a critical inflection point between hype and reality. While not revolutionary science, it documented a significant cautionary tale about translational research challenges.
