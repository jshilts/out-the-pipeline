## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 Science Magazine article by Derek Lowe condemns Retrophin's acquisition and immediate 20-fold price increase of Thiola (tiopronin), from $1.50 to over $30 per pill. Thiola treats cystinuria, a rare genetic disease causing painful kidney stones. Unlike previous controversial drug price hikes (like colchicine or Makena) where companies at least conducted new FDA trials to gain marketing exclusivity, Retrophin did no new development—they simply bought marketing rights and "slapped a new sticker" on an old, off-patent drug.

The article reveals Retrophin's strategy: exploit "closed distribution" systems—potentially abusing FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) programs—to block generic competitors from obtaining drug samples needed for bioequivalence testing. This effectively creates artificial monopolies even for drugs with expired patents. The author, normally defensive of pharmaceutical pricing due to high R&D costs and failure rates, expresses visceral anger at this purely extractive business model with "no development costs, no risks whatsoever."

## 2. HISTORY

This article proved stunningly prescient about Martin Shkreli's trajectory and broader industry trends.

**Shkreli's Downfall and Infamy**: Just one year later in 2015, Shkreli became globally notorious when his new company Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine), an essential antiparasitic drug used by AIDS and cancer patients, and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill—a 5,000% increase. The brazenness and Shkrelis public trolling on social media made him "the most hated man in America." In 2017, he was convicted of securities fraud (unrelated to drug pricing) and sentenced to seven years in federal prison—though ironically, his Thiola and Daraprim price hikes remained legal.

**Retrophin's Own Legal Victim**: In a remarkable twist, Retrophin itself sued Shkreli in 2015, alleging he had used the company as his "personal piggy bank" through fraudulent schemes. The company won a $65 million judgment against him. Retrophin later settled federal investigations by paying $15.8 million, admitting no wrongdoing but acknowledging Shkreli had engaged in improper conduct. The Thiola pricing strategy continued under new management.

**The Thiola Story Develops**: In 2017, compounding pharmacies began manufacturing affordable tiopronin alternatives, creating market competition despite Retrophin's closed distribution tactics. Some patients successfully petitioned insurance companies to cover compounded versions. By 2019, generic manufacturer Akorn attempted FDA approval for tiopronin, though faced distribution challenges.

**Broader Industry Impact**: The Thiola case became Exhibit A in congressional investigations into pharmaceutical price gouging. Subsequent FTC actions and the CREATES Act (2019) aimed to prevent REMS abuse for blocking generic competition—though critics argue enforcement remains weak. This pattern continued: in 2023, the FTC sued companies for using REMS to maintain drug monopolies.

**Cystinuria Treatment Advances**: Beyond pricing controversies, medical progress continued. New therapies like alpha-lipoic acid and cystine-binding drugs show promise, offering alternatives to tiopronin's limited efficacy (typically only 70% stone reduction). Some patients now combine tiopronin with other treatments, though Thiola remains the mainstay therapy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right**:

• **Predicting Shkreli's trajectory**: The author's visceral reaction and description of Shkreli's chortling presaged the public's later revulsion. This pattern—buy old drugs, jack prices astronomically, exploit regulatory loopholes—indeed became Shkreli's playbook, culminating in the Daraprim scandal.

• **"Giant hammer coming down" on drug pricing**: Correctly anticipated regulatory backlash. Congressional hearings, FTC investigations, state price-gouging laws, and public outrage intensified as predicted.

• **Reputation damage to industry**: Absolutely accurate—these scandals permanently tainted pharmaceutical companies' public image and fueled distrust.

• **REMS abuse vulnerability**: Astutely identified the legal loophole as both strategically powerful and ethically vulnerable, though underestimated its persistence.

**What the Article Got Wrong**:

• **Short-term pessimism about legal remedy**: The author worried REMS abuse had no clear solution. However, the 2019 CREATES Act did establish some legal pathways for generic manufacturers to access reference drugs.

• **Generic competition timeline**: Too sanguine about rapid generic entry. While compounded tiopronin emerged, full generic approval faced years of delays—even today some patients struggle with access.

• **Market self-correction**: Implicit assumption that market forces would quickly restore equilibrium proved too optimistic. Despite compounding pharmacies, many patients still face thousand-dollar monthly costs.

• **Broader Thiola availability**: The author underestimated how restrictions could persist even without strong legal precedent. Three decades after patent expiry, widespread generic competition remains limited.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 7**

This article earns a 7/9 for historical interest and lasting significance.

**Why it ranks high**: 
• **Prescient case study**: Thiola wasn't an isolated incident but a template for the pharmaceutical industry's extractive business models of the 2010s, culminating in the Daraprim scandal.
• **Lasting policy impact**: This exact controversy helped drive the CREATES Act and ongoing FTC scrutiny of REMS abuse.
• **Ethical significance**: The case crystallized public understanding of how pharmaceutical companies exploit orphan drugs for monopoly pricing.
• **Continuing relevance**: REMS abuse lawsuits continue today, using similar legal arguments to those previewed in this 2014 article.

**Why not higher**: 
• The core story—drug company jacks up prices—while outrageous, followed predictable patterns. The Shkreli saga made it famous rather than fundamentally novel.
• The specific drug affected only a few thousand cystinuria patients, limiting broad impact compared to mass-market drug pricing controversies.

This article's greatest value lies in being early documentation of tactics that later became infamous, making it essential reading for understanding pharmaceutical industry evolution post-2010.
