# InterMune Comes Through (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes InterMune's turbulent journey with pirfenidone, its drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). After initial stock volatility in 2010 when the FDA requested additional data, the company managed to complete the necessary trials and announced in February 2014 that it had met all endpoints in Phase III. The author notes this represents a significant turnaround, with the company's persistence appearing to pay off scientifically and financially, while also potentially benefiting IPF patients who had limited treatment options.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, several key developments occurred:

**FDA Approval and Market Launch:**
- Pirfenidone (brand name Esbriet) received FDA approval on October 15, 2014, approximately eight months after the Phase III announcement
- This made Esbriet one of only two FDA-approved treatments for IPF at the time (alongside Boehringer Ingelheim's nintedanib, approved the same day)

**Corporate Acquisition:**
- In August 2014, before FDA approval was finalized, InterMune was acquired by Roche for $8.3 billion
- The acquisition price reflected a significant premium over InterMune's trading value, validating the commercial potential that the Phase III results suggested

**Market Performance and Clinical Impact:**
- Esbriet became a commercially successful drug, though it faced competition from nintedanib
- Sales reached approximately $1 billion annually at peak
- The drug demonstrated modest but meaningful efficacy in slowing IPF progression rather than providing a cure

**Clinical Reality:**
- Pirfenidone's approval was based on showing a reduction in disease progression, with the primary endpoint being improvement in lung function (measured by forced vital capacity)
- The drug's benefits were statistically significant but clinically modest, reflecting the challenging nature of treating IPF
- Real-world uptake was substantial, as IPF patients had extremely limited treatment options prior to 2014

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article included several implicit predictions and observations:

• **"headed back to the FDA with what appears to be a solid story"** - ✓ Correct. The FDA approved the drug within eight months of this article, validating that the data package was indeed solid.

• **"the effort appears to have been worth it"** - ✓ Correct. The subsequent $8.3 billion acquisition by Roche demonstrated substantial financial worth, and the drug achieved blockbuster status.

• **Potential benefit for "people with fibrosis"** - ✓ Partially correct. While the drug provided a treatment option where none existed, the clinical benefits were modest, slowing rather than reversing or curing the disease.

• **Implicit success trajectory for the compound** - ✓ Correct. Unlike many drug candidates that fail after promising Phase III results, pirfenidone successfully navigated regulatory approval and market launch.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in rare disease drug development, documenting both scientific validation and the dramatic financial stakes involved. The subsequent acquisition and market success make this a valuable case study in pharmaceutical persistence and regulatory success.
