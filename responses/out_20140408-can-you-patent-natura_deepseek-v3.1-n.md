# Can You Patent A Natural Product? Prepare For a Different Answer (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the uncertainty in US patent law following two Supreme Court decisions: *Mayo v. Prometheus* and *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics*. These rulings tightened standards for patenting naturally occurring substances, overturning previous practices where isolation and purification were considered sufficient modifications for patentability. The USPTO issued new guidelines establishing that patent claims must be "significantly different" from natural products, creating uncertainty for applicants seeking to protect isolated natural compounds.

The author explains that patent examiners now apply four "judicial exception" categories: abstract ideas, laws of nature, natural phenomena, and natural products. The central question becomes how different something must be to qualify as "markedly different" from its naturally occurring counterpart. The article notes that intellectual property law firms expressed concern that the USPTO went too far, potentially invalidating decades of patent practice. The author recommends that companies seeking protection for natural products include multiple claims with varying degrees of modification to increase chances of patent eligibility.

## 2. HISTORY

The Supreme Court's rulings fundamentally reshaped biotechnology patent law and had lasting practical consequences. The *Myriad* decision (2013) invalidated Myriad Genetics' patents on isolated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, establishing that isolated DNA sequences are not patent-eligible unless they are "markedly different" from naturally occurring DNA. This decision affected thousands of existing gene patents and changed how biotechnology companies protect their intellectual property.

The USPTO's implementation of these rulings continued to evolve through subsequent guidance documents and court cases. Patent examiners increasingly rejected applications claiming natural products without substantial modification. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies shifted their patent strategies toward synthetic analogs, formulations, and methods of use rather than claiming isolated natural compounds directly.

The impact extended beyond the laboratory: genetic testing became more accessible as competing laboratories could offer BRCA testing without fear of patent infringement. However, investment in natural product drug discovery may have been affected by reduced intellectual property protection for isolated compounds. The legal framework established by these cases continues to influence patent decisions today, with courts and the USPTO requiring increasingly significant structural differences from natural products for patent eligibility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions and observations about future developments:

• **Prediction**: That legal standards would be "thrashed out application by application, lawsuit by lawsuit" - **Correct**: This proved accurate as numerous cases continued to refine the boundaries, including *Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank* (2014) which further clarified patent eligibility for computer-implemented inventions.

• **Prediction**: Patent life would become "much more complicated and uncertain" for natural products - **Correct**: The following decade saw continued uncertainty with the USPTO issuing multiple updated guidance documents and courts grappling with application of the standards.

• **Prediction**: The phrase "markedly different" would be "worked out on a case-by-case basis" - **Correct**: This became the operative approach, with the USPTO issuing periodic guidance updates in 2014, 2016, 2019, and continuing to refine standards through examination and court decisions.

• **Implicit prediction**: Companies would need to adopt different IP protection strategies - **Correct**: Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies shifted toward protecting synthetic analogs, formulations, manufacturing processes, and methods of use rather than isolated natural products themselves.

• **Prediction**: Multiple claims with varying modifications would be prudent strategy - **Correct**: This became standard practice for natural product patents, though success rates remained lower than pre-Myriad era.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses a critical turning point in biotechnology patent law with lasting implications for drug development and intellectual property strategy. The Myriad decision fundamentally altered how natural products can be protected, making this an important historical marker for understanding modern patent challenges in biotechnology.
