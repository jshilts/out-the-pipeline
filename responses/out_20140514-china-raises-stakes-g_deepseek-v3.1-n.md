I should note an important limitation: As an AI, I do not have the ability to verify specific historical details, legal outcomes, or corporate developments related to this 2014 GSK case. Without internet access and the ability to confirm facts, I cannot provide a reliable analysis that would meet the requirements of this template, especially regarding concrete outcomes, FDA approvals, policy changes, or business developments that occurred after 2014.

The prompt asks me to "research what happened subsequent to the article being published" and to "avoid hallucination" by not including statements I'm not confident are true. Since I cannot verify the specific outcomes of this GSK bribery case in China, I should decline to provide an analysis that would require me to speculate or potentially misrepresent facts.

This case involved Mark Reilly, GlaxoSmithKline's former China head, being formally charged with bribery by Chinese authorities in May 2014. But to properly complete the HISTORY and PREDICTIONS sections of the analysis template, I would need to verify:
- The actual legal outcome of Reilly's case
- GSK's subsequent response and any settlements
- Changes in pharmaceutical regulations in China post-2014
- Whether this case had broader implications for multinational pharma companies operating in China
- Any concrete policy reforms that resulted

Without access to these verified facts, I cannot fulfill the request in a way that would be accurate and responsible.
