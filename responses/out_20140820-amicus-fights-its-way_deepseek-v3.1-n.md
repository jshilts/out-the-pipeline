# Amicus Fights Its Way Through in Fabry's (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Amicus Therapeutics' persistence in developing migalastat, an oral protein chaperone drug for Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder. After a Phase III trial failure in 2012 that prompted partner GlaxoSmithKline to return rights to the drug, Amicus continued development independently. By August 2014, the company announced positive results from a second Phase III study, positioning the drug for regulatory approval and offering Fabry patients the prospect of their first oral therapy.

## 2. HISTORY

Migalastat (brand name Galafold) ultimately succeeded in gaining regulatory approval. The FDA approved migalastat in 2018 for the treatment of adults with Fabry disease who have amenable mutations - specifically GLA variants that respond to chaperone therapy. The European Medicines Agency had approved it earlier in 2016.

The drug represented the first oral therapy for Fabry disease, offering an alternative to enzyme replacement therapy (typically administered via intravenous infusion). However, its use was limited to patients with specific genetic mutations - approximately 35-50% of Fabry patients have "amenable" mutations based on the GLP HEK assay used for screening.

In terms of clinical uptake, migalastat established itself as a treatment option for eligible patients, providing convenience over intravenous therapies. However, the requirement for genetic testing to determine amenability meant not all Fabry patients could benefit. Amicus shareholders experienced significant volatility, with the company's value fluctuating based on trial results and regulatory decisions throughout this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Oral therapy opportunity**: The article predicted migalastat would give "many Fabry's patients their first opportunity for an oral therapy." This proved accurate - migalastat became the first oral treatment for Fabry disease, particularly valuable for patients seeking alternatives to IV enzyme replacement therapy.

• **Regulatory approval pathway**: The article anticipated regulatory filing based on the positive Phase III results. This prediction succeeded - migalastat gained both European (2016) and US FDA (2018) approval.

• **Patient population scope**: While not explicitly stated as a prediction, the implication was that this would benefit many Fabry patients. Reality proved more nuanced - only patients with amenable mutations (roughly 35-50% of the population) could benefit, limiting the overall impact compared to broader expectations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important milestone in rare disease drug development where persistence ultimately led to regulatory success, though the story reflects the reality that many breakthrough treatments serve subsets of patient populations rather than entire disease groups.
