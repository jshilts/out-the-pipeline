# Peer Review, Up Close and Personal (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the STAP (Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency) stem cell controversy, where researchers claimed to have created stem-like cells through simple acid treatment. The commentary examines referee reports obtained by Retraction Watch from the paper's earlier rejection by *Science* journal. These peer reviewers raised detailed, well-informed criticisms about experimental design, missing controls, insufficient methodological detail, and raised concerns about potential cell line contamination and artifacts. The reviews demonstrate exactly what scientific peer review is supposed to do: identify serious flaws and require extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims.

The STAP paper was ultimately published in *Nature* after being rejected by both *Science* and *Cell*, and was later revealed to be fraudulent. The author contrasts the rigorous reviewing at *Science* and *Cell* with questions about how *Nature* allowed publication despite these serious methodological concerns.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent events following this September 2014 article marked one of the most significant scientific scandals of the decade:

**Investigation and Retractions**: Within months, multiple investigations concluded the STAP phenomenon was fraudulent. Co-author Yoshiki Sasai, deputy director of RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, committed suicide in August 2014, before this article was published but highlighting the tragedy's deepening impact. Lead author Haruko Obokata was found guilty of research misconduct by RIKEN in April 2014, with the papers officially retracted from *Nature* in July 2014.

**Institutional Impact**: RIKEN undertook major reforms of its research oversight and ethics procedures. The scandal severely damaged Japan's scientific reputation and led to soul-searching about research culture and the pressure to produce breakthrough results. Several senior researchers faced career consequences, though Obokata's supervisor Teruhiko Wakayama continued his career in academia.

**Scientific Community Response**: The case reinforced the importance of rigorous peer review and institutional oversight. It highlighted the challenges journals face in detecting sophisticated fraud and the critical role of whistleblowers and post-publication peer review (like Retraction Watch itself) in scientific self-correction.

**No Therapeutic Applications**: Unlike legitimate stem cell breakthroughs that lead to clinical trials or approved treatments, STAP cells produced zero successful applications beyond the original fraudulent claims. The mechanism itself was never validated by independent researchers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions and assessments:

• **"Publication of these reports will occasion some very painful scenes over at *Nature*"**: This proved accurate - *Nature* faced significant criticism and embarrassment over the publication, damaging its reputation and leading to internal reviews of editorial processes. The journal became more cautious about publishing extraordinary claims without extraordinary evidence.

• **Implicit prediction that rigorous peer review (as shown by *Science* and *Cell*) prevents flawed publications**: This was validated and reinforced the importance of thorough peer review. However, it also revealed that even top-tier journals can be vulnerable to sophisticated fraud, suggesting peer review alone is insufficient without robust institutional oversight.

• **Suggestion that meeting reviewer objections "would have significantly improved the resulting paper"**: This proved prescient but underestimated the situation - the fundamental claims were impossible to validate because they were fraudulent. No amount of experimental refinement could salvage work based on fabricated data.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **8/10**

This article represents a crucial case study in scientific integrity, peer review effectiveness, and institutional responsibility that continues to inform policies and practices across the research community. The STAP scandal had lasting impacts on scientific publishing, research oversight, and public trust in science beyond just the immediate field of stem cell research.
