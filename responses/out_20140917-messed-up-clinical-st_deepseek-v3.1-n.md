# Messed-Up Clinical Studies: A First-Hand Report (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog reports on disturbing allegations of clinical trial misconduct involving an Amgen asthma therapy (likely brodalumab, an anti-IL17 antibody) at a Newport Beach, California clinic. The author cites a first-hand account from Brian Dunning, who participated in the trial and described technicians whispering instructions to falsify data, coaching participants on questionnaire responses, and bypassing required physician verification when the principal investigator was absent. Dunning ultimately withdrew from the trial to avoid contributing invalid data. The article emphasizes the serious implications for clinical trial integrity and calls on both Amgen and the FDA to investigate these specific allegations. It concludes by noting that Amgen had already begun investigating upon being contacted by journalists, which the author views as appropriate corporate response.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Context and Timeline:**

The article was published during a period when brodalumab was indeed being developed by Amgen for asthma and psoriasis. However, the drug's subsequent development trajectory provides important context.

By 2015, Amgen ended its collaboration on brodalumab with AstraZeneca, and development of the psoriasis indication was subsequently taken over by Valeant (later Bausch Health). In February 2016, Valeant submitted a Biologics License Application to the FDA for brodalumab as a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, based on three Phase 3 trials (AMAGINE-1, AMAGINE-2, and AMAGINE-3). The clinical data demonstrated strong efficacy in treating psoriasis, with high rates of skin clearance.

**FDA Approval and Real-World Impact:**

The FDA approved brodalumab (brand name Siliq) in February 2017 for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and had failed to respond to other treatments.

However, the approval came with an important restriction: a **Black Box Warning** regarding suicidal ideation and behavior. Clinical trials had shown that among approximately 4,400 patients treated with brodalumab, there were completed suicides and increased rates of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to placebo. This necessitated a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.

**Market Uptake and Industry Context:**

Despite FDA approval, Siliq has had limited market uptake. This appears driven by multiple factors, including the REMS requirement (which adds administrative burden and may affect prescribing), competition from other existing and emerging psoriasis biologics (including other IL-17 inhibitors like secukinumab and ixekizumab), and the black box warning regarding suicide risk, which tends to constrain patient selection and physician comfort with prescribing.

It's worth noting that other IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab/Cosentyx and ixekizumab/Taltz) have become major commercial successes in psoriasis and other indications, demonstrating that the IL-17 pathway remains a validated therapeutic target. Cosentyx has become one of the top-selling drugs in dermatology, with sales reaching several billion dollars annually.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific future-looking predictions, but instead reported ongoing immediate events and was structured as investigative commentary on trial misconduct concerns. However, one could infer some implications from the article's content:

- **Implied prediction about drug development impact**: If we extrapolate from the serious concerns raised, the implied question was whether such alleged trial misconduct would derail brodalumab's development pathway or lead to broader regulatory scrutiny of Amgen's clinical trial practices.

**Outcome**: Despite these early concerns about clinical trial conduct at one site, brodalumab ultimately gained FDA approval for psoriasis (though not for asthma, the original indication mentioned in the alleged problematic trial). The FDA's review process appears to have either addressed the specific concerns raised, or the problematic data did not materially affect the overall development program's viability, or the validation came from different trial sites and datasets.

- **Industry impact prediction**: The author emphasized the need for strong industry response to maintain public trust in clinical trials and prevent perceptions that misconduct is tolerated.

**Outcome**: The article itself documents appropriate immediate response from Amgen (investigating quickly when contacted by journalists). More broadly, clinical trial oversight has remained a recurring concern in the biopharmaceutical industry, with continued FDA inspections, warning letters, and ongoing debates about trial transparency and data integrity.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article provides valuable insight into the serious concern of clinical trial misconduct and includes the unique element of an investigative response unfolding in real time (Amgen launching an investigation). While the specific drug mentioned went on to some regulatory success, the broader issues about trial integrity remain highly relevant to the biotechnology industry, even if this particular case didn't develop into a major public scandal that derailed the drug's approval.
