# Retrospective Analysis: "A VC Firm Touts Its Successes - And Its Failures" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a novel approach by venture capital firm Index Ventures to increase transparency in biopharma investing. The firm planned to create a website detailing both their successful and failed early-stage biotech ventures, using a case study called "Purple Pharmaceuticals" as their exemplar. Purple was founded in 2013 to develop small molecule inhibitors of PCSK9 (a protein target for cholesterol-lowering drugs) that could be administered as pills rather than injections like the existing antibody therapies.

The article reveals that Purple spent approximately £300,000 over a year before discovering a fundamental scientific issue: their small molecule hits inhibited PCSK9's activity against external substrates but failed to inhibit the crucial autocatalytic activity that activates the protein in vivo. A conversation with Genentech researchers revealed that the company had already encountered this exact problem, essentially demonstrating why no effective small molecule PCSK9 inhibitors existed despite the obvious market opportunity created by successful antibody therapies. Purple was terminated as a result of this early-stage "killer experiment."

The article's author initially praised Index Ventures' transparency approach but then conducted additional research revealing that the scientific barriers to small molecule PCSK9 inhibitors were already well-documented in the literature by 2008, questioning why this information wasn't discovered earlier in Purple's development process. The author notes that PCSK9's unique autocatalytic mechanism and the fact that its catalytic activity isn't necessary for its cholesterol-related effects were already known, making the approach riskier than initially apparent.

## 2. HISTORY

Since the article's publication in 2014, several significant developments have occurred in the PCSK9 space and pharmaceutical transparency:

**PCSK9 Inhibitor Outcomes:**
- **Antibody Therapies Succeeded**: Both evolocumab (Amgen's Repatha) and alirocumab (Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent) received FDA approval in 2015 and have become successful treatments, though adoption has been slower than initially projected due to cost and access issues rather than efficacy concerns.
- **No Small Molecule Success**: Despite extensive efforts by multiple companies including Novartis, Merck, and others, no oral small molecule PCSK9 inhibitor has reached the market. The fundamental challenges identified in the Purple case study proved insurmountable.
- **Alternative Approaches Emerged**: Inclisiran (Novartis), an siRNA therapeutic requiring only twice-yearly dosing, received approval in 2020, providing a third mechanistic approach to PCSK9 inhibition.

**Index Ventures' Transparency Initiative:**
- The promised website tracking both successes and failures did materialize to some extent, though not as prominently as initially suggested. Index Ventures has continued to be a major player in biotech VC but hasn't made failure disclosure a central part of their brand strategy.
- The broader biopharma industry has moved toward greater transparency, with initiatives like AllTrials and requirements for clinical trial registration becoming more stringent, though corporate disclosure of failed early-stage projects remains limited.

**Scientific Developments:**
- Researchers have gained a much deeper understanding of PCSK9 biology, including its interactions with LDL receptors, genetic variants affecting cardiovascular risk, and potential roles beyond cholesterol metabolism.
- The structural challenges of targeting PCSK9 with small molecules (large protein-protein interaction surface, unique autocatalytic mechanism) have been extensively characterized, confirming the fundamental difficulties Purple encountered.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Matched Reality:**

1. **Antibody success**: The article correctly identified that PCSK9 antibodies would be "potential blockbusters." Both approved antibodies have achieved significant clinical success and market adoption.

2. **Small molecule challenges**: The author's skepticism about the viability of small molecule PCSK9 inhibitors proved entirely correct. No oral PCSK9 inhibitor has reached the market, validating both Purple's failure and the author's analysis that the scientific barriers were more substantial than initially apparent.

3. **Value of early failure**: The concept that "killing" unpromising projects early saves significant resources proved accurate. Purple's £300,000 expenditure was indeed modest compared to typical drug development costs.

**Predictions That Were Wrong:**

1. **Transparency adoption**: The article's optimistic prediction that Index Ventures' transparency model would catch on across the industry and help academics "see what needs to be done" overestimated the industry's willingness to publicly disclose failures. While transparency has improved in some areas (clinical trials), detailed public disclosure of early-stage project terminations remains rare.

2. **Information accessibility**: The author's implication that Purple's team should have easily found existing literature about PCSK9 autocatalysis underestimated the practical difficulties of literature mining and information synthesis in fast-moving fields, even with tools like PubMed.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 6/9**

This article warrants a high-interest ranking (7th decile) for several reasons:

**Strengths:**
- **Prescient scientific analysis**: The author's quick literature search revealed fundamental issues that accurately predicted the failure of small molecule PCSK9 inhibitors, demonstrating superior scientific insight compared to the VC-backed company.
- **Insider industry perspective**: The article provided rare insight into early-stage biotech project selection and termination processes, offering valuable lessons about preclinical strategy.
- **Cross-disciplinary learning**: The piece effectively bridged pharmaceutical development, venture capital economics, and scientific methodology.

**Enduring Relevance:**
- The transparency principles discussed remain highly relevant as the biopharma industry continues struggling with reproducibility, data sharing, and learning from failures.
- The PCSK9 case study has become a textbook example of the challenges in translating biological targets to druggable molecules.
- The broader theme of leveraging failure data to accelerate innovation has only grown in importance.

**Limitations to Score:**
- The article didn't predict the eventual success of siRNA approaches (inclisiran) or other novel modalities, missing some important future developments.
- The focus was somewhat narrow on a single therapeutic area and a specific VC firm's strategy.

The article remains valuable as both a case study in pharmaceutical development decision-making and an example of effective scientific skepticism in evaluating commercial biotechnology claims.
