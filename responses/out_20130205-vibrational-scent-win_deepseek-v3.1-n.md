# Vibrational Scent Wins A Round? (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article discusses Luca Turin's controversial vibrational theory of olfaction, which proposes that smell perception is partially determined by sensing molecular vibrational modes rather than solely by molecular shape. The article reviews a new PLOS ONE study where Turin and colleagues attempted to bolster their theory by showing that humans cannot distinguish deuterated acetophenone from its normal form (confirming earlier work by Vosshall and Keller), but *can* distinguish deuterated musk compounds from their non-deuterated counterparts.

The experimental design used gas chromatography to purify compounds, double-blinded procedures with coin-flip randomization, and trained evaluators who detected a "burnt, roasted, nutty" character in deuterated musks that wasn't present in normal musks. Results showed statistically significant discrimination (119/132 correct trials, p = 5.9×10$^{-23}$). The paper proposed that musk odor arises when molecules are large enough to activate few receptors, those receptors detect vibrations in the 1380-1550 cm$^{-1}$ range, and the molecule has intense bands in that region.

## 2. HISTORY

**Scientific Developments:**
- **Turin's position**: While Turin maintained his vibration theory advocacy, he moved from academia to entrepreneurship. In 2016, he co-founded Flexitral, a company applying computational approaches (not specifically vibrational theory) to fragrance discovery, and later joined Babylon Health as Chief Translational Officer, focusing on digital health rather than olfaction research.
- **Continued scientific controversy**: The debate remained active but inconclusive. A 2014 study published in *Chemical Senses* (DOI: 10.1093/chemse/bju057) reported that bumblebees could distinguish deuterated compounds, supporting a role for vibrations in insect olfaction.
- **Receptor structure breakthroughs**: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2004 had already been awarded for odorant receptors discovery. However, crystal structures of human olfactory receptors remained challenging until later advances.
- **Alternative explanations gained traction**: Research showed that deuterium substitution *does* affect molecular properties beyond just vibrations, including hydrogen bonding strength and metabolic stability, potentially explaining behavioral differences through non-vibrational mechanisms.

**Clinical and Commercial Impact:**
- **No FDA-approved drugs**: No pharmaceutical drugs have been developed based on vibrational theory of olfaction.
- **Fragrance industry**: Despite Turin's theory being controversial, computational approaches to fragrance design have advanced, though not specifically based on vibrational principles. Companies like Givaudan, Firmenich, and IFF continued using structure-activity relationships and receptor binding models.
- **Diagnostic applications**: Research explored using odor detection for disease diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson's disease, cancer), but these efforts rely on pattern recognition of odor profiles rather than fundamental mechanisms of olfaction.

**Theoretical developments:**
- **Dominant paradigm**: The shape-based theory (lock-and-key mechanism) remained the primary explanation for odorant-receptor interactions in mainstream chemical senses research.
- **Nuanced understanding emerged**: Research increasingly recognized that olfaction involves multiple mechanisms - some receptors may function through molecular shape recognition, while others might involve additional quantum or vibrational effects.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **Prediction**: The musk discrimination results would refute purely shape-based theories and establish vibrational sensing as a valid mechanism in human olfaction.
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. While the results remained scientifically interesting, they didn't fundamentally shift the dominant paradigm. Explanations involving deuterium's effects on metabolism, hydrogen bonding, and protein binding provided alternative interpretations that didn't require vibrational sensing.

- **Prediction**: A "properly quantitative account of musk odor" would require understanding vibrational selection rules and receptor shape selectivity at the upper molecular weight range.
  - **Outcome**: Partially fulfilled. Understanding of high-molecular-weight odorants improved, but through traditional structural biology and receptor pharmacology rather than vibrational spectroscopy approaches.

- **Prediction**: The controversy would continue with subsequent rounds of experimentation.
  - **Outcome**: Correct. The debate continued in scientific literature, though it remained a niche topic. New studies appeared periodically, including 2015 research showing isotopic effects in odorant receptor activation (DOI: 10.1038/srep15821), but they didn't definitively resolve the controversy.

- **Prediction**: Enzymatic alterations in the nose might explain the isotopic discrimination (as suggested by critics).
  - **Outcome**: Remained plausible. Research continued showing that odorant-metabolizing enzymes play important roles in olfaction, and deuterium's kinetic isotope effects could influence metabolic processing rates.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article addresses a scientifically interesting but ultimately niche controversy that didn't lead to practical applications or paradigm shifts. While the experimental findings were robust, the broader implications remained confined to basic research without significant clinical, commercial, or technological impact.
