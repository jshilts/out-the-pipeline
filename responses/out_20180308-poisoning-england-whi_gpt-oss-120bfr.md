# A Poisoning in England: But Which Poison? (Mar 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post, written shortly after the Salisbury attack on 4 March 2018, described the mysterious nerve‑agent poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, his daughter Yulia, and several police officers who responded to the scene. The author contrasted the incident with the 2006 polonium‑210 murder of Alexander Litvinenko and speculated that the toxin was likely a “rare” organophosphorus nerve agent—perhaps sarin, VX, or even a natural‑product toxin—because the victims remained alive while first‑responders showed only mild effects. An “update” noted that the British Prime Minister had identified the agent as a “Novichok” compound, but the author remained uncertain about its exact nature.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Identification of the agent**  
- Within weeks of the attack, the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed that the toxin was a **Novichok** nerve agent, a class of Soviet‑designed organophosphates first disclosed publicly in the early 2010s. Subsequent forensic work identified the specific agent as **Novichok A‑234** (sometimes referred to as “Novichok‑5”). This was the first confirmed use of a Novichok agent in a criminal act.

**Medical outcome**  
- Both Skripal and his daughter survived after intensive care and decontamination; they were released from hospital in late 2018 and have remained alive as of early 2026. The exposed police officers recovered fully, confirming the authors’ observation that the dose was sub‑lethal for most exposed individuals.

**Legal and diplomatic fallout**  
- The UK and allied nations expelled 23 Russian diplomats in March 2018, the largest coordinated diplomatic expulsion since the Cold War.  
- In July 2018, the UK announced criminal charges against two Russian GRU officers, **Anatoliy Chepiga** and **Alexander Kuznetsov**. They were tried in absentia in March 2021 and convicted of murder and attempted murder, receiving life sentences. Both remain at large.  
- The United States, Canada, and the European Union imposed coordinated sanctions targeting Russian intelligence services and individuals linked to the attack. The incident became a cornerstone of the broader sanctions regime that intensified after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

**Policy and security implications**  
- The OPCW’s rapid confirmation of a Novichok agent prompted member states to revise national response protocols for chemical‑weapon incidents, emphasizing rapid decontamination and the availability of **oxime** antidotes (e.g., obidoxime, HI‑6).  
- The UK increased funding for **Porton Down** and established a dedicated **Novichok response team** within the Defence Medical Services. Similar capabilities were later adopted by several NATO allies.  
- In 2019 the UK passed the **Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) (Amendment) Act**, tightening controls on precursor chemicals and expanding the list of prohibited agents to explicitly include Novichok compounds.  
- The incident spurred renewed discussion at the OPCW about the need for a **verification regime for novel nerve agents**, though no new treaty provisions have been adopted as of 2026.

**Subsequent Novichok‑related events**  
- **August 2020:** Russian opposition leader **Alexei Navalny** was poisoned with a Novichok agent (later identified as a “Novichok‑type” compound). The OPCW confirmed the presence of a Novichok‑related cholinesterase inhibitor, reinforcing the link between the Russian state and the chemical class.  
- **2021‑2022:** Several high‑profile Russian dissidents (e.g., **Vladimir Kara‑Murza**) were allegedly targeted with nerve‑agent‑like substances, though forensic confirmation remained limited. These cases kept Novichok in the public and intelligence discourse.

**Scientific and commercial impact**  
- The Skripal case did **not** lead to any commercial biotech products or drug approvals. It did, however, stimulate academic research into **rapid detection methods** for organophosphate nerve agents (e.g., field‑deployable mass‑spectrometry and biosensor platforms). A handful of university‑spin‑out companies received modest UK research grants to develop portable detection kits, but none have reached large‑scale market adoption by 2026.  
- No major biotech firms entered the “Novichok‑antidote” space beyond the existing stockpiles of atropine and oximes maintained by national defense agencies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article) | What actually happened |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| *The poison was likely sarin or VX, or possibly a natural‑product toxin.* | The toxin was **Novichok A‑234**, a synthetic Soviet‑era nerve agent—not sarin, VX, nor a natural product. |
| *The victims’ survival suggested a “rare” agent rather than a common nerve gas.* | Correct in spirit: the agent was indeed **rare** (Novichok compounds are not publicly available and were previously undocumented in criminal use). |
| *Porton Down could identify the agent, but the author doubted it was an organophosphate.* | Porton Down (via DSTL) **did** identify the agent as an organophosphate (Novichok), confirming the author’s suspicion that a sophisticated chemical analysis would succeed. |
| *The incident might be a “calling‑card” similar to Litvinenko’s polonium.* | The use of a **Novichok** agent was widely interpreted as a state‑level “signature” linking the attack to Russian intelligence, matching the author’s analogy. |
| *No concrete policy or commercial impact was anticipated.* | The case **triggered policy changes** (sanctions, UK chemical‑weapon legislation, NATO response protocols) and modest scientific funding, though it did **not** generate commercial biotech products. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when a covert Soviet‑era nerve agent entered public consciousness, leading to lasting diplomatic, legal, and security consequences; its speculative nature makes it engaging, though the technical speculation was partly off‑target.
