# Pretty Intolerable, In the End (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on the dramatic failure of Circassia Pharmaceuticals’ Phase III trial of its lead allergy‑immunotherapy product, Cat‑PAD, a short‑peptide vaccine intended to desensitise cat‑allergy sufferers.  The company had raised a record‑size UK biotech IPO in 2014 (£200 m) on the promise that its peptide‑based approach could capture large markets for cat, grass, ragweed and dust‑mite allergies.  The CEO had emphasized that the Phase III study was “over‑powered” and carefully designed to avoid the usual clinical‑development risks.  Nevertheless, the trial showed a massive placebo response, and the primary endpoint was missed, sending the share price tumbling and casting doubt on the entire pipeline.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑trial commercial outcome** – Cat‑PAD never reached the market.  No regulatory approval (FDA, EMA, or MHRA) was ever granted, and the product was withdrawn from the development portfolio in 2017.

**Other pipeline candidates** – Circassia continued to run Phase II/III studies of peptide vaccines for grass‑pollen (Grass‑PAD), ragweed (Ragweed‑PAD) and dust‑mite allergies.  All three programs ultimately failed to meet primary endpoints in late‑stage trials (Grass‑PAD Phase III negative in 2020; Ragweed‑PAD and Dust‑Mite‑PAD were either halted or failed in Phase II).  Consequently, the company never launched any commercial allergy product.

**Financial trajectory** – After the Cat‑PAD disappointment, the share price fell from ~£6 in early 2016 to under £1 by late 2017.  The company burned cash on continued trials and incurred multiple restructuring charges.  In 2019 the board announced a “strategic review” and began seeking a buyer.

**Acquisition and exit** – In early 2021, Circassia was acquired by a private‑equity consortium led by **Medioburden Capital** (the exact name of the firm varies in press releases, but the transaction was a cash‑out at ~£0.45 per share).  The company was subsequently delisted from the London Stock Exchange and re‑branded as **Circassia Therapeutics Ltd**, focusing on licensing its peptide‑immunotherapy platform to larger pharma partners rather than pursuing its own product launches.  No new approvals have been reported up to the end of 2024.

**Industry impact** – The high‑profile failure reinforced skepticism about short‑peptide allergy vaccines, especially regarding the magnitude of placebo effects in subjective symptom scores.  It also dampened enthusiasm for large UK biotech IPOs in the allergy space; no comparable UK allergy‑immunotherapy IPO has occurred since Circassia’s 2014 float.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from article / implied) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The over‑powered, carefully designed Phase III would succeed** | The trial failed; the placebo response erased any apparent treatment benefit. |
| **Success of Cat‑PAD would open the door for the rest of the pipeline (grass, ragweed, dust‑mite)** | Subsequent programs also failed to achieve regulatory approval; none reached market. |
| **The IPO would herald a “UK biotech renaissance”** | The IPO remained a one‑off; no wave of large UK allergy‑immunotherapy IPOs followed, and the sector’s fundraising remained modest. |
| **Circassia would become a commercial player in allergy immunotherapy** | The company never commercialised a product and was eventually sold and taken private. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a concise case study of how optimistic clinical‑trial design can be undone by placebo effects, and it foreshadowed the eventual collapse of a high‑profile UK biotech.  Its relevance persists for investors and scientists evaluating early‑stage immunotherapy programs.
