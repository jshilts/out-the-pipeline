# Getting Your Hands on All Those Three-Dimensional Structures (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article addresses a persistent challenge in drug discovery: the industry's reliance on flat, aromatic compounds for screening libraries. The author poses a practical sourcing question from a reader about where to find collections of molecules with greater three-dimensional complexity—specifically those rich in nonaromatic carbons and chiral centers. The piece acknowledges that this topic surfaces frequently in the industry, highlighting the gap between desired molecular diversity and what's commercially available. The author suggests starting with fragment-sized molecules, which theoretically offer better coverage of chemical space and may be more synthetically accessible, and invites readers to nominate suppliers who have responded to this demand.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following 2013 saw significant evolution in how the pharmaceutical industry addressed molecular complexity. The "escape from flatland" movement gained substantial traction, driven by growing importance and grudging admiration.* 

Sheesh. . . . though, to be the techniques that compare."
