# Write It Down, Write it Down (February 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a personal commentary about electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) in pharmaceutical/biotech research. The author enthusiastically endorses ELNs over paper notebooks, citing advantages like structure drawing, experiment tracking, data file attachment (LC/MS, NMR), ease of patent filing, and organizational searchability. The author mentions using two different in-house ELN systems and finds them superior to paper record-keeping, though notes they handle TLC (thin-layer chromatography) data poorly.

The article poses several questions to readers: recommendations for commercial ELN software, cost information, open-source options (mentioning Wetlab and OS-ELN), and a poll asking researchers whether they use paper or electronic notebooks, requesting context about their work setting (academic vs. industrial).

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following 2008, electronic lab notebooks saw significant adoption across the biotech and pharmaceutical industries:

**Industrial Adoption**: The pharmaceutical industry largely embraced ELNs, with major companies like Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, and Novartis implementing enterprise-wide ELN systems. This was driven by regulatory compliance requirements (FDA 21 CFR Part 11), intellectual property protection needs, and operational efficiency.

**Commercial ELN Market Growth**: The ELN market grew substantially, with companies like PerkinElmer (Signal/Highway), IDBS (E-WorkBook), Dassault Systèmes (BIOVIA Workbook), and LabArchives capturing significant market share. Pricing evolved from per-seat licenses (typically $1,000-3,000/user/year) to more flexible subscription models.

**Open-Source Development**: Open-source ELN projects received mixed adoption. While some academic labs adopted systems like eLabFTW and open-source alternatives, most institutions gravitated toward commercially supported solutions due to regulatory compliance requirements and support needs.

**Regulatory Impact**: FDA's focus on data integrity (especially post-2010) accelerated ELN adoption as paper records became increasingly non-compliant with ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate).

**Academic-Industrial Divide**: The correlation the author expected did materialize—industrial settings adopted ELNs much more rapidly than academia due to funding, regulatory pressures, and larger team sizes requiring coordination.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about ELN adoption and development:

• **ELNs becoming standard**: ✓ **Correct** - Electronic notebooks became the industry standard across pharmaceutical companies and increasingly in academia, though paper persisted longer in smaller academic labs due to cost constraints.

• **Superior utility of electronic systems**: ✓ **Correct** - ELNs did prove superior for patent filing, data sharing, and organizational knowledge management, with features like electronic signatures, audit trails, and integration with LIMS systems becoming standard.

• **TLC data handling gap**: ⚠️ **Partially resolved** - While some ELN systems improved TLC handling through image capture and annotation features, TLC documentation remained a weaker area compared to other analytical techniques like HPLC and NMR.

• **Open-source viability**: ⚠️ **Mixed outcome** - Open-source ELNs gained some traction in academic settings but failed to dominate, with most organizations preferring commercial systems' regulatory compliance features and vendor support.

• **Commercial market development**: ✓ **Correct** - A robust commercial ELN market emerged, though it consolidated around fewer major players (IDBS, BIOVIA, LabArchives, PerkinElmer) than might have been expected in 2008.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an important but ultimately narrow aspect of laboratory operations rather than fundamental scientific or therapeutic breakthroughs. While prescient about electronic record-keeping adoption, it's primarily a discussion of research infrastructure that would interest laboratory managers and informaticians more than the broader biotech community.
