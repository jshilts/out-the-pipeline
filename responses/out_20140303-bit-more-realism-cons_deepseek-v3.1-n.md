# A Bit More Realism in Consulting (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary critiques consulting industry perspectives on the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector circa 2014. The author contrasts two consulting reports—one from McKinsey arguing that major pharmaceutical mergers have generally succeeded, and another from Deloitte offering a more sober industry analysis.

The Deloitte report presents a mixed-to-concerning picture: despite an increase in FDA new drug approvals (39 NMEs in 2012), R&D returns had been declining since 2010 across top pharmaceutical companies' late-stage pipelines. Critically, development costs rose 18% from $1.094 billion to $1.290 billion (2010-2013), while forecast peak annual sales per asset declined over 40% from $816 million to $466 million. Total lifetime product sales also fell to $4.6 billion by 2013. The article notes both reports acknowledge pressures from patent cliffs on blockbuster drugs and healthcare cost containment policies.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in 2014 have largely persisted and even intensified in the subsequent decade:

**R&D Productivity**: The period 2014-2020 saw continued challenging R&D productivity across big pharma, though with notable variation by company. Many companies shifted strategy toward external innovation (licensing, acquisitions) and portfolio optimization. The biotech sector's role in early-stage innovation became more pronounced.

**Development Costs**: Tufts Center for Drug Development Research published updated figures showing prescription drug development costs reaching $2.6+ billion (pre-approval costs, capitalized), maintaining the upward trajectory noted in 2014. However, broader industry analysis has shown that costs vary dramatically by therapeutic area and development pathway.

**Sales Forecasts**: Industry experienced continued compression on revenue forecasts due to payer pressures, generic competition, and regulatory hurdles. This drove strategic shifts toward orphan drugs, specialty medicines, and oncology—areas with potentially higher pricing power.

**Biosimilars**: The biosimilar market grew substantially post-2014, though uptake in the US lagged Europe due to regulatory and patent challenges. Major biosimilar launches for drugs like Humira, Enbrel, and Herceptin occurred but often faced delayed market entry and legal challenges that tempered revenue projections.

**China Market**: The Chinese pharmaceutical market expansion did materialize, as hinted by the "Biosimilars...in China!" comment, though regulatory reforms, price controls, and intellectual property challenges meant uptake was slower and more complex than some projections suggested.

**Merger Trends**: Large pharmaceutical mergers continued through 2014-2020 (Pfizer-Allergan, Bristol-Myers-Celgene, AbbVie-Allergan), though value creation remained contested. Academic studies generally confirmed that R&D productivity often suffered post-merger, aligning more with the commentary's skepticism than McKinsey's rosy 2014 assessment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions and their outcomes:**

• **"Biosimilars...in China!" as growth opportunity**: Partially accurate but contextually complex. The Chinese market did expand significantly for pharmaceuticals including biologics and biosimilars, but regulatory complexity and pricing pressures limited rapid adoption. Western companies faced increased competition from domestic manufacturers and policy shifts favoring local production.

• **Declining R&D returns continuing**: Accurate. Industry-wide data continued showing challenging R&D economics through 2020, with only modest improvement in success rates despite new technological capabilities. Breakthrough therapy designations and accelerated approval pathways provided some mitigation.

• **Patent cliff pressures**: Correct. Multiple blockbuster drugs faced generic/biosimilar competition, intensifying revenue pressure on major companies and pushing strategic portfolio reshaping.

• **Merger justification narrative contested**: Validated. Evidence from subsequent major mergers showed mixed results on R&D productivity and innovation, with many independent analyses concluding value destruction outweighed synergies for innovation-dependent metrics.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

While the article correctly identifies important structural pressures affecting pharmaceutical industry economics, the commentary format and narrow focus on evaluating consulting reports limits broader significance. The core insights about declining R&D productivity and development cost inflation represent important but widely acknowledged trends, presented here without novel analysis or unique perspective.
