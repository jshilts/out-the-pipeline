# Verastem Takes a Tumble (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Verastem, a biotechnology company that went public early with a focus on targeting cancer stem cells—an area of both intense research and scientific controversy. The company had advanced its lead compound, defactinib (VS-6063), a FAK inhibitor, into a Phase II trial as maintenance therapy for mesothelioma patients who had completed chemotherapy. The trial was halted early when the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended stopping enrollment due to futility, indicating the drug was unlikely to demonstrate clinical benefit. Verastem's stock price fell sharply following this announcement, though the company still had other compounds in development within the cancer stem cell space.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 trial failure, Verastem underwent significant restructuring and strategic shifts:

- **Post-failure pivot**: After the defactinib mesothelioma trial failure, Verastem shifted its focus away from cancer stem cells and toward kinase inhibitors targeting the tumor microenvironment.

- **FDA approval achievement**: The company eventually found success with **COPIKTRA (duvelisib)**, a PI3K-delta/gamma inhibitor, which received FDA approval in September 2018 for treating relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.

- **Clinical setbacks continued**: Despite the approval, COPIKTRA faced challenges including boxed warnings for serious infections, diarrhea, skin reactions, and other adverse events, leading to limited market uptake compared to competing therapies.

- **Business developments**: In March 2022, Verastem announced it would acquire Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation assets and entered into various licensing agreements, and by 2024 the company was exploring strategic alternatives including potential sale or merger.

- **Mesothelioma field outcomes**: The broader mesothelioma therapeutic landscape remained challenging, with limited treatment advances in subsequent years, though immunotherapy approaches showed some promise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article made no explicit forward-looking predictions, instead focusing on reporting the clinical trial failure and its immediate consequences. However, the implicit concerns raised by the article's skeptical tone were largely validated:

- **Cancer stem cell hypothesis validation**: The underlying skepticism about cancer stem cell targeting as a therapeutic strategy proved somewhat prescient, as the field faced continued challenges translating the concept into clinical success, though research in this area persisted.

- **Verastem's viability concerns**: The concerns about the company's prospects following the trial failure were justified, though Verastem managed to survive through strategic pivot and ultimately gain FDA approval for a different drug—albeit one that faced significant commercial challenges due to safety profile and competition.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article captures a representative biotech clinical failure during the industry boom period, demonstrating both the challenges of drug development and the unpredictability of company trajectories when strategic pivots can later lead to FDA approval, even when initial approaches prove unsuccessful.
