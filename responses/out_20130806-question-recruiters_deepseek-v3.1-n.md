# A Question for Recruiters (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2013 article references See Arr Oh's "Open Letter to Biotech Recruiters" and suggests that biotech professionals and recruiters should read and consider the piece, regardless of whether they personally find it enjoyable. The article serves as a commentary on the state of biotech recruiting practices at the time, drawing attention to issues in how companies in the biotechnology sector approach talent acquisition.

## 2. HISTORY

The referenced "Open Letter to Biotech Recruiters" blog post by See Arr Oh addressed significant problems in biotech recruiting circa 2013, including issues like excessive job requirements, poor communication, unrealistic expectations, and a general disconnect between recruiters and the realities of working scientists' careers.

Following this period, the biotech industry experienced substantial growth and transformation. From 2013 to the present, the sector has seen:
- Significant expansion of gene therapy, immunotherapy (CAR-T), and mRNA technology platforms
- Major growth in venture capital funding for biotech startups
- Increased competition for skilled talent across therapeutic areas
- Evolution of recruiting practices toward more specialized, scientifically-literate recruiters
- Greater emphasis on remote work capabilities, particularly accelerated after 2020
- More systematic approaches to talent acquisition as companies scaled

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article has limited long-term importance as it primarily served as commentary linking to another piece about recruitment practices rather than addressing substantive developments in biotechnology science, technology, or business outcomes.
