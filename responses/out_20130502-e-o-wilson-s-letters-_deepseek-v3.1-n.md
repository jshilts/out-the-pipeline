# E. O. Wilson's (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a book review of E. O. Wilson's "Letters to a Young Scientist," which belongs to a genre of advice books from prominent scientists. The reviewer highlights Wilson's strong assertion that science is the superior method for understanding reality compared to religious belief systems, emphasizing science's role as the foundation of modern civilization.

The core advice presented focuses on several key themes: selecting research areas in sparsely populated fields rather than pursuing glamorous, heavily-funded topics; the idea that advanced mathematical skills are not essential for many scientific disciplines (including medicinal chemistry); and that extreme intelligence may be less important than sustained hard work and "entrepreneurship" (defined as opportunistic exploration through quick experiments). Wilson advocates for avoiding administrative roles to focus on research, maintaining constant engagement with problems, and being alert to unexpected findings that could lead to major discoveries—what Asimov called the "Hmm, that's funny..." moment preceding breakthroughs.

## 2. HISTORY

E. O. Wilson continued to be influential in the years following this book's publication until his death in December 2021. His later works included "Half-Earth: Our Planet's Fight for Life" (2016), which advocated setting aside half of Earth's surface for nature conservation, significantly influencing biodiversity protection discourse.

The book genre Wilson contributed to—scientist advice literature—remained popular, with numerous similar works published by prominent researchers. Wilson's specific advice about mathematics appears prescient given the growing importance of computational and data science in biology; ironically, the mathematical demands in many biological fields have increased substantially since 2013 due to bioinformatics, machine learning applications, and systems biology.

Wilson's emphasis on interdisciplinary work became increasingly relevant as fields like biotech converged with computer science. His advocacy for "sparsely inhabited" research areas gained renewed attention as funding became more competitive and researchers sought novel niches. The entrepreneurial aspect Wilson described—quick experimental iteration—became foundational to startup culture in biotech, particularly with the rise of companies like Moderna and CRISPR-focused enterprises.

However, Wilson's advice to avoid administration contrasts with the reality that many successful scientists increasingly needed administrative skills to manage large research teams and cross-institutional collaborations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains several implicit predictions about scientific practice and success factors:

• **Mathematical requirements would remain modest**: This has proven largely **inaccurate**. Post-2013 developments saw computational biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning become central to drug discovery and basic research. Many biological fields now require substantial mathematical literacy.

• **Success through hard work over intelligence**: This remains **plausible but oversimplified**. While sustained effort remains crucial, the biotech landscape increasingly rewards computational sophistication and technical versatility that require both intelligence and dedication.

• **Sparsely populated fields as optimal**: This has proven **mixed**. Some breakthrough areas (CRISPR, mRNA technology) became highly competitive while remaining revolutionary. The prediction underestimated how quickly promising areas attract attention and funding.

• **Administrative avoidance as optimal**: This becomes **increasingly problematic** as scientific projects grow in scale and complexity, requiring sophisticated management skills for successful execution.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides enduringly relevant insights about scientific practice from a major figure, with practical advice that connects to broader themes in research culture and biotech innovation. While some technical assumptions about mathematics have aged poorly, the core principles about research strategy and discovery remain valuable.
