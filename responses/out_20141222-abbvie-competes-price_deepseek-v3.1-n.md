# AbbVie Competes on Price (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post from December 2014 reported on AbbVie entering the lucrative hepatitis C market to compete with Gilead's established therapies. Express Scripts, a major pharmacy benefit manager, announced it would make AbbVie's hepatitis C cocktail its exclusive therapy in exchange for substantial price discounts. The article noted that while AbbVie's treatment was effective, it had drawbacks compared to Gilead's regimen, including requiring more pills and sometimes causing unpleasant side effects.

The author highlighted commentary from analyst Adam Feuerstein, who suggested this aggressive pricing competition could signal a major shift in the biotech market—from drug developers setting their own prices to pharmacy benefit managers determining what they would "allow" companies to charge. The piece framed this as the beginning of long-anticipated price competition between billion-dollar therapies, acknowledging that pricing power in biotech was not infinite.

## 2. HISTORY
The Express Scripts-AbbVie deal marked a pivotal moment in hepatitis C treatment and pharmaceutical pricing. In the subsequent years:

**Market Dynamics and Competition:**
- The hepatitis C market became fiercely competitive, with multiple players including Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni, AbbVie's Viekira Pak, and later Merck's Zepatier
- Gilead initially priced Sovaldi at $84,000 for a 12-week course, generating enormous revenue but drawing widespread criticism
- The competition did drive down prices significantly, with some health plans securing discounts of 40-50% by 2016-2017
- By 2018, list prices remained high but net prices (after rebates and discounts) had fallen substantially

**Clinical Outcomes:**
- Gilead's sofosbuvir-based regimens (Sovaldi, Harvoni, Epclusa) became the dominant treatments, praised for their high cure rates and simpler dosing
- AbbVie's Viekira Pak was effective but faced challenges due to its more complex regimen and some safety concerns
- Clinical guidelines evolved to favor certain regimens based on patient genotype, liver disease stage, and prior treatment history

**Economic Impact:**
- The hepatitis C drug spending surge strained healthcare budgets, particularly Medicaid programs
- Many states imposed treatment restrictions, limiting access to patients with advanced liver disease
- Pharmacy benefit managers leveraged competition to extract deeper discounts
- By 2017-2019, the initial wave of expensive treatments was followed by even more competitive pricing as patient pools shrank (due to successful treatment)

**Business Outcomes:**
- Gilead generated over $50 billion in hepatitis C drug revenue from 2014-2017, though sales declined as patient populations were treated
- AbbVie maintained a competitive position but never surpassed Gilead's market dominance
- The pricing pressure Feuerstein predicted did materialize across the industry, especially for drugs with competition

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Instead, the new question becomes: 'What will Express Scripts -- or any other pharmacy benefit manager --- allow you to charge for your new drug?'"**
  - This prediction proved accurate. Pharmacy benefit managers gained substantial pricing leverage, particularly in therapeutic areas with multiple treatment options. This trend extended beyond hepatitis C to diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and other competitive markets.

• **Implication that pricing power was finite and competition would increase**
  - This proved correct. While breakthrough therapies still command premium prices, the biopharmaceutical industry faced increasing pressure from payers, resulting in outcomes-based contracts, volume-based discounts, and formulary exclusions for higher-priced drugs.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article captures an important inflection point in pharmaceutical economics—the moment when aggressive price competition began reshaping market dynamics for blockbuster drugs, particularly highlighting the growing power of pharmacy benefit managers in determining drug access and pricing.
