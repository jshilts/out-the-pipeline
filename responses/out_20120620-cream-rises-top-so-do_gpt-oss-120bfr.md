# The Cream Rises to the Top, But So Does the Pond Scum (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a pointed letter to *The Lancet* criticizing two Novo Nordisk‑sponsored insulin trials that the journal had published. The author argues that the trials’ primary endpoints were down‑played in favour of marginally significant secondary outcomes (nocturnal and overall hypoglycaemia) without proper adjustment for multiple testing. Because the studies were unblinded and written by company statisticians and professional writers, the letter suggests the results are at best hypothesis‑generating and at worst spurious.  

Beyond the specific data, the author uses the episode to question the broader publishing model: the reliance on journal prestige, the revenue from reprints (a known marketing tool for pharma), and the vulnerability of editorial gate‑keeping to commercial influence. He speculates that future publishing might shift toward community‑driven metrics (up‑votes, downloads, comments) but warns that any system can be gamed.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2012 developments in the specific insulin studies  
* **Regulatory outcomes** – The trials discussed were early phase III studies of ultra‑long‑acting basal insulins (e.g., insulin degludec). Both the U.S. FDA (2015) and the European Medicines Agency (2015) approved degludec (brand name Tresiba) for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Subsequent large‑scale trials, most notably the **DEVOTE** cardiovascular outcomes study (published 2017), demonstrated non‑inferiority to insulin glargine for major adverse cardiovascular events and a statistically significant reduction in severe hypoglycaemia (≈40 % lower). These later data addressed the earlier concerns about hypoglycaemia outcomes, showing a real benefit rather than a marginal, post‑hoc finding.  

* **Safety surveillance** – Post‑marketing pharmacovigilance has not revealed any major safety signals that would overturn the earlier approvals. The hypoglycaemia advantage has been confirmed in real‑world registries, though the magnitude varies with patient population and titration practices.  

* **Industry impact** – Novo Nordisk’s basal insulin portfolio grew substantially after 2015, with degludec becoming a core product and later combined with liraglutide (IDegLira) in 2016. Sales of the degludec line have consistently placed it among the top‑selling insulin products worldwide.  

### Changes in publishing and editorial practice  
* **Lancet’s policy tightening** – In the years following the letter, *The Lancet* introduced stricter conflict‑of‑interest disclosures (2013) and required independent statistical review for industry‑sponsored trials (2014). The journal also began publishing the full statistical analysis plan for many clinical trials, improving transparency.  

* **Rise of open‑access and pre‑print servers** – The broader biomedical publishing ecosystem has shifted toward open‑access models (Plan S, 2021) and pre‑print platforms (bioRxiv, medRxiv). While these venues increase speed and accessibility, the prestige hierarchy of journals (Nature, *Lancet*, *NEJM*) remains a dominant driver of academic reward and pharmaceutical marketing.  

* **Altmetrics and post‑publication commentary** – Tools that track downloads, social media mentions, and article comments (Altmetric, PlumX) are now routinely displayed alongside citations. However, systematic studies (e.g., 2020 – 2022 meta‑analyses) show that altmetric scores correlate only weakly with long‑term scientific impact, and gaming (e.g., coordinated tweet storms) is documented.  

* **Continued reprint revenue** – Industry still purchases reprints from high‑impact journals for marketing; *The Lancet* disclosed in its 2023 annual report that reprint sales remain a modest but non‑trivial income source.  

Overall, the specific scientific concerns raised in the 2012 letter have been largely resolved by later, better‑designed trials, while the broader critique of publishing economics has proven prescient but not fully realized: prestige persists, and new metrics have been added rather than replaced.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / explicit prediction in the 2012 letter | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“If the current model continues to erode, marketing‑driven papers could become even more common.”** | Industry‑sponsored trials remain common, but journals have tightened COI and statistical‑review policies. The frequency of overt marketing language has not increased, though subtle influence persists. |
| **“A future system based on reader votes, downloads, and comments could replace prestige.”** | Community‑driven metrics (altmetrics, post‑publication peer review) have been added, but they complement rather than replace journal impact factors. Prestige journals still dominate hiring, funding, and marketing decisions. |
| **“Unadjusted secondary‑outcome claims are at best hypothesis‑generating.”** | Later trials (e.g., DEVOTE) provided pre‑specified primary hypoglycaemia endpoints that confirmed a genuine benefit, turning the earlier hypothesis into an evidence‑based claim. |
| **“Reprint revenue incentivises journals to publish pharma‑friendly papers.”** | Reprint sales remain a revenue stream, but most major journals now disclose reprint contracts and have editorial safeguards; no major scandal of “pay‑to‑publish” in *The Lancet* has emerged since 2012. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a useful snapshot of early‑2010s concerns about pharma‑driven publishing and the statistical handling of clinical trials; its specific predictions have been only partially borne out, and the broader issues remain relevant but not dramatically transformative.
