# The Ethics of Avastin (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reflects on the controversy surrounding **bevacizumab (Avastin)** for metastatic breast cancer. After an initial “provisional” FDA approval based on modest progression‑free survival (PFS) benefits, later trials failed to show a clear overall‑survival or quality‑of‑life advantage, leading the FDA to withdraw the indication in 2011. The author argues that Genentech’s attempt to regain approval by re‑interpreting the same data is scientifically dubious, and warns against relying on surrogate endpoints (like PFS) or anecdotal patient stories when evaluating oncology drugs. The piece calls for rigorous, well‑designed trials and transparent presentation of all data rather than persuasive rhetoric.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome**  
* **2011** – The FDA’s Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 12‑2 to *revoke* the breast‑cancer indication; the agency officially withdrew it in November 2011.  
* **2012‑2018** – Genentech submitted supplemental NDAs and appealed the decision, but the FDA never reinstated the label. In 2018 the agency formally removed the breast‑cancer indication from the product label, cementing the revocation.  

**Clinical use**  
* Despite the revocation, bevacizumab continued to be prescribed off‑label for breast cancer in a minority of centers, but uptake remained low because insurers generally denied coverage without an FDA‑approved indication.  
* The drug retained its approved uses in metastatic colorectal cancer, non‑small‑cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, and renal‑cell carcinoma, where it continues to generate substantial sales.  

**Commercial impact**  
* Roche’s global bevacizumab sales fell from a peak of ≈ $7 billion (2010) to ≈ $4 billion by 2020, largely because the breast‑cancer market was lost.  
* The controversy spurred Roche to focus on next‑generation anti‑angiogenic agents (e.g., ramucirumab) and on combination regimens in the remaining indications.  

**Industry‑wide consequences**  
* The Avastin‑breast episode became a landmark case cited in debates over the FDA’s **Accelerated Approval** pathway, which relies on surrogate endpoints. In the years that followed, the FDA issued stricter guidance (2014, 2020) requiring confirmatory trials to demonstrate overall survival or patient‑reported outcomes before maintaining accelerated approvals.  
* Several **bevacizumab biosimilars** (Mvasi – bevacizumab‑awwb, 2017; Zirabev – bevacizumab‑bvzr, 2019; others thereafter) entered the U.S. market, expanding access for the drug’s approved indications but not reviving the breast‑cancer label.  

**Scientific legacy**  
* The episode reinforced the oncology community’s skepticism toward PFS as a sole efficacy metric, prompting more rigorous incorporation of health‑related quality‑of‑life (HR‑QoL) instruments in pivotal trials.  
* It also highlighted the importance of **pre‑specified subgroup analyses**; subsequent meta‑analyses confirmed that bevacizumab’s benefit varied by chemotherapy backbone, but the magnitude never reached a clinically meaningful threshold for breast cancer.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Genentech would win a new FDA approval for Avastin in breast cancer** (by re‑interpreting the same data) | **Did not occur.** The FDA upheld the revocation; Genentech’s supplemental applications were rejected, and the indication was permanently removed in 2018. |
| **Progression‑free survival is an inadequate surrogate for real clinical benefit** | **Confirmed.** Subsequent FDA guidance and many post‑approval studies emphasized that PFS must be linked to overall survival or HR‑QoL improvements to sustain accelerated approvals. |
| **Anecdotal patient testimonies cannot replace rigorous trial data** | **Validated.** The FDA’s decision explicitly cited the lack of robust survival or QoL data despite strong patient advocacy. |
| **The controversy would pressure the drug‑approval system to rely more on solid evidence** | **Partially true.** The FDA tightened requirements for confirmatory trials under Accelerated Approval, and the ODAC process became more transparent for oncology drugs. |
| **Roche/Genentech would need to generate new data before trying again** | **Accurate in practice.** Roche shifted focus to other indications and later to newer anti‑angiogenic agents rather than re‑filing for breast cancer. No new pivotal breast‑cancer trial for bevacizumab has been launched since 2011. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in oncology drug regulation, illustrating how surrogate endpoints, patient advocacy, and corporate strategy intersect—issues that continue to shape biotech policy and trial design today.
