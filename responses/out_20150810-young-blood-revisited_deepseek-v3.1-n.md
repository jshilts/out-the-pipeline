# Young Blood, Revisited (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses research into the anti-aging effects of young blood transfusions, specifically focusing on early human trials by a Stanford startup called Alkahest. The company was conducting a small, blinded, crossover trial involving 18 people aged 50-90 with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, where participants received either young human plasma or saline placebo.

The author notes a significant practical concern: even if the treatment proved effective, the world's plasma supply would only be sufficient to treat approximately 3% of the global Alzheimer's population, creating an immediate supply bottleneck. Consequently, Alkahest and other researchers were actively searching for the specific active components in young plasma that produce these anti-aging effects, hoping to identify the key factors that could be manufactured rather than relying on blood donations.

## 2. HISTORY

The young blood research field has evolved significantly since 2015, though with mixed and controversial outcomes:

**Clinical Trial Outcomes**: The Alkahest/Alkahest-Grifols partnership progressed to larger trials, including Phase 2 studies of plasma-derived products for Alzheimer's disease. However, results have been underwhelming - none have demonstrated clear, reproducible cognitive benefits that would support regulatory approval.

**Scientific Developments**: Research has identified potential candidate proteins in young blood, such as GDF11, TIMP2, and circulating factors, though the field remains contentious with replication challenges. The therapeutic approach has largely shifted from whole plasma to identifying specific protein factors or developing synthetic alternatives.

**Industry Impact**: Alkahest was acquired by Grifols in 2019, reflecting the pharmaceutical industry's continued interest, though no young blood-based treatments have achieved FDA approval. Several other companies entered the space but have similarly failed to produce breakthrough therapies.

**Public and Ethical Issues**: The field became increasingly controversial, with some companies offering unproven "young blood" treatments through questionable clinics, leading to regulatory warnings and ethical concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable patients.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Alkahest's small trial leading to meaningful results**: The prediction (explicit or implicit) was that this initial study might show cognitive improvements by October 2015. **Outcome**: Initial results did not demonstrate clear efficacy, though research continued through larger trials that also failed to show consistent benefits.

• **Young plasma supply becoming a major constraint**: The article anticipated immediate supply problems if the treatment worked, with only 3% of Alzheimer's patients treatable. **Outcome**: This became moot since the treatment didn't prove effective enough to create demand, though it highlighted important resource considerations for plasma-based therapies.

• **Active components being identified as the solution**: The expectation was that researchers would isolate specific factors in young plasma that could be manufactured. **Outcome**: Partially correct directionally - research did focus on identifying specific proteins like GDF11, but these have not yet yielded proven therapeutic drugs with clinical validation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses a fascinating area of biotechnology with genuine scientific merit and captured significant public imagination about aging research. However, the ultimate clinical failure to translate these concepts into effective therapies, combined with subsequent ethical controversies in the commercial space, reduces its long-term importance compared to more successful therapeutic advances in the same period.
