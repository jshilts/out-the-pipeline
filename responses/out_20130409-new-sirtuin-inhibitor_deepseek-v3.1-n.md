# New Sirtuin Inhibitors (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2013 article describes a new Journal of Medicinal Chemistry paper from former Sirtris researchers reporting potent sirtuin inhibitor compounds. The compounds appear drug-like and include X-ray crystal structures showing binding to SIRT3. The inhibitors show pan-activity across SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3, with no selective compounds disclosed at the time of publication. The compounds were developed using DNA-encoded library technology—notably a different chemotype from previous work—and their activity was characterized using modified mass spectrometry assays. The author suggests these compounds would be valuable for sirtuin researchers in other laboratories.

## 2. HISTORY

**Sirtris and GSK Context**: By 2013, Sirtris had already been acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million, with high expectations around sirtuins as drug targets for metabolic diseases and aging. However, significant clinical and scientific challenges subsequently emerged. Multiple SIRT1-activating compounds (including resveratrol analogs) failed in clinical trials for diabetes and other indications, showing lack of efficacy or safety issues.

**Sirtuin Inhibitor Development**: While the 2013 paper reported *inhibitors*, the broader sirtuin field faced increasing skepticism. Subsequent research showed that sirtuins have complex biology—sometimes context-dependent opposing effects—making therapeutic targeting challenging.

**DNA-Encoded Library Technology**: This technology has evolved since 2013, with companies like GSK (which absorbed Sirtris expertise) continuing to use DEL for drug discovery. The approach has proven valuable for rapidly generating hit compounds against various targets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Sirtuin researchers in other labs to gladly take up some of these compounds"**: Reasonable prediction. Well-characterized tool compounds with X-ray structures are valuable for basic research. Academic labs did continue studying sirtuins, though overall enthusiasm declined after multiple therapeutic failures.

• **Implicit prediction that these drug-like sirtuin inhibitors could lead to therapeutic development**: The field's trajectory suggests caution. Despite continued academic interest, translation to approved drugs has not materialized. Sirtuin modulators have not reached widespread clinical use.

• **Success of DNA-encoded library approach**: This technology has seen broader adoption and commercial success, with companies like X-Chem and DyNAbind founded on DEL platforms, and major pharma companies investing in the approach.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

The article captured a specific research development during a period of active sirtuin investigation, but the broader field subsequently faced significant setbacks. While the technical aspects (DEL technology, X-ray structures) have lasting relevance for drug discovery methods, sirtuins failed to deliver on therapeutic promises, limiting this particular development's long-term impact.
