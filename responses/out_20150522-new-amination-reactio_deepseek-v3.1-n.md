# A New Amination Reaction (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a significant new synthetic methodology paper published in *Science* by Phil Baran's research group. The reaction is a radical-based amination process that converts nitro groups to N-alkyl amines under mild conditions using iron catalysts (Fe(acac)₂) and silane reducing agents. The process involves initial reduction of the nitro group followed by a zinc/HCl workup to cleave N,O-dialkylated hydroxylamine side products, yielding clean N-alkyl amination products.

The method demonstrates impressive scalability (tested up to tens of grams) with smooth reaction profiles showing no induction periods or exotherms. It exhibits excellent functional group tolerance including boronic acids, aryl halides, thioethers, free amines, and aryl triflates. The paper includes extensive documentation with 96 product examples across 350 pages of supporting information, and notably provides a transparent discussion of reaction limitations—nitroalkanes give low yields, esters adjacent to nitroaryl groups undergo hydrolysis, phenols/thiophenols are incompatible, and styrenes perform poorly as alkene partners.

## 2. HISTORY

The Baran group's radical amination methodology has had substantial impact in synthetic chemistry since 2015. This work is representative of the "redox-active ester" and decarboxylative coupling strategies that Baran's laboratory has extensively developed. While this specific reaction doesn't directly map to FDA-approved drugs, it exemplifies the broader push toward practical C-N bond formation methods that are widely used in medicinal chemistry and drug development.

The chemistry aligns with the pharmaceutical industry's ongoing need for robust, scalable methods to construct sterically hindered amines—common motifs in drug molecules. The emphasis on functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and detailed limitation studies has influenced how academic groups present new synthetic methodologies, encouraging more rigorous and practical evaluation criteria. The general approach of using iron catalysis for radical reactions has continued to gain traction in organic synthesis as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to precious metal catalysts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Versatility for complex molecule synthesis**: ✓ **Accurate**. The prediction that "a lot of variations that people will think of beyond what's been reported" has been validated. Radical-based C-N bond forming reactions using cheap iron catalysts have become an established tool in synthetic chemistry, particularly for constructing sterically crowded amine building blocks used in drug discovery.

**• Scalability and practical utility**: ✓ **Accurate**. The observation about good scalability (tens of grams with smooth temperature profiles) proved prescient. The general class of iron-catalyzed radical amination and decarboxylative coupling reactions has indeed found practical application in process chemistry and industrial-scale synthesis.

**• Broad adoption by synthetic chemists**: ✓ **Accurate**. The reaction exemplified a broader trend toward practical, functional-group-tolerant methods. While this specific transformation may not have become universally adopted, the principles it demonstrated—cheap catalysts, mild conditions, detailed mechanistic understanding, and honest reporting of limitations—have influenced synthetic methodology development.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating**: **4/10**

This article discusses an important but highly specialized synthetic methodology that has had academic impact within organic chemistry but limited broader scientific significance. While well-executed and practical for synthetic chemists, it addresses a relatively narrow problem in chemical synthesis.
