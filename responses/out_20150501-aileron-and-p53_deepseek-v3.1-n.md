# Aileron and p53 (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary discusses Aileron Therapeutics pursuing clinical development of a stapled peptide drug candidate targeting p53. The article notes that Aileron had raised substantial funding and was preparing for definitive human trials with this approach. p53 is described as a "great target" that had historically been undruggable through traditional methods, making it a reasonable test case for the novel stapled peptide technology. The author characterizes this as a "death-or-glory move" given the company's significant funding history and the high-risk nature of using an exotic technique on a target where all previous approaches had failed.

## 2. HISTORY

The development of p53-targeting therapeutics has remained challenging since 2015. The stapled peptide approach represents a protein-protein interaction inhibitor strategy that has shown mixed success across the broader field. Several companies pursuing stapled peptides have faced significant clinical hurdles, with some programs failing due to poor bioavailability, stability issues, or inability to achieve effective tissue penetration.

Aileron Therapeutics continued pursuing stapled peptide development, though the specific p53-targeting program faced the typical challenges confronting this drug modality. The fundamental difficulties of drugging p53 - a transcription factor involved in complex protein networks and lacking traditional small molecule binding pockets - have persisted as a major obstacle in oncology drug development.

The stapled peptide field has seen continued interest but has generally struggled to translate into approved drugs, with some programs advancing but many facing termination during clinical development due to the inherent challenges of peptide-based therapeutics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about Aileron's approach and the broader field:

• **"Death-or-glory move for Aileron"**: The outcome for Aileron's p53 program was uncertain, reflecting the high-risk nature of the approach. Stapled peptides have generally struggled to achieve clinical success.

• **Need for "real-world test" of stapled peptide technology**: The broader prediction that this technique needed validation through clinical testing has been borne out, with mixed results across the field. While scientifically interesting, practical drug development challenges have limited success.

• **Difficulty in making p53-targeting drugs work**: This prediction has held true; p53 remains a challenging drug target with limited clinical success despite decades of research, validating the article's characterization of it as undruggable by traditional methods.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an important but niche technical challenge in drug development but represents incremental commentary on a company's specific clinical strategy rather than breakthrough insights or broad industry impact.
