# "Okadaic Acid Makes Vanity Fair" (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a letter published in Vanity Fair magazine written by Steven Sabes, who responded to Nicky Hilton's complaint about journalists criticizing her work ethic. Sabes, then a 21-year-old PhD student in organic chemistry at the University of Minnesota, defended his generation's accomplishments by stating he was the first to synthesize okadaic acid—which he described as "the leading cause of breast cancer."

The author of the blog post acknowledges that Sabes' synthetic work appears legitimate (referring to his publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and work in Craig Forsyth's research group), but points out a significant error in how Sabes characterized okadaic acid. Rather than being the leading cause of breast cancer, okadaic acid is actually a marine natural product that acts as a phosphatase inhibitor, primarily encountered through shellfish poisoning. The article laments that while Sabes succeeded in bringing organic chemistry to Vanity Fair's attention, his scientific meaning was distorted or misunderstood.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent research and clinical developments confirmed the author's correction and provided additional context about okadaic acid's true role and applications:

**Scientific Research Applications**: Okadaic acid continued to be widely used as a research tool in biochemistry and cell biology due to its potent and selective inhibition of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. This property made it invaluable for studying signal transduction pathways, cell cycle regulation, and phosphorylation-dependent processes—not as a therapeutic agent, but as a laboratory reagent.

**Public Health Impact**: Okadaic acid remained recognized as a cause of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) when humans consume contaminated shellfish, but there is no evidence it became a major cause of breast cancer or any cancer in the general population. The compound's marine origin and exposure route (through shellfish consumption) remained the primary public health concern.

**Research Context**: The difficulty of developing phosphatase inhibitors as drugs, mentioned in the original article, remained a persistent challenge in medicinal chemistry. While some progress was made in developing more selective phosphatase modulators, this target class generally failed to deliver successful FDA-approved therapeutics, particularly for cancer, due to issues with selectivity and toxicity.

**No Clinical Translation**: There is no record of okadaic acid or its synthetic derivatives becoming FDA-approved drugs for breast cancer or any other indication. The compound's primary value remained in research applications rather than therapeutic use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original letter contained one implicit prediction and one major mischaracterization:

• **Prediction that okadaic acid synthesis would be recognized as important scientific work**: This was validated—Sabes' work was indeed published in a reputable journal (JACS) and represented legitimate synthetic chemistry achievement. However, the broader impact was limited to research applications rather than therapeutic breakthroughs.

• **Mischaracterization of okadaic acid as "the leading cause of breast cancer"**: This was inaccurate both at the time and subsequently. Research established that okadaic acid is primarily a marine toxin causing shellfish poisoning, with laboratory applications in cancer research, but not a significant cause of breast cancer in humans.

**Bigger Picture**: The hope that organic synthesis would gain broader public recognition through such media exposure was only partially realized. While this particular instance brought chemistry to Vanity Fair readers, the scientific inaccuracy likely undermined rather than enhanced public understanding of chemical research.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

This article has limited long-term importance as it primarily documents a minor media error rather than substantive scientific developments. While it touches on the broader theme of science communication challenges, the actual scientific content and implications are quite narrow.
