# Analysis of “Taking Risks - You Have To, So Do It Right” (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from Derek Lowe’s “In the Pipeline” column discusses risk management in drug development, building on insights from Michael Gilman’s LifeSciVC post. The piece highlights three crucial hypotheses that biotech companies must test: the **biological hypothesis** (how a molecule interacts with cellular targets and pathways), the **clinical hypothesis** (whether those interactions meaningfully improve patient outcomes), and the **commercial hypothesis** (whether the resulting drug offers compelling value to patients, physicians, and payers).

The author advocates for front-loading risk: identifying and addressing the most critical uncertainties early and inexpensively when possible, while preserving resources for high-stakes decisions. The article also discusses portfolio construction—ideally featuring multiple programs where major risks can be resolved before expensive Phase III trials, rather than maintaining a collection of “gigantic multiyear money furnaces” like Alzheimer’s or rheumatoid arthritis programs that concentrate immense risk in late-stage development.

## 2. HISTORY

The period from 2014 to the present has been transformative for biotech, with several key trends intersecting with the article’s themes:

**Capital and Investment Cycles:** The post-2014 era saw explosive biotech investment growth, peaking during the 2020-2021 healthcare boom, followed by a significant downturn in 2022-2024 as interest rates rose and investor risk appetite waned. Early-stage biotechs faced much tougher fundraising conditions, making Gilman’s advice about efficient risk management more relevant than ever.

**Clinical Trial Landscape:** The focus on Alzheimer’s and rheumatoid arthritis mentioned in the article proved prescient. Alzheimer’s drug development continued its horrific failure rate, but saw landmark FDA approval of Biogen’s aducanumab (2021) and lecanemab (2023)—controversial decisions that highlighted complex risk/reward calculations around surrogate endpoints and clinical meaningfulness. The commercial hypothesis for Alzheimer’s drugs became even more complex with CMS coverage restrictions.

**Hype vs. Reality:** The immunotherapy revolution fundamentally changed oncology treatment paradigms. CAR-T therapies demonstrated that “impossible” hypotheses could succeed, though at extraordinary cost and complexity—creating new challenges for the commercial hypothesis. Gene therapies faced a reckoning between scientific promise and manufacturing/commercial realities, with companies like Bluebird Bio struggling with pricing and market access challenges that perfectly illustrate the commercial hypothesis dilemma.

**Regulatory Evolution:** The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and FDA modernization efforts created new pathways for drug approval, including accelerated approvals and breakthrough therapy designations. This changed the risk calculus—allowing earlier commercial success but sometimes shifting the ultimate hypothesis testing to post-market studies, creating new categories of failures (e.g., accelerated approvals withdrawn when confirmatory trials failed).

**Drug Pricing Pressures:** The commercial hypothesis became dramatically more complex as payer scrutiny intensified, value frameworks emerged, and political pressure on drug pricing grew. The success of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss demonstrated that blockbuster commercial opportunities still exist, but required navigating coverage decisions and pricing pressures that didn’t exist in the same way in 2014.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions:**

The article’s core framework proved remarkably robust. The three-hypothesis framework (biological/clinical/commercial) became even more critical as:
- Gene therapies achieved biological success but faced commercial failure due to delivery challenges and payer pushback
- Alzheimer’s programs continued failing Phase III trials despite promising Phase II data (mismatch between biological and clinical hypotheses)
- Immuno-oncology combinations succeeded when all three hypotheses aligned, but failed when clinical benefit didn’t match the biological hypothesis

**The emphasis on front-loading risk** proved crucial as clinical trial costs escalated dramatically post-2014, with Phase III trials often exceeding $100 million and sometimes approaching $1 billion. Companies that could derisk key assumptions early (like Regeneron’s approach with antibody discovery) consistently outperformed those betting everything on single late-stage trials.

**Portfolio management insights** were validated when companies with diversified, earlier-stage pipelines (Vertex, BioMarin) weathered market downturns better than those reliant on single massive Phase III programs. The “money furnaces” metaphor for Alzheimer’s and RA programs proved apt—witness the spectacular failures of Alzheimer’s candidates and the immense costs of programs like Biogen/Eisai’s lecanemab development.

**Incorrect or Incomplete Predictions:**

The article didn’t fully anticipate how **platform technologies would change the risk calculus**. Companies like Moderna (established 2010, but still early in 2014) and BioNTech proved that building a technology platform could create a portfolio advantage that traditional one-drug-at-a-time development couldn’t match. The mRNA COVID vaccines demonstrated that some biological hypotheses could be validated at unprecedented speed, changing the risk/reward timeline dramatically.

The focus on traditional drug classes missed the emergence of **new categories with fundamentally different risk profiles**—cell therapies, gene therapies, microbiome therapeutics, and RNA-based medicines all presented hypothesis-testing challenges that differed from traditional small molecules and antibodies.

The article also didn’t anticipate how **digital technologies and AI/ML would reshape hypothesis generation and testing**. Companies like Recursion Pharma and Exscientia built business models around accelerating target validation and reducing biological hypothesis risk through computational approaches.

**Market Dynamics:** The prediction about portfolio construction proved only partially correct. While diversification remained important, 2014-2024 also showed that **platform companies** with a unified technology approach (like mRNA or CRISPR-based therapeutics) could justify concentrated risk differently than traditional small molecule-focused companies.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 7**

I rate this article in the 7th decile because, while it offers timeless principles about drug development risk management, its true value emerged through historical hindsight rather than revolutionary insight at publication.

The piece scores high for practical applicability—the three-hypothesis framework remains a useful mental model for any therapeutic development program. The emphasis on front-loading risk and portfolio thinking reflects deep industry wisdom that became even more valuable as drug development costs continued climbing post-2014.

However, three factors moderate the score:

First, the insights were already relatively well-established within drug development circles by 2014. The article synthesized existing wisdom rather than introducing novel concepts.

Second, while the framework proved durable, it wasn't particularly predictive of specific outcomes. Many companies followed excellent risk management principles and still failed due to biological complexity that overwhelmed even well-designed hypothesis testing.

Third, the article missed several transformative trends. It didn't anticipate how platform approaches, cell/gene therapy complexity, or AI-driven drug discovery would alter the risk management equation. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed how hypothesis testing could accelerate dramatically under extraordinary circumstances—the exact opposite of the careful, methodical approach advocated here.

The piece remains valuable as a solid "graduate-level" introduction to biopharma risk management, but represents 80th-89th percentile thought pieces rather than top-decile transformative insight.
