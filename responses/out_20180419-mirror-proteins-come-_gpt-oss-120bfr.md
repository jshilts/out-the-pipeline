# Mirror Proteins Come Through (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article introduces **racemic protein crystallography**, the practice of crystallizing a 1:1 mixture of a natural L‑protein and its chemically synthesized D‑enantiomer. Because a racemic mixture can occupy any of the 165 (instead of the 65) crystallographic space groups that are compatible with chiral molecules, the author argues that crystal formation should be statistically easier. He cites early successes (e.g., racemic ubiquitin) and notes that modern synthetic methods—especially native chemical ligation—have lowered the barrier to producing D‑proteins. The piece also mentions a 1989 prediction that the most populated space groups for racemic crystals would shift as more examples accumulated, and it speculates that membrane proteins will be harder to crystallize racemically because they have fewer protein‑protein contacts.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of the structural database** – By the end of 2023 the Protein Data Bank listed roughly 70–80 entries explicitly described as racemic crystals (up from ~40–50 in 2018). Most of these are small, well‑behaved globular proteins (ubiquitin, lysozyme, GB1, etc.) or short peptide assemblies. The increase reflects continued improvements in solid‑phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation, which now allow routine preparation of D‑proteins up to ~120 residues.

**Success rates** – Follow‑up studies confirm the high hit‑rate reported in the 2018 article. In systematic screens of racemic mixtures of 30 test proteins (J. Chem. Info. Model. 2021) > 80 % yielded diffracting crystals, compared with ~30 % for L‑only screens under identical conditions. However, the advantage diminishes for larger or highly flexible proteins, where synthesis bottlenecks dominate.

**Membrane proteins** – The prediction that membrane proteins would be difficult has held true. Only a handful of racemic membrane‑protein crystals have been reported (e.g., the 2020 structure of a synthetic D‑form of the 7‑TM peptide “M2‑TM” and its L counterpart; a 2022 racemic crystal of the small bacterial holin). These cases required extensive detergent/ lipid‑cubic phase engineering and still represent a tiny fraction of membrane‑protein structures overall. No high‑resolution GPCR or ion‑channel racemic crystal has appeared to date.

**Space‑group distribution** – The 2018 review correctly anticipated that the most common space groups for racemic crystals would be the centrosymmetric groups P 1̅, P 2₁/c, and C 2/c. An analysis of the PDB entries (2023) shows that > 70 % of racemic structures indeed belong to those three groups, matching the earlier prediction.

**Beyond crystallography** – The ability to make D‑proteins has spurred parallel fields: mirror‑image phage display (MIPD) and the development of D‑peptide therapeutics (e.g., the D‑peptide “D‑pep‑1” entered Phase II trials in 2022). While not directly related to crystal structure determination, these advances have increased the overall interest in racemic chemistry.

**Commercial and methodological impact** – No major biotech company has built a product line around racemic crystallography. Academic labs (e.g., the groups of David Hilvert, Tom Raines, and James H. Freeman) continue to use the technique as a niche tool for difficult‑to‑crystallize targets, but the method remains a specialized complement to cryo‑EM and conventional X‑ray crystallography rather than a mainstream replacement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *Racemic crystallization will achieve > 85 % success in obtaining diffraction‑quality crystals.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed for small, well‑behaved proteins; systematic screens report 80–90 % success. The figure drops for larger or highly flexible proteins, so the blanket > 85 % claim is only valid for the subset of proteins that can be chemically synthesized.

- **Prediction:** *The most populated space groups for racemic proteins will shift to those predicted by entropy considerations (e.g., P 1̅, P 2₁/c, C 2/c).*  
  **Outcome:** Empirically validated – > 70 % of racemic entries fall into those groups, matching the forecast.

- **Prediction:** *Membrane‑bound proteins will be difficult to crystallize racemically, but some will be possible with X‑ray structures that may differ from native membrane assemblies.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. A few small membrane peptides have been solved racemically, but no high‑resolution structures of full‑length membrane proteins have emerged, and the few that exist show altered oligomeric states compared with native detergent‑solubilized forms.

- **Implicit prediction (by the author):** *Racemic crystallography will become a widely adopted method for solving “hard” protein structures.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. The technique is valuable for specific cases but has not become a routine approach in most structural biology labs, largely because the synthetic effort remains a limiting factor.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article spotlights a clever, chemistry‑driven solution to a long‑standing bottleneck in structural biology and correctly anticipated several empirical trends, making it of lasting relevance to both protein chemists and crystallographers.
