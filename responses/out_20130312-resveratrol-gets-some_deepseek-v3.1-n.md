# Resveratrol Gets Some Details Cleared Up (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a March 2013 *Science* paper from David Sinclair's lab that attempted to clarify the molecular mechanism of resveratrol's action on the SIRT1 enzyme. The backstory involves resveratrol originally being identified as a SIRT1 activator, but subsequent work revealed that the initial assays contained artifacts from fluorescent tagged peptides that produced false positives. The new research suggested these fluorescent tags were actually mimicking natural protein partners, as SIRT1 recognizes hydrophobic domains present in both the artificial tags and native proteins. The paper identified a specific SIRT1 mutation (E230K) that didn't affect SIRT1's catalytic activity but eliminated resveratrol's ability to activate it, supporting an allosteric activation mechanism.

However, the article highlights that these mechanistic findings don't resolve the bigger translational questions about SIRT1 as a human drug target. Resveratrol itself was described as a "dirty molecule" with poor pharmacokinetic properties and off-target effects, making it unsuitable as a definitive test of SIRT1 activation as a therapeutic strategy. The article notes that GSK's synthetic sirtuin activators (SRT2104 and SRT2379) were the more relevant test vehicles, with several clinical trials completed or ongoing by 2013, though GSK's massive investment in Sirtris had not yet produced a drug or prime-time candidate, with multiple compounds having been discontinued after initial human studies.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in 2013, the SIRT1 activation field experienced significant setbacks and ultimately failed to deliver on its therapeutic promise:

**Clinical Development Outcomes:**
- GSK discontinued development of SRT2104 and SRT2379 after they failed to show meaningful clinical efficacy in various disease indications
- No SIRT1 activator has received FDA approval for any therapeutic indication
- The clinical trials mentioned in the article (including NCT01453491) ultimately did not lead to approved drugs

**Scientific Developments:**
- Research continued to reveal complexities in SIRT1 biology that complicated simple activation strategies
- Evidence accumulated that resveratrol's effects were largely independent of SIRT1 activation, supporting the "dirty molecule" characterization
- The mechanistic understanding of SIRT1 regulation became more nuanced, involving multiple protein partners and post-translational modifications

**Business Impact:**
- GSK's $720 million acquisition of Sirtris in 2008 became viewed as one of the more notable pharmaceutical industry failures
- The investment did not yield any marketed drugs or significant pipeline candidates
- The episode served as a cautionary tale about premature translation of basic science discoveries

**Current Status:**
The SIRT1 activation strategy as a therapeutic approach has largely been abandoned. While SIRT1 remains an important area of basic research, the clinical translation pathway that appeared promising in the late 2000s and early 2010s has not materialized. The field shifted focus from SIRT1 activation to better understanding its complex physiological roles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions about the future of SIRT1 activation research:

- **Implicit: SIRT1 activators would provide definitive answers about SIRT1 as a drug target** - This did not materialize. The synthetic activators failed in clinical trials
- **Implicit: GSK's synthetic compounds (SRT2104, SRT2379) would answer whether SIRT1 activation has beneficial effects** - These compounds were discontinued, and the strategy was ultimately abandoned
- **Explicit: The March 2013 *Science* paper might be the "precise mechanism" needed** - The mechanistic insights did not translate to clinical success
- **Implicit: Understanding allosteric activation would enable better drug design** - While mechanistically interesting, this did not lead to successful therapeutics

The broader prediction that SIRT1 activation would become an important therapeutic strategy completely failed. Rather than becoming a validated drug target, SIRT1 activation represents a cautionary example of premature translation from basic science to clinical development.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an important historical marker in a significant biotechnology story - one that combines substantial scientific interest with substantial commercial failure, making it valuable for understanding the challenges of drug development and the gap between mechanism and therapeutic application. The GSK/Sirtris case became a well-known example of a high-profile pharmaceutical acquisition that failed to deliver, providing lessons about translating basic biology into medicines.
