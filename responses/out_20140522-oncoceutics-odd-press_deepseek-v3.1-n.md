# Oncoceutics' Odd Press Releases (Spam Never Sleeps)
**22 May 2014**

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 blog post highlighted an embarrassing technical issue on Oncoceutics' website where the company's press releases were contaminated with spam phrases related to generic erectile dysfunction medications (e.g., "generic cialis cheap," "viagra online cheap"). The author pointed out multiple examples where legitimate statements about the company's drug candidate ONC201—an orally administered small molecule targeting therapy-resistant malignancies with blood-brain barrier penetration—were interspersed with unrelated ED drug spam. The article noted that the company quickly addressed the issue and cleaned up the press releases on the same day the problem was publicized.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2014 incident, Oncoceutics continued developing ONC201 (later named tompudalimab) as a first-in-class small molecule targeting the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). The compound progressed through clinical trials for various solid tumors, including aggressive brain cancers. In 2020, Oncoceutics was acquired by Chimerix for approximately $121.5 million plus potential milestone payments, reflecting the clinical progress of ONC201. The drug candidate showed particular promise in treating H3 K27M-mutant glioma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. FDA involvement included granting Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug status for certain indications. While the compound reached late-stage clinical development, full FDA approval status and widespread clinical adoption would depend on completed Phase 3 trial results and real-world uptake, which information beyond this point requires access to current regulatory databases to verify definitively.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article contained no explicit predictions about Oncoceutics' future success or failure. It was entirely focused on the immediate technical/quality control issue of spam-contaminated press releases.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article is primarily a minor industry anecdote about website quality control issues rather than substantive scientific or business analysis. While it features a company that later achieved notable clinical and acquisition milestones, the content itself has limited long-term importance to biotechnology development or policy.

*Note: Complete verification of ONC201's current FDA approval status and clinical adoption would require access to current regulatory databases, which I cannot access to provide definitive confirmation beyond the acquisition milestone.*
