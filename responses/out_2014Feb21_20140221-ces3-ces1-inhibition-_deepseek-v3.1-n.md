# Retrospective Analysis: Ces3 (Ces1) Inhibition As a Drug Target

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 blog post from Derek Lowe discusses promising research from Benjamin Cravatt's group on carboxylesterase 3 (Ces3) as a potential drug target for metabolic diseases. The article describes how the researchers used activity-based proteomics to identify Ces3 through phenotypic screening of adipocyte behavior—specifically cell differentiation and lipid accumulation—then worked backward to identify the responsible enzyme.

The key finding was that pharmacological inhibition of Ces3 produced beneficial effects resembling earlier genetic knockout studies, including improved glucose tolerance, better lipid profiles, and notably, clearance of fat deposits from the liver (hepatic steatosis). Two carbamate inhibitors (WWL113 and the more selective WWL229) were profiled, with in vivo mouse studies showing multiple positive metabolic effects that could address metabolic syndrome.

## 2. HISTORY

In the eleven years following this article, the trajectory of Ces3 inhibition has been more complex and uncertain than the promising 2014 results suggested. Despite the strong preclinical validation and the involvement of prestigious researchers, **Ces3 inhibition has not yet translated into approved therapies**.

**Academic Research Continuation**: Research on Ces3 (reclassified as Ces1 in humans) continued through the 2010s, with multiple groups publishing on its role in lipid metabolism, particularly in adipose tissue and liver. Studies confirmed that Ces1 expression correlates with metabolic dysfunction and that its inhibition reduces hepatic steatosis in various animal models.

**Translational Stagnation**: However, the path from animal studies to human therapies proved more challenging. The selectivity issues hinted at in the original article—the enzyme's broad substrate specificity and the complexity of serine hydrolase networks—likely contributed to difficulties in developing clinically viable inhibitors. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, while research papers on Ces1/Ces3 continued to appear, no major pharmaceutical company had advanced a Ces1 inhibitor into late-stage clinical trials for metabolic diseases.

**Recent Developments (2023-2024)**: Some renewed interest has emerged in targeting Ces1, but primarily for **different indications** than originally envisioned. Recent patent literature and early-stage company activity suggest Ces1 inhibition is being explored for cardiovascular applications rather than metabolic syndrome, recognizing the enzyme's role in processing various lipid metabolites that affect cardiovascular function.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Matched Reality**:
- The basic science was solid: Subsequent research confirmed Ces1/Ces3's important role in lipid metabolism and its connection to metabolic phenotypes
- The approach of activity-based proteomics has proven valuable for target discovery
- The target has remained of scientific interest for over a decade

**Predictions That Were Wrong**:
- **Timeline optimism**: The implicit expectation of relatively quick translation (typical pharma thinking in 2014) didn't materialize. Eleven years later, we still lack approved Ces1 inhibitor drugs
- **Disease focus**: The primary application shifted away from metabolic syndrome/diabetes toward different therapeutic areas
- **Commercial viability**: Despite solid academic interest, no blockbuster drugs emerged from this target as originally hoped
- **Technical ease**: The selectivity and pharmacology challenges proved more substantial than acknowledged

**Complex Outcomes**:
- The target validation was accurate, but the "druggability" proved more complex
- Off-target effects and the systemic nature of metabolic regulation created unexpected hurdles
- The field learned valuable lessons about the gap between phenotypic screening hits and viable drug candidates

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 4**

This article ranks in the **4th decile** (30-40th percentile) for long-term interest and importance.

**Rationale**: While this represents solid, rigorous science and the target remains biologically interesting, the **practical impact has been modest**. The 2014 article captured genuine scientific enthusiasm for a well-validated target with therapeutic potential. However, more than a decade later, the lack of clinical translation despite the promising preclinical data makes this more of a scientific cautionary tale than a breakthrough success story.

The case of Ces1/Ces3 illustrates several important realities in drug discovery:
- The enormous gap between hitting phenotypic endpoints in mouse models and achieving clinical success
- The challenge of achieving sufficient selectivity among serine hydrolases
- The unpredictability of which targets will ultimately prove "druggable"

This moderate interest score reflects that while the research was well-conducted and scientifically sound, it hasn't led to the kind of clinical or commercial breakthroughs that would place it in the upper deciles of biotech importance. It's a valuable case study in target validation but falls short of transformative impact.
