# More Ricin (January 2003)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses reader questions about ricin as a potential weapon, specifically discussing two scenarios: dissolving ricin in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) for transdermal delivery, and using ricin for food adulteration. The author analyzes the technical feasibility of both approaches from a biochemical perspective. For the DMSO method, they express skepticism that ricin would maintain its toxic activity after dissolution, citing protein denaturation and instability of disulfide bonds in organic solvents. For food contamination, they note practical challenges including taste detection and heat stability issues.

## 2. HISTORY

The ricin threat described in this article became more reality than speculation in subsequent years. In 2003 and 2004, several ricin incidents actually occurred, including discoveries at a postal facility in South Carolina and threats involving ricin-laced letters sent to government officials. However, these incidents resulted in minimal actual harm - no deaths from the 2003-2004 events. This aligns with the article's implicit theme that practical difficulties make ricin less effective as a weapon than feared.

Ricin attacks continued sporadically. In 2013, ricin-tainted letters were sent to President Obama and other officials, leading to arrests but no casualties. The most notable ricin-related death occurred in 2018 when a woman died after handling homemade ricin preparations in West Virginia, demonstrating that while ricin can kill, amateur production carries significant risks for the perpetrator.

The broader biosecurity landscape saw increased attention to ricin detection methods and regulatory controls. The FBI and CDC classified ricin as a biological threat agent, leading to enhanced screening protocols at mail facilities and other secure locations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions through its skeptical analysis:

• **Ricin's instability in DMSO**: The author predicted ricin would denature and lose activity in organic solvents like DMSO. This prediction has proven largely accurate - there have been no documented successful uses of transdermal ricin delivery, and the technical challenges of maintaining protein stability in organic solvents remain significant barriers in biochemical applications.

• **Food adulteration impractical**: The prediction that taste alteration and heat instability would make food contamination difficult appears validated. Despite occasional food tampering scares involving various substances, ricin has not emerged as a practical food adulteration agent.

• **General difficulty of weaponization**: While not explicitly stated, the tone suggests ricin would prove harder to weaponize effectively than might be feared. This has held true - despite periodic ricin incidents, the actual threat has remained limited, with most incidents resulting in arrests rather than casualties, supporting the author's implicit assessment of practical difficulties.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article addresses a niche biosecurity topic with technical biochemical analysis, but ricin has remained a relatively minor threat compared to other security concerns. The technical perspective and accurate assessment of practical challenges gives it some enduring relevance for understanding bioweapon feasibility.
