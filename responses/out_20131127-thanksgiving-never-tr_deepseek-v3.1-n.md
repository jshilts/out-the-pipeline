# Thanksgiving: Never Trust An Organic Chemist Who Can't Cook (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a personal Thanksgiving cooking blog post by Derek Lowe, an organic chemist who writes about science and biotechnology. The article describes his traditional Thanksgiving meal preparations, including his twenty-year tradition of making chocolate pecan pie (based on Craig Claiborne's recipe), pumpkin pie, and various side dishes. He mentions buying a kosher turkey, making green beans with country ham, Iranian basmati rice with saffron and nuts, mashed potatoes, creamed onions, Brussels sprouts, pepperoni stuffing, and an experimental Russian sour cabbage dish. The article is essentially a culinary diary entry rather than a scientific or biotech industry commentary.

## 2. HISTORY
This blog post was part of Derek Lowe's regular blogging for Science Magazine's "In the Pipeline" column. Lowe continued writing about pharmaceutical chemistry and drug discovery for many years after this post. His blog became one of the most widely read sources for pharmaceutical industry commentary and insider perspectives on drug development. The post itself had no direct impact on the biotechnology industry, FDA approvals, clinical trials, or public policy, as it was purely a personal cooking-related piece for the Thanksgiving holiday. The recipes and cooking techniques mentioned had no measurable effect on scientific methods, business growth, or drug development pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained no predictions about the biotechnology industry, drug development, or scientific advances. It was entirely focused on immediate Thanksgiving cooking plans and did not attempt to forecast future developments in any field.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 0/9**

This ranks in the bottom 10% of interest for biotechnology industry analysis. While Derek Lowe's blog is generally highly regarded for pharmaceutical industry insights, this particular post is a personal cooking diary with no relevance to biotechnology, drug development, or scientific advances. It was clearly intended as light holiday content rather than substantive industry commentary.
