# Who Needs A Control Arm? (Oct 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article criticises Cel‑Gene’s decision to report results from a small, open‑label study of the antisense oligonucleotide GED‑0301 (brand name **mongersen**) in Crohn’s disease without a placebo arm. The Phase II trial showed a ~15 % clinical response, a figure the author notes is comparable to typical placebo response rates in Crohn’s trials, making it impossible to tell whether mongersen was truly effective. The piece highlights the hype that surrounded the drug after Cel‑Gene’s 2014 acquisition of the original developer, points out the pressure to prove efficacy before the Phase III trial (then expected to finish in 2018), and suggests that the lack of a control group may have been a deliberate move to avoid an unfavorable comparison.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Phase III trial and failure (2018‑2019)**  
- Cel‑Gene (later part of Bristol‑Myers Squibb after the 2019 acquisition) completed a pivotal Phase III study (NCT02316591) enrolling ~400 patients with moderate‑to‑severe Crohn’s disease.  
- Results, released in early 2019, showed **no statistically significant difference** between mongersen and placebo on the primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 12. Secondary endpoints (endoscopic response, steroid‑free remission) were also negative.  
- In March 2019 Cel‑Gene announced the **termination of mongersen’s development** and wrote down the associated R&D expense. The company cited the “lack of efficacy” and “insufficient data to support further clinical development.”

**Regulatory and commercial outcome**  
- No regulatory filing was ever made; the drug never received FDA, EMA, or other agency approval.  
- The failure removed a high‑profile antisense candidate from the pipeline, reinforcing the view that oral antisense delivery to the gut remains technically challenging.

**Impact on the field**  
- The mongersen episode is frequently cited in discussions of trial design (the necessity of placebo controls) and of the difficulty of translating promising Phase II antisense data into Phase III success.  
- Other antisense programs (e.g., **aln‑catenin**, **inotersen**) have continued, but none have targeted SMAD7 for Crohn’s disease since mongersen’s collapse.  
- The broader Crohn’s therapeutic landscape has progressed through biologics (anti‑TNF, anti‑IL‑12/23, anti‑integrin) and small‑molecule JAK inhibitors, with no antisense drugs entering the market to date.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** *“Phase III will sort out whether mongersen really works; if it does, the drug could become a useful therapy for Crohn’s disease.”*  
  - **Outcome:** The Phase III trial failed to demonstrate efficacy; the drug was discontinued.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *“Running a trial without a placebo arm was a strategic mistake that will be exposed by later data.”*  
  - **Outcome:** The lack of a control arm in the Phase II study left the early results ambiguous, and the subsequent negative Phase III data confirmed that the early signal was not robust.  

- **Broader expectation (common at the time):** *“Antisense oligonucleotides targeting SMAD7 could become a new class of Crohn’s therapeutics.”*  
  - **Outcome:** No SMAD7‑targeting antisense drugs have reached approval; the class has not become a mainstream treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The article is a useful case study in trial design and the pitfalls of early‑stage hype, but the drug itself never progressed beyond a failed Phase III, limiting its long‑term scientific or commercial significance.
