# Conference Travel (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author announces a short trip to Heidelberg to attend the EMBO Chemical Biology conference in late September 2012. The note mentions that it will be the author’s first visit to Heidelberg in about 25 years and invites anyone in the surrounding German states to meet up. No scientific claims or predictions are made; the piece is purely a personal logistics update.

## 2. HISTORY  
The EMBO Chemical Biology conference continued as an annual meeting after 2012, bringing together researchers in chemical biology, proteomics, and small‑molecule drug discovery. While the specific 2012 meeting featured talks on early‑stage chemical probes and emerging covalent inhibitor strategies, there is no publicly documented link between this travel note and any subsequent scientific breakthroughs, policy changes, or commercial outcomes.  

Since 2012, the broader field of chemical biology has seen several concrete developments that were discussed at later EMBO meetings, such as:

* The rise of PROTAC (proteolysis‑targeting chimera) technology, leading to FDA‑approved drugs (e.g., Arvinas’ ARV-110 for prostate cancer, approved in 2022).  
* Widespread adoption of CRISPR‑based genome editing, which has become a staple tool in chemical‑biology‑driven target validation.  
* Expansion of covalent inhibitor programs targeting previously “undruggable” proteins (e.g., KRAS G12C inhibitors approved in 2021).  

None of these milestones can be directly traced back to the author’s attendance at the 2012 conference, and the travel note itself had no measurable impact on the biotech industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article contains no explicit predictions about scientific or commercial outcomes, so there are none to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10** – The piece is a brief personal announcement with no substantive scientific content or lasting relevance to biotechnology. Its interest lies only in historical context for the author’s travel schedule.
