# Things I Won't Work With: Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a humorous chemistry blog post describing hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), a high-energy explosive compound. The author breaks down the intimidating chemical name piece by piece, explaining how the "hexanitro" component (six nitro groups) indicates extremely explosive potential. CL-20 was developed as a compact, efficient explosive remarkable not for its ability to explode, but for its relative stability—it doesn't immediately detonate when handled, which the author notes is actually a significant achievement in energetic materials chemistry. The post discusses stabilization methods, including mixing CL-20 with TNT to form less explosive cocrystals, and describes the dangerous synthesis process involving fuming nitric acid. The author, identifying as a drug discovery chemist, concludes that he won't work with such compounds due to safety concerns, while noting ironically that many Google search results focus on the compound's environmental effects on earthworms, fish, and soil microorganisms.

## 2. HISTORY

CL-20 (also known as HNIW) was originally developed by the China Lake Naval Air Warfare Center in the 1980s and has since seen significant development and adoption. Following the 2011 article, CL-20 has been increasingly commercialized and incorporated into military applications. Several countries have adopted CL-20-based formulations for specific munitions, including the United States, China, and others. By the mid-2010s, production scaled up significantly, with companies like BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman involved in manufacturing. The compound has been used in rocket propellants, explosives for mining applications, and specialized military munitions where high energy density is critical. The environmental concerns mentioned in the article became more prominent, leading to numerous studies on CL-20's environmental fate, toxicity, and biodegradation pathways. Research on stabilization methods continued, with various polymorphs and formulations developed to improve safety during handling and storage. While CL-20 remains more expensive than conventional explosives like RDX or HMX, its superior performance characteristics have justified its use in specific high-value applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained no specific predictions about future developments in CL-20 technology, military adoption, environmental research, or commercial applications.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5/9**

This article represents a well-done technical blog post about an interesting chemical compound with niche appeal. While competently written and informative, the content is more specialized than broadly significant, relevant primarily to chemistry enthusiasts rather than having wide societal impact.
