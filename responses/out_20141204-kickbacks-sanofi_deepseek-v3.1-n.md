# Kickbacks At Sanofi? (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary discusses a whistleblower lawsuit filed against Sanofi alleging a kickback scheme involving the company's diabetes drugs. The article notes that a 13-year company paralegal filed a lawsuit claiming that Sanofi executives, including recently ousted CEO Christopher Viehbacher, participated in a scheme to funnel tens of millions of dollars through improper incentives to promote diabetes drug prescriptions in violation of federal law. The author mentions that the plaintiff's evidence would be "interesting to see" and notes this was particularly concerning because Sanofi had already settled with the Justice Department two years prior over a previous kickback scheme.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2014 article, several relevant developments occurred in pharmaceutical kickback enforcement and at Sanofi:

The Justice Department continued aggressive enforcement against pharmaceutical kickback violations throughout 2015-2020. Major settlements included Novartis ($390 million in 2020), Pfizer ($23.85 million in 2018), and United Therapeutics ($210 million in 2017).

Regarding Sanofi specifically: In terms of concrete outcomes from this whistleblower lawsuit or similar cases, Sanofi has faced various legal challenges related to marketing practices over the past decade. Most notably, in 2018 Sanofi agreed to pay $109.8 million to resolve False Claims Act allegations that the company paid kickbacks to Medicare patients through a "co-pay assistance" program for its cardiac drugs. The diabetes franchise also faced significant business headwinds - Sanofi's flagship diabetes drug Lantus went off patent in 2015, leading to substantial revenue declines and generic competition.

Christopher Viehbacher, the CEO mentioned in the lawsuit, did not return to a major pharmaceutical CEO role after his 2014 departure from Sanofi. However, he did take leadership positions in the biotech sector, becoming chairman of the board at Bioverativ (later acquired by Sanofi in 2018) and serving as a partner at Gurnet Point Capital, a healthcare investment firm.

The specific whistleblower lawsuit mentioned in the article does not appear to have resulted in major public settlements or DOJ announcements that garnered significant media attention in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contains one implicit prediction about employment prospects:

**Prediction:** "At the very least, it has just complicated Chris Viehbacher's near-term employment prospects, I should think."

**Outcome:** This prediction was largely accurate. Viehbacher did not secure another CEO position at a major pharmaceutical company following his 2014 departure. Instead, he moved into board positions and private equity roles in healthcare. His employment path did shift away from major pharma executive roles, though he remained active in the broader healthcare sector.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3/9**

The article touches on systemic issues in pharmaceutical marketing with real consequences, but ultimately describes what appears to have been one of many routine whistleblower cases that characterize the industry rather than landmark enforcement action or major corporate scandal that produced lasting regulatory change.
