# A Scientific Aptitude Test? (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a research paper by Shane Frederick from MIT Sloan that examines the correlation between performance on cognitive reflection tests and financial decision-making behaviors. The test consists of trick questions where an intuitively obvious answer is wrong and requires analytical thinking to solve correctly.

Frederick found that people who score high on this test—those who don't just accept their first intuitive answer but check it analytically—also demonstrate characteristic financial behaviors: they're more willing to delay gratification for larger future rewards and more willing to take calculated risks. Low-scorers showed the opposite traits, being more loss-averse and preferring immediate certain outcomes.

The author speculates that this high-scoring group likely makes the best scientists because they possess the mindset of questioning initial impressions, double-checking results, and thinking analytically rather than impulsively—qualities essential for good research.

## 2. HISTORY

The research discussed was published by Shane Frederick in 2005 in the *Journal of Economic Perspectives* under the title "Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making" (it gained broader attention when the article was written in January 2006).

The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) has become one of the most widely used instruments in behavioral economics and psychology research. As Frederick later summarized (2016): "By now, over 100 papers by other investigators have also used the CRT... It has proven to be a robust predictor of performance on a range of logic and reasoning problems."

**Scientific Community Adoption:** The CRT gained substantial traction in psychological and economic research, with hundreds of subsequent studies using it to examine correlations with decision-making across domains.

**Business and Financial Applications:** The concept that Frederick explored—linking cognitive style to risk tolerance and delayed gratification—has influenced how behavioral economists think about investment decisions, though it's not clear if specific businesses changed their practices based on this research.

**Impact on Scientific Practice:** The core insight that good scientists need cognitive reflection has become widely accepted, though specific testing of this proposition in laboratory settings appears limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions and speculations:

• **That the high-scoring group would make the best scientists**: This has received moderate support in subsequent research showing CRT scores correlate with analytical thinking ability, but direct evidence that high-CRT scientists have better research outcomes is mixed.

• **That cognitive reflection could be used to "separate sheep from goats" in science**: While some research has attempted to use CRT-like measures in hiring contexts, this prediction hasn't materialized in practice, likely because single metrics are poor predictors of complex job performance.

• **That the relationship between patience, risk-taking, and cognitive reflection would prove robust**: This has been strongly validated—numerous follow-up studies confirm the CRT correlates with patience and risk-taking preferences.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article highlights research that became genuinely influential in behavioral economics and has relevance to scientific practice, though the specific application to separating scientific 'sheep from goats' remains more speculative than proven.
