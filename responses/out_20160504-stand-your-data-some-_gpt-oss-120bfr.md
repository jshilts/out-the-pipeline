# Stand By Your Data With Some Cash (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post laments the chronic reproducibility problem in biomedical research and highlights a 2016 proposal by Michael Rosenblatt (Merck CMO) to change the economics of university‑industry collaborations. The idea is simple: universities would back their published data with a “money‑back guarantee.” If a partner company later finds the data irreproducible, the university would refund part or all of the collaboration fee. In return, the industry would be willing to pay a premium for data that carries such a guarantee, giving universities a financial incentive to replicate their own findings before signing deals. The author notes that universities may balk because the risk falls on them, and suggests that the incentive could be introduced from the industry side by offering higher payments only after successful replication.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened after 2016?**  

* **No widespread adoption of “money‑back guarantees.”**  To date, no major university‑industry partnership has incorporated a formal refund clause tied to reproducibility. The legal and administrative complexity, plus the difficulty of defining “failure to reproduce,” have kept the idea largely theoretical.  

* **Rise of reproducibility‑focused programs (not guarantees).**  
  * **NIH Rigor & Reproducibility policies (2016‑2022).**  The NIH introduced mandatory rigor statements in grant applications (2016) and later required detailed data‑sharing and authentication plans. These policies have increased transparency but do not involve financial penalties or refunds.  
  * **Industry‑led replication pilots.**  Companies such as Amgen (2018) and Bayer (2020) funded independent replication of promising pre‑clinical studies, but the funding was a one‑off grant rather than a contractual guarantee. Results were published in the *Reproducibility Initiative* and *Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology*; they influenced internal pipeline decisions but did not change contract terms.  
  * **Open‑science contracts.**  A handful of biotech start‑ups (e.g., BenchSci, Insitro) have begun to include “data‑quality milestones” in their agreements, where later‑stage payments are contingent on successful replication. These clauses are more akin to milestone‑based payments than to a refund of earlier fees.  

* **University‑level reproducibility offices.**  Several research institutions (e.g., University of California system, MIT) created internal “reproducibility cores” that offer services to validate key experiments before external licensing. The cores are funded by the university or by grant overhead, not by a revenue‑sharing model with industry.  

* **Policy and cultural shifts.**  The broader scientific community has embraced pre‑registration, open data repositories (e.g., OSF, Zenodo), and journal data‑availability mandates. While these changes improve the baseline reproducibility, they have not translated into the kind of financial guarantee the article envisioned.  

* **No evidence of Merck implementing the proposal.**  Public statements and press releases from Merck between 2016‑2024 focus on “data integrity” and “collaborative science” but do not mention a money‑back guarantee scheme.  

Overall, the proposal sparked discussion but did not become a standard contractual practice. The industry has instead pursued softer incentives—higher payments for data that meet pre‑agreed reproducibility criteria, internal replication budgets, and open‑science mandates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the article) | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **Universities will offer full or partial money‑back guarantees for their data.** | Not realized. No university has adopted a formal refund clause; the risk remains largely on the industry side. |
| **Industry will pay a premium for “guaranteed” data, accelerating collaborations.** | Premiums for reproducible data have emerged in limited, case‑by‑case contracts, but not as a systematic market price. |
| **The model will be resisted by universities because of the financial burden.** | Correct that many university tech‑transfer offices expressed skepticism; the lack of adoption reflects that resistance. |
| **A “carrot‑rather‑stick” approach (low upfront price, higher later payment after replication) will be preferred.** | Some milestone‑based contracts now follow this pattern, but they are driven by internal R&D risk management rather than a formal guarantee scheme. |
| **The idea could be tried from the industrial side by inserting guarantee language into deals.** | Few pilot clauses have appeared (e.g., “replication‑contingent” milestones), but they remain rare and are not industry‑wide policy. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a thoughtful early‑stage proposal that anticipated many later reproducibility initiatives, making it historically interesting, but the specific financial‑guarantee model never materialized, limiting its long‑term impact.
