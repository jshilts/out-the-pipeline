# Inside Moderna (A Little Bit) (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines Moderna Therapeutics, an mRNA-based biotechnology company that had secured massive financial deals while maintaining extreme secrecy about its research and technology. As a private company, Moderna had revealed very little scientific data, with founders publishing only one rodent study and the company disclosing details primarily through patent filings rather than peer-reviewed publications. The author notes that Moderna and other mRNA companies in the space operated with similar stealth, creating uncertainty about whose technology was superior, who owned which intellectual property, and how advanced various programs actually were. This secrecy existed despite the enormous potential of mRNA therapeutics, which the author compares to having "magic powers" that could revolutionize medicine if the technical challenges could be overcome. The article captures the fundamental uncertainty surrounding whether mRNA technology would eventually dominate the pharmaceutical industry or fail to deliver on its promises.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2015 article, Moderna's trajectory dramatically validated the massive investments made in the company, though not in the way anyone anticipated. The company went public in December 2018 at a $7.5 billion valuation. However, Moderna's defining moment came with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when it developed one of the first mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273, later named Spikevax) in partnership with the NIH. The vaccine received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in December 2020 and full approval in January 2022, demonstrating unprecedented speed in vaccine development—moving from sequence identification to FDA authorization in less than a year.

The success was not just scientific but commercial: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine generated approximately $18.4 billion in revenue in 2021 alone, transforming the company from a promising but unproven biotech into one of the world's most valuable pharmaceutical companies. The pandemic essentially served as a global validation of mRNA technology, proving that mRNA-based therapeutics could be rapidly developed, manufactured at scale, and demonstrate both safety and efficacy in large human populations.

Beyond COVID-19, Moderna has expanded its pipeline to include mRNA vaccines for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and various cancer vaccines, among other therapeutic areas. The technology platform that seemed enigmatic in 2015 has become the foundation for one of the most significant new drug development modalities in decades.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction about mRNA technology owning the world or failing completely**: The author expressed uncertainty about whether Moderna's technology would "start owning the world" in ten years or if it would be someone else or no one at all. **Outcome**: Moderna's mRNA technology did become globally dominant, but primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic rather than the gradual therapeutic development originally envisioned. The technology essentially "owned" vaccine development during 2020-2022, though competition has since emerged from other mRNA companies like BioNTech/Pfizer.

• **Implicit concern about deliverability on promises**: The article highlighted that "some analysts are wondering whether the company will be able to deliver on its promises" given the secrecy and RNA drug development challenges. **Outcome**: Moderna dramatically delivered on the fundamental promise of mRNA technology, though the pathway was unforeseen—a global pandemic created both the urgency and the validation platform that might otherwise have taken decades to establish through traditional drug development.

• **Uncertainty about competitive landscape**: The article noted that multiple stealthy companies were working in the mRNA space with unclear technology leadership. **Outcome**: Moderna emerged as a clear leader alongside BioNTech, validating the broad potential of mRNA platforms while creating a competitive duopoly initially, with broader industry adoption following.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

The article captured a pivotal moment in biotechnology history, documenting Moderna's enigmatic early phase just before it would become one of the most consequential companies in modern medicine. The contrast between the 2015 uncertainty and what actually transpired makes this a fascinating historical document of disruptive innovation in its formative stage, with the COVID-19 pandemic serving as an unprecedented validation event that transformed both the company and the entire field of mRNA therapeutics.
