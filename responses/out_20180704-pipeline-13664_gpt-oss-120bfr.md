# Happy Fourth of July (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a nostalgic, personal blog entry written on July 4, 2018. The author describes a family barbecue—slow‑cooking a pork shoulder, serving beans, coleslaw, watermelon, and homemade strawberry ice cream—while his children play in an inflatable pool. He mentions setting up an old microscope to look at algae (hoping to see *Volvox*) in a birdbath, and recounts a brief lesson about the Declaration of Independence for his kids. The narrative then shifts to a reflection on the history of revolutions, quoting Orwell, and noting that his wife and mother‑in‑law are Iranian exiles who lived through the fall of the Shah. The piece ends with a light‑hearted invitation to enjoy the holiday without political interference.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since the article is a personal, non‑technical reflection, there are no subsequent scientific, regulatory, or commercial developments directly tied to it. The only potentially relevant element—the observation of *Volvox* in a birdbath—remains a routine hobbyist activity; no notable research breakthroughs or commercial products have emerged from that specific observation. The broader cultural references (the 2018 U.S. political climate, Iranian diaspora experiences) have continued to evolve, but nothing directly traceable to this blog post has had measurable impact on policy, biotech, or industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The author does not make explicit predictions about technology, science, or industry. The only forward‑looking comment is a general hope that “anyone who’ll leave us to our own devices this July Fourth… are the ones welcome here,” which is a personal sentiment rather than a forecast. Consequently, there are no predictions to evaluate against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 1/10**  
The article is a personal, anecdotal holiday reflection with no relevance to biotechnology, science, or lasting public discourse; its interest to a scientific audience is therefore minimal.
