# GSK and Theravance Face Some Ugly Data (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on the failure of GlaxoSmithKline's SUMMIT trial, a large 16,000-patient study testing whether the respiratory drug Breo (developed in partnership with Theravance) could demonstrate a survival benefit in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Breo is a combination of fluticasone furoate (steroid) and vilanterol (long-acting beta-2 agonist), which had been approved for COPD in 2013 and for asthma. The trial was strategically important for GSK as their blockbuster respiratory drug Advair was approaching patent expiration, and success would have revitalized their respiratory division. The author notes this failure raises serious questions about GSK's broader strategy of exiting oncology research while focusing on supposedly "safer" respiratory, vaccines, and consumer health businesses. Theravance faced even more severe consequences, with its stock declining from $40 to below $12 over the preceding year and a half.

## 2. HISTORY

**Breo/Relvar and COPD Outcomes:**
The SUMMIT trial failure in 2015 was indeed a significant setback. Subsequently, GSK's respiratory strategy faced continued challenges. Breo (branded as Relvar outside the US) remained on the market but never achieved blockbuster status comparable to Advair. The drug continued to be used for COPD and asthma maintenance treatment, but the lack of mortality benefit limited its competitive positioning.

**GSK's Strategic Evolution:**
In the years following 2015, GSK's approach evolved significantly. Sir Andrew Witty, who was CEO during the time of the article, stepped down in 2017. The company eventually moved back toward a more balanced R&D strategy, including oncology. GSK later acquired Tesaro for its PARP inhibitor Zejula and entered into immuno-oncology collaborations, acknowledging that the earlier exit from oncology was premature.

**Theravance's Corporate Path:**
Theravance underwent major corporate restructuring. In a complex transaction starting around 2014, Theravance spun off its respiratory assets into Theravance Biopharma while the original entity became Royalty Pharma-listed company focused on collecting royalties. The respiratory business (Theravance Biopharma) continued developing respiratory medicines but at a smaller scale than originally envisioned during the GSK partnership's peak.

**Competitive Landscape:**
The respiratory market evolved with new mechanisms and combination therapies. The broader class of LABA/steroid combinations remained important in COPD and asthma management, but GSK never fully replaced the revenue gap left by Advair's decline.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: GSK's respiratory division return to growth by next year** - The article discussed GSK's expectation that the respiratory division would return to growth. This did not materialize as planned. GSK's respiratory portfolio faced continued competitive pressure, and growth remained challenging. The company eventually undertook portfolio reshaping.

• **Prediction: Doubts about Sir Andrew Witty's tenure** - The article questioned whether Sir Andrew Witty would have a long-term future. Witty indeed stepped down as CEO in 2017, so this prediction proved accurate. The strategic concerns raised in the article contributed to ongoing scrutiny of leadership.

• **Prediction: GSK's oncology exit seen as puzzling** - The article highlighted GSK's withdrawal from oncology as particularly strange given advances in the field. GSK later reversed course, acquiring oncology assets (including Tesaro in 2019 for $5.1 billion) and building an oncology presence, validating the criticism that the earlier exit was premature.

• **Prediction: Theravance facing terrible news** - The financial distress for Theravance was indeed severe. The company's restructuring into royalty-focused and R&D-focused entities reflected the challenges of relying heavily on GSK partnership success. The stock decline and subsequent corporate changes confirmed the seriousness of the setback.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical strategy, illustrating how major clinical trial failures can reshape corporate direction and management careers. The broader themes about pharmaceutical companies balancing portfolio risk and focus remain highly relevant to drug development strategy.
