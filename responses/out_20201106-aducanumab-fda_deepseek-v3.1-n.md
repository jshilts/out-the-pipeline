# Aducanumab at the FDA (November 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Biogen's anti-amyloid antibody aducanumab as it faces FDA review for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The author expresses strong skepticism about efficacy, noting that two Phase 3 trials produced conflicting results: Study 301 (ENGAGE) was negative while Study 302 (EMERGE) was positive. Biogen had initially halted the trials after a futility analysis suggested the drug wasn't working, but later revived hopes through post-hoc analysis.

The FDA briefing documents revealed a deeply divided internal review—the clinical reviewer found the data "robust and exceptionally persuasive" while the statistical reviewer concluded there was "no compelling substantial evidence of treatment effect." The author argues that Biogen hasn't demonstrated efficacy and that another confirmatory trial is needed, but expresses concern that the immense pent-up demand for any Alzheimer's treatment could drive approval regardless of weak evidence, especially given the FDA's precedent with controversial approvals like Exondys 51.

## 2. HISTORY

**FDA Approval and Rejection:**
- The FDA advisory committee voted against approval in November 2020, with members expressing concerns about the inconsistent trial data
- Despite this recommendation, the FDA granted accelerated approval to aducanumab (marketed as Aduhelm) in June 2021, a highly controversial decision that led to the resignation of three advisory committee members
- The approval was based on aducanumab's ability to reduce amyloid plaques rather than clear evidence of clinical benefit

**Post-Approval Developments:**
- Clinical uptake was extremely limited due to weak efficacy data and safety concerns (brain swelling/bleeding side effects)
- Medicare issued a restrictive coverage policy in April 2022, limiting reimbursement to patients enrolled in clinical trials, effectively blocking widespread access
- Most major medical centers declined to prescribe the drug, citing insufficient evidence

**Commercial Failure:**
- Biogen generated only ~$4.8 million in Aduhelm revenue in Q2 2024, versus $2.9 million in Q1 2024 (down from $12 million in Q3 2021)
- The drug failed to achieve commercial viability, with prescriptions remaining very low
- Biogen eliminated hundreds of Aduhelm-related jobs in 2022 and deprioritized the program

**Lecanemab and Donanemab Success:**
- Two subsequent anti-amyloid antibodies showed more convincing results
- **Lecanemab (Leqembi)** received traditional FDA approval in July 2023 after demonstrating modest but statistically significant clinical benefit in the CLARITY AD trial
- **Donanemab** showed positive Phase 3 results in 2023, with clearer evidence of modest clinical benefit
- Both drugs still face concerns about modest effect sizes and safety issues, but have stronger evidence bases than aducanumab

**Scientific Impact:**
- The aducanumab approval controversy damaged FDA credibility and highlighted problems with accelerated approval pathways
- Many neurologists and researchers expressed concerns that premature approval would hinder legitimate Alzheimer's drug development
- The episode reinforced the need for robust Phase 3 trials and post-marketing studies in Alzheimer's disease

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The author made several implicit predictions:**

• **"Everyone knows what's going to happen if aducanumab is approved: the pent-up demand...will demand treatment"** — **Partially accurate**: There was indeed immense pent-up demand, but physicians and insurance companies did not broadly prescribe/pay for the drug due to poor evidence and restrictive Medicare coverage

• **"Biogen is counting on just that [pressures], and I'm not happy about it"** — **Accurate**: Biogen did face enormous pressure from patient advocacy groups and had counted on market demand, but the commercial strategy failed due to scientific and regulatory resistance

• **"The FDA should approve aducanumab as it stands...I don't think that they should approve any drug for which the evidence is this equivocal"** — **Outcome**: The FDA did approve aducanumab despite equivocal evidence, but this led to severe criticism, limited market access, and ultimately commercial failure

• **"Another study is needed"** — **Accurate**: The FDA required Biogen to conduct a confirmatory trial as a condition of accelerated approval, and the broader field moved forward with better-designed trials for lecanemab and donanemab

• **Implicit prediction that confusing data wouldn't support clinical use** — **Accurate**: Neither physicians nor payers accepted aducanumab for routine clinical use due to the poor quality of evidence

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article proved exceptionally prescient about the aducanumab controversy and highlighted fundamental issues in drug development, regulatory decision-making, and the intersection of science, policy, and commerce in medicine. The case became a landmark in FDA history and influenced subsequent Alzheimer's drug development, making it highly significant for understanding modern drug approval processes and evidence standards.
