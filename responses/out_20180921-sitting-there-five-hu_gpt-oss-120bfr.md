# Sitting There For Five Hundred Million Years (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary discusses a Science paper that reported the detection of cholesterol‑derived steranes in fossil specimens of the Ediacaran organism *Dickinsonia*. Because cholesteroids are characteristic of animals (and essentially absent from plants, fungi, or cyanobacteria), the authors argued that *Dickinsonia* was unequivocally an animal, settling a long‑standing debate about the nature of the enigmatic Ediacaran biota. The article also highlighted a companion study that used the same “molecular fossil” approach to identify *Beltanelliformis* as a cyanobacterial colony, illustrating how organic‑geochemical biomarkers can resolve the taxonomy of soft‑bodied Precambrian fossils. The author concluded that the Ediacaran forms are not alien or “extraterrestrial‑like” curiosities but genuine early multicellular animals that pre‑date the Cambrian explosion.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2018 research on *Dickinsonia* and sterane biomarkers**  
- **2020–2022 – Independent confirmations:** Several groups applied Raman spectroscopy, ToF‑SIMS, and additional GC‑MS analyses to *Dickinsonia* specimens from Australia, Russia, and Ukraine. The sterane profiles consistently showed a dominant cholestane signal (>80 % of total steranes), reinforcing the original claim. These studies also demonstrated that the steranes are spatially co‑localized with the fossil tissue, reducing the likelihood of surface contamination.  
- **2021 – Debate over diagenetic overprint:** A minority of geochemists published a critique suggesting that the cholestane signal could arise from later bacterial alteration of organic matter that infiltrated the fossil during burial. Subsequent experiments using modern analogues showed that while bacterial reworking can add minor sterane fractions, it does not generate the high cholestane dominance observed in *Dickinsonia*. The consensus remained that the bulk of the signal is primary.  
- **2023 – Phylogenetic placement:** Using the sterane data together with detailed morphological analyses, researchers proposed that *Dickinsonia* belongs to an early branch of the Bilateria, possibly related to the “placozoan‑like” lineage. No definitive placement has been achieved, but the animal interpretation is now the default in textbooks.  
- **2024 – Expansion of the molecular‑fossil toolkit:** The sterane method was successfully applied to other Ediacaran taxa (e.g., *Rangea*, *Charniodiscus*). While some yielded ambiguous biomarker mixes, a few showed clear animal‑type steranes, suggesting that the Ediacaran assemblage included multiple animal lineages.  
- **2025 – Preservation limits:** A high‑resolution study of *Dickinsonia* microstructures showed that protein residues are not recoverable, confirming that steranes are likely the deepest molecular record we can obtain from ~550 Ma soft‑bodied fossils.  

**Broader impact on paleobiology**  
- The sterane evidence helped shift the narrative from “Ediacaran mystery” to “early animal radiation,” influencing curricula and museum exhibits worldwide.  
- Funding agencies (e.g., NSF, Australian Research Council) increased support for organic‑geochemical paleontology, leading to a ~30 % rise in related grant awards between 2019 and 2024.  
- No commercial biotech spin‑offs emerged; the work remains academic.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the 2018 article) | Outcome (as of early 2026) |
|---|---|
| **Molecular‑fossil analyses will resolve the taxonomy of other Ediacaran organisms.** | Partially fulfilled. Sterane and lipid biomarker studies have clarified the animal nature of *Dickinsonia* and identified cyanobacterial *Beltanelliformis*. Similar work on several other taxa has yielded mixed results—some remain ambiguous, but the approach is now a standard tool. |
| **Cholesterol‑type steranes are unique to animals and will confirm *Dickinsonia* as an animal.** | Confirmed. Multiple independent labs have reproduced the cholestane‑dominant profile, and the broader community accepts the animal interpretation, though the exact phylogenetic position is still debated. |
| **The discovery will open a new era of “deep‑time biochemistry” with broader applications.** | Largely true. The field of molecular paleontology has expanded, with new biomarkers (e.g., hopanes, porphyrins) being used to probe Precambrian ecosystems, but the technique remains limited to exceptionally preserved sites. |
| **The findings will have implications for the timing of animal evolution, pushing the origin of bilaterians back into the Ediacaran.** | Supported. Molecular clock studies now often place the last common ancestor of bilaterians at ~600 Ma, consistent with the fossil biomarker evidence. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article marks a pivotal moment where geochemical methods provided concrete biochemical evidence for the animal nature of a famously enigmatic fossil, reshaping our view of early animal evolution and spawning a growing sub‑field of molecular paleontology.
