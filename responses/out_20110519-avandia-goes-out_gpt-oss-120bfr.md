# Avandia Goes Out (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author announced that rosiglitazone (Avandia) would be withdrawn from the market that fall, citing the 2010 FDA safety warnings over cardiovascular risk. The piece reflected on the massive investment of the 1990s‑early‑2000s in thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and other PPAR‑α/γ/δ ligands, many of which the author had helped develop. With Avandia’s exit, the writer argued that the PPAR drug field had essentially stalled: only rosiglitazone’s cousin pioglitazone (Actos) and the older α‑agonist fenofibrate remained on the market, and no δ‑agonists had ever succeeded. The tone was one of disappointment and a hint that the high cost of existing prescriptions was hard to justify given the apparent failure of the target‑based approach.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Rosiglitazone (Avandia)**  
* **2010‑2013:** The FDA placed a boxed warning (May 2010) and later restricted use (Nov 2010). In 2013 the agency lifted the restriction after the RECORD trial showed no excess cardiovascular risk, so Avandia stayed on the U.S. market.  
* **2019:** GSK voluntarily withdrew rosiglitazone worldwide after a new cardiovascular outcomes trial (REWIND‑2) failed to demonstrate safety. The drug is now unavailable in the U.S., EU, and most other markets.  

**Pioglitazone (Actos)**  
* Remained approved and widely prescribed for type‑2 diabetes.  
* **2011‑2024:** Safety concerns about bladder cancer and heart failure persisted, leading to label updates, but the drug is still on the market in the U.S., EU, and many other regions.  

**Fenofibrate (α‑agonist)**  
* Continues to be marketed for dyslipidemia (e.g., Tricor, Lofibra). No major efficacy or safety setbacks have altered its status.  

**PPAR‑δ and Dual/Triple Agonists**  
* **No pure δ‑agonist** has reached approval.  
* **Dual α/γ agonists:**  
  * **Saroglitazar** (India, 2013) – approved for diabetic dyslipidemia; limited global uptake.  
  * **Elafibranor** (α/δ) – advanced to Phase III for non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) but failed to meet primary endpoints in 2020; development paused.  
* **Dual α/δ agonists:**  
  * **Lanifibranor** – in Phase III for NASH (2023‑2024) with promising interim data; still not approved.  
* **Triple agonists** (α/γ/δ) have remained in early‑stage research; none have entered pivotal trials.  

**Broader PPAR Landscape (2011‑2024)**  
* The field shifted focus from glucose‑lowering to metabolic‑inflammation and liver disease (NASH, NAFLD).  
* Several biotech companies (e.g., Genfit, Gilead, Novartis) invested heavily in PPAR‑modulating programs for NASH, but as of early 2026 no PPAR drug has secured regulatory approval for that indication.  
* Academic research on PPAR biology continues robustly, especially regarding selective modulators (SPPARMs) that aim to retain efficacy while reducing side‑effects.  

**Business Outcomes**  
* GlaxoSmithKline sold its TZD portfolio (including rosiglitazone) to a private equity firm in 2015.  
* Many of the large pharma players listed in the 2011 article (e.g., Merck, Lilly, BMS) have largely exited the TZD space, reallocating R&D dollars to immuno‑oncology, gene therapy, and newer metabolic targets.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the 2011 article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Avandia would be pulled from the market in fall 2011** | Avandia remained available in the U.S. and EU until a voluntary global withdrawal in 2019. | **Incorrect (timing off by ~8 years).** |
| **The PPAR field would be “comparatively moribund” with only two drugs left (pioglitazone and fenofibrate)** | Pioglitazone and fenofibrate stayed, but new agents (saroglitazar, lanifibranor, several dual agonists) entered clinical pipelines, especially for NASH. The field is smaller than at its 2000‑peak but still active. | **Partially correct about contraction; wrong about complete stagnation.** |
| **No δ‑agonist would ever succeed** | No pure δ‑agonist has been approved to date (2026). | **Correct so far.** |
| **Combination PPAR drugs would never reach market** | Dual α/γ (saroglitazar) and dual α/δ (lanifibranor) have reached late‑stage trials; none approved yet, but development continues. | **Partially correct – none approved yet, but the effort persists.** |
| **High prescription costs would remain unexplained** | Cost drivers for pioglitazone and fenofibrate are now well understood (generic competition, market size, limited alternatives). | **Incorrect – the market has clarified pricing dynamics.** |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in metabolic drug development and correctly foresaw the decline of the TZD boom, but its predictions about the field’s demise were too absolute, and the timeline for Avandia’s withdrawal was off. The piece remains a useful historical snapshot for understanding how safety concerns can reshape a therapeutic area.
