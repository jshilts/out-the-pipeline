# Drug Prices and Costs - From the Mail (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article presents a curated set of reader letters responding to earlier posts about pharmaceutical drug pricing and research costs. One reader (Dave S.) voices skepticism that patent revenues actually fund R&D, proposing to test this by comparing how R&D spending scales with revenue—if R&D grows slower than revenue, patents may simply boost profits rather than research. A second thread (from Mark S.) argues that Americans subsidize global drug costs, especially for wealthy countries like those in Europe and Canada, and suggests forcing U.S. prices down to the lowest price negotiated by any other country to "even out" what everyone pays. The author notes this could trigger a "Gresham's Law" where bad prices drive out good, since single-payer systems can extract unsustainably low prices. A third idea (from Clark H.) proposes that companies bargain with payers earlier—after Phase II trials but before most costs are sunk—so they can walk away if prices are inadequate. The author observes that Phase III failures would complicate this and that payers might just apply a standard Phase III cost estimate, returning bargaining to the current "sunk cost" disadvantage.

## 2. HISTORY

In the two decades since this 2004 piece, the core tensions—patent protection versus R&D incentives, geographic price disparities, and the power of single-payer negotiators—have persisted and often intensified, but few sweeping systemic changes were adopted in the U.S.

- **Patent protection and R&D spending**: Overall, industry R&D spending has grown in absolute terms, yet the link to innovation output has frayed. The proportion of revenue dedicated to R&D at many large firms often lagged revenue growth, while marketing and shareholder returns frequently captured larger shares. The much-cited cost to develop a new drug climbed (often cited at $1–$3 billion per approved drug in recent years), but the R&D "productivity" (new drugs per dollar spent) remained a concern, with high late-stage failure rates. No major legislative changes in the U.S. fundamentally altered the core patent-for-R&D bargain.

- **Geographic price disparities and reimportation**: The "Americans subsidizing the world" argument continued to surface in policy debates, but broad reimportation schemes or federal "lowest-price" matching rules were largely not enacted. Canada, the EU, and other high-income countries maintained lower prices via single-payer negotiations (e.g., Canada’s Patented Medicine Prices Review Board and various EU health technology assessment bodies). U.S. reimportation efforts remained limited and piecemeal; proposals to peg U.S. prices to an "international price index" or to enable broader importation faced strong industry opposition and logistical/safety concerns, and most did not become law at the federal level.

- **Bargaining before costs are sunk (early-stage negotiation)**: This idea did not meaningfully take hold in practice. Instead, the dominant model stayed post-approval and often post-launch negotiation with payers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and health systems. Most coverage and price discussions occur with evidence of pivotal-trial success and regulatory approval in hand, preserving the "sunk cost" dynamic described in the article.

- **Policy interventions and market changes**: Over time, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, 2022) introduced Medicare drug price negotiation for a limited set of top-spending drugs, beginning nearly two decades after this article; implementation is ongoing. Biosimilar and generic competition expanded, pressuring brand pricing, but biologics often retained substantial pricing power. High-profile pricing controversies (e.g., Turing’s daraprim, Valeant’s portfolio pricing, insulin costs) kept public and political attention on drug affordability, leading to some state-level reforms and transparency laws, though without fundamentally solving the price-differential problem.

- **Industry behavior**: Large manufacturers continued to depend heavily on U.S. revenue, reinforcing the "U.S. subsidizes the world" pattern; global pricing strategies often kept U.S. list prices highest, with confidential rebates and discounts complicating net-price comparisons.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Price regulation via "match the lowest global price"**: The article discussed this as a reader proposal, not an outright prediction, but considered it likely to cause a "Gresham's Law" dynamic.  
  - *Outcome*: This policy was not adopted federally, but Medicare price negotiation (IRA) later imposed a form of government-set prices for a subset of drugs—moving closer to state bargaining power, though not via a simple global-price-matching rule. Overseas price referencing is used in some countries but not broadly in the U.S., hence the "bad prices drive out good" dynamic did not materialize at scale here.

- **R&D spending rising proportionally with revenues as a test of patents-for-R&D**: The reader proposed that if R&D spending grows more slowly than revenues, the patent bargain isn’t truly funding R&D.  
  - *Outcome*: While absolute R&D rose, evidence frequently showed that many firms’ R&D as a percentage of revenue did not consistently increase; marketing and profits often rose faster, lending credence to the skepticism voiced in 2004. Industry productivity remained challenging, with rising trial costs and high attrition, yet continued high U.S. prices suggested that patent rents persisted even if R&D efficiency did not clearly improve.

- **Early-stage negotiation (bargain after Phase II, before costs are sunk)**: This was floated as a potential solution to payer bargaining power.  
  - *Outcome*: It was not widely adopted. Real-world negotiation stayed firmly anchored around post-approval coverage and pricing, reinforced by health technology assessment and value frameworks that require Phase III and real-world outcomes. Risk-sharing agreements and outcomes-based contracts emerged as alternatives but still typically after pivotal evidence was available.

- **Implicit prediction that without change, the status quo (price differentials, U.S. bearing higher costs) would continue**:  
  - *Outcome*: This did largely persist. U.S. patients and payers continued paying higher list and (often) net prices, while countries with centralized procurement and negotiating power secured lower prices. The dynamic became increasingly politically salient, culminating in parts of the IRA, but without a wholesale restructuring of the global pricing model.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This exchange distilled the core tensions in pharmaceutical pricing that would shape two decades of debate: whether patents meaningfully fund R&D, how to address global price disparities, and whether bargaining should shift earlier. While few of the specific ideas were adopted, the underlying conflicts persisted and are now central to U.S. policy fights (e.g., Medicare negotiation). The piece remains a useful snapshot of durable pressures with only modest resolution since 2004.
