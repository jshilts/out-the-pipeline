# AstraZeneca Admits It Spent Too Much Money (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In a July 2012 Reuters interview, Astra Zeneca’s head of discovery, **Mene Pangalos**, acknowledged that the company had historically favoured “quantity over quality” in its early‑stage drug selection. He contrasted the firm’s high number of clinical‑candidate declarations with its relatively low launch rate, implying that many of those candidates failed later in development. The comment was made while the company was publicly discussing a restructuring of its R&D organisation, especially in neuroscience, and a promise that the shake‑up would move “at least 8 drugs to final tests by 2015.” The article’s author criticised the headline from Biospace that framed the restructuring as a clear success.

## 2. HISTORY  
**R&D restructuring and portfolio shifts (2012‑2015)**  
- After the 2012 statements, Astra Zeneca launched a multi‑year “R&D transformation” that reduced head‑count, cut spending, and refocused the pipeline on three therapeutic pillars: **oncology, cardiovascular‑respiratory, and metabolic disease**.  
- The neuroscience unit, which had been highlighted in the 2012 interview, was **sold to Daiichi Sankyo in 2015** for about **US $2.4 billion**. This marked a clear retreat from the earlier claim that the neuroscience shake‑up was paying off.

**Key product launches and pipeline outcomes**  
| Year | Product (indication) | Outcome |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| **2015** | **Tagrisso** (osimertinib, EGFR‑mutant NSCLC) | First‑in‑class third‑generation EGFR inhibitor; FDA approval 2015; now a blockbuster (> $2 bn annual sales). |
| **2016** | **Lynparza** (olaparib) – co‑developed with Merck | First PARP inhibitor approved for ovarian cancer; strong commercial uptake. |
| **2017** | **Imfinzi** (durvalumab, anti‑PD‑L1) | FDA approval for stage III NSCLC; part of the growing immuno‑oncology portfolio. |
| **2018** | **Calquence** (acalabrutinib, BTK inhibitor) – co‑developed with Acerta | FDA approval for mantle‑cell lymphoma; later expanded to CLL. |
| **2020‑2022** | **Enhertu** (trastuzumab‑deruxtecan) – co‑developed with Daiichi Sankyo | FDA approval 2020 for HER2‑positive breast cancer; rapid uptake and high revenue. |
| **2023** | **Fasenra** (benralizumab) – asthma biologic | Continued growth in respiratory franchise. |

**Failures and setbacks**  
- Several late‑stage candidates announced in 2012–2014 (e.g., **AZD5718** for cardiovascular disease, **AZD9496** for breast cancer) failed in Phase III or were discontinued.  
- The promised “8 drugs to final tests by 2015” was **not fully realized**; only a handful (Tagrisso, a few oncology candidates) reached Phase III, and many of the others stalled earlier.

**Financial performance**  
- R&D spend fell from **≈ US $6.5 bn (2012)** to **≈ US $5.5 bn (2015)**, then rose again as the pipeline matured, reaching **≈ US $7 bn (2022)**.  
- Net sales grew from **US $15 bn (2012)** to **≈ US $30 bn (2022)**, driven largely by the oncology and respiratory launches that emerged after the 2012 restructuring.

**Policy and industry impact**  
- Astra Zeneca’s public admission of “quantity‑over‑quality” contributed to a broader industry discussion on **R&D efficiency metrics** (e.g., “cost per launched drug”).  
- The company’s shift toward **collaborative models** (co‑development deals with Merck, Daiichi Sankyo, Acerta) became a template for other large pharma firms seeking to share risk.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from 2012 article or related statements) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **“We were one of the most productive companies in the world, dollar for dollar, in terms of candidates entering the clinic.”** | Astra Zeneca continued to file many INDs, but the **launch rate remained modest** until the oncology focus took effect. | Partially true – high early‑stage output persisted, but conversion to marketed drugs stayed low for several years. |
| **“If you rated us by how many drugs we launched, we were one of the least successful.”** | By 2022 the company had **10+ new molecular entities (NMEs) launched** (e.g., Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Calquence). This lifted its launch rank but **still lagged behind peers** like Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson in absolute numbers. | Accurate for 2012; later improvements reduced the gap but did not eliminate it. |
| **“Neuroscience shake‑up is paying off; may advance at least 8 drugs to final tests by 2015.”** | The neuroscience unit was **sold in 2015**, and **fewer than 8 candidates** reached Phase III; only Tagrisso (oncology) and a couple of other oncology assets made it. | **Incorrect** – the neuroscience promise was not fulfilled; the unit was divested instead. |
| **Implicit expectation that cutting R&D spend would improve efficiency.** | R&D spend was trimmed, but **efficiency gains were realized mainly through portfolio focus and external collaborations**, not merely cost cuts. | Largely true – the strategic refocus, not the raw spend reduction, drove later success. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of a pivotal moment when a major pharma company publicly critiqued its own R&D model; the subsequent turnaround (oncology breakthroughs, neuroscience exit) makes it a noteworthy case study in strategic restructuring.
