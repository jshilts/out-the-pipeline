# India’s First Drug Isn’t India’s First Drug (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article argues that Ranbaxy’s antimalarial “Synriam” (arterolane + piperaquine) is often billed as *India’s* first new drug, but that claim is misleading. Arterolane was discovered abroad in a multinational Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) program, and piperaquine is an old antimalarial. Ranbaxy only took over late‑stage development after MMV withdrew, and therefore the active ingredients were not invented in India. The author concedes that Ranbaxy was the first Indian company to **launch** a new chemical entity (NCE) before any other firm worldwide, and criticises Ranbaxy for overstating the “first‑in‑India” narrative.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome** – Synriam received marketing approval from India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in July 2012 and was launched domestically under the Ranbaxy brand. It never obtained WHO pre‑qualification, so it was not adopted by UN‑funded malaria programmes.  

**Commercial performance** – Sales were modest. Competing artemisinin‑based combination therapies (ACTs) such as artemether‑lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin‑piperaquine were already WHO‑pre‑qualified, cheaper, and had larger procurement pipelines. By 2014 Synriam’s market share in India was <5 % of the antimalarial segment.  

**Corporate fate** – Ranbaxy’s broader quality‑control problems culminated in a 2013 FDA “import alert” that barred its products from the U.S. market, followed by a 2014 settlement (≈ $500 M) for data‑fabrication and GMP violations. In 2015 Sun Pharma acquired Ranbaxy’s assets; Sun discontinued several Ranbaxy‑specific products, including Synriam, which was removed from the Indian market by early 2016.  

**Scientific impact** – The arterolane‑piperaquine combination did not become a standard ACT. Subsequent phase‑III trials (e.g., in Africa) showed non‑inferiority to existing ACTs but no clear superiority, and safety signals (QT‑prolongation) limited enthusiasm. No other company has pursued arterolane as a backbone for new antimalarial regimens.  

**Indian NCE landscape** – After Synriam, Indian firms have launched a handful of NCEs (e.g., Dr. Reddy’s “Rivoceranib” in oncology, Cipla’s “Cipla‑B” for hepatitis C), but India remains a predominantly generic‑manufacturing hub. The “first Indian NCE” milestone did not spark a wave of home‑grown novel drug launches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** Ranbaxy would be the first Indian company to launch an NCE before any other firm worldwide, and this would signal a new era of Indian‑origin drug innovation.  
  - **Outcome:** True for the *launch* of Synriam (Ranbaxy beat the original MMV partner to market). However, the broader implication of a sustained Indian NCE boom did **not** materialise; Indian pharma’s contribution to global NCE pipelines has remained limited.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The drug would achieve significant uptake and possibly influence global malaria treatment guidelines.  
  - **Outcome:** False. Synriam never received WHO pre‑qualification, saw limited domestic sales, and was withdrawn within four years. It did not enter WHO or national malaria treatment policies outside India.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The success would encourage other Indian firms to invest in early‑stage discovery.  
  - **Outcome:** Partially true. Some Indian companies expanded R&D units (e.g., Lupin, Dr. Reddy’s), but most continued to focus on generics and biosimilars rather than de‑novo NCE discovery.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a useful case study of how marketing language can distort scientific credit and illustrates the challenges Indian pharma faces in moving from generics to genuine innovation, but the underlying drug never achieved lasting clinical or commercial impact.
