# 36 Basic Types of Reactions? (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes confusion and skepticism about an MIT Press Office announcement claiming researchers had discovered the "37th type of chemical reaction." The press release indicated there were only 36 basic reaction types known throughout history, with this work adding a 37th. The actual research paper described computational work on low-temperature oxidation pathways, specifically showing how gamma-keto hydroperoxides can form cyclic peroxide intermediates that fragment into carboxylic acids and aldehydes. This mechanism helped explain discrepancies in COOH compound production in oxidation and combustion pathways. However, the "36 basic reaction types" framework appeared nowhere in the scientific paper itself, leading the author and other scientists (including Reddit commenters) to question whether this was a press office misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the actual research.

## 2. HISTORY

The MIT press release appears to have been an example of institutional hype or misunderstanding rather than accurate scientific communication. The underlying research (Zhang et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2013) did present legitimate computational chemistry work on oxidation mechanisms, but the framing of "discovering the 37th basic reaction type" was problematic for several reasons:

**The 36-Type Framework**: I cannot confidently verify that there was any established, widely recognized classification system of exactly 36 basic reaction types in chemistry prior to 2013. Standard chemistry classifications typically include categories like addition, elimination, substitution, rearrangement, redox, acid-base, and various named reactions - but these don't neatly total exactly 36 types. The claim appears to be either invented or based on an obscure classification system.

**Impact of the Actual Research**: The computational work on gamma-keto hydroperoxide pathways did contribute to combustion chemistry and atmospheric chemistry understanding, particularly regarding carboxylic acid formation. However, this did not represent a paradigm shift or new "fundamental reaction type" in the dramatic way suggested.

**Resolution**: This case became a cautionary example in science communication about press offices potentially overselling or misrepresenting research findings to generate media attention. The scientific community's reaction (including the Reddit discussion) demonstrated healthy skepticism about extraordinary claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

I should note that this article is primarily about questioning a press release rather than making predictions about future scientific developments. However, if we examine related areas:

- **The press release framing suggested this might revolutionize reaction classification**: This did not happen. The "37th reaction type" framework did not gain traction in chemistry.

- **The underlying research focus on oxidation mechanisms**: This area did continue developing, particularly relevant to atmospheric chemistry and combustion modeling, though not as revolutionary breakthrough.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article primarily documents a moment of poor science communication rather than representing significant scientific advancement or insight. The underlying chemistry research had legitimate value, but the sensationalized framing reduced rather than enhanced understanding.
