# India's Disgrace (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article criticizes the rise of pseudoscience in India under Hindu nationalist influence, particularly through Vijnana Bharati (VIBHA), the science wing of the RSS movement. The author documents specific incidents: funding for research on panchagavya (cow urine/dung remedies), a government minister dismissing Darwin's evolution theory, claims about ancient Hindu stem cell technology at the Indian Science Congress, and Prime Minister Modi's reference to Hindu mythological surgical feats. The piece argues that nationalist and religious criteria are being imposed on science, which dishonors India's strong scientific tradition and undermines evidence-based inquiry.

## 2. HISTORY
After the article's publication, these concerning trends continued and in some cases intensified:
- **Curriculum controversies**: Evolution remains in Indian educational curricula, but debates over curriculum content, especially around ancient Indian science claims, have persisted under the Modi government.
- **Continued institutional support**: VIBHA has maintained its activities and government funding, continuing to organize science events with nationalist framing.
- **Policy implementation**: The Modi government has continued promoting traditional medicine systems alongside modern medicine, including during COVID-19 responses.
- **Scientific community response**: Many Indian scientists have continued advocating for evidence-based science, though institutional pressures have remained.
- **International scientific reputation**: India has continued producing excellent scientific research and researchers, but these pseudoscience controversies have intermittently drawn negative attention.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article serves more as criticism than prediction, so it contains few concrete predictive claims. However, some implied concerns:
- **Implicit concern**: The author worried these trends would damage India's scientific reputation and undermine evidence-based approaches.
  - **Outcome**: India's scientific output has continued growing, and the country remains a significant contributor to global research. However, specific incidents of pseudoscientific claims in official settings have recurred, generating periodic controversy.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article addresses an important and specific case study in the intersection of science, nationalism, and politics, with concrete examples from a major country. However, this represents a narrower case study rather than fundamental shifts in biotechnology or scientific methodology that would have broader long-term importance across the field.
