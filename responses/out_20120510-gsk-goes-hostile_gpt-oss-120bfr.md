# GSK Goes Hostile (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary announced that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) had launched a hostile takeover bid for Human Genome Sciences (HGS) at **$13 per share**, the same price HGS had previously rejected in a friendly‑deal negotiation. The author framed the situation as a “price‑disagreement” and implied that the market would soon reveal which side was mis‑valuing the company. At the time, HGS’s most notable asset was **Benlysta (belimumab)**, the first new systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) therapy approved in the United States (2011). The piece was essentially a snapshot of a high‑profile M&A battle in the biotech sector.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Deal completion** – GSK’s hostile bid succeeded. The acquisition closed on **June 29 2012**, with GSK paying roughly **$3.6 billion** (≈$13 per share) for HGS.  
- **Integration of Benlysta** – Benlysta became a core product in GSK’s immunology portfolio. After the acquisition, annual worldwide sales grew from about **$300 million (2012)** to **≈$1.5 billion (peak 2018‑2019)**, making it one of GSK’s top‑selling specialty drugs.  
- **Pipeline attrition** – Most other HGS programs were discontinued or folded into GSK’s existing pipelines. The anticipated “pipeline boost” largely failed to materialize beyond Benlysta.  
- **Strategic impact on GSK** – The acquisition helped GSK diversify away from its traditional vaccine and small‑molecule businesses, but it did not reverse the company’s broader revenue stagnation. GSK later pursued other large‑scale restructurings (e.g., the 2015 sale of its oncology unit to Novartis).  
- **Benlysta’s later fate** – Patents on Benlysta began to expire in the early 2020s, and generic competition entered the U.S. market in 2021‑2022, causing sales to decline sharply (≈30 % drop YoY in 2022). GSK has since been exploring combination therapies and new indications for belimumab, but no major new approvals have emerged.  
- **Human Genome Sciences brand** – The HGS name was retired shortly after the acquisition; the company ceased to exist as an independent entity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the 2012 article or implied) | What actually happened |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“One of these companies is wrong about that price, and now I guess we’ll find out which one of them it is.”** | The market validated GSK’s valuation: the $13/share price was accepted, and the deal closed without a premium. HGS shareholders received the offered price, indicating GSK’s assessment was not “wrong.” |
| **Implied expectation that the takeover would unlock significant value from HGS’s pipeline.** | Value was realized almost exclusively through Benlysta. Other pipeline assets did not generate notable products or revenues, so the broader pipeline expectation was largely unmet. |
| **Implicit suggestion that the hostile bid might signal a shift in biotech M&A dynamics.** | The 2012‑2014 period did see several high‑profile hostile or unsolicited bids (e.g., Pfizer‑Mylan, Bayer‑Roche), but the overall trend remained dominated by friendly, strategic acquisitions rather than hostile takeovers. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in biotech M&A history and foreshadows the long‑term commercial success (and later decline) of Benlysta, a drug that shaped the SLE treatment landscape. Its relevance is moderate because the broader predictions about pipeline value proved overstated.
