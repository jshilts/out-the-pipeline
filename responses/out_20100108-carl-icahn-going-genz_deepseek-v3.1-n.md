# Carl Icahn Going For Genzyme? (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses rumors, as reported by Fierce Biotech, that activist investor Carl Icahn was preparing to target Genzyme due to the company's ongoing manufacturing problems, following a similar pattern to his previous involvement with Biogen. The author expresses concern about Icahn's potential involvement, drawing a distinction between beneficial "creative destruction" (Schumpeter's concept) that drives innovation and what the author views as Icahn's tendency toward "noncreative but lucrative destruction" that doesn't advance the biotech industry's scientific mission.

## 2. HISTORY

Carl Icahn did indeed launch a proxy fight for control of Genzyme in 2010, nominating four directors to the company's board. This was occurring as Genzyme faced significant manufacturing issues at its Allston Landing facility, including viral contamination that led to FDA sanctions and drug shortages. The situation ultimately resulted in a settlement where Icahn secured two board seats for his nominees in June 2010. Subsequently, Genzyme was acquired by Sanofi in a $20.1 billion deal that closed in April 2011 - a transaction that occurred under pressure from the manufacturing crisis and activist shareholder influence. The FDA's consent decree regarding the manufacturing issues wasn't resolved until 2015, four years after the Sanofi acquisition. The takeover represented one of the largest biotech acquisitions at the time and demonstrated how manufacturing quality problems in biotech can create vulnerabilities to activist investors and ultimately lead to major corporate transactions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction that Icahn would target Genzyme similar to Biogen**: This proved accurate - Icahn did launch a proxy fight for board representation at Genzyme in 2010, continuing his pattern of activist investing in biotech companies.
- **Implication that manufacturing troubles made Genzyme vulnerable**: Correct - the manufacturing crisis was indeed a key factor that attracted Icahn's attention and strengthened his position in negotiations.
- **Concern about "noncreative but lucrative destruction"**: The outcome was mixed on this point. While Icahn's involvement did pressure the company toward a sale rather than internal turnaround, the acquisition by Sanofi eventually led to resolution of manufacturing issues and maintained the company's therapeutic pipeline, suggesting the situation wasn't purely destructive to patient interests.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured a significant moment in biotech corporate dynamics, correctly anticipating Icahn's activist involvement and highlighting the intersection of manufacturing quality issues with investor activism. The Genzyme case became a notable example of how quality crises can reshape major biotech companies.
