# Shootmenowicene  
**August 2012**

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary notes that the natural product **shootmenowicene**—a molecule that had been mentioned only a day earlier—has now been synthesized in the laboratory by a researcher named **See Arr Oh**. The author points to a blog post that claims the total synthesis can be achieved in **47 steps**. He suggests that the overall purity could be further improved by applying a preparative gas‑chromatography (prep‑GC) purification to one of the early intermediates, or by using a spinning‑band distillation, but otherwise considers the synthesis essentially complete.

## 2. HISTORY  
A comprehensive search of the scientific literature, patent databases, and FDA/EMA drug approval records up to early 2026 yields **no trace** of a compound named *shootmenowicene* or of a 47‑step total synthesis attributed to “See Arr Oh.” The blog link cited in the article (a personal “justlikecooking” blog) is no longer active, and no subsequent peer‑reviewed publications cite it. Consequently:

* **No approved drug** or clinical candidate bearing the name *shootmenowicene* has appeared.  
* The synthetic route has **not been adopted** in any major synthetic‑chemistry textbooks or review articles.  
* No biotech or pharmaceutical company appears to have built a pipeline around this scaffold.  
* There have been **no policy changes**, market impacts, or notable business developments linked to the molecule.

In short, the reported synthesis seems to have remained an isolated, unpublished laboratory exercise that did not translate into further scientific or commercial activity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original commentary does not contain explicit future predictions beyond the brief suggestion that purity could be improved with prep‑GC or spinning‑band distillation. Since no concrete forecasts were made, there are no predictions to evaluate against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10**  
The article is of limited interest because the compound appears to be obscure (or possibly fictitious), the synthesis never entered the public scientific record, and there have been no downstream scientific, clinical, or commercial consequences.
