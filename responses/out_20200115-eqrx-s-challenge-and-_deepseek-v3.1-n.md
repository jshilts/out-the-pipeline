# EQRx's Challenge, And My Challenge to Them (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes the launch of EQRx, a biotech startup founded by Alexis Borisy that aimed to disrupt pharmaceutical pricing by developing "fast-follower" drugs—new medicines targeting existing validated mechanisms—and selling them at lower prices than patented originals. The company's ambitious goals included developing roughly 50 experimental medicines and launching 10 drugs within a decade, with the first medicine expected within five years.

The article's author expresses strong skepticism about EQRx's claims, particularly regarding the feasibility of rapid drug development through technology-driven approaches like virtual screening of billions of compounds "overnight in the cloud" and on-demand synthesis. The critique focuses on the irreducible science risk in drug development, the practical challenges of virtual screening (including false positives), and the fundamental difference between Amazon's execution-focused business model and the complex, uncertain process of drug discovery. The piece concludes with a public challenge: the author offers to bet \$500 on LongBets.org that EQRx would not succeed in producing ten drugs in ten years.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication in January 2020, EQRx pursued its vision with substantial funding, raising approximately \$1.8 billion total, including a \$500 million Series B in 2021 and going public via SPAC merger in 2022 with CM Life Sciences III at a valuation around \$3.6 billion. However, the company faced significant challenges that ultimately validated much of the author's skepticism.

**Clinical Development:** EQRx concentrated on fast-followers in oncology. Their lead programs included:
- **Aumolertinib**: An EGFR inhibitor (licensed from Hansoh Pharma) for non-small cell lung cancer—their most advanced program
- **Sugemalimab**: A PD-L1 antibody for lung cancer
- **Lerociclib**: A CDK4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer

**Regulatory and Market Failures:** The company encountered substantial setbacks that undermined its business model. Aumolertinib, while approved in China, faced an FDA rejection and did not receive U.S. approval, eliminating the primary market opportunity. Other programs either showed insufficient differentiation from existing therapies or failed to gain regulatory traction.

**Business Collapse:** In 2023, EQRx essentially collapsed as an independent entity. Following the clinical and regulatory setbacks, the company merged with Revolution Medicines and laid off its workforce. The merger effectively represented acqui-hiring rather than a successful independent operation, with EQRx's pipeline failing to deliver on its pricing disruption promise.

**Market Context:** The core assumption that payers would flock to lower-cost alternatives proved overly optimistic. Physicians and health systems showed limited willingness to adopt fast-followers without demonstrated superiority over existing therapies. The FDA's increasingly strict requirements for demonstrating meaningful clinical benefit also posed barriers to me-too drugs entering the market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**EQRx's Predictions:**
- **Develop 10 drugs within 10 years**: The author expressed strong skepticism, stating the timeline was unrealistic. **Outcome**: EQRx achieved zero FDA-approved drugs before the company effectively dissolved in 2023, well short of the 10-year timeline, validating the author's skepticism.
- **Launch first drug within 5 years**: This was a key milestone they aimed for by 2025. **Outcome**: No drug was successfully launched in the U.S. market; their lead candidate was rejected by the FDA.
- **Disrupt pharmaceutical pricing through technology-driven process improvements**: EQRx claimed that integrating data science and technology would enable rapid, low-cost drug development. **Outcome**: The fundamental science risk and development timelines proved inescapable; no price disruption was achieved, and the technology advantages proved insufficient to overcome biological complexity.
- **Shift from science risk to execution risk**: EQRx claimed they could minimize science risk by focusing on validated targets. **Outcome**: Science risk remained dominant, with clinical failures and regulatory hurdles demonstrating that even validated targets carry substantial development risk.

**Implicit Industry Predictions:**
- **Fast-follower drugs can compete primarily on price**: **Outcome**: Still not established in the market; differentiation remains critical for commercial success.
- **Payers will drive rapid adoption of lower-cost alternatives**: **Outcome**: Limited evidence of this behavior; clinical differentiation, not price, drives most prescription decisions for branded drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient analysis regarding the fundamental challenges facing drug development and pricing reform. It correctly identified core flaws in EQRx's business model that ultimately led to the company's collapse, while highlighting ongoing structural issues in pharmaceutical economics.
