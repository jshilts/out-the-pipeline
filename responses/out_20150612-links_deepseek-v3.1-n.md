## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog serves as a collection of curated links to other chemistry-related content from June 2015. The author highlights two specific items: first, a post by "Milkshake" discussing "blunder-based optimization" (BBO) in chemical reactions, where accidentally running control reactions differently than planned can lead to unexpectedly improved results. The author admits to having cut similar corners himself but suggests the technique needs a shorter name. Second, the post references "See Arr Oh's" discussion of using silicone oil as a solvent in chemical synthesis, a technique the author acknowledges he had overlooked in previous discussions despite having inadvertently used it in some reactions.

## 2. HISTORY

This article is essentially a "link roundup" style blog post rather than substantive scientific commentary. Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog (hosted by Science magazine and later by various platforms) has been running since the early 2000s and continues to publish regularly through 2025. The blog primarily covers pharmaceutical chemistry, drug discovery, and biotechnology industry news with Lowe's characteristic analytical perspective.

The specific content linked - discussions about practical laboratory techniques like reaction optimization methods and alternative solvents - represents routine, ongoing topics in synthetic chemistry research and development. These techniques would primarily be of interest to practicing medicinal chemists and synthetic organic chemists working in drug discovery and related fields. However, the linked posts appear to be from smaller, specialized chemistry blogs that may or may not have continued publishing regularly after 2015.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no substantive predictions about biotechnology, drug development, or scientific methodology. The author's main speculative comment is that "blunder-based optimization" needs a shorter name ("BBO") to catch on - a minor linguistic observation rather than a scientific or technological prediction. This is purely a blog post sharing interesting links rather than making predictions about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 1/10**

This is essentially ephemeral blog content serving as a link aggregator rather than substantive analysis of biotechnology or scientific developments. It has no lasting scientific importance and limited relevance to understanding actual biotechnology industry developments.
