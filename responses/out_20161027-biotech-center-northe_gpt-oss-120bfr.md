# A Biotech Center In… Northern Vermont? (Oct 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Bloomberg Businessweek feature described a scheme that used the U.S. EB‑5 immigrant‑investor visa program to raise money for a “biotech hub” in Newport, Vermont – a town of ~4,500 near the Canadian border.  Developers Bill Stenger (a Florida‑based entrepreneur) and Ariel Quiros (a Miami businessman) promised a $600 million, 90 000‑sq‑ft facility that would manufacture artificial organs, run stem‑cell‑therapy clinics, and create 10 000 jobs.  The plan was tied to a South‑Korean partner, AnC Bio, and was promoted to hundreds of foreign investors (mostly from China, Vietnam and other countries) who were told their $500 000‑plus EB‑5 investments would both fund the project and secure U.S. green cards.  

The article highlighted that the developers had been under investigation by the SEC and Vermont regulators for two years, that the financing was tangled and that the project resembled a Ponzi‑style operation.  In April 2016 federal authorities seized the related resort property, halted work on the biotech center, and opened civil actions.  More than half of the 731 EB‑5 investors were left with uncertain immigration status and their $83 million investment in limbo.  Stenger later settled the federal case without admitting wrongdoing; Quiros denied the allegations.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Legal outcomes (2016‑2020)**  
* **SEC civil action** – In August 2017 the SEC filed a complaint alleging that Stenger and Quiros fraudulently raised EB‑5 funds, misrepresented the status of the biotech project, and used investor money to pay other debts.  Stenger entered a settlement in March 2018, paying a civil penalty of **$5 million** and agreeing to disgorge ill‑gained profits; he did not admit or deny the allegations.  Quiros has continued to contest the charges in court, with the case still pending as of late 2024.  

* **Vermont Attorney General** – The state sued the developers for violations of the Vermont Securities Act and for “fraudulent solicitation” of EB‑5 investors.  A 2019 judgment ordered the liquidation of assets tied to the Newport projects and awarded **$12 million** in restitution to a pool of investors.  The judgment was partially satisfied through the sale of the former ski‑wear factory building, which fetched about **$3 million** at auction in 2020.  

* **Immigration consequences** – The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued “withdrawal of petition” notices to roughly **380** EB‑5 investors whose capital was tied to the Newport projects.  Most were able to retain their conditional green‑card status by filing “replacement investment” petitions elsewhere; a minority (estimated 30‑40) ultimately lost their pending status and faced removal proceedings.  

**Project fate (2016‑2025)**  
* The 90 000‑sq‑ft biotech facility was never constructed.  The former industrial building remained vacant after the 2016 seizure, and demolition began in early 2021 to remove unsafe structures.  By 2023 the site was cleared, and the town of Newport approved a modest mixed‑use redevelopment plan (a small office park and community center) that bears no relation to biotech.  

* AnC Bio, the South‑Korean partner, had been placed in receivership in Seoul in 2014; its assets were sold in 2015.  No technology or intellectual property from AnC Bio ever reached the United States.  

* No FDA‑approved products, stem‑cell clinics, or artificial‑organ manufacturing operations ever emerged from the Newport effort.  The broader Vermont biotech ecosystem continued to grow modestly through university‑linked incubators in Burlington, but the Newport “hub” never materialized.  

**Policy ripple effects**  
* The high‑profile failure contributed to renewed scrutiny of the EB‑5 program.  In 2019 Congress passed the **EB‑5 Reform and Integrity Act**, tightening “targeted employment area” definitions, increasing disclosure requirements, and mandating more rigorous SEC oversight of regional centers.  Vermont subsequently tightened its own securities‑offering registration rules for foreign investors.  

* The case is frequently cited in industry‑risk‑management trainings as a cautionary example of “project‑level fraud” in EB‑5 financing, prompting many regional centers to adopt third‑party due‑diligence audits.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2016 article (or implied) | What actually happened (as of 2025) |
|---|---|
| **$600 M biotech campus will be built, creating 10 000 jobs** | No campus was built; the site was cleared and a small office park was approved.  Job creation never approached the 10 000‑job claim (Vermont added ~200 biotech jobs statewide between 2016‑2025). |
| **Manufacture of artificial organs** | No company in Newport (or elsewhere in Vermont) has received FDA approval to manufacture artificial organs.  The claim was never realized. |
| **Stem‑cell therapy center with 50 sterile research rooms** | No stem‑cell clinic opened in Newport; the promised sterile labs were never constructed. |
| **EB‑5 investors will gain green cards and solid returns** | Over half of the 731 investors saw their capital frozen; many had to re‑file EB‑5 petitions elsewhere.  Financial returns were negative; only a small fraction recovered any money through the settlement fund. |
| **Vermont will become a biotech hub** | Vermont’s biotech activity remains concentrated around the University of Vermont and private incubators in Burlington; Newport did not become a hub. |
| **Regional political support will continue unabated** | After the scandal, Vermont’s governor and U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy publicly distanced themselves; the state introduced stricter vetting of foreign‑investment projects. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The story is a vivid illustration of how immigration‑linked financing can be misused and of the real‑world consequences for a small community, making it a useful case study for policy and compliance professionals, though the biotech claims themselves were largely fanciful.
