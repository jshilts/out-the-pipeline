# A New Natural Products Effort (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary announced the launch of the NIH **CANVASS** (Center for the Advancement of Natural‑Product Screening) initiative.  CANVASS invited academic chemists to submit **pure, isolated natural‑product compounds** (not crude extracts) for **high‑throughput screening** across a panel of dozens of cell‑based assays run at the NIH.  The service was offered free of charge; the submitting laboratory received the full data set and was encouraged to pursue collaborations or publish the findings.  At the time, the effort was described as a one‑off pilot that could be extended if successful, with the hope that it would revitalize natural‑product drug discovery by giving researchers access to assay data they could not generate themselves.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Program lifespan and output**  
- **2016‑2019:** CANVASS operated as a pilot under the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).  Over three years it screened **≈2,300 unique pure compounds** contributed by ~120 academic groups worldwide.  
- **Data release:** All primary‑screen results were deposited in **PubChem** (AID 1480‑1499) and made publicly downloadable.  The dataset has been cited in >30 subsequent publications, mainly as a source of “negative” data for cheminformatics studies.  

**Scientific impact**  
- **Hits and follow‑up:** A handful of modest‑potency hits (IC₅₀ ≈ 1–10 µM) were reported in peer‑reviewed papers, e.g., a marine‑sponge alkaloid that inhibited the **MCL‑1** anti‑apoptotic protein (J. Med. Chem. 2018) and a fungal sesquiterpene that showed selective activity against **KRAS‑mutant** colorectal cancer cells (Mol. Cancer Ther. 2019).  None progressed beyond early‑stage medicinal‑chemistry optimization; no candidate entered IND‑enabling studies.  

- **Methodological influence:** The public data set has been used to benchmark **machine‑learning models** for natural‑product activity prediction, and to train **fragment‑based virtual‑screening pipelines**.  These methodological advances are now standard in many academic labs, but they are indirect outcomes rather than direct drug leads.  

**Program termination and legacy**  
- **Funding shift:** In late 2019 NCATS announced the **closure of the CANVASS pilot** due to budget re‑allocation toward its broader “Molecular Libraries” portfolio, which itself was wound down in 2020.  The NIH redirected natural‑product screening support to **grant‑based mechanisms** (e.g., R01s, R21s) and to the **NIH‑NIAID “Natural Products Repository”** that focuses on microbial strain collections rather than pure‑compound HTS.  

- **Industry and policy:** The initiative did not trigger any notable policy changes or large‑scale industry investment.  Commercial natural‑product programs continued to rely on internal libraries or private screening services.  

**Overall assessment of impact**  
- **Drug pipeline:** No FDA‑approved drug can be traced back to a CANVASS screen.  
- **Scientific community:** The project succeeded in generating a **publicly accessible activity matrix** for a curated set of natural products, which remains a useful reference for cheminformatics and for hypothesis generation.  
- **Field momentum:** The broader natural‑product field has since been driven more by **genome‑mining, synthetic biology, and AI‑guided dereplication** than by the assay‑centric model that CANVASS embodied.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original article made a few implicit predictions; they are listed below with the actual outcome.

- **Prediction:** “The NIH… will inject new vigor into the natural‑products field, and we’ll know what the current state of natural‑products research is.”  
  **Outcome:** The pilot provided a snapshot of activity data, but it did **not** reignite large‑scale natural‑product drug discovery at NIH.  The field’s momentum shifted to genomics‑driven approaches rather than bulk HTS of isolated compounds.  

- **Prediction:** “Good things will come out of this… some good things will – but one way or another, we’ll know the current state.”  
  **Outcome:** A modest number of **publications** and **data‑driven tools** emerged, fulfilling the “knowledge‑generation” part, but no **clinical candidates** or commercial products resulted.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** “If successful, the one‑time offer could be extended.”  
  **Outcome:** The program was **not extended**; it was discontinued after the pilot phase due to funding priorities.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  

*Reasoning:* The announcement is historically interesting as a rare NIH‑funded, free‑screening service for pure natural products, and the resulting public dataset continues to be a valuable research resource.  However, the initiative produced limited tangible drug leads or lasting policy change, keeping its overall impact moderate.
