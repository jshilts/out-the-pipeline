# Trimethylaluminum Explosion in Massachusetts (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on a serious industrial accident at a Dow Advanced Materials facility in North Andover, Massachusetts, involving an explosion caused by trimethylaluminum (TMA). The author notes this was particularly concerning as the same facility had experienced a fatal explosion just three years earlier in 2013, which involved trimethylindium reacting with cleaning fluid. The article characterizes organometallics like TMA as extremely hazardous materials that react violently with oxygen, moisture, and other substances, producing massive flames through exothermic reactions. The author expresses strong safety concerns about handling such compounds, especially on an industrial scale, and emphasizes that while sealed systems and safety measures exist, accidents still occur. Initial reports suggested 4-5 injuries from the incident.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Incident's Aftermath:**
The January 7, 2016 explosion at Dow's North Andover facility resulted in four workers being hospitalized with burn injuries. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) launched an investigation into the incident, which involved the violent reaction of trimethylaluminum.

**CSB Investigation and Findings (2016-2018):**
The CSB's investigation revealed several critical safety deficiencies. In their final report, investigators found that an unsealed valve on a reactor allowed air and moisture to enter the system containing trimethylaluminum, causing the violent reaction. The investigation also identified systemic issues including inadequate standard operating procedures for maintenance activities involving air and moisture-sensitive materials, insufficient training for operators, and failure to implement proper engineering controls.

**Regulatory and Company Response:**
Following the incident and CSB recommendations:
- Dow implemented enhanced safety protocols at the facility
- OSHA conducted investigations resulting in safety citations
- The incident contributed to increased regulatory scrutiny of organometallic handling in industrial settings
- Enhanced training programs were developed for handling pyrophoric materials

**Facility Status:**
The Dow facility in North Andover has continued operations but under increased safety oversight. The 2016 incident, combined with the 2013 fatality, led to sustained attention on industrial safety practices for handling highly reactive organometallic compounds in semiconductor and materials manufacturing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather focused on describing the immediate situation and emphasizing the inherent dangers of handling organometallics. There was an implicit expectation that such incidents would continue to occur if proper safety measures weren't rigorously implemented, which the subsequent CSB findings and safety improvements validated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important industrial safety incident involving chemical process safety, but represents a specific accident report rather than broader scientific or policy developments that would sustain long-term interest.
