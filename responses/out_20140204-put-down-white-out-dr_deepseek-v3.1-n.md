# Put Down That White-Out; Drop That Photoshop Cursor (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a significant scientific integrity issue that surfaced in the chemistry community. Organic Letters published six corrections related to NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) data manipulation, where researchers had apparently removed solvent peaks and impurity signals from their spectra using photo-editing software like Photoshop, while also restating reaction yields. The post references Amos Smith's earlier 2013 editorial about spectrum manipulation practices and uses a French military phrase ("encourager les autres") to suggest these corrections might set an example for others. The article also references a specific question about whether the Fukuyama lab voluntarily corrected their work or was pressured to do so.

## 2. HISTORY
The events described in this article became part of a broader pattern of increasing scrutiny over scientific image manipulation and data integrity throughout the 2010s. The referenced corrections were part of organic chemistry's ongoing efforts to address research misconduct. Following this period, several developments occurred:

**Regulatory and Institutional Changes:** Journals increasingly implemented automated image screening tools and more rigorous peer review processes for supporting data. Publications like the Journal of the American Chemical Society and Organic Letters strengthened their editorial policies on data presentation and manipulation.

**Technology Solutions:** The scientific publishing industry moved toward adopting digital tools that could detect image manipulation automatically, with companies developing software specifically for identifying altered spectra and gel images.

**Broader Impact:** This episode contributed to a wider awareness of research integrity issues across chemistry and life sciences. However, the problem persisted - major retractions and corrections continued to occur throughout the decade, indicating that while awareness increased, eliminating the practice entirely remained challenging.

**No Major Public Policy Changes:** There were no significant federal policy changes or legislation directly resulting from these specific corrections, though they contributed to ongoing discussions about research integrity funding and oversight.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's subtle suggestions about future developments included:

• **That these corrections would "encourage others" to be more careful** - This had mixed results. While awareness of integrity issues increased significantly in the chemistry community, high-profile cases of data manipulation and retractions continued to occur regularly throughout the 2010s and beyond, suggesting the deterrent effect was partial rather than complete.

• **Implicit suggestion that journal oversight would strengthen** - This prediction was largely accurate. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, major chemistry journals had implemented automated screening systems and more rigorous data checking requirements for submissions.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important and persistent issue in scientific publishing, but focuses on a routine correction notice rather than a major scandal or breakthrough. While data integrity remains highly relevant, this specific incident represents a typical example rather than a landmark case.
