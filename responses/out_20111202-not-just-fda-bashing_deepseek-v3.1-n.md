# Not Just FDA-Bashing? (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog addresses the polarized debate around FDA regulation. On one side, critics argue the FDA stifles innovation with excessive regulations; on the other, critics believe the agency fails to adequately police drug companies and allows unsafe compounds to reach market. The author positions himself between these extremes, supporting the FDA's core mandate for rigorous safety and efficacy testing.

The central focus is a novel proposal the author highlights from a Bio-IT World column: creating "FDA-free Enterprise Zones" within medical institutions like the Cleveland Clinic. In these designated areas, physicians, scientists, and volunteer patients with terminal illnesses could experiment with therapies based solely on informed consent, bypassing standard FDA oversight. Treatments proven effective in these zones would still need to clear the full FDA regulatory pathway for broader market access. The piece frames this as a feasible, incremental reform to test whether lighter regulation for terminally ill patients, who already receive many unproven therapies, could accelerate discovery without compromising safety for the general population. It invites reader debate on the proposal's merits.

## 2. HISTORY
The proposal for "FDA-free Enterprise Zones" was never realized. No enabling legislation was ever drafted or enacted. The FDA's regulatory purview for drug approval remained fundamentally unchanged. Both the agency's advocates and its vocal critics persisted, but calls for deregulated "zones" failed to gain mainstream support or institutional traction.

Subsequent developments in drug approval showed some movement, but not toward deregulation. The FDA expanded existing accelerated pathways like Breakthrough Therapy (established by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, FDASIA, in 2012) and regenerative medicine frameworks (21st Century Cures Act, 2016). These changes sought to expedite approvals for serious conditions without sacrificing regulatory oversight, instead streamlining evidence requirements and review processes. For oncology and rare diseases, pathways like accelerated approval allowed drugs onto the market based on surrogate endpoints with confirmatory trials required post-approval. The Right to Try Act, passed in 2018, permitted patients with life-threatening conditions to access investigational drugs outside clinical trials, but with strict eligibility criteria and without FDA pre-approval. It did not, however, create "Enterprise Zones" or permit unrestrained experimentation.

Public and legislative discussions about FDA reform increasingly focused on targeted initiatives like the Oncology Center of Excellence (launched 2017), real-world evidence integration (advancing since the mid-2010s), and expanding patient input in regulatory decision-making. Debates over regulatory stringency continued, but concrete policy evolved to emphasize "smart" regulation—improving efficiency, embracing novel trial designs, and leveraging real-world data—rather than establishing deregulated enclaves.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction: States could carve out "FDA-free Enterprise Zones" in medical centers.**  
  **Outcome:** This never happened. No such legislation or pilot programs were enacted at federal or state levels. Regulatory oversight remained consistent.

- **Prediction: Physicians, scientists, and volunteer patients could make their own decisions in these zones based on informed consent alone.**  
  **Outcome:** Unmet. Even with later laws like Right to Try, informed consent must still navigate complex ethical oversight and institutional review—not unfettered decision-making.

- **Prediction: Breakthroughs from these zones would still face the full FDA regulatory "gantlet" before broader availability.**  
  **Outcome:** Not applicable, as the zones were never created. Existing pathways (like accelerated approval) allow earlier access but still demand rigorous evidence generation.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5**

The article captured a specific, moderately novel policy idea—deregulated medical zones—during a time of heightened debate about the FDA’s pace of innovation, but the concept failed to gain traction and lacks historical significance. The broader tension between innovation and safety endures, but this particular proposal became irrelevant.
