# AstraZeneca Makes a Deal With Moderna. Wait, Who? (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This March 2013 commentary discusses AstraZeneca's announcement of 2,300 job cuts in sales and administration, part of a broader restructuring of the company's R&D strategy. The more notable development was AstraZeneca's $240+ million deal with Moderna Therapeutics, a relatively new Cambridge-based company pursuing an unconventional approach: using messenger RNA (mRNA) as therapy to instruct the body's own cells to produce desired therapeutic proteins. This represented the inverse of existing RNA interference approaches that block protein production. The author expressed both excitement and skepticism about this high-risk strategy, questioning whether cells would properly recognize and translate the mRNA, achieve tissue-specific delivery, and maintain appropriate physiological control. The piece noted that while AstraZeneca might have been a "desperate company" making aggressive bets, Moderna's substantial upfront payment suggested compelling internal data justifying the premium valuation for such speculative technology.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade transformed Moderna from an obscure, high-risk startup into one of the most valuable biotechnology companies in history, with AstraZeneca's $240 million investment representing one of the most prescient bets in pharmaceutical history. 

**Moderna's Technological Validation and Commercial Success:**
- **2013-2019:** Moderna continued advancing mRNA therapeutics across multiple disease areas, with significant progress in infectious disease vaccines and rare genetic disorders
- **2018:** Moderna conducted the largest biotech IPO in history, raising over $600 million and demonstrating sustained investor confidence despite no approved products
- **2013-2020:** Multiple mRNA-based therapies entered clinical trials for infectious diseases, oncology, and rare genetic conditions, gradually establishing proof-of-concept across therapeutic areas

**Pandemic-Driven Transformation and Clinical Proof:**
- **2020-2021:** Moderna's mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine received FDA emergency use authorization and became the second COVID-19 vaccine approved in the United States
- **Global Impact:** The vaccine demonstrated approximately 94% efficacy in clinical trials, leading to hundreds of millions of doses administered worldwide
- **Commercial Scale:** Moderna generated approximately $18.4 billion in 2021 revenue from the COVID-19 vaccine alone, validating the manufacturing scalability of mRNA therapeutics

**Pipeline Expansion Beyond COVID-19:**
- **Respiratory Vaccines:** Preclinical and early clinical development of mRNA vaccines for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other respiratory pathogens
- **Oncology Applications:** Personalized cancer vaccines leveraging mRNA technology, with several candidates in clinical development
- **Rare Diseases:** Continued development of mRNA therapeutics for genetic disorders where protein replacement showed therapeutic potential

**AstraZeneca Partnership Outcome:**
- The original partnership focused on cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal diseases initially
- By 2020, AstraZeneca had advanced several programs from the Moderna collaboration into clinical development
- The partnership structure allowed AstraZeneca to leverage Moderna's platform while Moderna retained flexibility for other applications

**Industry Impact and Scientific Validation:**
- **Technology Platform Adoption:** Major pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer (partnering with BioNTech for mRNA COVID-19 vaccine), Sanofi, and Novartis accelerated mRNA programs following Moderna's success
- **Manufacturing Infrastructure:** Significant investment in mRNA manufacturing capacity globally, establishing infrastructure for rapid pandemic response capabilities
- **Regulatory Precedent:** FDA approval and WHO emergency use listing established regulatory pathways for future mRNA therapeutics beyond COVID-19
- **Delivery System Advances:** Continued refinement of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems improving mRNA stability, cellular uptake, and tissue targeting

**Clinical and Commercial Results:**
- **Approved Therapies:** Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine represents the first approved mRNA therapeutic, providing definitive clinical validation after decades of research
- **Global Distribution:** Hundreds of millions of people received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, demonstrating population-level safety and effectiveness
- **Public Health Impact:** mRNA vaccines contributed significantly to pandemic control, reducing severe disease and mortality while enabling economic reopening
- **Future Pipeline Value:** Moderna's market capitalization exceeded $100 billion at peak, reflecting expectations for continued platform expansion beyond COVID-19

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's Skeptical Concerns and How They Played Out:**

• **"Will other cell types recognize the mRNA-type molecules... and make some insulin themselves? If they do, what sort of physiological control will they be under?"**
- **Reality:** Direct protein replacement via mRNA did face challenges with tissue-specific delivery and physiological control, though the field advanced significantly. The COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated that intramuscular mRNA delivery could achieve robust protein expression (spike protein) with predictable kinetics and immune responses. However, applications requiring precise tissue targeting or regulated protein expression remain active development challenges rather than fully solved problems.

• **Concern about stepping in "dump some mRNA on the process, and get things to work the way that you want them to"**
- **Reality:** The COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated remarkably precise biological control - mRNA encoding spike protein led to specific, robust immune responses with relatively few side effects. Manufacturing, delivery, and dosing proved highly controllable. However, applications beyond simple protein expression (like regulated metabolic control or tissue-specific targeting) remain more complex and are still advancing through clinical development.

• **"AstraZeneca... a rather desperate company" making aggressive bets**
- **Reality:** This assessment proved accurate in one sense - AstraZeneca did face significant patent cliffs and pipeline gaps in 2013 requiring strategic transformation. However, the Moderna investment became one of the most successful biotechnology partnerships in recent history, validating AstraZeneca's willingness to place substantial bets on unproven technologies while also highlighting Moderna's scientific credibility.

• **"This is the very picture of a high-risk, high-reward approach"**
- **Reality:** This prediction proved remarkably prescient. Moderna faced multiple development failures and skepticism for years before COVID-19 validated the platform. The company lost billions in market value during pipeline setbacks but ultimately delivered paradigm-changing success. Returns for early investors, including AstraZeneca, became astronomical when considering platform validation across multiple therapeutic areas.

• **Implied skepticism about whether the approach would work at all**
- **Reality:** The COVID-19 pandemic served as the ultimate validation event. mRNA vaccines demonstrated safety and efficacy at population scale, while manufacturing proved remarkably scalable and consistent. The technology worked decisively for prophylactic vaccines, opening pathways for broader therapeutic applications.

• **Industry skepticism about whether blocking RNA pathways could become reliable therapy**
- **Reality:** RNA interference (RNAi) therapies did achieve clinical success, with multiple approved products including Alnylam's ONPATTRO (patisiran) in 2018 for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. However, mRNA-based protein replacement proved more immediately scalable and commercially impactful than RNAi, particularly for infectious diseases.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional foresight in identifying both the transformative potential and realistic challenges of mRNA therapeutics. The author's nuanced skepticism toward then-unproven technology, combined with recognition of the high-reward potential, proved remarkably prescient. The piece captures a critical turning point when major pharmaceutical companies began seriously investing in mRNA platforms before clinical validation, establishing the foundation for technology that later transformed global public health. The AstraZeneca-Moderna partnership became one of the most consequential biotechnology collaborations of the 21st century, making this retrospective analysis both historically significant and scientifically illuminating.
