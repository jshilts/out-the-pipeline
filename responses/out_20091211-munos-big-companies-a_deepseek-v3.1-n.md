# Munos On Big Companies and Small Ones (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Bernard Munos' analysis of pharmaceutical R&D productivity patterns, published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. Munos found that drug companies have maintained remarkably steady rates of new molecular entity (NME) production over 60 years, typically well below one NME per year, regardless of company size, therapeutic focus, or era. This output appears to follow a Poisson distribution, suggesting drug development has strong stochastic elements with an underlying average rate rather than being a deterministic process amenable to management optimization.

Key findings include: mergers and acquisitions have not improved innovation rates and may actually hinder it; smaller companies' share of NME production has been growing; drug output correlates better with the number of companies than with company size; and economies of scale do not appear to apply well to pharmaceutical R&D. Munos suggested that innovation networks, different research approaches, orphan drug development, and regulatory differences might explain why smaller companies have become increasingly productive contributors to the drug pipeline.

## 2. HISTORY

The core insights from Munos' 2009 analysis have held up remarkably well and proved prescient in subsequent industry developments:

**Merger Impact**: The decade following 2009 saw continued consolidation (e.g., Pfizer-Wyeth 2009, Merck-Schering-Plough 2009, Teva-Cephalon 2011, Actavis-Warner Chilcott 2013, AbbVie-Shire 2016, Takeda-Shire 2019). Post-merger analysis consistently showed that R&D productivity did not improve and often declined, with merged entities typically cutting R&D spending and reducing output following consolidation.

**Small Company Growth**: Munos' observation that smaller companies were increasing their share of NMEs proved accurate. FDA data shows that from 2010-2022, smaller biotech companies accounted for approximately 60-70% of novel drug approvals, with the proportion growing over time. Companies like Vertex (founded 1989), BioMarin (1997), and Regeneron (1988) exemplified this trend, conducting breakthrough research in specialized areas.

**Orphan Drug Act Success**: The orphan drug pathway, which Munos noted as potentially favoring smaller companies, became increasingly important. Orphan drugs grew from ~25% of novel FDA approvals in 2009 to ~40-50% in the 2010s and 2020s, with smaller companies disproportionately represented in this category due to lower development costs and faster regulatory pathways.

**Biotech Industry Maturation**: The biotech sector continued expanding in the 2010s, with increased venture capital investment and a growing number of publicly traded biotech companies. However, this growth came with increased volatility and, by the 2020s, some market correction.

**R&D Cost Escalation**: The trend Munos identified of soaring costs per NME continued. By the late 2010s, estimates for developing a new drug (including failures) reached $2-3 billion, though methodologies for these calculations remain debated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article and Munos paper made several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **Prediction**: Small companies would continue increasing their share of NME output
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Correct. FDA data confirms smaller companies now account for the majority of novel drug approvals, with this trend accelerating post-2009.

- **Prediction**: Mergers would continue failing to improve innovation rates
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Correct. Subsequent research (including by Munos himself in later publications) confirmed that M&A in pharma does not improve R&D productivity and often reduces output.

- **Prediction**: The steady-state NME production rate would persist due to fundamental stochastic nature of drug discovery
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Mostly correct. While individual years show variation, the overall rate of ~20-50 NMEs/year in the US has remained relatively stable, though with some improvement in the 2010s-2020s compared to 2000s.

- **Prediction**: Economies of scale wouldn't apply to R&D
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Correct. Subsequent analysis confirmed that large company R&D productivity (measured as approvals per R&D dollar) remained lower than for smaller, focused companies.

- **Prediction**: Innovation networks would be increasingly important for small company success
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Correct. The 2010s saw proliferation of partnerships, licensing deals, and collaborative research networks between small biotechs and larger companies or academic institutions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified fundamental structural issues in pharmaceutical innovation that proved remarkably durable and prescient. The core insight—that drug discovery follows stochastic rather than deterministic patterns, and that company size inversely correlates with innovation productivity—has been validated by subsequent industry developments and continues to inform current debates about pharmaceutical R&D strategy.
