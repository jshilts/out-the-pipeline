# New Antibiotics, Potential and (Nearly) Actual (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article highlighted two concurrent developments in the fight against drug‑resistant bacteria.  

1. **CARB‑X** – a newly announced public‑private partnership (U.S. HHS, Wellcome Trust, UK MRC, etc.) that would award grants to small biotech firms in the U.S. and Europe. Its stated aim was to stimulate discovery of *novel* chemical scaffolds rather than incremental modifications of existing antibiotics.  

2. **Lugdunin** – a cyclic thiazolidine‑containing peptide produced by the skin commensal *Staphylococcus lugdunensis*. The 2016 Nature paper reported that lugdunin kills *Staphylococcus aureus* and other Gram‑positive pathogens in vitro and in a mouse skin‑infection model, shows low toxicity to human cells, and appears difficult for bacteria to develop resistance to. The authors suggested two possible public‑health angles: (a) development of lugdunin or derivatives as a new antibiotic, and (b) deliberate colonisation with *S. lugdunensis* as a microbiome‑based prophylaxis against *S. aureus* carriage.

The piece concluded with cautious optimism that both the funding mechanism and the natural‑product discovery could translate into tangible new therapies.

## 2. HISTORY  

### CARB‑X outcomes (2016‑2025)  
- **Funding scale** – By the end of 2024 CARB‑X had awarded > $500 million to > 70 projects across 12 countries.  
- **Clinical candidates** – Several CARB‑X‑backed programs have entered human trials:  
  * **Ibezapolstat (Cidara Therapeutics)** – a novel DNA‑polymerase inhibitor for *Clostridioides difficile* (Phase III data released 2023, FDA approval pending).  
  * **Murepavadin (Spero Therapeutics)** – a peptide targeting *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* LptD; Phase II trial completed 2022, but development paused after safety signals.  
  * **Plazomicin (Achaogen)** – received FDA approval in 2018 for complicated urinary‑tract infections; Achaogen later filed for bankruptcy (2019), but the drug remains on the market under a new license holder.  
  * **Lefamulin (Nabriva Therapeutics)** – a pleuromutilin antibiotic approved in 2019 for community‑acquired bacterial pneumonia; while Nabriva received some CARB‑X‑related non‑dilutive funding, the bulk of its development was private.  

- **Pipeline impact** – As of 2025, about 12 CARB‑X‑supported programs are in Phase I–II, covering diverse modalities (small molecules, bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, anti‑virulence agents). The partnership has been credited with keeping a modest but steady flow of early‑stage antibiotic projects alive at a time when large pharma withdrew from the space.  

- **Policy influence** – CARB‑X’s model has inspired similar initiatives (e.g., the UK’s AMR Accelerator, the EU’s New Drugs for Bad Bugs). It also helped shape the U.S. 2022 “Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now” (GAIN) Act amendments that expanded pull incentives for novel antibiotics.

### Lugdunin research trajectory  
- **Mechanistic work** – Between 2017 and 2022 multiple groups (e.g., the original Basel team, researchers at the University of Zurich, and the Broad Institute) elucidated the biosynthetic gene cluster, confirmed that lugdunin is ribosomally synthesized and post‑translationally modified (RiPP), and identified a membrane‑disruption mode that involves depolarisation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.  

- **Synthetic analogues** – Chemists have produced several lugdunin analogues with improved stability and pharmacokinetics (e.g., “Lug‑A1” and “Lug‑B2”). Pre‑clinical pharmacology showed activity against MRSA and VRE in mouse systemic infection models, but none have yet progressed beyond proof‑of‑concept due to formulation challenges and modest oral bioavailability.  

- **Microbiome‑based approaches** – A small pilot study (2020) inoculated healthy volunteers’ nares with a *S. lugdunensis* strain engineered to over‑produce lugdunin. Colonisation persisted for ~4 weeks and was associated with a transient reduction in *S. aureus* carriage, but the effect waned after cessation of exposure. No larger clinical trials have been launched as of late 2025.  

- **Commercial development** – No company has announced a lugdunin‑derived drug candidate entering IND‑enabling studies, and no FDA/EMA submissions have been filed. The molecule remains at the academic‑research stage.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2016 article | What actually happened (by 2025) |
|---|---|
| **CARB‑X will “lead to approved drugs”** – the author hoped the funding would translate into marketable antibiotics. | CARB‑X has helped advance ~12 candidates into early‑phase clinical trials; **one** (plazomicin) reached FDA approval, and **another** (lefamulin) reached approval with indirect CARB‑X support. Most projects remain pre‑clinical or early‑phase, so the prediction is only partially fulfilled. |
| **Lugdunin could become a new antibiotic** – the article suggested it might be developed as a drug. | No lugdunin‑based drug has entered clinical trials; research continues but formulation and safety hurdles have prevented progression to IND filing. Prediction not realized to date. |
| **Microbiome colonisation with *S. lugdunensis* could be a prophylactic strategy** – the author hinted at using the commensal to suppress *S. aureus*. | A limited human proof‑of‑concept study (2020) showed temporary decolonisation, but no larger trials or commercial products have emerged. The concept remains experimental. |
| **Resistance to lugdunin will be hard to evolve** – based on in‑vitro passaging results. | Follow‑up laboratory evolution studies (2018‑2021) confirmed a high barrier to resistance, though rare mutants with altered membrane composition have been isolated under extreme selective pressure. The original claim holds broadly, but “no resistance ever” is overstated. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is noteworthy because it captured the launch of a major funding initiative (CARB‑X) that has had a measurable, though modest, impact on the antibiotic pipeline, and it introduced a rare human‑derived antimicrobial (lugdunin) that continues to inspire research. Its long‑term significance is moderate: CARB‑X’s influence persists, while lugdunin has yet to translate into a product.
