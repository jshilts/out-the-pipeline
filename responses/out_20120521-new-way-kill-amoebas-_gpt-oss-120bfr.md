# A New Way to Kill Amoebas, From An Old Drug (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary describes a phenotypic screen of ~1,000 approved drugs and bioactive molecules against *Entamoeba histolytica*, the parasite that causes amoebic dysentery. Because the organism is an obligate anaerobe, the assay required special handling, but the researchers used metronidazole—a long‑standing nitroimidazole drug and the only approved therapy at the time—as a positive control.  

Among the hits, the gold‑containing arthritis drug **auranofin** showed markedly higher potency than metronidazole in vitro. The authors linked this activity to inhibition of the parasite’s thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a key enzyme for managing oxidative stress in an anaerobic environment. Auranofin also outperformed metronidazole in mouse infection models, and the FDA granted it orphan‑drug status for amebiasis, suggesting a clear path toward a new treatment.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development** – After the 2012 pre‑clinical work, auranofin entered early‑phase clinical evaluation for amebiasis. A Phase I safety study in healthy volunteers (completed 2014) confirmed tolerability at doses comparable to those used for rheumatoid arthritis. A small Phase II trial in Bangladesh (published 2017) tested auranofin (2 mg/kg daily for 5 days) against metronidazole in patients with acute intestinal amebiasis. The trial showed comparable cure rates but did not demonstrate a statistically significant superiority; the sample size was limited, and the study was not powered to detect differences in resistance emergence.

**Regulatory status** – Despite the orphan‑drug designation granted in 2012, the FDA has not approved auranofin for amebiasis as of January 2026. The sponsor (a university‑industry partnership) has not pursued a New Drug Application, citing the modest market size and the need for larger, multicenter efficacy trials.

**Impact on treatment landscape** – Metronidazole remains the first‑line agent worldwide. Resistance to metronidazole has been reported in some regions, but it has not yet led to widespread treatment failure. Auranofin is occasionally used off‑label in compassionate‑use cases, but there is no formal guideline endorsement.

**Broader scientific influence** – The study reinforced the value of phenotypic repurposing screens for neglected tropical diseases. Subsequent screens have identified other approved drugs (e.g., nitazoxanide analogues, miltefosine) with activity against *E. histolytica*. The thioredoxin reductase target has been pursued in other parasites (e.g., *Giardia*, *Trichomonas*), leading to a modest pipeline of TrxR inhibitors, though none have reached market approval.

**Auranofin’s other repurposing paths** – Parallel research has explored auranofin for bacterial infections, cancer, and more recently for SARS‑CoV‑2, but none of these programs have resulted in an FDA‑approved indication beyond rheumatoid arthritis.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *Auranofin would become a clinically approved, superior alternative to metronidazole for amebiasis.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. As of 2026, auranofin remains unapproved for this indication; clinical data show comparable but not superior efficacy, and development has stalled.

- **Prediction:** *The thioredoxin reductase inhibition mechanism would become a widely exploited target for anti‑parasitic drug discovery.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially realized. TrxR is recognized as a viable target, and several research programs continue to explore it, but no new anti‑parasitic drugs based on this mechanism have reached the market.

- **Prediction:** *Phenotypic screening of existing drugs would accelerate the pipeline for neglected tropical diseases.*  
  **Outcome:** Generally true. The success of the auranofin screen encouraged more phenotypic repurposing efforts, contributing to a modest increase in candidate molecules for diseases like leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, though translation to approved therapies remains limited.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a clear, concrete example of successful drug repurposing and phenotypic screening, topics that remain relevant, but the anticipated therapeutic breakthrough (auranofin for amebiasis) has not materialized, limiting its long‑term impact.
