# A Totally New Way to Finance Drug Discovery (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on a proposal by MIT finance professor Andrew Lo and colleagues to create “megafunds” of **$5–30 billion** that would pool dozens or hundreds of early‑stage oncology projects. By diversifying risk across a large portfolio, the authors argue the fund could raise **debt as well as equity**, using securitisation‑style structures (“research‑backed obligations”) to tap the much larger pool of capital available to institutional investors. Their simulations (based on oncology new‑molecule data from 1990‑2011) suggested average equity returns of **8.9–11.4 %** and debt returns of **5–8 %**, modestly above typical venture‑capital hurdle rates but attractive to pension funds, insurers, etc. The piece also discusses why traditional biotech financing (quarterly‑focused equity markets, limited venture capital) may be ill‑suited to the long, costly, high‑failure‑rate nature of drug discovery, and it raises concerns about the potential for the same kind of opaque securitisation that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

## 2. HISTORY  
**No megafund has been launched.**  
- **Funding attempts:** Since 2012 there have been a handful of large‑scale biotech venture funds (e.g., Flagship Pioneering, Arch Venture Partners, SoftBank Vision Fund’s biotech allocations) that raised **$1–5 billion** each, but none approached the $10‑30 billion scale envisioned by Lo.  
- **Debt‑based structures:** A few companies have issued **pipeline‑linked bonds** (e.g., *Gilead* 2020 “COVID‑19” bond, *Moderna* 2021 “COVID‑19” bond) that tie repayment to product milestones, but these are corporate issuances, not pooled‑portfolio securities. No public “research‑backed obligation” market has emerged.  
- **Industry response:** The concept sparked academic debate (Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2013; several finance‑focused blog posts) and was cited in policy discussions about “venture‑debt” for biotech, but regulators and rating agencies have been reluctant to treat a mixed‑pipeline fund as a tradable asset class because of the difficulty of modelling correlated drug‑development risk.  
- **Outcome for oncology R&D:** The period 2012‑2024 saw **steady, not explosive, growth** in oncology approvals (≈50 new oncology NMEs approved by the FDA, up from ≈30 in the prior decade). The increase is largely attributed to **targeted therapies and immunotherapies** emerging from traditional biotech companies and large pharma, not from a megafund model.  
- **Policy & financing trends:** The U.S. government introduced **“R&D tax credits”** and the **“21st Century Cures Act”** (2016) to stimulate early‑stage research, while the **“Advanced Market Commitment”** model has been used for vaccines (e.g., Gavi, CEPI) but not for oncology drugs.  
- **Business trajectories:** The few firms that attempted to aggregate pipelines (e.g., *Mediobase* – a private‑equity‑style vehicle that tried a limited‑scope securitisation in 2015) raised only a few hundred million dollars and were wound down by 2018 after failing to attract sufficient debt investors.

In short, the **megafund idea has not been realized**; the biotech financing landscape has continued to rely on a mix of venture equity, corporate debt, and government incentives rather than large, diversified, securitised debt pools.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (as stated or implied in the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Megafunds of $5–30 B can be raised by issuing debt and equity.** | No such fund has been created. The largest biotech‑focused funds have stayed below $5 B, and none have used securitised debt as a primary financing tool. |
| **Average equity returns of 8.9–11.4 % and debt returns of 5–8 % would be achievable.** | Since the funds never existed, these returns are untested. Real‑world biotech venture funds have historically targeted **>20 % IRR** for equity, while debt investors have earned **~3–5 %** on corporate bonds, reflecting the gap between the proposal and market reality. |
| **Diversification would reduce risk enough to make early‑stage projects financially viable.** | Diversification does lower portfolio variance, but the **correlation of failure across oncology projects remains high** (≈70 % overall failure rate). The risk reduction achieved by existing multi‑project biotech companies has not been sufficient to attract large institutional debt investors. |
| **Securitisation would unlock “patient capital” from pension funds, insurers, etc.** | Institutional investors continue to allocate to biotech **via equity or direct corporate bonds**, not via pooled pipeline securities. Concerns about opacity and model risk have kept them away from such structures. |
| **A “preclinical incubator” shared across the portfolio would generate economies of scale.** | Some consortia (e.g., **NIH’s Accelerating Medicines Partnership**, **EU’s Innovative Medicines Initiative**) have built shared pre‑clinical resources, but these are publicly funded or industry‑specific, not tied to a megafund. |
| **The model would avoid the “quarter‑by‑quarter” pressure of public markets.** | Public biotech companies still face quarterly reporting pressures; the megafund model never materialised to test this hypothesis. |

Overall, the article’s **core predictions have not been borne out**; the financing mechanisms remain largely theoretical.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece is historically interesting because it captured a bold, finance‑driven vision that sparked debate about how to fund costly oncology R&D, even though the idea has not materialised. Its relevance lies more in illustrating the limits of applying traditional securitisation to high‑uncertainty biotech pipelines.
