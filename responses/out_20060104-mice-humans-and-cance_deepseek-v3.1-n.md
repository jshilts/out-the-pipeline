# Mice, Humans, and Cancer (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes a critique by an anonymous epidemiologist ("Revere") of the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), which had petitioned against high-dose rodent carcinogenicity tests. Revere defended the Maximum Tolerated Dose approach, arguing that only about 1% of chemicals can transform normal cells into cancer cells, that we know of no false negatives (all human carcinogens also cause cancer in rodents), and that these tests protect public health. The author pushes back with several complicating factors: high doses can cause irritation and cell proliferation that doesn't scale to low doses (the Bruce Ames critique), the proportion of positive results from synthetic chemicals roughly matches that of natural products, cancer cells are damaged rather than "super cells," the mismatch in cancer types between rodents and humans (liver cancers dominate in rodents while lung cancers dominate in humans), and the problem of false positives—many rodent carcinogens do not appear to pose human risks. The tone is more measured than Revere's polemical framing.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated the author's nuanced position rather than Revere's strident defense of high-dose rodent models. Regulatory guidelines evolved: the FDA and EPA moved toward incorporating more mechanistic data and alternative testing strategies. EPA's ToxCast program (launched 2007) and FDA initiatives increasingly emphasized in vitro assays, toxicogenomics, and human-relevant models—recognizing the limitations of traditional bioassays.

The argument over Maximum Tolerated Dose use became more nuanced. Discussions increasingly focused on mode-of-action analysis and interspecies extrapolation, with growing recognition that high-dose effects—particularly cell proliferation—could lead to misleading results for human risk assessment.

The list of IARC-confirmed human carcinogens expanded moderately. By 2024, IARC Monographs list over 1,000 agents evaluated, with about 120 classified as Group 1 human carcinogens, still representing a tiny fraction of chemicals tested in rodent models.

Rodent models have only partially kept pace with modern genomics and understanding of cancer. While they remain essential, regulatory decisions increasingly require mechanistic understanding for extrapolation to humans.

No major policy upheavals eliminated high-dose rodent testing, but regulatory agencies increasingly emphasize integrated testing strategies and weight-of-evidence approaches rather than relying solely on maximum tolerated dose studies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Revere's prediction**: We know of no false negatives with this process; every chemical that causes cancer in humans also does so in rodents.
  - *Reality*: This remains difficult to definitively evaluate. Arsenic remains a debated case. Some compounds have weak human evidence but clear rodent bioassay results, such as certain occupational exposures.
- **Revere's prediction**: Only ~1% of chemicals can cause cancer.
  - *Reality*: Highly dependent on definitions. In quantitative terms, Revere may have been underestimating the complexity—mutagenicity is common, and whether that translates to carcinogenicity depends on dose, exposure route, metabolic capacity, and repair systems.
- **Revere's prediction**: The process should not be abandoned.
  - *Reality*: The process was not abandoned, but it became supplemented. High-dose rodent studies remain regulatory requirements (e.g., ICH S1B for pharmaceuticals) but are now contextualized with mechanistic data.
- **Author's concern**: Cell proliferation at high doses confounds low-dose extrapolation.
  - *Reality*: This has become widely accepted. Mode of action frameworks now formally consider whether effects at high doses are relevant to humans at typical exposures—proliferative effects receive particularly critical scrutiny.
- **Revere's framing**: Eliminating industrial chemical carcinogens need not halt civilization.
  - *Reality*: Risk assessment has become more sophisticated, focusing on dose-response characterization rather than binary classification. The precautionary principle collides with evidence-based prioritization.
- **Author's complexity point**: Cancer really isn't a single disease.
  - *Reality*: This understanding has deepened with genomics. Cancer heterogeneity, driver mutations, tissue-specific pathways, and immune context all shape whether a carcinogen operates similarly across species.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This piece captures a durable, high-stakes debate in regulatory toxicology that has evolved significantly but remains unsettled. The text shows strong foresight in pointing to the complexities that would shape decades of policy and research. The dynamic between cancer epidemiology and mechanistic toxicology continues to this day, and the core issues—appropriate models for human risk assessment, high-dose assumptions—remain live and important. A prescient and unsentimental analysis, avoiding simplifications on either side.
