# Chemical Probes Versus Drugs (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses an important distinction highlighted in a Nature Chemical Biology issue on target selection and validation: chemical probes and drugs are fundamentally different entities. The author explains that while one might assume drugs face a higher standard, chemical probes should actually be held to a higher standard regarding in-cell selectivity between on- and off-target activity. This is because clinical drug responses may actually benefit from off-target activity through polypharmacology, whereas biological responses to chemical probes require clear deconvolution of on-target versus off-target effects.

The article emphasizes that a drug is defined by its effects in living organisms, while a chemical probe is defined by its specificity. The author warns against two dangerous extremes: developing highly selective compounds that consume vast resources but have no clinical utility, and using probe compounds that hit multiple targets, making results unreliable beyond single purified protein systems.

## 2. HISTORY

The distinction between chemical probes and drugs that the author highlighted in 2013 has become increasingly important and institutionalized over the past decade:

**Chemical Probe Quality Initiatives**: Organizations like the SGC (Structural Genomics Consortium) and various pharmaceutical companies established formal chemical probe criteria and databases. These efforts emphasize the need for well-characterized, highly selective tool compounds with comprehensive selectivity profiling against large panels of off-targets (often hundreds of kinases or other targets).

**Impact on Drug Discovery**: The recognition that polypharmacology can be beneficial rather than detrimental has influenced drug design. Several successful drugs owe their efficacy to hitting multiple targets simultaneously. For example, many kinase inhibitors approved since 2013 (such as ibrutinib and other BTK inhibitors) were found to have clinically relevant off-target activities that contribute to their therapeutic profiles.

**Clinical Validation**: Numerous drug programs failed despite having highly selective compounds, reinforcing the article's point that exquisite target selectivity doesn't guarantee clinical success. Conversely, some drugs with broader activity profiles succeeded where highly selective predecessors failed.

**Industry Practice Changes**: Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly incorporate polypharmacology considerations into lead optimization, often designing compounds with intentional multi-target profiles for complex diseases like cancer and neurological disorders.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's core message contains several implicit predictions about the field:

• **Prediction**: That failure to distinguish probes from drugs would lead to continued waste of resources on highly selective but clinically ineffective compounds and unreliable biological data from non-selective probes.

**Outcome**: ✓ **Largely validated**. The field has moved toward better characterization of both probe selectivity and therapeutic polypharmacology. Funders and journals increasingly demand rigorous probe validation.

• **Prediction**: That clinical responses may improve from off-target activity (polypharmacology) rather than suffering from it.

**Outcome**: ✓ **Well validated**. Many approved drugs since 2013 (particularly in oncology, neuroscience, and immunology) demonstrate that multi-target activity contributes to efficacy. Polypharmacology is now a recognized strategy rather than a liability.

• **Prediction**: That chemical probe development should face higher selectivity standards than drug development.

**Outcome**: ✓ **Validated and institutionalized**. Major initiatives like the SGC's chemical probe program and commercial probe suppliers now routinely provide comprehensive selectivity data (including kinome-wide profiling, complete target panels) for probe compounds, setting higher bars than typically required or achievable for drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addressed a fundamental conceptual issue that has become increasingly important in drug discovery over the subsequent decade. The probe-versus-drug distinction has influenced both academic research quality and pharmaceutical industry practices, making it highly relevant and prescient.
