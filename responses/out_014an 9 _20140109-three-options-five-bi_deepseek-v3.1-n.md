# Analysis of "Three Options With Five Billion to Spend" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article presents a strategic dilemma facing pharmaceutical executives regarding R&D investment allocation. Given that developing a single new drug cost approximately $5 billion at the time, the author considers three options: (1) funding internal R&D using established approaches yielding only 5% ROI, (2) acquiring external product candidates at market prices in a competitive environment, or (3) creating a portfolio of 50 independent projects pursuing novel drug discovery approaches, each with a hypothetical 2% chance of doubling ROI indefinitely.

The author's recommendation is a hybrid approach: enough internal R&D to provide "cover" from board scrutiny, sufficient external acquisitions to satisfy market expectations, and remaining funds dedicated to exploratory research—while expressing skepticism about whether 50 truly novel approaches to drug R&D actually exist or have realistic 2% success probabilities.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) proved transformative for pharmaceutical R&D, largely validating the article's underlying concerns while witnessing dramatic shifts in investment patterns:

**Internal R&D continued its productivity crisis**: Industry ROI on traditional drug development continued declining, with some analyses showing returns falling to 1-3% by 2020. The $5 billion per drug figure mentioned in 2014 proved conservative—later studies would peg the cost at $6-7 billion when accounting for failed projects.

**External acquisitions intensified dramatically**: The 2014-2024 period saw unprecedented M&A activity, with companies like AbbVie ($63B for Allergan), Bristol-Myers Squibb ($74B for Celgene), and countless smaller deals. Biotech buyouts became the primary growth strategy for many large pharma companies as internal pipelines struggled.

**The "Option 3" portfolios evolved unexpectedly**: Rather than the hypothetical 50-project portfolios, the industry saw the rise of different innovation models:
- **CAR-T and gene therapy platforms** (2017-2024): These represented truly novel approaches that did double or triple ROI, but required entirely new manufacturing and regulatory frameworks rather than simple R&D diversification
- **AI and machine learning in drug discovery** (2018-present): Companies like DeepMind, Exscientia, and Atomwise emerged, though results have been mixed—promising but not yet transformative
- **Platform biotechnology companies**: Moderna, BioNTech, and CRISPR companies became viable through focused platform investments rather than diversified portfolios

**The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered calculations**: mRNA vaccine development showed that certain "black swan" events could justify massive concentrated bets rather than portfolio approaches, though this required unprecedented regulatory speed and public-private partnerships.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**CORRECT PREDICTIONS:**
- Internal R&D ROI continued declining as forecasted
- External acquisitions remained essential for growth
- The challenge of finding truly novel approaches proved accurate—there weren't 50 different revolutionary methods available
- Companies continued hybrid strategies combining internal work with external acquisitions

**INCORRECT OR INCOMPLETE PREDICTIONS:**
- The article significantly underestimated the pace of technological disruption: CAR-T, gene therapies, and mRNA vaccines achieved success rates much higher than the doubted 2% probability
- The "$5 billion per drug" figure became outdated quickly, as development costs continued rising despite technological advances
- The assumption that board pressure would favor conservative internal R&D became less true over time—external acquisitions increasingly became the primary growth strategy even for risk-averse boards
- The implied assumption that drug development costs were necessarily fixed or rising proved wrong in some cases; platform technologies eventually enabled more efficient development for certain therapeutic classes

**MISSED DEVELOPMENTS:**
- The rise of patient advocacy and social media dramatically changed reimbursement and market dynamics
- Regulatory pathways evolved significantly (FDA breakthrough therapy designations, accelerated approvals) reducing some development risks
- The venture capital and biotech startup ecosystem matured, providing alternative mechanisms for exploring novel approaches outside large pharma constraints

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article merits a high-middle decile score for several reasons:

**Strengths:**
- The strategic framework remains highly relevant, and similar calculations continue driving pharmaceutical investment decisions today
- The author's skepticism about easy technological fixes proved prescient—R&D productivity challenges persist
- The piece captures a genuine industry dilemma that intensified in subsequent years

**Limitations:**
- The article operates at a relatively high level of abstraction, never deeply investigating specific technological possibilities
- The hypothetical nature of "50 projects with 2% success" lacks grounding in what actually constitutes drug discovery innovation
- The analysis predates the most significant biotechnological disruption of the century (COVID-19 vaccines, which changed all the equations)

The article's lasting value lies in its framing of persistent industry challenges rather than its specific predictions. The core tension between incremental internal development, external growth through acquisitions, and bets on transformative innovation continues shaping pharmaceutical strategy—making this more than a historical curiosity but less than a truly prescient analysis of biotechnology's future directions.
