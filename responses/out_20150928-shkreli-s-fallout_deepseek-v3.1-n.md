# Shkreli's Fallout (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary article discusses the immediate industry reaction to Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals acquiring the drug Daraprim and raising its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill in September 2015. The article highlights public condemnations from established pharmaceutical executives: Biogen CEO George Scangos called the move "arrogant," "naïve," and a "perversion of the system," while Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez distinguished "hedge fund managers masquerading as pharmaceutical executives" from the legitimate R&D-based pharmaceutical industry. The author expresses concern that such predatory pricing could damage the industry's reputation during an election season and highlights structural problems in the generic drug regulatory framework, particularly the "closed distribution" system that enables such price hikes, calling for FDA and Congressional intervention to reform generic drug market regulations.

## 2. HISTORY
Martin Shkreli was arrested in December 2015 on securities fraud charges unrelated to Turing's drug pricing, convicted in 2017, and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released in 2022. The Daraprim price hike became a symbol of pharmaceutical industry greed and catalyzed significant public outrage and policy discussions about drug pricing. In the years following 2015, numerous other examples of similar tactics emerged, including price increases on older drugs like the EpiPen and various generic medications. Congress held hearings on drug pricing, and the issue became a major theme in the 2016 presidential election campaigns. Turing Pharmaceuticals eventually faced public pressure and pledged to lower the price, though the actual impact on patient access remained problematic. The case contributed to ongoing debates about pharmaceutical regulation, generic drug market competition, and healthcare reform in the United States.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Industry damage from pricing controversies**: The article predicted that Shkreli-style tactics would damage the pharmaceutical industry's reputation. ✓ This proved accurate - the Daraprim case became a focal point for public anger about drug prices and contributed to sustained negative public perception of pharmaceutical companies.
• **Political consequences during election season**: The author warned that the controversy could cause "real damage to the industry" during an election season. ✓ This materialized as drug pricing became a major issue in the 2016 election and subsequent elections, with multiple legislative proposals targeting pharmaceutical pricing practices.
• **Need for FDA regulatory reform**: The article predicted that the FDA would need to examine closed distribution systems and generic drug regulations. Partially accurate - while the controversy did spur regulatory scrutiny and discussions about reforming generic drug markets, significant comprehensive reform has remained incomplete, with piecemeal changes rather than fundamental restructuring.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment that exposed systemic problems in pharmaceutical pricing and became a touchstone for broader healthcare policy debates, accurately anticipating both political consequences and industry reform needs.
