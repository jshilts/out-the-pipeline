# Roger Boisjoly and the Management Hat (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article commemorates Roger Boisjoly, the Morton Thiokol engineer who attempted to prevent the 1986 Challenger space shuttle launch. Boisjoly and colleagues identified that cold weather degraded the O-ring seals on solid rocket boosters, and they vigorously argued against launching. Initially, Thiokol management supported their engineers' recommendation to delay, but NASA officials on a conference call rejected this advice, famously telling the engineers to "Take off your engineer hat, and put your management hat on."

The article emphasizes the fundamental principle that "reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled" (quoting Richard Feynman's Rogers Commission report). It discusses the responsibility of technical professionals to clearly communicate their data-driven conclusions, referencing debates about whether the engineers' presentation of data was sufficiently clear, while acknowledging that some decision-makers appeared determined to launch regardless. The author distinguishes between "slick" presentations that gloss over concerns and "effective" presentations that clearly communicate risks.

## 2. HISTORY

Roger Boisjoly (1938-2012) died approximately two weeks after this article was published on February 9, 2012. He spent the decades following the Challenger disaster as a prominent advocate for engineering ethics and whistleblower protection, speaking extensively about the Challenger decision-making process and its lessons for technical professionals.

The article was published during a period of renewed attention to engineering ethics and risk communication, coinciding with emerging discussions about organizational culture in technology and engineering sectors. However, the space industry developments subsequent to 2012 show a mixed record regarding the article's core lessons about management vs. technical expertise.

**Space Industry Developments:**

- **Commercial Crew Program (2010s):** NASA shifted toward commercial partnerships with SpaceX and Boeing, evolving away from the traditional NASA-contractor dynamic that characterized the Challenger era.
  
- **SpaceX Operations:** SpaceX developed a notably different safety culture under Elon Musk's engineering-focused leadership, with engineers reportedly having significant input on go/no-go decisions. The company achieved numerous successful launches with iterative safety improvements.

- **Boeing Starliner Issues (2019-2024):** Boeing experienced multiple technical problems with its Starliner spacecraft during test flights, including software issues that some critics attributed to management pressures and inadequate technical review processes, echoing some Challenger-era concerns about schedule pressure overriding safety considerations.

- **NASA Cultural Evolution:** NASA continued implementing lessons from both Challenger and the 2003 Columbia disaster, with improved safety reporting systems and greater emphasis on technical voices in launch decisions.

**Broader Context:**
The period following 2012 saw increased attention to organizational psychology in engineering contexts, with academic research on groupthink, psychological safety, and communication barriers in technical organizations. However, major industrial incidents like the Boeing 737 MAX crashes (2018-2019) demonstrated that similar dynamics of management overruling technical expertise persisted in other industries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article was primarily retrospective and commemorative rather than predictive in nature. The author did not make specific forward-looking predictions about industry developments, technological changes, or policy outcomes. Instead, the article emphasized timeless principles about technical decision-making and organizational culture that remain relevant across decades.

The implicit suggestion that the engineering community should remember Boisjoly's experience and apply those lessons has seen mixed outcomes. While awareness of engineering ethics has grown, subsequent incidents like the Boeing 737 MAX crisis (where engineers' concerns about MCAS system safety were reportedly minimized) suggest that the fundamental dynamic of management pressure overriding technical expertise remains a persistent challenge in complex engineering organizations.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article addresses timeless principles of engineering ethics and organizational decision-making that remain highly relevant, supported by a historically significant case study with continuing real-world applications across engineering disciplines.
