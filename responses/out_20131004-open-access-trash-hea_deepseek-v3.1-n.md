# An Open Access Trash Heap (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes John Bohannon's "sting operation" against open-access journals. Bohannon authored a deliberately flawed scientific paper about a fictional anticancer molecule extracted from lichen, attributing it to a fake researcher (Ocorrafoo Cobange) from a nonexistent institution (Wassee Institute of Medicine). The paper contained obvious fatal flaws that any competent reviewer with basic scientific training should have detected—the experiments lacked proper controls and the data contradicted the claimed dose-dependent effects, with the results being explainable by simple alcohol toxicity rather than any purported drug effect.

Bohannon submitted 304 versions of this fabricated paper to various open-access journals. The outcome was concerning: 157 journals accepted the paper (52% of those making decisions), including journals hosted by major publishers like Elsevier (Drug Invention Today) and Sage (Journal of International Medical Research), as well as journals from prestigious academic institutions like Kobe University. Only 98 journals rejected it outright. Even when reviewers did identify problems with the manuscript, 16 journals still accepted it anyway. The article highlights the emergence of predatory publishing practices, particularly noting concentrations of such journals in India, Nigeria, and other regions, raising serious concerns about quality control in open-access publishing.

## 2. HISTORY

The Bohannon sting operation, published in October 2013, had significant real-world impact on scientific publishing:

**Immediate Impact on Publishing Companies:**
Both Elsevier and Sage responded following the investigation. They investigated the implicated journals and tightened their review processes for accepting new journals into their portfolios. The incident contributed to established publishers becoming more cautious about partnerships with third-party open-access journal operators.

**Predatory Publishing Awareness:**
The sting operation dramatically raised awareness about predatory publishers within the scientific community and among research institutions. Jeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers, referenced in the article, gained prominence and became a widely cited resource, though it also became controversial and was eventually taken down in 2017 due to both legal pressures and debates about its criteria.

**Research Policy Changes:**
Funding agencies and academic institutions began implementing policies to help researchers identify legitimate journals. Some institutions developed training programs for early-career researchers to recognize predatory publishers and make informed publication decisions. However, predatory publishing continued to thrive; estimates by 2015-2017 suggested thousands of predatory journals remained active, generating hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

**The Specific Journal Fates:**
Drug Invention Today, the Elsevier journal mentioned, remained in publication for several more years but faced ongoing scrutiny. Other problematic journals either improved their peer review processes or gradually lost credibility within their respective fields.

**Ongoing Problems:**
Despite increased awareness, predatory publishing persisted as a significant issue throughout the 2010s, with high publication fees (typically $1,500-$3,500 per article) remaining appealing revenue sources for questionable publishers. Research published in subsequent years showed that researchers, particularly from developing countries or those early in their careers, continued to fall victim to these practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions and Their Outcomes:**

• **Prediction:** That awareness of predatory open-access journals would improve publication practices
  - **Outcome:** Partial success. Awareness certainly increased, and major publishers became more careful about quality control. However, predatory journals adapted and persisted, with the problem becoming more nuanced rather than disappearing entirely.

• **Prediction:** That journals like Drug Invention Today and Journal of International Medical Research would face consequences
  - **Outcome:** Mixed. Both journals continued publishing, though the sting operation likely contributed to increased scrutiny of their editorial standards and may have affected their impact within their respective research communities.

• **Prediction:** That this investigation would significantly reduce predatory publishing business models
  - **Outcome:** Failed. Predatory publishing remained profitable and widespread throughout the decade following the sting. New predatory publishers emerged to replace those exposed, and the business model proved resilient due to the strong incentive structure (publication requirements for career advancement combined with authors willing to pay fees).

• **Prediction:** That such poor-quality "scientific research" would lead to regulatory or systematic reform
  - **Outcome:** Limited success. While individual institutions and funding agencies developed guidelines, no comprehensive regulatory framework emerged to address predatory publishing. The scientific community relied primarily on education and awareness rather than formal regulation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article exposed significant systemic problems in scientific publishing that had real consequences for research quality and academic careers. The investigation was methodologically rigorous and revealed issues that persisted long after its publication, making it both an important piece of science journalism and a cautionary tale about the challenges of maintaining quality control in scientific communication.
