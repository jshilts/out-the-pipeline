# Faking Two Papers A Month. For Seven Years. (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the unfolding research fraud scandal involving Dutch social psychologist Diederik Stapel, who was found to have fabricated data for at least 150 papers over seven years. Stapel's method involved inventing experimental data rather than conducting actual research, leading to situations where his students graduated without ever running experiments. The article notes that Stapel maintained tight control over his fabricated data, threatening colleagues who asked to see raw data, while his peers often blamed themselves when unable to replicate his results. The author draws parallels to the Jan-Hendrik Schön scandal in physics and emphasizes fundamental scientific principles: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, irreproducible results warrant suspicion, and refusal to share raw data should trigger immediate alarm.

## 2. HISTORY
The Stapel case became one of the most extensive documented cases of scientific fraud in psychology. Following the initial revelations in 2011, investigations ultimately identified **at least 58 fraudulent publications** by Stapel between 2004-2011, leading to his dismissal from Tilburg University. The Dutch investigative commission's 2012 report documented systematic fabrication across multiple institutions where Stapel had worked (University of Amsterdam, University of Groningen, and Tilburg University).

**Concrete impacts and outcomes:**
- By 2013, **55 papers were formally retracted**, with additional retractions continuing in subsequent years as investigations continued
- Stapel's PhD was revoked by the University of Amsterdam in 2013, an extremely rare disciplinary action
- Criminal investigations were opened, though Stapel ultimately faced no prison time
- The scandal triggered widespread reforms in Dutch academic institutions regarding data management and research integrity protocols
- Multiple graduate students and collaborators saw their careers damaged; some had to restart research programs or abandon academic careers entirely
- The case contributed to psychology's broader "replication crisis" discussions, influencing methodological reforms and greater skepticism toward single-author "too good to be true" results
- Institutions implemented stricter data sharing requirements and oversight mechanisms for principal investigators

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made general observations about research integrity rather than specific predictions. The implicit expectation that such scandals would lead to institutional reforms did materialize, though the broader concern about continued fraud in science remains relevant. No explicit predictions were made about Stapel's specific case outcomes or the scale of retractions that would ultimately occur.

## 4. INTEREST
**8/9**

This case represents one of the most systematic and extensive documented cases of scientific fraud, with lasting impacts on research integrity policies and psychology's methodological standards.
