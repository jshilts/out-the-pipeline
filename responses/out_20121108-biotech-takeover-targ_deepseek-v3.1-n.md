# Biotech Takeover Targets (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief article from Science Magazine's blog post highlighted a FierceBiotech special report listing the most frequently cited takeover targets in the biotech sector. The key criterion identified by John Carroll was that these companies either had late-stage blockbuster drug candidates or newly marketed products, with valuations ranging from $1 billion to $6 billion. The article specifically mentioned Onyx Pharmaceuticals as the number one target on the list, encouraging readers to review the full compilation of companies deemed ripe for acquisition.

## 2. HISTORY
The timing of this article proved prescient, as the biotech sector experienced significant M&A activity in the years following 2012:

**• Onyx Pharmaceuticals**: The article's top target was indeed acquired. In August 2013—just nine months after this article—Amgen acquired Onyx for approximately $10.4 billion, well above the $1-6 billion range mentioned. Onyx had several important assets including Kyprolis (carfilzomib) for multiple myeloma and Nexavar (sorafenib) for cancer treatment.

**• Broader M&A Trends**: The 2013-2015 period saw extensive consolidation in biotech and pharma, driven by companies seeking to replenish pipelines as patents expired on blockbuster drugs. Many mid-cap biotech companies with promising late-stage candidates or newly approved therapies became acquisition targets.

**• Market Evolution**: The $1-6 billion valuation range proved somewhat conservative, as several major deals exceeded this (like Onyx's $10.4B acquisition). The period validated the basic premise that companies with late-stage blockbusters or newly launched products were prime takeover candidates, though actual valuations often exceeded initial expectations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article did not contain explicit predictions about future events—it was reporting on an existing analysis rather than making forward-looking statements. It essentially served as market commentary on current M&A speculation rather than a predictive piece.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

This article ranks in the bottom 30-40% of interest because it primarily served as timely market commentary rather than containing enduring scientific or analytical insights. While it captured M&A dynamics accurately for its time, its relevance was largely confined to the specific market conditions of late 2012.
