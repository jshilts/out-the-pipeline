# Pfizer Tears It All Down (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Pfizer's decision to demolish their former 750,000-square-foot research headquarters (Building 118) in Groton, Connecticut, rather than sell the complex to developers. Local officials and developers expressed frustration, with developer Stu Lichter claiming that Pfizer had negotiated in bad faith by repeatedly introducing new obstacles to stall the sale process. Despite a viable purchase offer and the fact that demolition would cost more than selling the property even at a nominal price, Pfizer proceeded with tearing down the building. The article characterizes this as consistent with Pfizer's corporate behavior, with the tagline "wrecking balls are what Pfizer does."

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, this specific real estate decision became part of a broader pattern of pharmaceutical industry consolidation and research site restructuring:

**Pfizer's Groton/New London Operations:** The demolition proceeded as announced. This was part of a larger strategic shift—in 2011, Pfizer had already announced plans to close their nearby New London research headquarters, consolidating operations into their Groton campus. The Eastern Point Road facility was one of several closures.

**Manufacturing and R&D Restructuring:** Throughout 2011-2015, Pfizer significantly restructured their global footprint. The Groton campus remained operational as Pfizer's largest R&D site in the US, but employment there declined substantially from historical highs.

**Industry-wide Pattern:** This real estate decision reflected broader trends. Major pharmaceutical companies consolidated research facilities in the 2010s due to patent cliffs, generic competition, and pipeline optimization strategies. Merck, AstraZeneca, and other major companies made similar moves to close or demolish facilities.

**Regulatory and Policy Context:** The period after 2013 saw no major policy changes specifically addressing pharmaceutical site demolitions. Such corporate real estate decisions remained largely within companies' discretion, though local development authorities increasingly emphasized master planning rather than individual site preservation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in the Article:**

• **Forecast:** The header "Guys, wrecking balls are what Pfizer does" implies that such aggressive facility closures and demolitions will continue as part of the company's operating model.
• **Outcome:** This proved accurate descriptively—Pfizer continued consolidating and closing facilities. This occurred within an industry-wide context where restructuring and site closures became standard during 2013-2020.

• **Forecast:** The article suggests Pfizer may avoid genuine negotiations on property deals if they prefer demolition.
• **Outcome:** For this specific property, demolition proceeded. However, pharmaceutical companies more broadly adapted to maximize real estate values, often through more sophisticated sale-leaseback, facility reuse, or multi-phase exit strategies in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This article documents a particular corporate real estate decision with primarily local Connecticut relevance and lacks broader scientific or patient-care implications that would sustain long-term interest in biotechnology development.
