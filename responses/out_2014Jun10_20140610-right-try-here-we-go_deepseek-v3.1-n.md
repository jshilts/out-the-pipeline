# Right To Try: A Retrospective Analysis

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine article "Right To Try: Here We Go" examined the emergence of state-level "Right to Try" legislation, beginning with Colorado's law allowing terminally ill patients to access experimental drugs after Phase I trials and ongoing Phase II investigation. The author, Derek Lowe, expressed skepticism about these laws, arguing they largely duplicated existing FDA compassionate use pathways while creating dangerous loopholes. 

The article highlighted several concerns: the laws could enable unscrupulous operators to conduct minimal Phase I trials then charge desperate patients during prolonged, slowly progressing Phase II studies; they create false hope since most drug failures occur post-Phase I; and they're premised on a flawed assumption that bureaucracy rather than scientific difficulty prevents cures. The piece noted that Neuralstem Inc. planned to be the first company to utilize Colorado's law for their experimental ALS stem cell therapy, providing an early test case.

## 2. HISTORY

The Right to Try movement gained significant momentum after 2014. By 2018, 41 states had passed similar legislation, culminating in the federal **Right to Try Act of 2018** signed by President Trump, which applied nationwide. However, the actual utilization and impact proved far more limited than advocates suggested.

**Neuralstem's outcome**: The company mentioned as the first test case faced mixed results. Their stem cell therapy NSI-566 showed some promise but ultimately did not deliver breakthrough results. The company struggled financially and underwent restructuring. More importantly, the FDA's existing compassionate use (expanded access) program proved more robust and safer than the parallel state-level pathways.

**Real-world impact**: Despite the legislative victory, Right to Try usage has been remarkably low. Vox's 2020 investigation found that only about 150 patients had used the federal law in its first year, compared to thousands who accessed drugs through FDA's expanded access programs. Critics note that drug companies remain reluctant to provide experimental drugs outside clinical trials due to liability concerns, supply constraints, and fear that adverse events could derail approval prospects.

The core problem remains: while the laws remove state-level barriers, they cannot compel pharmaceutical companies to provide unapproved drugs, nor can they override FDA regulatory authority or address insurance coverage issues. Most major pharmaceutical companies prefer working through the FDA's expanded access framework, which offers better legal protections and clearer guidelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the article got right:**
- **False hope creation**: The prediction that these laws would primarily create false hope proved accurate. Patients gained theoretical access but faced practical barriers from unwilling companies.
- **Minimal added value**: The author correctly identified that Right to Try largely duplicated existing compassionate use pathways rather than creating genuinely new access opportunities.
- **Predatory potential**: Concerns about unscrupulous operators proved prescient, though the federal law included some safeguards. The broader issue of companies exploiting desperate patients continued through other channels (e.g., stem cell clinics, offshore treatments).
- **Regulatory redundancy**: The prediction that FDA oversight serves important purposes was validated—most drug failures and safety issues do occur post-Phase I, and removing regulatory oversight doesn't solve the fundamental scientific challenges.

**What the article got wrong:**
- **Scale of implementation**: The author didn't anticipate how rapidly Right to Try would spread to federal legislation, though this didn't change the fundamental limitations.
- **Harm assessment**: The prediction that the laws wouldn't "do much harm" underestimated the potential damage. While direct harm from the laws themselves was limited, they contributed to broader anti-regulatory sentiment and the dangerous narrative that FDA oversight represents unnecessary bureaucracy rather than evidence-based patient protection.
- **Industry uptake**: The author likely overestimated how eagerly companies would embrace these opportunities, not fully anticipating their legitimate concerns about liability, trial integrity, and regulatory relationships.

## 4. INTEREST SCORE: 5

This article earns a **decile score of 5** (50th-59th percentile). While it addresses important issues in pharmaceutical regulation and patient access, its long-term significance is moderate rather than transformative.

**Factors supporting this score:**
- The article tackled a timely policy debate with real implications for terminally ill patients
- It demonstrated skepticism toward easy solutions to complex regulatory problems
- The piece correctly anticipated many implementation challenges and practical limitations

**Factors limiting higher interest:**
- The fundamental issue proved less consequential than initially appeared—Right to Try laws ultimately changed little in practice despite considerable political attention
- The article represented one voice in a broader, ongoing debate rather than introducing fundamentally new insights
- While thoughtful, it didn't reveal unexpected connections or challenge fundamental assumptions about drug development

The moderate interest score reflects that while the article was well-reasoned and accurate in its skeptical assessment, the underlying phenomenon it examined turned out to have less real-world impact than the political rhetoric suggested, making it more of an interesting case study in policy-making than a pivotal moment in biotechnology history.
