# Thanksgiving Break 2020 (November 25, 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a personal Thanksgiving holiday post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog (likely from Science Magazine's blog network) rather than a biotech industry commentary. The author describes his Thanksgiving cooking plans, sharing details about traditional family recipes including chocolate pecan pie, pumpkin pie, turkey with unique stuffing (featuring his mother-in-law's recipe with bread cubes, cranberries, green apples, celery, onion, and pepperoni sausage), various side dishes, and Persian-inspired javaher pullo rice dish. The post ends with holiday wishes to readers and a brief mention that "recent vaccine news should bring some cheer" and that "the end of all this is in sight," referencing the COVID-19 pandemic context of late 2020.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be one of Derek Lowe's annual Thanksgiving posts rather than substantive biotech analysis or commentary. These personal posts are a recurring feature in his blog. The timing is notable as it falls during the pivotal period when COVID-19 vaccines were receiving emergency authorization - Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine received UK authorization on December 2, 2020, and FDA EUA on December 11, 2020, while Moderna's vaccine received FDA EUA on December 18, 2020. These approvals did indeed mark the beginning of widespread vaccination campaigns, though vaccine rollout faced various logistical challenges, hesitancy, and the emergence of new variants requiring updated formulations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The recent vaccine news should bring some cheer, though - the end of all this is in sight!"** This optimistic statement about the COVID-19 pandemic ending proved premature. While mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) did receive emergency authorization within weeks of this post and showed remarkable efficacy (~95%) in preventing severe disease, the pandemic continued for years beyond 2020, with new variants (Alpha, Delta, Omicron) emerging and requiring updated vaccine formulations. Vaccines did dramatically reduce mortality and severe illness, but SARS-CoV-2 became endemic rather than eliminated.

• The implicit expectation that vaccine approval would quickly end the pandemic underestimated the duration and complexity of achieving population-level immunity and the virus's capacity for evolution and immune evasion.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This is a personal holiday blog post about family recipes and Thanksgiving plans rather than a substantive commentary about the biotechnology industry. It does not contain meaningful biotech analysis, predictions, or information relevant to evaluating industry developments.
