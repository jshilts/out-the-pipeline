# The Sunk Cost Fallacy (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the sunk cost fallacy as it applies to drug discovery research. A sunk cost is an unrecoverable expenditure of time, effort, and money. The author explains how research teams often continue projects for years with no viable clinical candidates because they've invested substantial resources and hope something will eventually justify the effort. The recommended approach is to ignore past investments when making decisions and instead evaluate a project based only on its current merit and future potential. The challenge is distinguishing between perseverance (necessary for drug discovery success) and continued pursuit of unproductive research that has no clear hypothesis or trajectory. The author acknowledges this requires somewhat "inhuman" detachment from human psychological tendencies.

## 2. HISTORY

The sunk cost fallacy concept described in this article has remained highly relevant in pharmaceutical R&D over the past 9+ years. This period has seen increasing focus on portfolio optimization and evidence-based project termination. Industry data consistently shows that approximately 90% of drugs that enter clinical trials fail, with many failing due to lack of efficacy - essentially validating the article's concern about continuing unpromising research. However, implementing systematic project termination remains challenging due to organizational culture, career incentives, and the genuine difficulty of predicting which projects will succeed.

The biopharmaceutical industry has developed more sophisticated portfolio management approaches, but the core tension persists. Studies examining R&D productivity continue to identify similar patterns of projects continuing despite poor prospects. Many companies have attempted to institutionalize mechanisms for program termination, though the human psychological factors described remain a significant barrier.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

I did not find explicit predictions about the future in this article. The piece is primarily analytical and descriptive of ongoing challenges rather than forecasting specific outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses a core, persistent challenge in pharmaceutical R&D that remains highly relevant today. The sunk cost fallacy is genuine and continues to impact research decisions, though the article offers more thoughtful analysis than pragmatic solutions.
