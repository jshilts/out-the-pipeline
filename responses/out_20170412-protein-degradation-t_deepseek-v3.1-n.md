# Protein Degradation Time (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the emerging technique of targeted protein degradation using PROTACs (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras), which are hybrid molecules that bridge a target protein to ubiquitin ligase machinery, leading to the protein's destruction via the proteasome. The method had been pioneered by the Bradner lab (Harvard/Dana-Farber) and Crews lab (Yale), creating bifunctional molecules with one end binding the target protein and the other end recruiting ubiquitination complexes.

A new 2017 paper demonstrated this approach against Sirt2 (a sirtuin protein implicated in various cellular pathways) using SirReal2-derived ligands linked to thalidomide-based ubiquitin ligase recruiters via click chemistry triazole linkages. The resulting molecule showed ~250 nanomolar activity and dose-dependent Sirt2 depletion in cells, with stronger downstream effects than simple pharmacological inhibition. The technique represented a novel way to completely remove proteins rather than just inhibit them, combining benefits of small molecules (temporal control, cell permeability) with the completeness of genetic knockout approaches.

The article also noted practical challenges: the need for good small-molecule ligands (difficult for targets like p53 or cMyc), cell permeability issues, and unpredictable variability in ubiquitination/degradation efficiency.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2017 article, targeted protein degradation evolved from a promising research tool into a major therapeutic modality with significant clinical and commercial traction:

**Clinical Success and FDA Approvals:**
- In 2019, ARV-110 became the first PROTAC to enter clinical trials (Phase I for prostate cancer, targeting the androgen receptor)
- ARV-471 (targeting the estrogen receptor for breast cancer) also advanced to clinical trials
- While no PROTAC had received full FDA approval as of 2024, multiple candidates reached Phase II trials, representing the first wave of protein degrader drugs in clinical development

**Commercial Development:**
- Arvinas (founded by Craig Crews, mentioned in the article) became the field's pioneer, going public in 2018 and advancing multiple programs to clinical trials
- Nurix Therapeutics went public in 2020 and advanced several degrader programs
- Kymera Therapeutics (focused on IRAK4 and other targets) also reached public markets and clinical trials
- Major pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche) established protein degradation partnerships and internal programs
- Investment in the space reached billions of dollars across multiple companies

**Scientific and Technical Evolution:**
- The field expanded beyond PROTACs to include molecular glues, LYTACs (lysosome-targeting chimeras), and other degradation modalities
- New E3 ligase recruiters beyond thalidomide (CRBN ligands) were developed, including VHL-based and IAP-based systems
- degron-targeting approaches expanded the pool of "undruggable" targets that could be addressed
- Intracellular delivery challenges remained significant, particularly for central nervous system targets

**Target Validation and Pipeline:**
- The approach proved valuable for previously intractable targets, including transcription factors and scaffolding proteins
- Many programs focused on oncology (androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, BRD4, KRAS) but expanded to immunology, neurodegeneration, and other therapeutic areas
- Academic literature grew exponentially, confirming the article's prediction about overwhelming publication volume

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The azido-thalidomide derivative in this paper will be a catalog item pretty soon"** - **ACCURATE**: Thalidomide-based PROTAC linkers and building blocks became commercially available from major suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich/Merck, TCI, Enamine) within a few years, enabling broader academic and industrial adoption of the technology.

• **"Soon there will be another field of the literature comparing and contrasting all three or four methods on individual proteins"** - **ACCURATE**: Extensive comparative studies emerged examining pharmacological inhibition vs. siRNA vs. CRISPR vs. PROTAC-mediated degradation for various targets, revealing context-dependent differences in phenotypic outcomes and informing target validation strategies.

• **"Watch as the number of papers in this area swells beyond the ability of any of us to read them all!"** - **ACCURATE**: Publication rates grew exponentially from dozens annually in 2017 to hundreds, then thousands annually by the early 2020s, with dedicated journals and conference tracks emerging.

• **Implicit prediction about solving delivery challenges** - **MIXED**: While cell permeability remained problematic (particularly for CNS targets), formulation strategies, new linker chemistries, and intracellular targeting approaches partially addressed these issues, but delivery continued to limit some applications.

• **Implicit prediction about expanding the "undruggable" target space** - **ACCURATE**: PROTACs successfully addressed challenging targets including transcription factors, scaffolding proteins, and mutant KRAS variants, though success rates varied and depended heavily on the availability of suitable ligands and ligase engagement.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured the PROTAC field at an inflection point, just before its maturation into a major therapeutic modality with multiple clinical programs. It correctly identified key challenges (delivery, ligand discovery, mechanistic unpredictability) while accurately predicting the technology's expansion.
