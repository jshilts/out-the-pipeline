# Making the Non-Flat, Non-Aromatic Compounds (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the "flatness problem" in drug discovery compound libraries, observing that pharmaceutical screening collections were becoming dominated by flat, aromatic ring systems linked by amide bonds and metal-catalyzed couplings. The author notes that several companies were openly concerned about this trend and explores ways to introduce more three-dimensional, saturated ring systems into drug discovery libraries.

The piece specifically advocates for reactions that create 3D character, such as the Diels-Alder reaction, and suggests methods to annulate saturated heterocycles like pyrrolidines or tetrahydropyrans. The author proposes using D-glucal as a chiral starting material for library synthesis to generate complex, stereochemically rich tetrahydropyran derivatives, arguing that the potential for carbohydrate-based library synthesis was underappreciated at the time.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns articulated in 2013 proved prescient and catalyzed significant changes in medicinal chemistry practices over the subsequent decade.

**Industry Response and Strategy Shift**: Pharmaceutical companies actively re-engineered their screening libraries and synthesis strategies. Companies like GSK, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca published analyses showing they had systematically reduced aromatic ring counts in their collections and increased sp³ character (measured by fraction of sp³ carbons, Fsp³). Library design moved toward more saturated heterocycles and natural product-like scaffolds.

**Synthetic Method Development**: The challenge of making complex 3D structures drove substantial innovation in synthetic chemistry. New methods emerged for constructing saturated ring systems efficiently, including improved C-H functionalization techniques, photoredox catalysis for generating quaternary centers, and novel cyclization reactions. However, the fundamental difficulties of synthesizing complex 3D structures in parallel library format persisted - these compounds remained more expensive and difficult to make than their flat counterparts.

**Clinical Impact**: By the mid-to-late 2010s, analysis of clinical success rates began correlating molecular complexity with higher success rates in Phase II trials, supporting the article's central premise. More three-dimensional molecules showed better selectivity profiles and fewer off-target effects, though this came with increased synthetic complexity and cost.

**The "Escape from Flatland" Movement**: The article contributed to a broader industry conversation that became known as "escaping from flatland." This movement influenced fragment-based drug discovery, where 3D fragments showed better binding efficiency, and structure-based drug design, where modeling programs improved their treatment of conformational flexibility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: D-glucal and carbohydrate-based starting materials would prove valuable for library synthesis**
**Outcome**: Mixed. While carbohydrate chemistry found some applications in specific drug discovery programs (particularly for glycosidase inhibitors and some enzyme targets), it did not become a mainstream library synthesis approach. The complexity and synthetic challenges proved too high for broad adoption in parallel synthesis, though chiral pool strategies remain important for specific applications.

**• Prediction: Diels-Alder reactions and ring-annulation strategies would gain prominence**
**Outcome**: Partially realized. Diels-Alder reactions saw some increased use, but the larger trend was adoption of diverse ring-forming reactions including cycloadditions, C-H activation, and photochemical cyclizations. The emphasis on 3D complexity was correct, but the specific synthetic routes evolved beyond the examples given.

**• Prediction: Companies would systematically move away from flat aromatic structures toward saturated heterocycles**
**Outcome**: Well-realized, though with caveats. Most major pharmaceutical companies did restructure their libraries toward higher sp³ content, but flat aromatics still dominated certain target classes (especially kinases and GPCRs where aromatic stacking remained important). The shift was more nuanced than complete abandonment of flat structures.

**• Prediction: The synthetic chemistry community would develop better methods for complex saturated ring synthesis**
**Outcome**: Strongly realized. The subsequent decade saw significant innovation in synthetic methods for making complex saturated rings, including asymmetric catalysis, C-H functionalization, and photoredox chemistry, though many methods remained challenging for automated parallel synthesis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article identified a genuine and important trend in medicinal chemistry that influenced significant changes across the pharmaceutical industry, though as a commentary piece it was more influential in articulating existing concerns than driving breakthrough science on its own.
