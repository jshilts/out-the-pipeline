# Brazil's Own Right-To-Try Issues (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the controversy in Brazil surrounding phosphoethanolamine, an unproven cancer treatment being distributed by chemists at the University of São Paulo. When the university administration moved to shut down this unofficial distribution in September 2015, patients took the matter to court. In October 2015, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court ruled in favor of a plaintiff seeking the right to try the compound, leading to lower courts granting similar orders. The university reportedly faced over 800 requests, overwhelming their capacity.

The article highlights ethical concerns raised by bioethicist Volnei Garrafa, who noted that the court decisions ignored medical specialist opinions and overlooked the fact that the drug had only been tested on animals. The author expresses understanding for patients' desires to access potential treatments but questions whether most cancer patients have sufficient clinical oncology knowledge to make informed decisions about unproven therapies.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2015 court rulings, phosphoethanolamine continued to generate controversy in Brazil. The Brazilian government responded by passing legislation in 2016 that authorized the use of synthetic phosphoethanolamine for cancer patients, despite the lack of clinical evidence. This move was largely seen as a political response to public pressure rather than a scientifically-based decision.

However, subsequent scientific research failed to support phosphoethanolamine's efficacy. Studies published in the following years showed no significant anticancer activity in cell cultures or animal models. Brazilian regulatory agencies consistently raised concerns about quality control and safety issues with the compound.

The Right to Try movement gained momentum internationally during this period, with the United States passing federal Right to Try legislation in 2018. However, this movement has remained controversial within the medical and bioethics communities, with ongoing debates about patient autonomy versus evidence-based medicine and regulatory oversight.

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

This article addresses a specific legal-pharmaceutical controversy that occurred in Brazil, involving a single unproven compound. While it touches on broader issues of patient rights and drug regulation, the phosphoethanolamine case represents a localized incident that did not fundamentally alter global approaches to drug approval or right-to-try policies. The broader Right to Try debate has continued, but this particular Brazilian case had limited international impact.
