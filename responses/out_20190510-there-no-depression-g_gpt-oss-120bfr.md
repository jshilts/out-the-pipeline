# There Is No (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post argues that the long‑standing belief that a single polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5‑HTTLPR) – and, by extension, other “depression genes” – meaningfully predicts risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) or response to antidepressants is untenable.  Citing a 2019 meta‑analysis of >400 000 participants, the author notes that neither main‑effect nor gene‑by‑environment interactions survive correction for multiple testing.  The piece stresses that early studies suffered from tiny sample sizes, producing false‑positive “unicorn” stories that later larger studies have demolished.  It also critiques commercial pharmacogenomic panels (e.g., GeneSight) that still market tests based on these discredited variants, warning that their predictive claims lack independent validation.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Large‑scale genetics after 2019**  
* **GWAS breakthroughs** – Subsequent genome‑wide association studies (GWAS) have dramatically increased the number of loci linked to depression.  A 2021 meta‑analysis of >1 million individuals identified ~269 independent SNPs, confirming that risk is highly polygenic and that any single variant (including 5‑HTTLPR) has a negligible effect size (odds ratios ≈1.02).  
* **Polygenic risk scores (PRS)** – PRS derived from these GWAS now explain ~2–3 % of variance in liability, enough to stratify risk in research cohorts but still insufficient for clinical decision‑making.  No PRS has been adopted in routine psychiatric practice.  

**Pharmacogenomics**  
* **Metabolism genes** – The only genetic markers with modest, reproducible impact on antidepressant pharmacokinetics are CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.  CPIC and DPWG guidelines (updated 2020‑2023) provide dose‑adjustment recommendations for several antidepressants based on these enzymes.  
* **Response prediction panels** – Commercial tests that include 5‑HTTLPR, HTR2A, or other “candidate” variants continue to be marketed, but prospective trials (e.g., the 2022 GUIDED study of GeneSight) showed at best a small, non‑significant improvement in remission rates compared with treatment‑as‑usual.  Systematic reviews (2023, 2024) conclude that evidence for clinical utility remains “low to moderate” and that cost‑effectiveness is unproven.  

**Regulatory and policy landscape**  
* The FDA has cleared a few pharmacogenomic panels for “informing” antidepressant selection, but the clearance is based on analytical validity, not on demonstrated clinical benefit.  The agency’s 2022 safety communication reminded clinicians that such tests are “not a substitute for clinical judgment.”  
* Professional societies (APA, NICE) have issued cautious statements (2021‑2024) recommending that pharmacogenomic testing be considered only after multiple treatment failures and that results be interpreted in the context of metabolism genes, not candidate‑gene “depression” markers.  

**Scientific culture**  
* The 2019 critique contributed to a broader shift away from candidate‑gene studies toward large, preregistered GWAS and biobank analyses.  Replication failures of 5‑HTTLPR‑by‑stress interactions are now routinely cited in textbooks and meta‑research discussions about the “winner’s curse” in psychiatric genetics.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *No single gene (including 5‑HTTLPR) will show a robust association with depression.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  The largest GWAS to date still finds no genome‑wide significant signal at the serotonin transporter locus; risk is distributed across hundreds of loci.  

- **Prediction:** *Pharmacogenomic tests that rely on these candidate genes will lack clinical utility.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely true.  Prospective trials and meta‑analyses have shown minimal benefit over standard care; only metabolism‑related variants (CYP2D6/CYP2C19) have modest, guideline‑supported relevance.  

- **Prediction:** *Future research will need tens of thousands of participants to detect the biggest effect sizes.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  Contemporary GWAS routinely exceed 500 000 participants, and power calculations indicate that detecting odds ratios <1.05 indeed requires sample sizes in the hundreds of thousands.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *The field will move away from “single‑gene” narratives toward polygenic and pathway‑level models.*  
  **Outcome:** Realized.  Current research emphasizes PRS, transcriptomic integration, and functional genomics rather than isolated candidate genes.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a clear, timely critique that anticipated the decisive shift in psychiatric genetics toward massive GWAS and away from candidate‑gene hype; its relevance persists as clinicians and regulators grapple with the limited utility of commercial genetic tests.
