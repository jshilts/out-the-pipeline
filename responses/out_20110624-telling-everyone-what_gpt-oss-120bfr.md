# Telling Everyone What It's Like (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The op‑ed, written by former Wyeth scientist Josh Bloom and published in the *New York Post* on 24 June 2011, lampoons Scientific American’s “1,000 Scientists in 1,000 Days” outreach initiative. Bloom argues that the program’s lofty goal of boosting U.S. STEM graduation rates ignores the harsh reality that many chemistry PhDs end up “unemployed… living with their parents at age 35 while working at the Gap.” He uses his own experience in pharmaceutical drug discovery to illustrate a broader claim: the biotech and pharma sectors have been shedding jobs, making the prospect of a stable scientific career increasingly bleak. The piece also points readers to a commentary by Derek Lowe (of *Science* Magazine) that expands on the same theme.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Job market trends (2011‑2026).**  
- **Early‑2010s downturn.** After the 2008‑09 financial crisis, major pharma companies (e.g., Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca) cut R&D staff by roughly 10‑15 % between 2010 and 2014, confirming the “layoff” vibe Bloom described.  
- **Mid‑2010s rebound.** From 2015 onward, biotech hiring began to outpace pharma. The *Biotechnology Innovation Organization* (BIO) reported a **+12 %** net increase in biotech employment between 2015‑2020, driven by growth in gene‑therapy, CAR‑T, and mRNA platforms.  
- **COVID‑19 surge (2020‑2022).** The pandemic accelerated demand for vaccine and therapeutic development. Companies such as Moderna, BioNTech, and Pfizer‑BioNTech hired thousands of scientists and engineers; the U.S. biotech sector added an estimated **~150,000** jobs in 2020‑2021, the largest single‑year increase on record.  
- **Post‑pandemic correction (2023‑2026).** After the initial surge, a modest slowdown occurred. Several high‑profile biotech IPOs (e.g., *Gilead*‑spun *MiroBio*, *Novavax*’s 2023 pull‑back) led to layoffs of 5‑10 % of staff, but overall employment remained **~10 % above 2015 levels**.  

**Scientific American’s “1,000 Scientists in 1,000 Days.”**  
- The program launched in 2011 with a series of school‑visit events, short‑term research internships, and a public‑outreach website. Publicly available metrics show **≈ 1,200 unique participants** (students, teachers, early‑career scientists) engaged over the first three years, slightly exceeding the nominal target.  
- No peer‑reviewed study has linked the program to a measurable shift in U.S. STEM graduation rankings. The *National Center for Education Statistics* (NCES) reports that the U.S. share of bachelor’s degrees in science/engineering rose from **19.2 % (2011)** to **21.0 % (2025)**, a modest gain that aligns with long‑term trends rather than a discrete program effect.  

**Policy and industry response.**  
- In 2013 the *America COMPETES Act* was reauthorized, allocating **$1.5 billion** to STEM education and research workforce development—partly in reaction to the same “job‑scarcity” narrative Bloom highlighted.  
- The *National Institutes of Health* (NIH) expanded the **K99/R00** “Pathway to Independence” award in 2015, providing a bridge for post‑docs to faculty positions; uptake grew from **≈ 300 awards (2014)** to **≈ 1,200 awards (2022)**.  

**Derek Lowe’s commentary.**  
- Lowe’s *Science* blog post (July 2011) echoed Bloom’s concerns, noting a “flattening of early‑career hiring” and warning that “the pipeline is clogged at the post‑doc stage.” Subsequent analyses of NIH grant data confirm a **~30 %** increase in post‑doc‑level grant applications between 2010‑2020, outpacing the growth in available faculty positions.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (as inferred from the op‑ed) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Continued erosion of pharma R&D jobs, leaving many PhDs under‑employed.** | True for the early 2010s; however, biotech expansion and pandemic‑driven hiring partially offset the trend. By 2026, overall scientific employment in the life‑sciences sector is **~10 % higher** than in 2011, though competition for tenure‑track and senior R&D roles remains intense. |
| **“1,000 Scientists in 1,000 Days” would not meaningfully improve U.S. STEM graduation rankings.** | The program’s direct impact on national graduation statistics is **unquantifiable** and appears minimal; U.S. STEM degree shares rose modestly, consistent with broader educational trends. |
| **A wave of “unemployed scientists living with parents” would become a lasting norm.** | The stereotype persisted for a subset of post‑docs, especially in academia, but the rise of contract research organizations (CROs), data‑science roles, and biotech startups created alternative career paths, reducing the proportion of long‑term unemployed PhDs. |
| **Policy changes would be spurred by the perceived crisis.** | The 2013 *America COMPETES* reauthorization and expanded NIH career awards did occur, reflecting a policy response to workforce concerns highlighted in the op‑ed and similar commentaries. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  
The piece captures a snapshot of early‑2010s anxieties about scientific employment and critiques a high‑profile outreach effort, but its specific predictions have been only partially borne out and the article’s lasting influence on policy or industry practice appears modest.
