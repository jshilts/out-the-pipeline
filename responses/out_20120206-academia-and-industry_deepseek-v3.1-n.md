# Academia and Industry, Suing Each Other (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a major intellectual property lawsuit between Agios Pharmaceuticals and the Abramson Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, involving allegations of IP theft exceeding $1 billion. The central conflict revolved around Dr. Craig Thompson, who founded Agios while working at Abramson, allegedly concealing his commercial activities and transferring cancer metabolism research from the academic institute to the company without proper disclosure or licensing.

The article highlights competing narratives: Abramson claimed Dr. Thompson secretly created Agios and obtained $261 million in funding for research that originated at the institute, while Dr. Thompson's defense suggested Penn was aware of his involvement with Agios and had even discussed licensing arrangements. Key legal questions centered on whether Dr. Thompson transferred patented technology versus simply sharing insights and knowledge, and whether Penn truly discovered his involvement only in 2011 despite Agios being mentioned in their public materials years earlier. The author speculated the case would likely settle before trial, with discovery of emails and documentation determining the outcome.

## 2. HISTORY

**Settlement and Resolution:**
The lawsuit was settled in June 2012, just four months after this article was published. The New York Times reported that Agios and the University of Pennsylvania reached an undisclosed settlement agreement, with both parties issuing a joint statement that they were "pleased to have reached an amicable resolution." This remarkably quick settlement aligned with the article's prediction that the case would likely be resolved before trial.

**Agios's Subsequent Commercial Success:**
Following the settlement, Agios went on to achieve significant commercial success. The company completed a successful IPO in July 2013, raising approximately $106 million. This validated the value proposition of their cancer metabolism research platform, which had been at the center of the dispute.

**Drug Development and FDA Approvals:**
Agios developed multiple FDA-approved therapies. **Tibsovo (ivosidenib)** received FDA approval in 2018 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH1 mutation, and **Idhifa (enasidenib)** was approved in 2017 for AML with IDH2 mutations (developed in partnership with Celgene). These represented real therapeutic breakthroughs for patient populations with limited treatment options.

The drugs achieved meaningful market uptake. Tibsovo generated approximately $280 million in annual revenue by 2022, demonstrating substantial patient adoption. Notably, Celgene (later acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb) had the exclusive option mentioned in the lawsuit, which ultimately resulted in approved drugs.

**Corporate Evolution:**
The relationship between Agios and Celgene proved highly productive, leading to multiple approved therapies. However, in 2023, Agios announced it would sell its oncology business to Servier for $1.8 billion, while retaining its rare genetic disease programs. This represented a significant return on investment, validating the research platform's value.

The settlement enabled Agios to move forward without the cloud of litigation, contributing to their successful drug development trajectory and eventual $1.8 billion transaction.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"That would be my bet" - predicting settlement before trial**: ✓ **CORRECT**. The case settled in just four months, well before any trial could occur, exactly as the author predicted.

• **"This is all going to come down to what happened when"**: ✓ **CORRECT**. The settlement suggests both parties reached an understanding about the timeline and nature of disclosures, likely through discovery evidence.

• **"Discovery process - emails, meeting minutes, memos, text messages, whatever can establish who told what to whom"**: ✓ **PROBABLY CORRECT**. The rapid settlement indicates discovery produced evidence that made both parties willing to resolve the matter quickly rather than proceed with costly litigation.

• **"Not quite the way to build trust"**: ✓ **CORRECT**. The quick settlement suggests both parties recognized the relationship damage and moved to resolve rather than escalate.

The author's legal analysis proved prescient, with the case following almost exactly the predicted trajectory of settlement after discovery rather than proceeding to trial.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a crucial moment in academic-industry relations, and the rapid settlement followed by Agios's successful IPO and FDA-approved drugs makes this case study particularly valuable for understanding how such disputes can be resolved while still enabling scientific and commercial success. The $1.8 billion eventual transaction demonstrates significant long-term importance.
