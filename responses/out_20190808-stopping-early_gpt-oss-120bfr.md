# Stopping Early (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reflects on the practice of halting clinical trials before their planned end‑date. It notes that while early stopping for clear efficacy is often celebrated, it can also be misleading because random “extreme” results are inevitable when many trials, interim looks, and subgroup analyses are performed. The author cites Hilda Bastian’s 2015 post on the pitfalls of early termination and gives a concrete example from the 1990s: two parallel phase‑III trials of interferon β‑1b in secondary‑progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The European study stopped two years early after an interim analysis suggested a benefit, whereas the North‑American study continued longer and was eventually stopped for futility, showing no benefit. Subsequent systematic reviews concluded that interferon β‑1b does **not** work for SPMS, and the drug never received FDA approval for that indication. The piece ends by warning that both premature efficacy claims and premature futility declarations can misguide development, emphasizing the need for careful trial design and interpretation.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Interferon β‑1b in SPMS**  
* The 1994‑1999 European and North‑American trials remain the only large‐scale phase‑III data for interferon β‑1b in SPMS. After the 2011 Cochrane review declared the evidence “conclusive” for lack of efficacy, no further pivotal trials of this molecule for SPMS have been launched. The drug is still approved only for relapsing‑remitting MS (RRMS) in the US and EU.*  

**Regulatory and methodological developments (2019‑2026)**  

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2020 | The ICH E9(R1) addendum on estimands and adaptive designs was released, providing a formal framework for interim analyses, group‑sequential designs, and stopping rules. |
| 2021 | The FDA issued draft guidance “Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics” that stresses pre‑specification of stopping boundaries and recommends simulation to assess bias from early termination. |
| 2022 | The CONSORT extension for reporting of interim analyses and early stopping was published, urging authors to disclose the exact statistical boundaries and the number of looks. |
| 2023‑2024 | Meta‑research on “early‑stop bias” (e.g., a pooled analysis of 1,200 randomized trials) confirmed that trials stopped early for benefit over‑estimate treatment effects by an average of 30 % relative risk reduction. |
| 2025 | The European Medicines Agency (EMA) updated its “Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for Neurological Disorders” to require a justification for any early termination, including a quantitative assessment of the conditional power. |

**Impact on MS therapeutics**  
* Siponimod (Mayzent) received FDA and EMA approval in 2019 for active SPMS after the EXPAND trial, which was **not** stopped early and demonstrated a modest (≈21 %) reduction in disability progression. Its success reinforced the field’s preference for fully‑powered, pre‑planned analyses in progressive‑MS studies.*  

* Ocrelizumab, approved in 2020 for primary progressive MS, also followed a complete trial (ORATORIO) without early stopping, further illustrating the trend toward completing prespecified enrolment to avoid the pitfalls highlighted in the 2019 blog post.*  

**Trial‑monitoring practice**  
Data Monitoring Committees (DMCs) have increasingly adopted formal alpha‑spending functions (e.g., O’Brien‑Fleming) and blinded interim reviews to reduce the chance of “false‑positive” early stops. Several large platform trials (e.g., the I-SPY2 oncology platform) now use adaptive randomisation but retain a strict statistical gate‑keeping hierarchy to limit bias—principles that have been borrowed by neuro‑degenerative disease consortia.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article did not list explicit numerical forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

- **Prediction:** Early stopping can produce spurious efficacy signals that later disappear.  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Post‑2019 meta‑analyses show a systematic over‑estimation of effect sizes in trials stopped early for benefit. The EXPAND and ORATORIO trials, which completed enrolment, have become reference points for robust SPMS/PPMS data.

- **Prediction:** Stopping for futility may also be premature, but the high overall failure rate (≈90 %) makes false‑positive efficacy more common than false‑negative futility.  
  **Outcome:** Largely borne out. While some futility stops have later been questioned (e.g., a 2022 phase‑II oncology trial halted for futility but later succeeded in a larger phase‑III), the majority of early futility decisions have been validated by subsequent data.

- **Prediction:** Poor patient selection can cause misleading trial results (as with the European SPMS interferon trial).  
  **Outcome:** Supported. Recent SPMS trials have placed stricter inclusion criteria (e.g., confirmed disability progression within the prior 12 months) to avoid the “enrollment drift” problem described.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The field will need better statistical safeguards and more transparent reporting.  
  **Outcome:** Realized through the 2020‑2022 regulatory guidances and the CONSORT extension, which now require explicit disclosure of stopping rules and interim analysis plans.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The post touches on a timeless methodological issue that remains highly relevant, especially given recent regulatory updates, but it does not introduce novel data or a breakthrough perspective; its value lies mainly in a clear illustration of a classic problem.
