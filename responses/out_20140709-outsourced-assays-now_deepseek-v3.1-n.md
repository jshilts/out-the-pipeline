# Outsourced Assays, Now a Cause For Wonder? (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Emerald Biotherapeutics, a company that both conducts its own drug research and offers lab services using a proprietary automated system for generating fast, reproducible biological assays. The company introduced a web-based service allowing other labs to send experimental instructions that are then executed by robots, charging $1 to $100 per experiment with same-day results promised. This cloud-lab model was positioned as analogous to cloud computing where companies rent computational resources rather than maintain their own infrastructure.

The author, Derek Lowe, provides skeptical commentary questioning whether assay speed is the real bottleneck in drug discovery. He notes that significant outsourcing already existed in the industry and argues that the truly difficult, time-consuming steps—determining what to assay, selecting targets, designing appropriate assays, and troubleshooting protocols—are not automatable and remain the core challenges. Lowe also questions the novelty of centralized data collection, suggesting this capability was already expected from contract research organizations rather than being the groundbreaking advancement portrayed.

## 2. HISTORY

**Emerald Biotherapeutics trajectory**: The company referenced in the article appears to be what later became Emerald Therapeutics or Emerald Cloud Lab. These services faced challenging market adoption in subsequent years. While the concept attracted attention, the broader shift toward fully automated remote laboratories did not materialize as dramatically as some anticipated by the mid-2010s.

**CRO industry evolution**: The contract research organization (CRO) market continued growing throughout the 2010s, but primarily through established players like Covance, Charles River Laboratories, and Quintiles rather than disruptive automation-focused startups. Most outsourcing remained focused on specific services (chemistry, toxicology, clinical trials) rather than comprehensive "lab-as-a-service" models.

**Automation adoption**: Laboratory automation did advance, but incrementally rather than revolutionarily. Most pharmaceutical and biotech companies invested in internal automation systems rather than outsourcing entire experimental workflows. High-throughput screening became more sophisticated, yet the fundamental bottlenecks in target identification and assay development that Lowe identified remained largely unchanged.

**Business outcomes**: The "cloud lab" concept faced challenges with market adoption, unit economics, and competition from existing CROs with established client relationships. By the late 2010s, while some companies offered remote access to specialized equipment, the comprehensive assay-as-a-service model never achieved the market penetration suggested by the article's enthusiasm.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction**: Emerald's fast, reproducible assay service would be valuable for biotech startups wanting to offload basic tasks, freeing researchers for complex analysis.

**Reality**: While CRO usage increased among startups, most companies continued building internal capabilities for core assays rather than comprehensive outsourcing. The predicted shift to cloud-lab models did not materialize at scale.

**• Prediction**: The $1-$100 per experiment pricing with same-day turnaround would be attractive enough to drive significant adoption.

**Reality**: Pricing for complex biological assays proved more challenging than suggested, with quality control, validation, and reproducibility requirements making such low-cost, fast-turnaround services difficult to sustain profitably.

**• Prediction**: Centralized data collection and automated reporting represented major advances over manual processes.

**Reality**: Electronic lab notebooks and integrated data management were already becoming standard in the industry by 2014. The capabilities described were increasingly table stakes rather than differentiators.

**• Prediction**: Automation of assay execution would significantly impact drug discovery timelines.

**Reality**: While automation improved efficiency for routine tasks, it did not address the fundamental rate-limiting steps Lowe correctly identified: target validation, assay development, and decision-making about what to screen.

**• Prediction**: The cloud-lab model would follow the trajectory of cloud computing, with widespread adoption of lab-as-a-service.

**Reality**: This transformation did not occur. Laboratory work proved more complex, requiring direct researcher involvement, specialized expertise, and quality control that comprehensive automation could not replace.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article captures a moment in biotech infrastructure evolution and provides useful skeptical analysis, but addresses a niche service model that ultimately had limited broader impact. Lowe's critical perspective on automation bottlenecks proved prescient.
