# PhRMA Waits For The Supreme Court (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece describes the political backdrop to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the role of PhRMA, the trade group for large‑pharma companies. According to leaked internal memos, PhRMA agreed to support the ACA in exchange for concessions on drug‑importation bans and Medicare pricing. The association funded a public‑relations push—through the “Healthy Economy Now” (HEN) coalition that also involved the AMA and White House staffers—to thank lawmakers who voted for the bill and to keep them “vigilant” during implementation. The article notes a potential conflict of interest involving David Axelrod’s former ad firm, AKPD, which was hired to run part of the $12 million HEN advertising campaign. The author warns that the Supreme Court’s pending decision on the ACA could upend these lobbying gains and affect pharma revenues.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Supreme Court decision (June 28 2012).** In *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* the Court upheld the ACA’s individual‑mandate as a valid exercise of Congress’s taxing power, leaving the rest of the law intact. The decision therefore preserved the legislative compromises that PhRMA had bargained for.

**Subsequent ACA litigation and implementation.**  
* *King v. Burwell* (2015) upheld federal subsidies, keeping the insurance‑exchange market functional.  
* The 2017‑2018 “American Health Care Act” repeal attempts failed, so the ACA’s core provisions survived.  
* In 2021 the Court struck down the individual‑mandate penalty (*California v. Texas*), but left the rest of the law untouched, meaning the pricing concessions PhRMA secured remained in force.

**Drug‑pricing policy after 2012.**  
* The ACA did **not** impose direct price caps on brand‑name drugs; instead it created a “Medicare Part D discount” that was never implemented because of industry opposition (including PhRMA).  
* In 2019 the Trump administration issued a rule to allow limited importation of certain drugs from Canada, but the rule was blocked by courts and never took effect.  
* The most consequential change came with the **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022**, which introduced a modest, phased‑in Medicare price‑negotiation program for a small set of high‑cost drugs beginning in 2025. PhRMA lobbied heavily against the provision, but the law passed with bipartisan support. The IRA also caps annual price increases for Medicare‑covered drugs at 15 % and caps out‑of‑pocket costs for seniors.

**Industry outcomes.**  
* PhRMA’s membership companies continued to dominate the U.S. drug market; revenue growth slowed modestly after 2015, largely due to patent cliffs and pricing pressure, not because of ACA‑related provisions.  
* The “Healthy Economy Now” coalition dissolved shortly after the ACA’s passage; its advertising campaign ended in 2010‑2011 and left little lasting infrastructure.  
* The 2022 Supreme Court case *West Virginia v. EPA* (environmental) and *Dobbs v. Jackson* (abortion) did not directly affect pharma, but the broader political climate kept drug‑pricing reform a contentious issue.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **The Supreme Court could strike down the ACA, wiping out the concessions PhRMA obtained.** | The Court upheld the ACA in 2012, preserving the negotiated concessions. Later rulings trimmed the individual‑mandate penalty but left the rest of the law intact. |
| **If the ACA were weakened, PhRMA’s revenue stream could be jeopardized.** | The ACA survived; pharma revenues continued to grow through the 2010s, though growth slowed after 2015 due to patent expirations and market saturation, not because of ACA repeal. |
| **The “Healthy Economy Now” coalition would be a lasting vehicle for pharma‑policy influence.** | HEN was a short‑lived ad effort (≈2009‑2010) and dissolved well before the Supreme Court hearing; it left no enduring policy‑shaping role. |
| **The deal on drug‑importation and Medicare pricing would be a permanent win for pharma.** | The import‑ation ban remained largely in place; a limited import‑ation rule was proposed in 2019 but blocked. The promised Medicare Part D discount never materialized. However, the 2022 IRA introduced modest price‑negotiation powers, partially eroding the earlier “win.” |
| **PhRMA’s lobbying would keep drug pricing largely untouched for the foreseeable future.** | PhRMA succeeded in delaying major price‑control measures for a decade, but the IRA’s negotiation program (2022) represents a concrete shift toward price moderation, indicating that the “untouched” prediction was only partially correct. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in health‑policy lobbying and foreshadows legal battles that shaped the ACA, but its specific focus on a single lobbying memo limits broader long‑term relevance.
