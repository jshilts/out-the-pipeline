# Real-World Ebola (30 Sep 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary describes a Liberian doctor, Dr. Gobee Logan, who is treating Ebola patients in Tubmanburg and experimenting with lamivudine, an HIV and hepatitis B drug, as a potential Ebola treatment. The author, Derek Lowe, notes that while lamivudine is typically a nucleoside analog antiviral used for HIV, it is theoretically possible it could have activity against Ebola (a filovirus) as a separate nucleoside analogue (BCX4430) was recently reported to show promise against filoviruses. The article emphasizes that Dr. Logan's approach is desperate but rational, given the high mortality and limited options during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The author contrasts this with anti-foreign medical sentiment and explicitly supports trying existing drugs, even if off-label, despite the absence of prior reports on lamivudine for Ebola.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent to this article being published, the 2014–2016 West African Ebola epidemic became the largest Ebola outbreak in history, with over 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths. Lamivudine was never validated as an effective treatment for Ebola. Instead, treatments that ultimately proved effective included:
- **Supportive care** (fluid resuscitation, electrolyte management) remained crucial and was the primary intervention that improved survival.
- **ZMapp**, a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, showed promise in observational studies (though a randomized trial was halted early due to waning cases) and became part of standard care.
- **Remdesivir** (a nucleoside analog, originally investigated for Ebola and later repurposed for COVID-19) underwent trials for Ebola but was not the primary advance.
- **ERVEBO (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP)**, a vaccine developed by Merck, demonstrated high efficacy in the "ring vaccination" trial and gained FDA approval in 2019, becoming the first approved Ebola vaccine and a major breakthrough.
- **mAb114 and REGN-EB3** (monoclonal antibody regimens) showed strong efficacy in the 2018–2020 DRC outbreak and became the basis for current Ebola therapeutics.
No credible evidence emerged to support lamivudine's efficacy against Ebola; the later consensus emphasizes supportive care plus specific monoclonal-antibody-based therapies and vaccination.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Lamivudine might help against Ebola**: The article suggested lamivudine could be "worth a try" based on nucleoside analogs showing promise and a clinician’s anecdotal report. **Outcome**: Lamivudine was not validated; no rigorous trials or observational data confirmed its benefit, and Ebola care shifted toward antibody-based therapies and vaccines.
- **Nucleoside analogs as antivirals for filoviruses**: The article referenced BCX4430 (a nucleoside) and framed nucleosides as a plausible antiviral class for Ebola. **Outcome**: While remdesivir (a nucleoside analog) later showed some utility, it is not a first-line Ebola therapy; monoclonal antibodies and vaccines became dominant.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
The article discusses attempted repurposing of a legacy antiviral during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and advocates for pragmatic local medicine. However, the specific drug (lamivudine) did not pan out, and treatment paradigms shifted decisively to vaccines and monoclonal antibodies rather than nucleoside analogs. The piece amounts to a historical footnote without lasting clinical or scientific resonance.
