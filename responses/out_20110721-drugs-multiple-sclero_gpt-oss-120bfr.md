# Drugs for Multiple Sclerosis: Worth the Price, Or Not? (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary highlighted a cost‑effectiveness analysis published in *Neurology* that compared the five disease‑modifying therapies (DMTs) then available in the United States: interferon‑β‑1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon‑β‑1b (Betaseron/Extavia), and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). Using a ten‑year horizon, the study expressed outcomes as dollars per quality‑adjusted life‑year (QALY). All five agents fell far above the thresholds commonly used by the UK’s NICE (≈ $40‑50 k/QALY) and even above a more permissive US benchmark of $100‑150 k/QALY, with estimated costs approaching $800 k–$1 M per QALY. The author noted that the newer oral agent fingolimod (Gilenya) was likely to be even more expensive and questioned whether any of these drugs provided sufficient benefit to justify their prices. The piece then raised broader philosophical questions about pricing, insurance coverage, and the role of cost‑effectiveness in therapeutic decision‑making.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Market evolution after 2011  
| Year | Event | Impact on the landscape |
|------|-------|--------------------------|
| **2012‑2013** | FDA approval of oral dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) and teriflunomide (Aubagio). | Introduced lower‑cost oral alternatives; early cost‑effectiveness studies placed them around $50‑70 k/QALY, still above NICE thresholds but better than the older injectables. |
| **2014** | Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) approved for relapsing‑remitting MS. | Very high acquisition cost (~$70 k/yr) and a safety monitoring burden; ICER analyses > $150 k/QALY, limiting uptake. |
| **2015‑2016** | Real‑world price‑adjustment programs (e.g., Novartis “Gilenya Savings Card”) and the emergence of patient‑assistance foundations. | Marginally improved affordability for some patients but did not change the underlying high ICERs. |
| **2017** | Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) approved for both relapsing and primary‑progressive MS. | Became the first high‑efficacy IV therapy; price ~ $65 k/yr. Subsequent US cost‑effectiveness analyses ranged $80‑120 k/QALY, still above NICE’s “acceptable” range but comparable to other high‑efficacy agents. |
| **2018‑2020** | Introduction of next‑generation sphingosine‑1‑phosphate (S1P) modulators: siponimod (Mayzent, 2019), ozanimod (Zeposia, 2020), and ponesimod (Ponvory, 2021). | Prices similar to Gilenya; NICE initially rejected siponimod and ozanimod until manufacturers offered confidential discounts, after which they were listed as cost‑effective. |
| **2019** | First biosimilar glatiramer acetate (Glatopa) approved in the US; biosimilar interferon‑β‑1a (e.g., “Inflectra‑like” product) approved in Europe and later in the US (2020). | Introduced modest price competition; wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) fell ~ 15‑20 % versus reference products. |
| **2020‑2022** | Expanded use of high‑efficacy monoclonal antibodies (ofatumumab/Kesimpta subcutaneous, ublituximab in trials). | Subcutaneous ofatumumab priced similarly to Ocrevus; early US cost‑effectiveness estimates around $100 k/QALY. |
| **2023‑2024** | FDA approval of the first generic fingolimod (e.g., from Mylan/Viatris). | Generic price ~ 30‑40 % lower than brand; ICER for generic fingolimod dropped to roughly $300‑400 k/QALY—still high but a notable improvement. |
| **2025** | NICE re‑evaluated several DMTs under its “end‑of‑life” and “high‑cost” pathways, resulting in conditional approvals for some oral agents with price‑rebate agreements. | Demonstrated that cost‑effectiveness can be achieved through negotiated discounts rather than intrinsic efficacy changes. |

### Policy and reimbursement trends  
* **United States:** Medicare Part D continues to cover all FDA‑approved DMTs, but many plans employ tiered copays and prior‑authorization criteria that effectively steer patients toward lower‑priced options (e.g., biosimilars, generics). The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced a “price‑negotiation” mechanism for certain high‑cost drugs, but DMTs were excluded in the first round; a 2024 amendment is expected to bring some MS therapies under negotiation.  
* **United Kingdom:** NICE’s threshold remained £20‑30 k/QALY (≈ $25‑35 k). By 2023, only a subset of oral DMTs (dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide) met the threshold without confidential discounts. The newer S1P modulators were accepted only after manufacturers offered > 30 % price cuts.  
* **Europe (EU):** Many countries adopted reference‑pricing or “price‑volume” agreements, leading to lower list prices for interferons and glatiramer acetate compared with the US.  

### Clinical outcomes  
* The overall relapse‑rate reduction and disability‑progression delay achieved by the 2011‑era injectables have been matched or modestly improved by newer oral and IV agents, but no therapy has demonstrated a cure.  
* Real‑world registries (e.g., MSBase, NARCOMS) show that adherence to oral agents is higher than to injectables, modestly improving cost‑effectiveness by reducing discontinuation‑related costs.  

### Bottom line  
* The 2011 cost‑effectiveness concerns remain largely valid: most MS DMTs still exceed the $100‑150 k/QALY range used in US health‑technology assessments and are far above NICE’s traditional threshold.  
* Price competition (biosimilars, generics) and negotiated discounts have narrowed the gap for a few agents, but the market still features high absolute prices, especially for high‑efficacy monoclonal antibodies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Gilenya (fingolimod) would be “even more expensive” and likely less cost‑effective than the older injectables.** | Brand Gilenya launched at ≈ $70 k/yr in the US, yielding ICER estimates of $800‑$1 M/QALY in early analyses—consistent with the article’s claim. The 2024 generic reduced price by ~ 35 %, improving ICER to ≈ $300‑$400 k/QALY, still high but better. | **Correct in direction**; price remained high, and cost‑effectiveness stayed poor until generic entry. |
| **All five established DMTs would have ICERs well above $800 k/QALY.** | Subsequent US analyses (e.g., 2015–2020) placed interferon‑β and glatiramer acetate around $500‑$900 k/QALY, depending on discount assumptions. The figure was not far off, though some later models (including discount programs) lowered estimates to $400‑$600 k/QALY. | **Approximately correct**, though later discounting narrowed the gap. |
| **Debate over “pricing a quality of life” would intensify and force policy changes.** | The past decade saw multiple policy initiatives (e.g., NICE price‑rebate negotiations, US Medicare Part D formulary reforms, 2022 Inflation Reduction Act) directly addressing high DMT prices. Public and professional discourse on QALY‑based pricing grew, especially in the UK and EU. | **Accurate** – the issue became a central theme in health‑economics discussions. |
| **New oral agents (like Gilenya) would “land” with a track record that could justify their cost.** | Real‑world data (2020‑2024) confirmed fingolimod’s efficacy but did not dramatically improve its cost‑effectiveness; newer oral agents (dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide) achieved better ICERs, while later S1P modulators required price cuts to be deemed acceptable. | **Partially correct** – efficacy was confirmed, but cost‑effectiveness remained a problem. |
| **Prices of existing drugs would continue to rise, widening the cost‑effectiveness gap.** | US list prices for interferons and glatiramer acetate rose modestly (≈ 5‑10 % per year) until biosimilar entry; the net effect was a slight narrowing of the gap rather than widening. | **Mixed** – price growth slowed after biosimilar competition. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when high‑cost MS therapies first collided with formal health‑economic evaluation, a debate that has shaped pricing, reimbursement, and the development of newer, more affordable DMTs over the subsequent decade.
