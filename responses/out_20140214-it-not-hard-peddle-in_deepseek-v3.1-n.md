# It Is Not Hard to Peddle Incoherent Math to Biologists (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article describes a 2014 public dispute in computational biology and bioinformatics. Lior Pachter (UC Berkeley) leveled serious criticism against the work of Manolis Kellis (MIT), alleging statistical errors and problematic practices in published research. Specifically, Pachter criticized the Ward and Kellis 2012 *Science* paper on human regulatory evolution from the ENCODE project, accusing the authors of "blatant statistically invalid cherry picking."

The broader concern raised was about accountability in computational biology. The author echoes Pachter's warning that biologists unfamiliar with advanced mathematics may be vulnerable to accepting flawed quantitative methods, while mathematicians may uncritically accept biological claims. The article frames this as a systemic problem where insufficient cross-disciplinary expertise allows "incoherent math" to go unchallenged, potentially enabling questionable practices or even misconduct to persist.

## 2. HISTORY
Looking at the specific issues and participants after 2014:

**The ENCODE Project and Ward-Kellis Paper**: The Ward-Kellis 2012 *Science* paper on purifying selection in human regulatory elements was one of many high-profile publications from the larger ENCODE consortium. Despite Pachter's criticism, the paper was never retracted or formally corrected. Follow-up work on human regulatory evolution continued through the ENCODE consortium's later phases. However, over the subsequent decade, the field did move toward improved statistical rigor, better control procedures for genomic analyses, and stronger emphasis on reproducibility in computational biology.

**The Researchers**: Manolis Kellis remained at MIT as a prominent computational biologist, continuing to publish extensively and receiving numerous grants and recognitions. Lior Pachter continued his work at Berkeley (later moving to Caltech) and continued to advocate for rigorous mathematics in biology. Importantly, this 2014 controversy did *not* result in career-ending consequences for Kellis, nor did it lead to formal investigations or retractions.

**The ENCODE Project Outcomes**: The broader ENCODE project generated vast amounts of functional genomics data that proved valuable for the scientific community. While initial press coverage about "what makes us human" was overly simplistic, the actual data resources and computational tools from ENCODE enabled substantial downstream research. Beyond earlier criticisms, no major fraud scandals emerged from the ENCODE consortium.

**Field Impact**: Computational biology has since developed stronger norms around transparency and reproducibility, including better data sharing, open-source code, and more rigorous peer review standards. The "fight" garnered attention, but similar public disputes have recurred in computational biology, including disputes over statistics in single-cell genomics methods around 2018-2020.

**Policy Implications**: No concrete public policy changes resulted directly from this dispute. However, broader discussions about reproducibility in science in the subsequent decade influenced funding agencies' expectations for data and code sharing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"After this very public calling out, there's no other outcome"**: The author anticipated some definitive resolution would follow the public accusations. However, no formal retractions, sanctions, or major career shifts for Kellis occurred after widespread publicity. The controversy gradually faded without the dramatic outcome the article implied.

The article didn't make explicit long-term predictions about computational biology's evolution, but the concerns did anticipate ongoing challenges in interdisciplinary work.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a revealing moment in the sociology of computational biology. The allegations were severe, the researchers prominent, and the underlying tension about cross-disciplinary accountability remains relevant. While it didn't lead to major changes or major breakthroughs, it illuminates persistent challenges in ensuring rigor when fields merge.
