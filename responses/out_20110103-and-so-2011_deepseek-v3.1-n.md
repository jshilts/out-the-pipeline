# And So, 2011 (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary reflects on 2010 as "Not A Good Year for the drug industry," but suggests it may have broken the deteriorating trend since 2006, possibly indicating a bottom had been reached. The author speculates that 2011 will serve as a prelude to 2012, with significant patent expirations looming—most notably Lipitor's expiration late in 2011. The article notes that patent cliffs are bad news for research-driven pharmaceutical companies but positive for generic manufacturers and drug store chains, and invites readers to predict which companies would fare best and worst in the coming year.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2011-2012 period did indeed mark a significant inflection point for the pharmaceutical industry:

**Lipitor's Patent Expiration (November 2011)**: Lipitor (atorvastatin), Pfizer's blockbuster cholesterol drug, lost patent protection on November 30, 2011, after generating over $130 billion in cumulative sales. The impact was immediate and severe for Pfizer, with Lipitor sales dropping from $10.7 billion in 2010 to $3.9 billion in 2012, then continuing to decline as generic competition intensified.

**Industry-Wide Patent Cliff**: The 2011-2015 period represented the largest patent cliff in pharmaceutical history, with drugs worth approximately $255 billion in annual sales losing patent protection. Other major expirations around this time included Plavix (2012), Seroquel (2012), Singulair (2012), and Actos (2012). This created enormous pressure on R&D productivity and forced major restructuring across the industry.

**Diverging Fortunes**: The article's observation about differential impacts proved accurate. Research-driven companies like Pfizer, Merck, and Bristol-Myers Squibb faced significant revenue declines and responded with massive cost-cutting, layoffs, and restructuring. Generic companies like Teva, Mylan, and Actavis (now part of Teva) experienced substantial growth. The generic market expanded rapidly, with the FDA approving a record number of generic applications to improve competition.

**M&A Recovery**: After a period of relative quiet, pharmaceutical M&A activity began accelerating in 2014-2015 as companies sought to rebuild pipelines and achieve growth through acquisition rather than internal R&D.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"2011 will end up looking more like the prelude to 2012"** - **Accurate**. The patent cliff impact was indeed felt most strongly in 2012, with Lipitor's full-year generic competition beginning that year and multiple other blockbusters losing protection.

• **"Perhaps some sort of bottom has been reached?"** - **Accurate**. Industry performance did stabilize and begin recovering after 2010-2011, though the recovery was uneven and many companies took several years to return to growth.

• **Differential impact on research vs. generic companies** - **Accurate**. This prediction was borne out by subsequent financial performance, employment trends, and stock price movements across the sector.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This commentary correctly identified a major turning point for the pharmaceutical industry and accurately predicted the looming patent cliff's impact, though it was relatively brief and did not delve deeply into the broader implications or quantitative aspects of the transition.
