# Avastin's Metastatic Breast Cancer Approval Revoked (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a 2011 commentary on the FDA's decision to revoke Avastin's accelerated approval for metastatic breast cancer. The article endorses the FDA's 70-page ruling, which was based on the agency's finding that while the initial E2100 trial had shown what appeared to be a clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), five subsequent trials collectively showed the drug's effect was "very weak" while its serious, potentially life-threatening risks remained. The author anticipates that the decision would draw ill‑informed criticism (such as claims it was a cost-cutting move or an assault on medical progress) and argues that believing in medical progress requires accepting what well-controlled trials show, even when they disappoint.

## 2. HISTORY
- **Trial evidence and the FDA process**: Avastin (bevacizumab) had received accelerated approval in 2008 for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer based on the E2100 trial showing a 5.5-month improvement in median PFS. Confirmatory studies (AVADO, RIBBON-1) showed much more modest PFS gains (about 0.8–1.2 months) and no overall survival benefit. In 2010 an advisory committee voted 12–1 to withdraw the breast cancer indication; in 2011 FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg finalized the withdrawal, emphasizing that the totality of evidence did not demonstrate clinical benefit justifying the risks.
- **Concrete impacts**: Avastin retained its approvals in multiple other cancers (colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, renal, cervical, ovarian) where evidence of benefit was stronger. For metastatic breast cancer, the decision removed the FDA-approved indication, but physicians could still prescribe Avastin off-label. Insurers subsequently tightened coverage, often declining to pay for Avastin for breast cancer outside of clinical trials, reducing real-world access for patients.
- **Scientific reception**: The revocation was widely supported by cancer specialists, biostatisticians, and evidence-based medicine advocates who argued that surrogate endpoints (like PFS) must be validated by meaningful clinical outcomes and a favorable benefit–risk profile. Critics—some patient groups and the manufacturer (Genentech/Roche)—argued that any delay in progression was meaningful and that the decision removed a viable option for patients and clinicians.
- **Longer-term outcomes**: No subsequent studies reversed the conclusion. In the following decade, Avastin was not reinstated for metastatic breast cancer. Treatment paradigms shifted toward other targeted agents and immunotherapy in appropriate subsets, with CDK4/6 inhibitors and HER2-directed therapies rising in prominence. Avastin remains part of standard care in approved indications (e.g., colorectal cancer), but the breast cancer episode became a landmark case study on accelerated approval, confirmatory evidence, and evidence-based regulatory decision-making. Public policy did not change dramatically, but it reinforced the principle of requiring confirmatory trials to validate clinical benefit for accelerated approvals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **The author predicted there would be "a lot of commentary, not all of it very informed," framing the decision as a price-driven attempt to cut costs, an assault on medical progress, or an early move under "Obamacare."**
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Many media reports and advocacy groups deployed those narratives, while mainstream scientific and clinical groups largely supported the evidence-based decision.
- **Implicit prediction: believing in medical progress requires accepting what multiple well-controlled trials show, even when they disappoint.**
  - **Outcome**: This stance aged well. Over the next decade, accelerated-approval confirmatory trials became more rigorous, and withdrawals for indications that failed to confirm benefit occurred repeatedly (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors in certain tumor types), reinforcing the principle that clinical benefit must be demonstrated, not assumed from surrogates.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: 8/9

Reasoning: This episode became a durable case study in evidence-based regulatory decision-making and accelerated approval, directly shaping clinical practice, insurer policy, and subsequent FDA standards.
