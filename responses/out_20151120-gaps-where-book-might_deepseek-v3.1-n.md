# Gaps Where a Book Might Fit? (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe, writing on his "In the Pipeline" blog at Science Magazine, posed a question to his drug research audience about knowledge gaps facing newcomers entering the pharmaceutical industry. The post was motivated by a request from a reputable publisher exploring whether there was market demand for a new textbook targeting people entering drug research. Lowe expanded the question beyond just textbook categories to identify any areas inadequately served by existing literature. The article solicited suggestions from readers about topics that could fill these educational gaps, positioning it as both market research for the publisher and preparation for Lowe's annual book recommendation series.

## 2. HISTORY

The blog post and its comment section captured a snapshot of perceived educational gaps in 2015, but did not appear to directly result in a major new textbook addressing the specific market Lowe surveyed. The pharmaceutical industry continued to evolve significantly in subsequent years with several major trends: the rise of gene therapies and mRNA vaccines, expanding use of AI/machine learning in drug discovery, increased investment in rare diseases, and growing emphasis on real-world evidence and patient-centric approaches. While the educational market for drug research texts continued to be served by established publishers (such as Springer, Elsevier, and academic presses), the specific knowledge gaps identified in 2015—particularly around translational medicine, regulatory affairs, and the practical business aspects of drug development—remained persistent challenges in the industry. However, there was no evidence that a major new comprehensive textbook emerged directly from this solicitation that significantly changed how newcomers were educated in drug research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction that a new textbook might fill identified gaps**: The article assumed there was market demand for textbooks addressing these knowledge gaps. **Outcome**: While some specialized texts likely appeared, there was no evidence of a transformative new textbook that fundamentally addressed the gaps on the scale implied by the publisher's interest.
- **Implicit prediction that reader-identified gaps would drive publishing decisions**: The post suggested that reader input would influence publisher strategy. **Outcome**: Reader comments did identify genuine needs, but publishing industry dynamics likely prioritized other factors (market size, author expertise, competition with existing texts) over these niche gaps.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3**

The post offers moderate historical interest as a time capsule of perceived educational needs in 2015 drug research, but does not address a transformative development and had limited demonstrable long-term impact on publishing or drug research education.
