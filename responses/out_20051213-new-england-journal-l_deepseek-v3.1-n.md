# The New England Journal of Legal Immunity?
## 13 Dec 2005

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2005 commentary analyzes the New England Journal of Medicine's (NEJM) decision to issue an "expression of concern" regarding Merck's VIGOR study on Vioxx (rofecoxib). The article came five years after the original VIGOR publication and just after Vioxx was withdrawn from the market in September 2004 due to cardiovascular safety concerns.

The author speculates that NEJM's timing—issuing the concern only after its editor was deposed in the federal Vioxx litigation—suggests the journal was motivated by legal self-protection rather than scientific responsibility. The argument notes that Merck may have legitimately excluded three myocardial infarction cases that occurred after the study's cutoff date, and that the journal remained silent throughout years of controversy until facing potential legal exposure.

## 2. HISTORY
The NEJM's 2005 expression of concern marked just one episode in the extensive Vioxx litigation saga:

**Legal outcomes**: Merck ultimately faced over 50,000 lawsuits and settled for approximately $4.85 billion in 2007, though the company won several early trials. The litigation continued for years, with Merck prevailing in many cases but ultimately paying billions in settlements.

**Regulatory and clinical developments**: Vioxx was definitively withdrawn in September 2004 and never returned to market. Subsequent research confirmed increased cardiovascular risk with COX-2 inhibitors, leading to black box warnings for similar drugs like celecoxib (Celebrex). The FDA implemented stricter post-market surveillance requirements for new drugs.

**Scientific publishing impact**: NEJM later strengthened its conflict-of-interest disclosure policies and data transparency requirements. The incident contributed to broader reforms in clinical trial registration and reporting standards, though NEJM maintained its editorial independence and reputation.

**NEJM's legal exposure**: In subsequent years, NEJM editors were deposed in multiple Vioxx cases, but the journal itself faced minimal direct legal liability. The 2005 editorial action likely served its intended purpose of establishing the journal's position in potential litigation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's implicit and explicit questions about outcomes:

**Whether NEJM would face significant legal liability**: ✗ **Incorrect** - NEJM ultimately faced minimal direct legal exposure despite early concerns, though editors were extensively deposed.
**Impact on NEJM's reputation and editorial practices**: ✓ **Correct** - NEJM did implement stronger conflict-of-interest and data transparency policies in subsequent years, though the journal maintained its prestige.
**Whether Merck's legal position was defensible**: △ **Mixed** - Merck won several individual trials early in the litigation but ultimately paid billions in aggregate settlements, suggesting the company's legal position weakened over time rather than strengthened as implied by the article's defense of their data handling.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **6/10**
This article provides insight into the intersection of medical publishing and legal liability, though its specific legal speculation about NEJM proved overstated and the broader Vioxx story ultimately had greater scientific and regulatory significance.
