# Good Old Medicinal Chemistry: What Can You Get Away With? (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies in medicinal chemistry, particularly focusing on research that analyzed when small structural changes cause dramatic (>100-fold) activity shifts. The referenced study used matched molecular pair analysis across public databases to identify which functional group transformations most frequently cause these "activity cliffs." The findings showed predictable patterns: carboxyl group modifications are rarely neutral due to their polar nature, while carbonyls and amines also cause significant changes. Interestingly, some transformations proved surprisingly benign, including secondary hydroxyl additions and small halogen substitutions on aromatic rings. The article emphasizes that SAR trends are probabilistic—while certain changes are more likely to cause problems, exceptions always exist, making drug discovery both "enjoyable and frustrating."

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2010 article, matched molecular pair (MMP) analysis became an established computational tool in drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies integrated these approaches into lead optimization workflows, helping medicinal chemists make more informed decisions about structural modifications. The fundamental SAR principles described remained relevant, with companies like Pfizer, GSK, and Novartis continuing to rely on these empirical relationships while developing small molecule drugs.

However, the landscape evolved significantly. By the mid-2010s, machine learning and AI began augmenting traditional SAR analysis, with companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, and Schrödinger developing platforms that could predict activity cliffs more systematically. Fragment-based drug discovery gained prominence, while macrocycles and PROTACs emerged as new modalities that challenged traditional SAR thinking. Most major pharmaceutical companies now use computational tools that combine MMP analysis with machine learning predictions to guide medicinal chemistry decisions.

Structurally related analogs continue to drive drug development, with many approved drugs representing optimized versions of earlier candidates. However, the rise of biologics, gene therapies, and cell therapies over the past decade means small molecule SAR now represents a smaller fraction of pharmaceutical R&D than in 2010.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction about SAR analysis utility**: The article suggests these empirical approaches will remain valuable. This proved accurate—SAR and MMP analysis remain standard tools, though now often combined with machine learning.

• **Implicit prediction about the field staying "enjoyable and frustrating"**: This correctly anticipated that despite computational advances, drug discovery would remain challenging with many failures, which has been borne out by continued low success rates in pharmaceutical R&D.

• **Implicit prediction about the importance of understanding activity cliffs**: The focus on identifying problematic transformations correctly anticipated that this would remain a crucial aspect of medicinal chemistry optimization.

## 4. INTEREST
Score: 6

This represents solid but not exceptional interest. The article captures an important methodological moment when systematic analysis of activity cliffs was gaining traction, and the concepts remain relevant today. While not transformative, it addresses enduring challenges in drug discovery that continue to matter.
