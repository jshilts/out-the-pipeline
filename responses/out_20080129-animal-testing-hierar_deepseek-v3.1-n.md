# The Animal Testing Hierarchy (January 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article provides a practitioner's overview of the hierarchy of animal models used in preclinical drug discovery circa 2008. The author describes mice and rats as the front-line species: mice are favored for early efficacy studies due to smaller compound requirements, while rats are standard for toxicity testing. Larger animals represent progressively more serious development commitments—dogs are used for critical pharmacokinetics (PK) and two-week toxicity studies, and the author characterizes dog studies, particularly cardiovascular assessments, as a major gatekeeper with the saying "drugs kill dogs and dogs kill drugs." Monkeys are used sparingly for PK and occasional efficacy studies (e.g., osteoporosis), but monkey toxicity screens are described as extremely rare. The piece also notes operational trends, including stricter physical separation of animal facilities for both security and data quality.

## 2. HISTORY

The tiered, species-dependent preclinical pathway described in 2008 largely remained the standard for small-molecule drug development through the 2010s and into the 2020s. Regulatory frameworks (FDA, EMA) continued to require safety assessments in a rodent and a non-rodent species (typically rat and dog) before first-in-human trials. Advances in alternative methods did not eliminate these traditional in vivo studies but supplemented them: microdosing and humanized mouse models improved early candidate selection, while organ-on-a-chip and in vitro toxicity assays (e.g., hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity) enabled earlier de-risking without replacing pivotal animal toxicology. There was a notable exception for certain biologics, where non-human primates (NHPs) became the default non-rodent species because their targets often do not cross-react in dogs. Increased scrutiny around animal welfare and supply-chain constraints on NHPs (e.g., China's 2020 NHP export restrictions) raised costs and visibility but did not fundamentally change the rat–dog/NHP regulatory requirement for most systemically administered drugs. In parallel, companies invested heavily in translational biomarker strategies early in discovery to reduce the risk of late-stage tox failures, especially the cardiovascular sensitivities in dogs noted by the author.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article is observational rather than predictive, so there are no explicit forward-looking claims to evaluate. Its description of the 2008 hierarchy serves as a baseline; subsequent developments showed that the model remained robust with refinements rather than wholesale change.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**
This is a straightforward insider's tour of the animal-testing workflow circa 2008 with no major biomedical claims or forecasts. While accurate and useful contextually, it does not address breakthrough science, specific drug programs, or pivotal policy shifts, limiting its broader long-term importance.
