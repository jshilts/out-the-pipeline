# Generics Get Cheaper, As They Should (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights that generic drug prices had been decreasing over the previous several years, citing multiple studies referenced by Alex Tabarrok. The author emphasizes that this price decline for generics is the expected and proper functioning of the pharmaceutical market—patents eventually expire, allowing generic competition that drives down prices.

The piece notes widespread public confusion about the distinction between patent-protected drugs and generics, with many people unfamiliar with the patent expiration mechanism. The author contrasts pharmaceuticals with other consumer goods like electronics (where prices drop due to manufacturing improvements rather than IP expiration) and copyrighted material (where IP protection effectively never expires). The article serves as a corrective to what the author views as misplaced public concern, while acknowledging that companies like Valeant and figures like Martin Shkreli were attempting to subvert this generics pricing mechanism through questionable practices.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2016 article, generics pricing dynamics became significantly more complex than the simple downward trajectory described:

**Mixed Pricing Reality (2016-2020):** While many generics continued to decrease in price, investigations revealed that certain generic drugs saw dramatic price increases (sometimes 1000%+), particularly for older, less-competitive generics with few manufacturers. The FDA began publishing lists of drugs experiencing shortages or having only one or two manufacturers, highlighting vulnerabilities in the generics supply chain.

**Policy Responses:** The 2017 FDA Reauthorization Act included provisions to expedite generic drug approvals and improve competition. However, the problem of generic drug shortages persisted, often affecting critical medications like injectables and older antibiotics. Some hospital systems reported paying significantly more for certain generics than they had a decade earlier.

**COVID-19 Impact (2020-2022):** The pandemic exposed severe supply chain fragility in generics manufacturing, with approximately 60% of U.S. generic drug active pharmaceutical ingredients sourced from overseas (primarily India and China). Multiple drugs experienced shortages and price volatility during this period.

**Recent Developments (2022-2024):** The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included drug pricing reforms, but primarily targeted brand-name drugs rather than generics. Generic drug makers continued to face margin pressures from increased competition, leading to consolidation in the industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions identified:**

• **Generic prices will continue to decrease as expected**: This held partially true for many high-volume generics but proved too simplistic. Numerous generics experienced price spikes due to manufacturing consolidation, supply disruptions, and strategic behavior by some manufacturers.

• **Patent expiration ensures price reduction**: This remained generally accurate for drugs with robust generic competition, though the timeline and extent varied significantly. Some drugs faced delayed generic entry or "authorized generics" that maintained higher prices.

• **Valeant/Shkreli-type behavior represents an exception, not a trend**: While extreme cases remained outliers, similar strategies of acquiring older drugs and dramatically increasing prices became more common than anticipated, leading to congressional investigations and public outcry.

• **Public understanding will improve regarding generic vs. brand drugs**: Evidence suggests continued confusion persists, though awareness has increased due to media coverage of drug pricing controversies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important and ongoing issue in pharmaceutical economics, but its somewhat simplistic analysis of generics pricing and limited forward-looking perspective prevents higher ranking. The emergence of more complex generics market dynamics in subsequent years makes this piece more historically interesting than analytically prescient.
