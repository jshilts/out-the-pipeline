# Upcoming Holidays (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post by Derek Lowe announces he is taking time off for the Thanksgiving holiday and describes his traditional family Thanksgiving menu in detail. The meal features a roasted kosher turkey with various side dishes including stuffing with apples and pepperoni, mashed potatoes, creamed onions, marinated mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, green beans with ham, and Iranian "jeweled" rice with saffron and nuts. He also mentions plans to bake chocolate pecan pie and key lime pie using recipes he has previously shared on his blog, "In the Pipeline," which covers pharmaceutical industry topics at Science magazine. The post contains personal cooking anecdotes and links to his earlier pie recipes, framed as "holiday organic synthesis" and "lab preparation" in keeping with his scientific writing style.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at developments since November 2016, Derek Lowe has continued writing "In the Pipeline" as one of the most respected and widely-read blogs covering pharmaceutical research and the biotechnology industry. His blog moved from Science magazine to different platforms over the years but maintained its focus on drug discovery chemistry, clinical trial results, industry trends, and scientific commentary. The posts he referenced (chocolate pecan pie from 2010 and key lime pie from 2011) remain accessible and represent his characteristic style of applying scientific thinking to everyday topics while maintaining rigorous coverage of pharmaceutical science. Lowe has become an even more influential voice in biotech commentary, with his blog serving as essential reading for pharmaceutical industry professionals, and he continues to write detailed analyses of drug development successes and failures that have proven accurate and insightful over time.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain predictions about biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, or scientific research. It was entirely focused on personal Thanksgiving plans and holiday cooking.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 0/10**

This was a personal holiday post unrelated to biotechnology or scientific developments, making it unsuitable for analysis in the requested context of evaluating biotech industry commentary with the benefit of hindsight.
