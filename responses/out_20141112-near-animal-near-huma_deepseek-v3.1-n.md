# Near-Animal, Near-Human: The Future of Drug Testing? (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary discusses the growing recognition that animal models in drug discovery have significant limitations, particularly the failure to accurately predict human outcomes. The article quotes former NIH director Elias Zerhouni's critique that the research community has become overly reliant on questionable animal data, suggesting a need to refocus on methodologies that study human disease biology directly in humans.

The author highlights several problematic areas: inflammatory mouse models, pain research, and cancer xenografts, while noting that 90% of clinical trials fail due to poor predictive models. While human cell cultures present challenges, the article points toward two potential solutions: creating organ-like human tissues *in vitro* (organoids) or "humanizing" animal models by incorporating human tissues. The piece concludes that while animal models remain necessary as intermediate steps before human trials, the industry desperately needs better alternatives to escape the high failure rate that's constraining drug development.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade since this article's publication, significant progress occurred in developing alternatives to traditional animal models:

**Organoid Technology Advancement**: Human organoid systems matured substantially. By 2024, researchers had developed functional organoids for brain, liver, kidney, intestine, and other organs, with companies like Hubrecht Organoid Technology and STEMCELL Technologies commercializing these platforms. However, organoids still struggle to fully recapitulate aged or diseased tissue complexity.

**FDA Modernization Act 2.0 (2022)**: This landmark legislation removed the federal mandate requiring animal testing for all new drugs, explicitly allowing alternative methods including cell-based assays, organ chips, computer modeling, and other human biology-based approaches. This represented concrete policy change reflecting the article's concerns.

**Organ-on-a-Chip Growth**: The 2010s-2020s saw significant investment in microphysiological systems, with DARPA and NIH funding programs supporting development. Companies like Emulate and CN Bio commercialized human organ chips, though widespread adoption in pharmaceutical pipelines remained gradual rather than revolutionary.

**Clinical Failure Rates**: The 90% clinical trial failure rate remained stubbornly high through 2024, with estimates still in the high 80-90% range, confirming the continued relevance of the article's concerns. Success in oncology remained particularly problematic.

**Stem Cell-Derived Models**: Advances in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) enabled generation of disease-relevant human cells, but challenges persisted in creating aged or metabolically matured cells that reflect chronic disease states.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The field would move toward creating "real human organ-like tissue *in vitro*" → **Outcome**: Partially fulfilled. Organoid and organ-on-a-chip technologies advanced significantly from 2014-2024, with multiple commercial platforms available, though they still don't fully replace animal models and adoption in pharmaceutical pipelines has been slower than hoped.

• **Prediction**: "Humanizing" animal models by incorporating human tissues would emerge as an alternative approach → **Outcome**: This approach developed, particularly in immunology and cancer research with humanized mouse models, though ethical concerns limited widespread adoption.

• **Prediction**: Better alternatives could help reduce the 90% clinical trial failure rate → **Outcome**: Unfulfilled. Clinical trial failure rates remained high through 2024, suggesting that while alternatives improved, they didn't fundamentally solve the predictive validity problem at scale.

## 4. INTEREST

Score: 7

This article identified a critical bottleneck in pharmaceutical development that remained relevant a decade later, correctly anticipating policy shifts and technological directions. While it didn't fully predict the pace of adoption, it captured a significant inflection point in the move away from traditional animal models.
