# Citable Garbage (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that *Experimental and Clinical Cardiology*, previously a reputable journal, had been sold and transformed into a predatory publisher that would accept and publish nearly any submission in exchange for a $1200 fee sent to a bank account in the Turks and Caicos Islands. An Ottawa Citizen reporter, Tom Spears, tested this by submitting a gibberish cardiology paper created via find-and-replace from an HIV paper, with missing graphics and nonsensical content; it was accepted upon payment. The journal claimed affiliation with the International Academy of Cardiovascular Sciences in Winnipeg, which denied any connection, and listed non-functional contact numbers, while advertising a fast editorial process with guaranteed acceptance or rejection without additional research requests.

## 2. HISTORY

The article is part of a broader exposure of predatory publishing that continued to grow after 2014. Key developments:

- **Beall's List**, referenced in the article, remained a primary watchdog resource identifying predatory publishers and journals until it was taken down in 2017. It documented hundreds of predatory publishers exploiting the open-access model for profit.

- **COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics)** and other bodies stepped up efforts to educate researchers and institutions about predatory practices, promoting transparency, peer review standards, and ethical publishing.

- **Institutional policies** evolved to discourage or penalize publications in predatory journals. Many universities began explicitly advising against paying fees to journals on Beall's List and similar watchdogs.

- **Regulatory interventions** increased. In 2016, India's University Grants Commission (UGC) compiled a list of approved journals and flagged thousands of predatory titles, making it harder for academics to game promotions using such publications.

- **Continued proliferation** of predatory journals occurred despite crackdowns. By the mid-2010s, thousands of dubious journals operated online, charging authors fees while offering little or no editorial oversight or peer review.

- **Exposure of the *Experimental and Clinical Cardiology* scam** contributed to heightened awareness, but the problem persisted. No concrete legal action or widespread policy change appears to have stemmed directly from this specific case, though it reinforced calls for reform in academic publishing.

- **Legitimate open-access** alternatives, like PLOS or eLife, gained traction, offering rigorous peer review and transparent fees, contrasting sharply with predatory models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not explicitly state predictions about the future, but it implies several outcomes. Here is how those expectations compared to reality:

- **Predatory publishers would exploit journal reputations while credibility lasted** - This largely continued, with dozens of hijacked journals and cloned websites mimicking reputable titles. Many predatory publishers operated in legal gray zones and continued to attract submissions from unwitting or desperate researchers.

- **Authors padding c.v.s with such publications would become scam artists themselves** - This did happen widely, documented in reports showing researchers, especially in developing countries, listing predatory journal articles in tenure and promotion applications. India's UGC action highlighted this trend.

- **Institutions and funders would crack down** - Partial success. While some institutions issued guidelines and blacklists, broad enforcement remained inconsistent, and predatory publishing thrived in regions with high publication pressure and limited oversight.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article highlights a real and persistent problem in academic publishing—predatory journals exploiting researchers for profit—but offers limited broader insights into biotechnology or clinical impact, making it moderately interesting but not highly important for biotech industry analysis.
