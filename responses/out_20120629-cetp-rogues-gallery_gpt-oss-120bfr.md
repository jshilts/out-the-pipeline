# The CETP Rogues Gallery (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece lampooned the chemical structures of the five major cholesteryl‑ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor programs that were active in 2012 – Pfizer’s torcetrapib, Roche’s dalcetrapib, Merck’s anacetrapib, Eli Lilly’s evacetrapib, and a Bristol‑Myers Squibb candidate (BMS‑795311).  The author highlighted how “ugly” the molecules looked: highly hydrophobic, heavily fluorinated, and packed with aromatic rings, a direct consequence of the CETP binding pocket’s preferences.  The article questioned whether any of these chemically unwieldy agents would ever reach the market, whether their mechanisms of inhibition differed in meaningful ways, and, more fundamentally, whether CETP inhibition was a viable therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Torcetrapib (Pfizer)** – Already failed in 2006 (the ILLUMINATE trial) due to off‑target hypertension and increased mortality; the drug was abandoned long before this article.

**Dalcetrapib (Roche/Genentech)** – The dal-OUTCOMES phase‑III trial (2012) showed no reduction in cardiovascular events despite modest HDL‑C rise, leading Roche to halt development and close the dedicated CETP site.

**Anacetrapib (Merck)** – Completed the large REVEAL phase‑III trial in 2017 (≈30 000 participants).  The drug lowered LDL‑C by ~9 % and raised HDL‑C by ~30 %, translating into a modest 9 % relative reduction in major coronary events.  However, the absolute benefit was small, the drug accumulated in adipose tissue with a very long half‑life, and Merck decided not to pursue regulatory approval.  Anacetrapib is now essentially a “failed” asset, though its data remain a valuable proof‑of‑concept that CETP inhibition can modestly improve outcomes.

**Evacetrapib (Eli Lilly)** – The ACCELERATE phase‑III trial (2015) was stopped early after ~12 000 patients because the drug showed no cardiovascular benefit despite large HDL‑C increases and LDL‑C reductions.  Development was terminated.

**BMS‑795311 (Bristol‑Myers Squibb)** – The BMS CETP program was discontinued around 2013–2014 after pre‑clinical and early‑clinical data failed to demonstrate a clear advantage; no phase‑III trial ever materialized.

**Overall impact** – By the early 2020s, CETP inhibition was largely abandoned as a commercial strategy.  The modest efficacy of anacetrapib, combined with safety/tissue‑accumulation concerns, convinced the major pharma players to shift resources to other lipid‑lowering modalities (PCSK9 antibodies/inhibitors, inclisiran, bempedoic acid, and next‑generation statins).  No CETP inhibitor has received FDA or EMA approval to date, and none are in late‑stage development as of 2024.

**Scientific legacy** – The CETP saga clarified that simply raising HDL‑C is insufficient for cardiovascular protection; the modest benefit seen with anacetrapib is now attributed mainly to LDL‑C lowering rather than HDL‑C effects.  The extensive structural data generated for CETP inhibitors have been repurposed for basic studies of lipid transport and for designing selective CETP probes, but they have not led to a new class of marketed drugs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** “Will any of these fancy fluorocarbon nanoparticles make it through to the market … ?”  
  **Outcome:** None reached the market.  All programs were terminated (torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, evacetrapib, BMS‑795311) and anacetrapib was not pursued despite a positive trial.

- **Prediction in the article:** “Is inhibiting CETP even a good idea … ?”  
  **Outcome:** The REVEAL trial showed a modest (~9 %) reduction in events, confirming that CETP inhibition can confer benefit, but the effect size and safety/tissue‑accumulation issues made it unattractive compared with existing therapies.  The consensus today is that CETP inhibition is not a high‑priority therapeutic avenue.

- **Implicit prediction:** “Money is being spent … to find out.”  
  **Outcome:** Billions of dollars were indeed invested (≈ $2–3 bn across programs).  The investment yielded valuable negative data and a single modestly positive trial, but no commercial product.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The article is a memorable snapshot of a high‑profile, chemistry‑focused controversy that ultimately reshaped lipid‑drug development strategies; its humor and structural commentary make it engaging, though the scientific conclusions proved largely prescient.
