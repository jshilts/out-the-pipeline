# Quenching NMRs, Accidentally and On Purpose (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses emergency quench circuits in NMR/MRI superconducting magnets following an accident in India where an oxygen tank was brought into an MRI room, pinning two people to the machine. Because the emergency quench circuit was deactivated, it took hours to kill the magnet. GE subsequently issued instructions (FDA document 132519) for checking that quench circuits are operational on all installed machines.

The author explains that superconducting magnets require liquid helium cooling and can maintain electric current indefinitely—until they warm up. A "quench" occurs when part of the magnet loses superconductivity, causing rapid heating that propagates through surrounding regions, resulting in a loud noise and expensive helium gas release. Emergency quench circuits use heaters to deliberately shut down the magnet for safety. The article also notes rising helium costs due to limited suppliers, making helium-recycling devices economically viable.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments show continued emphasis on MRI safety and helium supply challenges. MRI safety protocols have become more rigorous, with improved training requirements and stricter access controls in clinical settings. The helium market has remained volatile, with ongoing supply constraints driving prices higher and accelerating adoption of helium-recycling systems in both research and clinical facilities.

However, without confidence in specific FDA regulatory changes, drug approvals, or detailed helium price trajectories, I cannot provide concrete details about whether additional regulatory mandates followed GE's 2015 safety check request, whether specific helium costs reached particular levels, or whether helium recycling achieved stated market adoption rates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains these predictions and observations:
- **Engineering safety improvements**: GE's system-wide quench circuit verification would establish legal/liability precedent
  - *Outcome*: Without access to specific litigation records or regulatory changes, I cannot confidently evaluate this prediction's accuracy.
- **Helium price trajectory**: Article noted ongoing price increases with large fluctuations due to limited suppliers
  - *Outcome*: Inability to access market data prevents confident assessment of whether prices continued rising or whether helium-recycling adoption reached predicted levels.
- **Helium recycling economics**: Devices would "pay for themselves pretty handily" as costs remained elevated
  - *Outcome*: Cannot evaluate without sector-wide adoption statistics or ROI analyses.
- **New helium field discovery**: Economic viability of recycling would change "unless someone stumbles on another big helium-rich natural gas field"
  - *Outcome*: Lacks confidence about whether significant new helium reserves were discovered post-2015.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses a narrow technical safety issue with limited scope for broad scientific or medical significance, though it does touch on helium supply constraints relevant to multiple scientific fields.
