# Hexacyclinol: A Forensic Case (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a scientific controversy surrounding hexacyclinol, a complex natural product. In 2006, James La Clair published what purported to be a synthesis of hexacyclinol in the prestigious journal *Angewandte Chemie*, but the paper immediately drew criticism from readers who questioned the spectral data and experimental details, as well as the quality of peer review.

The controversy deepened when synthetic organic chemist Scott Rychnovsky suggested that the structure of the natural product itself had been misassigned from the start. Rychnovsky and John Porco's group then published a synthesis of the proposed correct structure, supported by X-ray crystallography and matching NMR spectra of the original natural product. Despite this, arguments persisted about what La Clair had actually synthesized, with La Clair suggesting he and Rychnovsky had made different molecules with coincidentally similar NMR spectra.

The article discusses a new 2009 paper by Saielli and Bagno that performed computational NMR analyses on both proposed structures and concluded unequivocally that Rychnovsky's structure (2) was correct and that La Clair's proposed synthesis couldn't possibly produce the real hexacyclinol molecule. The author characterizes the remaining questions as psychological rather than chemical—wondering whether La Clair's work represented fraud, self-deception, or scientific fiction.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2009 article, the hexacyclinol scientific community largely accepted the corrected structure assignment proposed by Rychnovsky and confirmed by computational studies. The controversy became a well-known case study in natural product chemistry and a cautionary tale about the importance of rigorous structure elucidation and synthesis verification.

The La Clair paper in *Angewandte Chemie* (2006) remained a subject of ongoing discussion and appears to have been largely discredited by the accumulating evidence that both the structure assignment and the synthesis claims were incorrect. While the journal itself did not issue a formal retraction of La Clair's paper, the scientific consensus definitively shifted to the Rychnovsky/Porco structure assignment.

However, hexacyclinol itself did not emerge as a drug candidate or lead compound that achieved clinical significance. Despite all the attention around the structure controversy, the molecule does not appear to have been developed into approved drugs or entered clinical trials. The compound's scientific importance remained confined to academic discussions about molecular structure determination and total synthesis methodology rather than therapeutic applications.

The case served as an influential example in discussions of scientific integrity and the peer-review process, particularly highlighting the need for robust validation of complex natural product syntheses. It also reinforced the critical role of X-ray crystallography and computational chemistry in definitively resolving molecular structures when other spectroscopic methods yield ambiguous results.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not contain any explicit predictions about the future. Its focus was retrospective analysis of a scientific controversy that was ongoing from 2006-2009.

However, by asking whether the work represented "a hoax? An odd and pointless work of fiction? Self-deception?" and stating "we'll probably never know," the author did implicitly suggest uncertainty about how the controversy would ultimately be resolved or what explanations would emerge.

In this sense, while there were no direct predictions to evaluate against future outcomes, the case did end up serving as an important cautionary example about scientific verification processes, and the questions it raised about peer review and research integrity remained relevant in chemistry and beyond.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While this was a fascinating scientific detective story within chemistry circles, its broader impact and long-term importance were quite limited. The controversy involved complex technical details not broadly accessible outside natural product chemistry, and the compound itself did not become medically or commercially significant.
