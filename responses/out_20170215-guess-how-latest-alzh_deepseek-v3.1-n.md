# Guess How This Latest Alzheimer's Trial Came Out (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that Merck halted its Phase III trial of verubecestat, a beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitor, for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease due to futility. Despite verubecestat being a technically impressive drug that effectively reduced amyloid concentrations in the brain, the trial showed no clinical efficacy. The author questions the amyloid hypothesis, noting that multiple approaches targeting amyloid—including beta-secretase inhibitors, gamma-secretase inhibitors, and anti-amyloid antibodies—had all failed in clinical trials. The article also mentions Merck had another ongoing trial in earlier-stage patients but expresses skepticism about its prospects, arguing that the fundamental understanding of Alzheimer's disease may be flawed.

## 2. HISTORY

**BACE Inhibitor Failures:** Merck's second verubecestat trial (APECS, in prodromal patients) was terminated in February 2018 for futility. Subsequent BACE inhibitors from other companies also failed: Eli Lilly's lanabecestat trials were stopped in 2018; AstraZeneca/Eli Lilly's AZD3293 program was discontinued; Janssen's atabecestat trials were halted due to liver toxicity; Novartis/Amgen's BACE inhibitor trials failed; and Biogen/Eisai's elenbecestat trials were terminated in 2019. This represented a nearly complete clinical failure of the BACE inhibitor class.

**Amyloid Hypothesis Persistence:** Despite these failures, the amyloid hypothesis continued to drive drug development. Biogen's aducanumab received controversial FDA approval in 2021 under the accelerated approval pathway, despite mixed clinical trial results and strong opposition from the FDA's advisory committee. The approval was based on biomarker data (reduction in amyloid plaques) rather than clear clinical benefit. The drug has faced significant uptake challenges due to uncertainty about efficacy, high cost, and safety concerns.

**Recent Developments:** In 2023, lecanemab (Biogen/Eisai) received FDA approval with modest clinical benefit - showing a 27% slowing of cognitive decline over 18 months compared to placebo in patients with early Alzheimer's. Results were statistically significant but clinically modest (0.45 point difference on an 18-point cognitive scale). This renewed debate about whether targeting amyloid provides meaningful patient benefit versus the hypothesis being fundamentally flawed. The therapy carries risks of brain swelling and bleeding.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** Merck's second trial in prodromal patients "I'm not expecting much out of" because the amyloid focus "is in very serious doubt."
  - **Outcome:** Correct. Merck terminated the second trial in February 2018 for futility.

• **Prediction:** Implicit skepticism that better drugs targeting the same pathway would succeed despite being "better and better attempts"
  - **Outcome:** Highly accurate. Multiple subsequent BACE inhibitors from major pharma companies all failed in trials through 2019.

• **Prediction:** Implicit suggestion that the fundamental understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis might be wrong
  - **Outcome:** Partially validated. Even drugs showing amyloid reduction have produced only modest clinical effects, supporting that amyloid alone may not be the full story. The field has increasingly recognized that amyloid may be necessary but not sufficient, or that timing of intervention may be crucial.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article correctly anticipated the failure of the entire BACE inhibitor class and highlighted fundamental issues with the amyloid hypothesis that remain unresolved, making it remarkably prescient about a critical period in Alzheimer's drug development.
