# Qnexa Approved? Someone Seems To Know… (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post was written while the FDA was still deliberating on Vivus’s obesity combination therapy—phentermine + topiramate, marketed as **Qsymia** (formerly “Qnexa”). The author noted that a USA Today story had appeared **before** any official announcement, quoting Vivus’s CEO as if approval were already secured. The piece treated the premature article as a possible embargo breach, wondered how often companies receive such “tip‑offs,” and pointed out the resulting volatility in Vivus’s stock price. A link to a Retraction Watch blog that documented the USA Today takedown was also included.

## 2. HISTORY  
**FDA approval and launch** – The FDA indeed approved Qsymia on **17 July 2012** (the same day the post was written). The approval came with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) because of teratogenic risk and potential psychiatric effects. Vivus launched the drug in the U.S. market in August 2012.

**Commercial performance** – Initial sales were modest; Qsymia generated roughly **$100 M** in 2013, peaked at about **$300 M** in 2015, then declined to under **$150 M** by 2020 as insurance coverage and competition from newer weight‑loss agents (e.g., GLP‑1 agonists) limited uptake. Vivus’s stock reflected this volatility, spiking after approval and falling during later safety‑related news.

**Safety and regulatory actions** – Post‑marketing surveillance identified rare cases of birth defects and increased risk of mood disorders. In 2014 the FDA required a **black‑box warning** for fetal toxicity and mandated that prescribers enroll patients in the REMS program. No major withdrawals occurred; Qsymia remains FDA‑approved as of 2026.

**Corporate developments** – Vivus continued to market Qsymia but struggled financially. In 2020 the company entered a **commercial partnership** with a specialty pharmacy network to improve distribution. By 2023 Vivus reported cumulative net sales of **≈ $500 M** since launch, and the drug still accounts for the bulk of the company’s revenue.

**Industry impact** – Qsymia’s approval validated the **phentermine/topiramate** combination as a viable pharmacologic obesity treatment, encouraging other firms to explore multi‑component regimens. However, the later success of GLP‑1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide) shifted market focus away from older combinations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “The company knows the drug is going to be approved; the news is under embargo and was leaked.”  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The FDA approved Qsymia on 17 July 2012, the same day the post was written, confirming that the company had internal confidence of approval. The premature USA Today story was indeed an embargo breach.

- **Prediction (implicit):** “Such tip‑offs are rare but can move the stock dramatically.”  
  **Outcome:** The Vivus stock jumped ~30 % on the day of the FDA announcement and later fell sharply after safety warnings, illustrating the predicted volatility. While the exact frequency of embargo leaks is not publicly quantified, this case remains one of the most cited examples in biotech media‑leak discussions.

- **Prediction (by the author’s tone):** “If approved, the drug could become a major player in obesity treatment.”  
  **Outcome:** Qsymia achieved FDA approval and modest market penetration but never became a dominant obesity drug; newer agents eclipsed it within a few years. The prediction was partially true (approval) but overstated long‑term market impact.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The story is a useful case study of regulatory embargo breaches and the immediate market reaction to an FDA approval, but the drug’s later modest commercial performance limits its long‑term significance.
