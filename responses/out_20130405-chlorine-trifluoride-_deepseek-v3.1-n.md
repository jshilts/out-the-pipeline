# Chlorine Trifluoride: Some Empirical Findings (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article references the author's earlier popular post "Sand Won't Save You This Time" about the extreme reactivity and danger of chlorine trifluoride (ClF3). The substance is described as so hazardous that it remains on the author's "Things I Won't Work With" list. While noting that chemist Shloro Rozen has published research using this compound, the author maintains their refusal to work with it. The article primarily serves to share a demonstration video allegedly made by "French lunatics" showing ClF3 reacting violently with common laboratory materials including Plexiglas, rubber gloves, leather, gas masks, wood, and wet gloves—items that would normally serve as protective equipment but are completely inadequate against this chemical.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2013 article catalogs rather than predicts—it's documenting an already-known material's properties for outreach. Chlorine trifluoride had been recognized for decades prior as exceptionally hazardous due to its extreme oxidizing power. Academic research continued after 2013 within highly specialized, safety-intensive contexts for niche synthetic applications.

In practical terms, ClF3 remains restricted to controlled industrial and research settings where its reactivity can be harnessed safely. Real-world applications include semiconductor manufacturing (chamber cleaning) and specialized fluorination chemistry, where its ability to react with nearly any material is professionally managed rather than casually demonstrated. Wider adoption in routine laboratory work did not materialize—the article's cautionary stance reflects ongoing practice in the broader chemistry community.

The article reinforced established chemical safety knowledge through dramatic demonstration rather than catalyzing new developments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contains no explicit predictions about future developments. It is primarily descriptive and cautionary in nature, documenting the known properties and hazards of chlorine trifluoride through empirical demonstration. No forecasts about medical applications, industrial adoption rates, policy changes, or scientific breakthroughs are presented.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
The article serves as a dramatic chemical safety demonstration with entertainment value for chemistry enthusiasts, but it lacks broader scientific, medical, or policy implications that would elevate its long-term importance.
