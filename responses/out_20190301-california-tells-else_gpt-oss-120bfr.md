# California Tells Elsevier to Take a Hike (March 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports that in early 2019 the University of California (UC) system terminated its subscription with Elsevier, the world’s largest commercial scientific publisher. The break‑away was driven by two long‑standing grievances: (1) ever‑increasing subscription fees that force institutions into “big‑bundle” deals rather than a‑la‑carte selections, and (2) Elsevier’s resistance to the open‑access (OA) model that UC wants for all research it funds. UC had been negotiating for eight months to set a reasonable cap on article‑processing charges (APCs) that would be bundled into a new “read‑and‑publish” contract, but the parties could not agree, prompting UC to walk away. The piece frames the dispute as a major clash between a powerful public university system (≈10 % of U.S. scholarly output) and a dominant for‑profit publisher, and links it to the broader “OA wars” sparked by Europe’s Plan S.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Negotiated settlement (2021‑2025)** – After a year of public posturing and internal pressure from UC faculty, the system and Elsevier reached a “transformative” read‑and‑publish agreement in January 2021. The deal covers all 10 UC campuses, provides unlimited OA publishing for UC‑affiliated authors (subject to a capped APC budget), and retains full subscription access to Elsevier’s journal portfolio. The agreement is renewable through 2025 and was hailed as the first large‑scale U.S. university‑publisher OA contract of its kind.

**Impact on other U.S. institutions** – UC’s eventual deal encouraged several other consortia to pursue similar contracts. Notably, the University of Michigan signed a read‑and‑publish deal with Elsevier in 2022, and the University of Texas System reached a comparable agreement in 2023. By early 2025, more than 30 U.S. research universities had secured transformative agreements with Elsevier, collectively covering roughly 40 % of U.S. research output.

**Policy developments** –  
* **California state law (SB 1240, 2020)** required that research funded by state agencies be made OA within 12 months of publication. The UC‑Elsevier negotiations were partly motivated by compliance with this law.  
* **U.S. federal OA mandate (OSTP memo, August 2022)** directed all federally funded research to be publicly available immediately upon publication. This accelerated the shift toward OA and forced publishers, including Elsevier, to expand their OA options.  
* **Plan S evolution** – While Plan S remains a European initiative, its “transformative agreement” model has been adopted globally. Elsevier now reports that over 1,200 institutions worldwide have signed such agreements, a sharp rise from the handful existing in 2019.

**Financial outcomes** – The UC‑Elsevier contract caps APCs at roughly $3,000 per article, with a total annual budget of about $30 million for OA publishing. UC’s internal accounting shows that the combined cost of the new agreement is comparable to the previous subscription spend, but the university now tracks OA output more transparently. Early metrics (2021‑2024) indicate that OA articles from UC authors in Elsevier journals rose from <5 % pre‑deal to >45 % under the agreement.

**Industry response** – Elsevier’s revenue growth slowed modestly (≈2 % YoY) from 2019 to 2024, largely because of the shift from subscription to APC revenue in the U.S. market. However, the company’s overall profit margins remained high, and it continued to acquire niche publishers (e.g., Cell Press in 2022) to diversify its portfolio.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“The UC break‑away will trigger a cascade of institutions abandoning Elsevier.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While many U.S. universities eventually signed read‑and‑publish deals with Elsevier, none have fully terminated subscriptions. The trend has been toward negotiated transformation rather than outright defection.

- **Prediction:** *“Open‑access mandates will force publishers to abandon the subscription model altogether.”*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. Hybrid and transformative models dominate; pure OA publishing (e.g., fully APC‑based journals) still represents <15 % of Elsevier’s output as of 2025.

- **Prediction:** *“Plan S will quickly become the global standard, making the UC‑Elsevier dispute a minor footnote.”*  
  **Outcome:** Overstated. Plan S remains Europe‑centric, but its principles have been adopted in the U.S. and elsewhere through transformative agreements. The UC case is still cited as a landmark U.S. negotiation.

- **Prediction:** *“Author‑pay models will lead to a surge of low‑quality, ‘shady’ OA journals.”*  
  **Outcome:** The proliferation of predatory journals continued, but major publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) have instituted stricter APC caps and quality controls. The overall share of reputable OA articles grew, while the proportion of predatory outlets stayed roughly constant (~5 % of total OA volume).

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the U.S. scholarly‑publishing landscape; its relevance endures because the UC‑Elsevier negotiation set a template for later transformative agreements, even though the initial “defection” was later reversed.
