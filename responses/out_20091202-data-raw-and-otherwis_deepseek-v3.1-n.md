# Data, Raw and Otherwise (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses what scientists mean by "raw data" through a personal example of a reaction screen analyzed by LC/MS. The author ran 12 different reaction conditions in triplicate, expecting either no reaction or the same product. An LC/MS instrument measured peak areas corresponding to the product, which were then converted to concentrations using a standard curve. The author performed several data refinement steps: checking peak integration, applying the standard curve, correcting for detector drift over time using repeated standard injections, and averaging triplicate runs. The final presentation showed bar charts with error bars, but the full data package preserved all intermediate steps and calculations.

The piece argues that "raw data" exists in layers of refinement—from the detector's raw signal readings (rarely examined), to peak areas, to concentration calculations, to drift-corrected values, and finally to averaged replicates. It emphasizes meticulous labeling and archiving of each refinement step so others can trace conclusions back to the original machine output, while noting that presenting fully "raw" detector traces would be impractical and unhelpful. The article illustrates that what scientists call "raw data" is often already processed, but the key is transparency about how it was processed.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article's publication, the concept of "raw data" and data transparency evolved significantly in scientific research:

**Data Standards and Reproducibility (2010s-present):** The decade after this article saw growing concerns about research reproducibility across science. High-profile replication failures led funding agencies and journals to mandate more stringent data sharing requirements. By the mid-2010s, major journals increasingly required authors to deposit "raw data" in public repositories.

**FAIR Data Principles (2016):** The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) were formally introduced in 2016, pushing for research data to be curated with sufficient metadata that others can understand and reuse it. The author's practice of carefully labeling each processing step aligns with what would later become FAIR guidelines.

**Computational Methods in Chemistry:** LC/MS instrumentation advanced significantly post-2009 with improved detector sensitivity, faster sampling rates, and more sophisticated software. By the 2020s, many analytical workflows incorporated automated peak detection, quality control flags for detector drift, and built-in recalibration. However, the fundamental challenge the author described—interpreting what "raw" means across processing layers—persisted.

**Open Science Movement:** Initiatives like the Center for Open Science (founded 2013) and government policies (NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy implemented 2003, updated 2020) increasingly required researchers to preserve and share primary research data. The distinction between what the author called "raw raw data" (detector response curves) and "processed data" became institutionalized in many data management plans.

**No direct link to drug approvals or clinical outcomes**—the article addressed a methodological practice issue rather than a specific therapeutic area or experimental result. The impact was primarily on research data management culture and practices within analytical chemistry and pharmaceutical research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was primarily explanatory rather than predictive, focusing on defining "raw data" rather than forecasting future developments. Some implicit assumptions remained relevant:

- **That instruments will continue producing layered data requiring interpretation** - **Accurate.** Modern LC/MS and other analytical instruments still produce data at multiple levels of processing, and the question of which level constitutes "raw data" remains current.

- **That good data management practices (labeling, archiving all processing steps) will remain important** - **Accurate.** These practices became codified in institutional data management policies and FAIR principles.

- **That detector drift and reproducibility concerns will persist** - **Accurate.** These remain routine quality control challenges in analytical chemistry, though modern instruments have improved automated compensation.

No bold predictions about specific technological futures, drug development outcomes, or policy changes were made in the article.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses a perennial methodological issue in analytical chemistry with competent technical writing but has limited long-term importance or broad impact. While the topic of research data handling gained policy significance later, this piece is primarily a technical tutorial rather than a forward-looking commentary with major implications for biotechnology or science policy. It serves as a useful snapshot of best practices circa 2009 but doesn't illuminate broader trends or developments in the field.
