# How Drug Companies Keep Medicine Out of Reach (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This Atlantic article by Brian Till examined proposals for reforming drug development, particularly for neglected tropical diseases. The central focus was on a contested WHO treaty that would commit signatory states to spend 0.01% of GDP on neglected diseases, though the treaty remained undefined at the time of writing. 

The article explored the concept of "delinking" R&D from drug sales through a prize-based model, where discoveries would be rewarded with predetermined payments rather than patent exclusivity and market pricing. This approach was contrasted with the traditional pharmaceutical business model where companies price drugs at "what the market will bear" and reinvest approximately 16 cents per revenue dollar into R&D—a figure the original article criticized as insufficient but which industry defenders argued was high by industrial standards.

The piece also discussed open-source drug discovery efforts like Matt Todd's malaria research at Sydney University, while acknowledging the tension between prize-based competition and collaborative research models. Derek Lowe, a chemist and industry commentator, was quoted extensively, expressing cautious support for prize models specifically for neglected diseases (where market failures exist) but concern about extending such models to all drug development.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, several relevant developments occurred in neglected disease research and drug pricing debates:

**Neglected Disease Funding and R&D Models:**
- **No major WHO treaty** materialized as proposed in the article. The 0.01% GDP commitment framework for neglected diseases did not gain widespread adoption.
- **Alternative funding mechanisms** evolved instead, including public-private partnerships like the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), Gavi, and expanded PEPFAR funding.
- **Open-source drug discovery** efforts continued but remained niche, with most pharmaceutical research maintaining traditional IP protection models.

**Drug Pricing Evolution:**
- **Industry R&D spending** continued at similar or higher levels than the "16 cents per dollar" cited in 2013. Pharmaceutical industry R&D expenditures remained among the highest across all sectors.
- **High-profile pricing controversies** intensified, particularly around specialty drugs, hepatitis C treatments, and insulin, leading to congressional hearings and policy debates.
- **Pay-for-delay** and patent evergreening practices faced increased regulatory scrutiny in both the US and Europe.

**Market and Policy Responses:**
- The Affordable Care Act's implementation in the US changed healthcare access dynamics.
- **Drug price transparency laws** emerged in various states and countries.
- **Value-based pricing** discussions gained traction, though implementation remained limited.
- The **orphan drug market** expanded significantly, with companies finding profitable niches in rare diseases—an alternative to the prize model.

**Tropical Disease Progress:**
- Ebola vaccine development (rVSV-ZEBOV) succeeded through unconventional partnerships.
- Malaria elimination efforts continued with existing tools rather than breakthrough vaccines or drugs.
- Dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) faced significant setbacks, showing continued challenges in tropical disease R&D.

The prize model specifically advocated in the article did not see widespread adoption as a primary R&D funding mechanism, though smaller prize competitions continued in targeted areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions from the article:**
• **WHO treaty with 0.01% GDP commitment for neglected diseases** - This did not materialize as envisioned.

• **Prize-based R&D replacing patent exclusivity** - Failed to gain significant traction beyond niche applications.

• **Extension of prize models to all diseases** (industry's fear) - Did not happen; traditional patent and market models remained dominant.

• **Open-source collaboration replacing competitive R&D** - Remained limited to specific academic initiatives without displacing commercial research models.

• **Implicit prediction that neglected disease R&D would remain inadequate without major reform** - Partially accurate: while some progress occurred through existing mechanisms, tropical diseases still receive disproportionately low R&D investment compared to their global burden.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured important tensions in pharmaceutical R&D models and raised legitimate questions about neglected diseases, but its specific policy proposals didn't materialize. It remains moderately interesting as a case study in reform debates that ultimately took different paths than predicted, with market and regulatory evolution rather than radical structural change dominating subsequent developments.
