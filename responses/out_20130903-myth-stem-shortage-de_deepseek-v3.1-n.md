# The Myth of the STEM Shortage, In Detail (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary challenges the widely-promoted narrative that the U.S. faces a critical shortage of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workers. The author argues that market indicators contradict this claim: stagnant wages in computing/IT over the previous decade, slower salary growth for engineers compared to non-STEM fields, and uncompetitive wages for PhD holders in science and mathematics. The article cites multiple studies from Duke University, RIT, the Sloan Foundation, and Rand Corporation dating back to 2004, all finding no evidence of shortages. The author suggests that the perpetual "shortage" narrative benefits both corporations (by creating an oversupply that suppresses wages) and educational institutions (by securing funding), mentioning that similar shortage alarms have been sounded since the 1930s.

## 2. HISTORY
The years following this 2013 article reveal a complex and bifurcated STEM labor market that largely validates the article's skeptical position, while also showing important exceptions tied to specific technology waves.

**Wage stagnation persisted broadly**: From 2013-2019, particularly for mid-career STEM roles, wage growth remained modest across many traditional engineering disciplines and life sciences. The Economic Policy Institute continued reporting flat or declining real wages for many IT workers through much of the 2010s.

**The AI/ML exception emerged (2017-2024)**: Demand for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and AI researchers saw dramatic salary increases, with entry-level positions often exceeding $150,000-$200,000 at major tech companies. However, this represented a narrow subset of STEM fields rather than broad-based demand.

**PhD crisis deepened**: The academic job market worsened significantly post-2013, with tenure-track positions becoming increasingly scarce across most scientific fields. Postdoc positions remained low-paying ($40,000-$55,000 typically), validating the article's assessment about PhD wage competitiveness.

**Immigration policy reflected these dynamics**: The H-1B visa program continued generating controversy, with tech companies arguing for expansion while critics pointed to wage suppression effects. Major technology firms faced lawsuits and investigations over alleged collusion to suppress engineer wages during the early 2010s.

**Industry consolidation accelerated**: The article's observation about companies preferring oversupply proved prescient. Major tech platforms (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) continued to hire aggressively while maintaining salary structures that concentrated very high compensation among relatively small segments of their workforce.

**COVID-19 pandemic impact (2020-2021)**: Temporarily boosted demand for certain tech roles, but by 2022-2023, major tech companies conducted large-scale layoffs affecting tens of thousands of STEM workers, suggesting labor surplus rather than shortage.

**Geographic concentration intensified**: High-paying STEM jobs became increasingly concentrated in a few metro areas (San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Boston, New York), while other regions saw less robust STEM employment growth.

The fundamental market structure described in the 2013 article largely persisted: a bifurcated labor market with intense competition for a small number of highly compensated roles, while broader STEM employment showed characteristics consistent with adequate or surplus supply.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, but instead presented a structural analysis of why the "STEM shortage" narrative persists. Several implied continuations of existing trends can be evaluated:

- **That wage stagnation would continue**: This largely proved accurate through 2019 across most STEM fields except artificial intelligence/machine learning roles.
- **That the cyclical shortage narrative would persist**: Correct—calls for more STEM graduates and expanded skilled immigration continued throughout the 2010s and beyond.
- **That corporate interests would continue promoting shortage narratives**: Validated by continued industry lobbying for H-1B expansion and STEM education funding.
- **That PhD career prospects would remain challenging**: Confirmed by continued academic job market deterioration and modest compensation for most PhD-level research positions outside of elite tech companies.

The article's broader analytical framework—that considering labor supply in STEM requires examining actual wage signals rather than public relations narratives—remained relevant and underappreciated throughout the subsequent decade.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
The article identified a durable and important economic misconception with significant policy implications, using clear empirical evidence (wage data) that remained relevant for years afterward and predicted broader labor market dynamics that emerged more clearly by the 2020s.
