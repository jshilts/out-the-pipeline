# Stapled Peptides Take a Torpedo (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes "stapled peptides" - small helical proteins whose helices are stabilized via artificial molecular bridges between loops, aiming to create molecules that retain the binding properties of the original protein while gaining the pharmacokinetic advantages of small molecules (better absorption, distribution, and metabolism, potentially enabling oral dosing). The piece contrasts the field's initial promise with a then-new paper from Australian researchers and Genentech that challenged these claims. That study found that stapled BH3 peptides (BimSAHB) showed lower binding affinity, slower on-rates, faster off-rates, and lacked the expected cell permeability, with the staple apparently disrupting important interactions - contradicting earlier reports about the same peptide system. The author notes the discrepancy especially given Roche's business partnership with Aileron (a company focused on stapled peptides) while this critical paper came partly from Genentech, now part of Roche.

## 2. HISTORY
The years following the 2012 article saw mixed but ultimately modest real-world development for stapled peptides:

**Clinical Development**: Aileron's lead stapled peptide candidate, ALRN-6924, progressed furthest. It targets MDM2/MDMX and completed multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials investigating it in various cancers including AML, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and as a chemoprotection agent against chemotherapy-induced side effects. However, development slowed with no FDA approvals as of 2024.

**Regulatory Status**: No stapled peptide drugs received FDA approval as therapeutics between 2012-2024. While several entered clinical trials, none achieved widespread clinical adoption or commercial success.

**Scientific Adoption**: The basic research on stapled peptides continued, with publications exploring their use as research tools and investigating the structural and mechanistic questions raised in the 2012 controversy. However, the technology did not become broadly adopted across the pharmaceutical industry for drug development pipelines.

**Business Outcomes**: Aileron (founded 2005) went public in 2017 but faced financial challenges. The company restructured and shifted its strategy several times, eventually focusing ALRN-6924 on specific niche applications like chemoprotection. The field did not spawn the wave of successful companies or partnerships that early enthusiasm suggested.

The critical concerns raised in the 2012 Genentech paper - issues with binding affinity, unexpected effects of the staple chemistry, and questions about cell permeability - continued to be reported and discussed in subsequent literature, suggesting the initial technical challenges were substantial and persistent.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original article did not make explicit predictions about the future of stapled peptides, but described expectations and challenges in the field:

- **Implicit expectation**: That resolving discrepancies between conflicting reports would be important, and "watching the dust settle will be interesting" ✓ - This proved accurate as the field continued generating debate and mixed results
- **Intended goal of technology**: Oral dosing of stabilized peptides would bridge the gap between protein drugs and small molecules ✗ - No stapled peptide achieved practical oral dosing with clinical success
- **Business confidence indicator**: Roche's partnership with Aileron suggested commercial viability ✗ - Despite partnerships, no products reached market success
- **Technical assumption**: Stabilizing helices would automatically improve properties ✗ - The complexity shown in the 2012 paper proved representative of broader challenges

## 4. INTEREST
Interest score: **3/9**

This represents a typical case where intriguing early-stage technology encountered serious real-world validation challenges. While the concept held promise, the subsequent decade showed limited translation to clinical or commercial success, with continued fundamental questions about the approach.
