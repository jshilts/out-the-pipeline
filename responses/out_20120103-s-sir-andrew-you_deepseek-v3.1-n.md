# That's Sir Andrew to You (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2012 blog post reported that Andrew Witty, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), received a knighthood in the UK's New Year's Honours list. The author made a pun referencing GSK's $720 million acquisition of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals in 2008, suggesting the knighthood "put the 'Sir' in 'Sirtris acquisition'." The post provides minimal context but is clearly commenting on the apparent recognition of Witty's leadership, particularly given GSK's major investment in sirtuin research through the Sirtris acquisition.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Sirtris aftermath (2008-2015):** GSK acquired Sirtris in 2008 for $720 million based on promising early research into sirtuins (particularly SIRT1) and resveratrol as potential anti-aging and metabolic disease targets. However, subsequent research revealed significant problems:

- Many key findings about resveratrol's effects on sirtuins could not be replicated
- Clinical trials failed to demonstrate efficacy for the company's pipeline drugs
- GSK shut down Sirtris as an independent unit in 2013 and substantially wrote down the value of the acquisition
- SRT501 (the lead resveratrol formulation) was abandoned after Phase II trials showed no benefit and potential kidney toxicity

**Andrew Witty's tenure (2008-2017):** Witty served as GSK CEO from 2008 until his retirement in 2017. During this period:
- He faced criticism for the failed Sirtris investment and pipeline problems
- GSK paid a $3 billion fine in 2012 for healthcare fraud (unrelated to Sirtris but reflecting broader company challenges)
- The company faced declining revenue from key drugs losing patent protection
- Despite these setbacks, Witty maintained his knighthood and went on to serve in other prominent roles, including joining the board of Amazon in 2018

**Sirtuin research impact:** While Sirtris as a drug development venture failed, basic research into sirtuins continued. Scientists still study these proteins and their role in aging and metabolism, but the therapeutic excitement of the late 2000s has considerably cooled.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself made no explicit predictions about the future. It was a brief commentary on contemporary news about Witty's knighthood rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the post has some historical interest due to its timing relative to the Sirtris failure becoming apparent, its brevity and lack of substantive content limit its value for understanding the biotechnology developments it references.
