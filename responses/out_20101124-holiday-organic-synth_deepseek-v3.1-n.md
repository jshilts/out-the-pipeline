# Holiday Organic Synthesis: Chocolate Pecan Pie (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article presents a detailed recipe for chocolate pecan pie using the format and terminology of organic synthesis procedures. The author frames holiday baking as "organic synthesis" with precise measurements, alternative reagents for international readers, and laboratory-style notes about the product's properties. The recipe calls for chocolate, butter, corn syrup, sugar, eggs, vanilla, and pecans baked in a pie shell, with the author recommending generous amounts of pecans to achieve proper texture. The article includes conversion notes for non-US ingredients and a humorous safety warning about the dessert's energy density.

## 2. HISTORY
As this is a cooking recipe rather than scientific content, no empirical developments or commercial outcomes followed its publication. The article achieved its intended purpose: it continues to function as an accessible holiday baking reference. There have been no FDA approvals, clinical trials, policy changes, or business developments related to this content, as it was purely instructional cooking material. The recipe remains available for readers seeking chocolate pecan pie instructions, with no subsequent scientific or regulatory events to document.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No predictions were included in this recipe article. The content focuses entirely on cooking instructions and ingredient specifications rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

The recipe is competently written and accessible, with useful ingredient alternatives and clear instructions, but it lacks the novelty and broader impact that would justify a higher interest score.
