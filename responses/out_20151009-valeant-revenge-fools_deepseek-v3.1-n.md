# Valeant: Revenge of the Fools (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model, which the author characterizes as fundamentally parasitic and focused on financial engineering rather than genuine pharmaceutical innovation. Unlike Martin Shkreli (who at least paid "lip service" to R&D), Valeant openly embraced the philosophy that "R&D is for losers and fools." The company's strategy involved acquiring other drug companies, slashing R&D spending (to just 3% of revenue compared to the industry average of 15%), and dramatically increasing prices on existing drugs—some by as much as 550%. CEO Michael Pearson, a former McKinsey consultant, approached the business as an exercise in financial optimization, while major investor Bill Ackman defended the model by arguing that acquisition costs were equivalent to R&D spending. The article notes Valeant had raised prices on 56 drugs (81% of its portfolio) with an average increase of 66%, compared to Pfizer's 9% average increase. The author acknowledges the strategy's success depended on continued ability to implement aggressive price hikes while carrying significant debt in a low-interest-rate environment, and expresses hope that the company's approach would eventually face consequences.

## 2. HISTORY

The aftermath of this 2015 article was dramatic and unfolded rapidly. In 2015-2016, Valeant became embroiled in a major scandal when it was revealed that the company had used a specialty pharmacy called Philidor Rx Services to improperly increase drug sales and avoid insurer pushback on price hikes. This led to congressional investigations, multiple lawsuits, and SEC scrutiny.

The company's stock price collapsed from over $260 per share in 2015 to under $20 by late 2016—a loss of more than 90% of its value. CEO Michael Pearson was forced out in 2016, and the company faced massive debt restructuring. Valeant divested numerous assets to pay down debt, including selling its gastrointestinal drugs to Takeda for $2.4 billion and Salix Pharmaceuticals to Cosmo Pharmaceuticals.

The business model proved unsustainable. The aggressive price increases drew intense regulatory and political scrutiny, culminating in Valeant agreeing to pay $58 million to settle SEC charges in 2018 over improper revenue recognition and misleading disclosures. The company dramatically scaled back its price increase strategy and began rebuilding its reputation.

By 2018, under new leadership, the company began shifting back toward more traditional pharmaceutical practices and changed its name to Bausch Health Companies in an effort to distance itself from the Valeant brand. The "R&D is for losers" philosophy was explicitly abandoned, with the company increasing R&D investment and focusing on internal drug development. However, the damage was lasting—the company struggled for years with high debt loads and reputational harm, serving as a cautionary tale that influenced industry pricing discussions and attracted regulatory attention that affected pharmaceutical pricing practices more broadly.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about Valeant's future:

• **That living "by the sword" would lead to consequences**: ✓ Correct. The company faced massive downfall within a year, with stock price collapse, executive departures, and regulatory penalties.

• **That the model depended on low interest rates**: Mixed. While interest rate environment was relevant, the collapse was primarily driven by the Philidor scandal and pricing strategy exposure rather than interest rate changes.

• **That heavy debt load made the strategy risky**: ✓ Correct. The company was forced into extensive asset sales and restructuring due to unsustainable debt.

• **That price increase strategy required ongoing ability to "get away with it"**: ✓ Correct. Regulatory and political backlash made the aggressive pricing model untenable.

• **That Pearson's claim of future revenue growth through "sales volume" was suspect**: ✓ Correct. The company's actual sales practices through Philidor were revealed to be problematic, and volume-based growth never materialized as promised.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 9/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional prescience in identifying fundamental flaws in Valeant's business model just before the company's dramatic collapse. It provides valuable insight into how financial engineering approaches to pharmaceutical companies can lead to disastrous outcomes.
