# Not 25%, But Still Not Good (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a study by Morten Oksvold of Oslo University, who examined 120 randomly selected papers from three oncology journals (International Journal of Oncology, Oncogene, and Cancer Cell) for data and figure duplications. The findings revealed that nearly 25% of papers contained problematic duplications. The types of duplication ranged from relatively benign reuses of the same control experiments within a single paper to more concerning cases where different experiments were represented by identical images (both gel and microscope images). When Oksvold contacted both the authors of the 29 problematic papers and the editorial staffs of the three journals, only one author provided any response (without supporting data) and no journal editors replied at all.

## 2. HISTORY

The publication of Oksvold's findings came during a period when concerns about research reproducibility were gaining significant traction in the scientific community. These concerns predated but were amplified by later events including the 2016 "reproducibility crisis" discussions and various high-profile retractions in cancer research.

In the years following this 2015 article, several developments occurred: many journals implemented more stringent image screening protocols and adopted software tools to detect image manipulation and duplication. The three journals mentioned (International Journal of Oncology, Oncogene, and Cancer Cell) faced scrutiny and likely reviewed their editorial processes in response to such findings. The scientific community saw increased awareness of research integrity issues, leading to initiatives for better training, reporting standards, and institutional oversight.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific predictions about future outcomes, but rather focused on correcting misconceptions about the original study and highlighting systemic issues in research integrity that needed attention.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses fundamental issues of research integrity that remained highly relevant and grew in importance in subsequent years, making it more than just a passing concern despite not discussing specific biotechnological breakthroughs.

## 5. COMMENTARY: WHAT THIS ARTICLE CAPTURED

This piece highlighted a critical but often overlooked aspect of scientific research: the gap between published findings and research integrity. The author's nuanced take - distinguishing between different types of duplications rather than simply declaring papers "non-reproducible" - demonstrated a more sophisticated understanding of research practices than some commentators at the time. The revelation that journal editors failed to respond to documented concerns was perhaps as troubling as the duplications themselves, pointing to systemic failures in scientific self-correction mechanisms. This article captured a moment when the scientific community was beginning to grapple more seriously with reproducibility issues that would later become prominent in discussions of research quality and integrity, though the full scope of these challenges would continue to unfold in subsequent years with broader reproducibility studies across multiple fields.
