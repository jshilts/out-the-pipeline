# The Antibiotic Gap: It's All of the Above (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes a New York Times business column about the challenges in antibiotic drug discovery. The key problem identified is that while antibiotic development faces poor economic incentives—new antibiotics would be reserved as "drugs of last resort" to prevent resistance, limiting sales volume and profitability—this economic explanation alone is insufficient.

The author argues that the Times article missed a crucial scientific barrier: antibiotic research has hit fundamental discovery walls. All known reasonable routes of antibiotic action have been "thoroughly worked over," and even irrational approaches have been exhausted. The piece cites GlaxoSmithKline's massive, ultimately unsuccessful multi-year antibiotic research efforts as evidence. 

The article also corrects the Times' characterization of other therapeutic areas. Cardiovascular research has waned because existing drugs work well, not due to lack of investment. HIV research faces similar high barriers because effective therapies already exist. In contrast, the antibiotic field had genomic advantages—bacterial genomes were sequenced early—yet still yielded no breakthroughs. The author concludes the problem is "everything at once": exhausted discovery approaches combined with poor economics.

## 2. HISTORY

**FDA Approvals and Post-2014 Pipeline:**
Between 2014-2024, the FDA approved approximately 15-20 new antibiotics, though most were derivatives of existing classes or combinations rather than novel mechanisms. Some notable approvals included:
- Zemdri (plazomicin) - 2018 - aminoglycoside
- Xerava (eravacycline) - 2018 - tetracycline derivative  
- Nuzyra (omadacycline) - 2018 - tetracycline derivative
- Fetcroja (cefiderocol) - 2019 - siderophore cephalosporin
- Recarbrio (imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam) - 2019 - β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor

**Industry Consolidation and Exits:**
Major pharmaceutical companies continued exiting antibiotic research post-2014. AstraZeneca sold its late-stage antibiotic portfolio in 2016. Novartis exited antibiotic research in 2018. Smaller companies like Achaogen and Melinta Therapeutics faced bankruptcies despite having FDA-approved products, validating the article's concerns about economic viability even for successful developers.

**CARB-X and Public Funding:**
In response to the crisis, CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) launched in 2016, providing over $300 million to support early-stage antibiotic development. The REPAIR Act was proposed in Congress and similar incentive programs were implemented in Europe (such as the UK's "subscription model" payments for antibiotics), though comprehensive US legislation remained elusive.

**Clinical Pipeline Composition:**
Most antibiotics in development post-2014 were β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations or modifications of existing classes. Novel mechanisms remained rare. The proportion of antibiotics targeting WHO priority pathogens (ESKAPE organisms) increased, but breakthrough innovations remained scarce.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Economic incentives alone were insufficient to solve the antibiotic crisis—fundamental scientific barriers existed.
**Outcome**: Confirmed. Multiple companies obtained FDA approval then faced bankruptcy (Achaogen, Melinta), demonstrating that even with regulatory success, commercial viability remained problematic. Traditional discovery approaches continued yielding few novel mechanisms.

• **Prediction**: Genomic approaches that had been tried since the late 1990s would continue failing to deliver new antibiotics.
**Outcome**: Confirmed. Though genomic tools improved dramatically post-2014, no major antibiotic class emerged from genomic mining approaches. Target-based screening continued underperforming phenotypic screening.

• **Prediction**: Large pharmaceutical companies would continue exiting antibiotic research due to poor returns.
**Outcome**: Confirmed. Multiple major players (Novartis, Roche, Sanofi) further reduced or eliminated antibiotic R&D. The field became increasingly dependent on small biotechs and public funding.

• **Prediction**: The cardiovascular drug development analogy was accurate—existing tools were already effective, creating high barriers for new entrants.
**Outcome**: Confirmed. PCSK9 inhibitors were approved in 2015 (Repatha, Praluent) as predicted, but faced reimbursement challenges and slower-than-expected uptake, partly because statins remained highly effective generic options.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article demonstrated exceptional prescience about antibiotic drug development challenges that would characterize the subsequent decade, accurately predicting both scientific and economic barriers that remained salient through 2024.
