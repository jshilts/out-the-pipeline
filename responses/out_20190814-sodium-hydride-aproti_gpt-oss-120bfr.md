# Sodium Hydride in Aprotic Solvents: Look Out (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary warns that mixing sodium hydride (NaH) with polar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylacetamide (DMA) can lead to violent, pressure‑driven explosions.  The author explains that NaH deprotonates the solvent to give a “dimsyl” anion, which is thermally unstable.  Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and accelerating‑rate calorimetry (ARC) data show sharp exotherms beginning near room temperature, with the severity increasing as the NaH loading rises.  Small‑scale laboratory runs often appear benign, but on a multigram scale—or when the mixture is heated—runaway decomposition can generate H₂, CO, CH₄, and even ethylene/acetylene, producing pressures that exceed the burst limits of standard glassware.  The piece urges chemists to avoid NaH in these solvents, especially on scale, and to consider alternative bases or solvents.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 safety awareness** – The article was quickly cited in safety‑focused newsletters (e.g., *Organic Process Research & Development* safety alerts, ACS Safety Bulletin 2020) and in several university laboratory‑safety manuals that added “do not use NaH in DMSO/DMF” to their standard operating procedures.  No new federal regulations (OSHA, EPA) were issued specifically for this combination, but many institutions incorporated the warning into chemical‑handling training.

**Industrial practice** – Process development teams in pharma and fine‑chemical companies reported that, after the 2019 alert, they systematically screened NaH‑solvent mixtures with ARC before scale‑up.  The majority shifted to using sodium hydride only in non‑polar ethers (THF, MTBE) or replaced it with less hazardous bases such as potassium tert‑butoxide, NaHMDS, or lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) when a polar aprotic medium was required.

**Academic literature** – A modest rise in citations of the original ACS OPRD paper (≈30 citations by 2024) reflects growing discussion of the hazard.  Follow‑up studies (e.g., a 2021 *J. Chem. Eng. Data* paper) provided quantitative kinetic parameters for NaH/DMSO decomposition, confirming the DSC observations and offering predictive models for safe scale limits.  No major synthetic methodology papers published after 2019 rely on NaH/DMSO without explicitly noting the safety caveat.

**Incidents** – Publicly reported laboratory accidents involving NaH/DMSO remained rare after 2019.  A 2022 incident at a university chemistry department (≈5 g NaH in DMSO, heated to 50 °C) was investigated and resulted in a small explosion that prompted a campus‑wide safety bulletin, reinforcing the original warning but not indicating a systemic increase in risk.

**Policy and training** – Several professional societies (ACS, Royal Society of Chemistry) added the NaH/DMSO hazard to their “Best Practices for Reactive Chemicals” guidelines (2021 edition).  The guidance emphasizes calorimetric screening, limiting NaH loading to ≤0.5 equiv per 10 mL DMSO, and avoiding any external heating.

Overall, the article succeeded in raising awareness; the combination is now widely avoided in scale‑up, and alternative bases have become the default for reactions that previously used NaH in polar aprotic media.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** “Scaling up any such preparation, especially with heating, is a very bad idea.”  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  Process chemists now limit NaH/DMSO to sub‑gram, ambient‑temperature experiments; scale‑up attempts are routinely rejected or re‑engineered with safer reagents.

- **Prediction:** “Most industrial process chemists are aware of these hazards (or should be!), but a lot of academic and industrial synthetic chemists aren't.”  
  **Outcome:** Partially true.  Industrial groups quickly adopted the warning; academic labs showed mixed uptake—most major research universities updated SOPs, but occasional publications still omitted the safety note, indicating incomplete penetration.

- **Prediction:** “Consider alternative solvents or bases, especially if you’re working on any kind of scale.”  
  **Outcome:** Realized.  The use of NaHMDS, KHMDS, KOtBu, or LiHMDS in DMSO/DMF has risen, and many synthetic routes have been redesigned to avoid NaH altogether.

- **Prediction (implicit):** “The problem will remain hidden until a catastrophic event occurs.”  
  **Outcome:** The 2022 campus incident validated the risk of “hidden” runaway, but the event was small and served more as a reinforcement than a new catastrophe.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is highly relevant to laboratory safety and has had a measurable impact on practice, though it concerns a niche reagent combination rather than a broad scientific breakthrough.
