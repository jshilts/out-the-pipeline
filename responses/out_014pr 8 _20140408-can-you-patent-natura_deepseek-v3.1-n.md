# Critical Analysis: "Can You Patent A Natural Product? Prepare For a Different Answer"

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article discusses the dramatic shift in U.S. patent law regarding natural products following two landmark Supreme Court decisions: *Mayo v. Prometheus* (2012) and *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics* (2013). The author explains how these rulings fundamentally challenged the long-standing practice of patenting isolated and purified natural compounds, which had been standard practice for over a century in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.

The article highlights the new USPTO guidelines requiring patent examiners to determine whether claimed inventions are "significantly different" from naturally occurring substances, moving beyond the previous standard where mere isolation and purification were considered sufficient for patentability. The author captures the widespread uncertainty and anxiety within the IP legal community, noting that terms like "markedly different" lacked clear operational definitions and would need to be defined through case-by-case litigation and examination practice.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this article has indeed proven transformative for natural product patent law, largely validating the article's prescient warnings about uncertainty:

**Immediate Aftermath (2014-2016):** The USPTO's interim guidance proved problematic in practice, leading to extensive industry feedback and several revisions. Patent examiners initially applied highly restrictive standards, rejecting applications for naturally derived compounds that had previously been routinely approved.

**Key Subsequent Ruling (2017):** In *Impression Products v. Lexmark*, the Supreme Court extended the exhaustion doctrine, further limiting patent rights. While not directly about natural products, this signaled the Court's continued skepticism toward broad patent claims.

**Legislative Response:** The biotech and pharmaceutical industries lobbied extensively for legislative clarity. However, despite several proposed bills (including the STRONGER Patents Act and various iterations of patent reform), Congress failed to provide statutory clarification, leaving courts and the USPTO to continue developing standards through case law.

**Practical Impact:** Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly shifted patent strategies away from claims on isolated natural compounds toward:
- Process patents for specific manufacturing methods
- Formulation patents for specific dosage forms and delivery systems
- Combination patents for specific therapeutic mixtures
- Diagnostic method patents with specific technical implementations

**Ongoing Developments (2018-2024):** The Federal Circuit continued refining the "markedly different" standard, with cases like *Natural Alternatives v. Creative Compounds* (2019) providing further guidance on what constitutes sufficient structural differences from naturally occurring compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**

The author accurately predicted the **uncertainty and complexity** that would follow the Supreme Court decisions. The phrase "this is going to be thrashed out application by application, lawsuit by lawsuit" proved remarkably prescient. Over the subsequent decade, numerous cases have indeed worked their way through the Federal Circuit and district courts, slowly establishing precedents for what constitutes "markedly different."

The prediction that **life would become "much more complicated and uncertain"** for those trying to patent natural products was entirely correct. The biotech and pharmaceutical industries faced years of unpredictable examination outcomes and increased litigation costs.

The suggestion that **including multiple claims with varying degrees of modification** would be a prudent strategy also proved sound. This became standard practice among sophisticated patent practitioners.

**What the Article Got Wrong:**

The author's relative optimism about finding "some new equilibrium" was somewhat misplaced. **Ten years later, significant uncertainty still persists**. The boundaries of patentable subject matter for natural products remain contested, with new edge cases continually arising as technology advances.

The article underestimated the **staying power of the restrictive approach**. Rather than a temporary disruption followed by recalibration, the Supreme Court's foundational shift has proven durable, with no serious reconsideration of the core principles established in *Myriad* and *Mayo*.

The analysis missed the **broader international dimension**. While focused on U.S. patent law, the global harmonization of patent standards meant that these U.S. developments influenced debates in other jurisdictions, though outcomes varied significantly.

**Moderate Success:**

The author's recognition that this would primarily affect the biotechnology sector was partially correct, but the impact extended far beyond. Agricultural biotechnology, traditional pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and even software patents (through the "abstract ideas" prong) were all affected by the new framework.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 7/9**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile of interest and importance. Here's why:

**High Interest Factors:**
- **Legal-Economic Intersection**: The article brilliantly captures a critical moment where legal doctrine directly impacts billions of dollars in R&D investment and intellectual property strategy.
- **Prescient Uncertainty**: The author correctly identified that major disruption was coming and that the practical implications would take years to unfold.
- **Industry Transformation**: This legal shift genuinely transformed business models and patent strategies across the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors.
- **Ongoing Relevance**: The issues raised remain actively litigated and debated a decade later, indicating fundamental rather than transient importance.

**Limitations in Long-term Significance:**
- **Sector-Specific Impact**: While crucial for biotech/pharma, this has limited relevance for other technology sectors that dominate broader innovation discussions.
- **Incremental Evolution**: Despite the initial disruption, the patent system adapted through gradual evolution rather than revolutionary transformation.
- **Partial Resolution**: The fundamental tension between incentivizing innovation and preventing over-broad monopolies on nature continues unresolved.

**Why Not Higher:**
This falls short of the top decile (8-9) because it addressed a specific, albeit important, legal-technical issue that affects a limited (though economically significant) sector. Articles ranking in the top decile typically deal with broader themes: fundamental scientific discoveries, global technological transformations, or societal-scale challenges that affect multiple domains.

The analysis proved insightful and important, but the subject matter remains more specialized than the most historically significant scientific and technological questions.
