# My Imaginary Friends Would Be Glad to Serve as Referees (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a major academic publishing scandal uncovered in 2014, where a Taiwanese researcher orchestrated an elaborate peer-review fraud operation at the Journal of Vibration and Control. The researcher created approximately 130 fake email addresses and fabricated reviewer identities in the journal's submission system to ensure his own manuscripts received favorable reviews. This scheme resulted in the retraction of 60 papers dating back to 2010.

The author criticizes not only the fraudulent researcher (who was subsequently removed from his position) but also the journal's editor (who resigned) for editorial negligence. The piece questions how such a large volume of papers from a single obscure institution with overlapping authorship could go unnoticed. The author characterizes the scandal as involving "a fool, faking papers for a bunch of incompetents, and rewarded for it by idiots," expressing broader concerns about the standards in scientific publishing and academia.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2014 scandal was part of a larger wave of peer-review manipulation cases that prompted significant changes in academic publishing practices:

**Immediate Impact (2014-2016):**
- SAGE Publications, the publisher, conducted a comprehensive investigation and ultimately retracted 60 papers from the Journal of Vibration and Control
- The researcher involved, Peter Chen (陳震遠), was indeed removed from his position at Taiwan's National Pingtung University of Education
- The journal's editor, Ali H. Nayfeh, resigned his position

**Broader Industry Response:**
Following this and similar scandals (including a 2015 mass retraction by BioMed Central of 43 papers), major publishers implemented stricter verification systems:
- Enhanced reviewer identity verification processes
- Implementation of more sophisticated reviewer database systems
- Greater scrutiny of suspicious patterns in authorship and institutional affiliations
- Cross-referencing of reviewer email addresses and institutional affiliations

**Long-term Consequences:**
- The case became a landmark example in discussions about peer-review integrity
- Contributed to the development of more robust peer-review management systems like Publons and ORCID
- Influenced policies at funding agencies and academic institutions regarding publication ethics
- Led to increased awareness and detection of "peer-review rings" in subsequent years

**Real-world Implications:**
- The scandal highlighted serious vulnerabilities in the traditional peer-review system
- While improved detection systems were implemented, peer-review fraud cases have continued to emerge periodically
- The broader issue of publication pressure in academia remained largely unaddressed, with similar motivations driving subsequent fraud cases

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's main predictions and expectations:

**Prediction: This represented a low point that couldn't be underestimated**
- **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While this was indeed a massive case, peer-review manipulation continued to evolve and be discovered. Notable subsequent cases include the 2015 BioMed Central retractions (43 papers), various paper mill operations, and the 2020-2021 "paper mill" scandals affecting hundreds of publications across multiple journals.
- **Assessment**: The prediction underestimated both the persistence and sophistication of academic fraud. Rather than representing a "lowest point," it highlighted systemic vulnerabilities that fraudsters continued to exploit in different ways.

**Implicit prediction: Such large-scale operations would be caught more quickly**
- **Outcome**: Mixed. Detection systems did improve, but sophisticated operations (like coordinated paper mills) continued to succeed for years before detection. The 2021 investigation by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) revealed ongoing systematic manipulation affecting multiple publishers.
- **Assessment**: While detection methods evolved, fraud methods also became more sophisticated, creating an ongoing cat-and-mouse dynamic rather than elimination of the problem.

**Implicit expectation: Institutions would become more vigilant**
- **Outcome**: Variable. Some institutions and funding agencies strengthened oversight, but similar cases continued to emerge, suggesting that systemic pressures (publication requirements for promotion, funding, etc.) persisted largely unchanged.
- **Assessment**: The fundamental incentive structures driving such fraud remained largely intact, though awareness and some preventive measures increased.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a watershed moment in academic publishing ethics that catalyzed industry-wide changes in peer-review practices. Its significance extends beyond the immediate scandal to reveal systemic vulnerabilities and incentive problems that remained relevant for years afterward.
