# Another DNA-Barcoded Program From GSK (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses two GSK papers using DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology for drug discovery. It focuses primarily on the InhA tuberculosis target work, where GSK screened a library of over 16 million compounds. The DEL platform successfully identified hits, with one aminoproline scaffold compound reaching nanomolar potency. After extensive medicinal chemistry optimization addressing metabolic stability concerns (particularly a problematic methyl ester group), compound 65 emerged with promising in vitro profiles matching moxifloxacin's antibacterial performance, clean preliminary toxicity, and good PK/selectivity.

The crucial failure occurred at the final hurdle: despite excellent in vitro results, compound 65 showed no efficacy in mouse tuberculosis infection models. The author notes this represents both the power and limitations of DEL technology - the platform successfully delivered quality starting points and chemistry optimization proceeded normally, yet the ultimate biological validation exposed a fundamental disconnect between in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy that remains unexplained.

## 2. HISTORY

**DNA-Encoded Library Technology Evolution (2014-present):**
- DEL technology has become an established hit-identification platform across pharmaceutical companies including GSK, Novartis, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and biotech companies.
- Multiple clinical candidates have emerged from DEL campaigns: **BAY-298** (Bayer, phase 2 completed for endometriosis), **PF-07275315** (Pfizer, dermatology), **GSK2256294** (soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, multiple phase 2 studies), and several others.
- The technology has proven particularly valuable for difficult targets like protein-protein interactions, where traditional screening methods struggle.
- Commercial DEL providers emerged (e.g., X-Chem, now part of Charles River; Nuevolution, now part of Amgen), validating the market adoption.

**Tuberculosis Drug Development Post-2014:**
- Despite decades of research, InhA remains a challenging target with limited clinical success beyond isoniazid.
- **Delamanid** (Otsuka) received EMA approval in 2014, **Pretomanid** (TB Alliance) received FDA approval in 2019 - both targeting different mechanisms than InhA.
- **BTZ-043** (Benzothiazinone, InhA inhibitor) has shown promise in early clinical trials but remains investigational.
- No novel InhA inhibitors from DEL platforms have reached clinical development for tuberculosis, suggesting the target's inherent difficulties persist.

**LFA-1 Target Outcomes:**
- LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) has seen mixed clinical results despite extensive drug discovery efforts.
- **Lifitegrast** (Xiidra) received FDA approval in 2016 for dry eye disease - not a direct LFA-1 inhibitor but targeting related pathways.
- Multiple LFA-1 programs have been discontinued due to efficacy or safety concerns, highlighting the challenges in modulating protein-protein interactions therapeutically.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in the Article:**

• **DEL Technology Viability:** The author suggested DEL was showing promise as a discovery platform. *Outcome:* DEL has indeed become an established hit-finding methodology across the pharmaceutical industry, with multiple clinical candidates and two approved drugs demonstrating the technology's value.

• **InhA as a Viable Tuberculosis Target:** The article assumed InhA remained a druggable target worth pursuing. *Outcome:* InhA has proven stubbornly difficult despite extensive efforts; no novel InhA inhibitors have reached market approval since 2014, suggesting fundamental challenges in translating in vitro activity to clinical efficacy in tuberculosis.

• **The Mouse Model Failure Requiring Explanation:** The author implied the disconnect between in vitro and in vivo results needed resolution for future success. *Outcome:* This issue remains a persistent challenge in tuberculosis drug development; target validation and translation between assays continues to be a bottleneck, not just for InhA but for tuberculosis drug discovery generally.

• **Medicinal Chemistry Optimization Pathways:** The detailed account of structure-activity relationship work assumed rational optimization could solve the problems encountered. *Outcome:* While the specific program failed, the general approach of iterative medicinal chemistry on DEL-derived hits has proven successful across multiple programs, though each target and compound class presents unique challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides valuable insight into both the promise and reality of drug discovery platforms, illustrating how technologically successful approaches can still fail due to biological complexity. The honest account of program termination despite excellent in vitro data makes it more instructive than typical success-story publications.
