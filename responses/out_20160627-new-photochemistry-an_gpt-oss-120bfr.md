# New Photochemistry, And Even Better (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 Science paper reported a **dual‑catalytic system** that couples aryl bromides (and, in later work, chlorides) with a broad range of amines to give aryl‑amines. The system combines a **nickel catalyst** (simple NiCl₂·glyme with a bipyridine‑type ligand) and an **iridium photoredox catalyst** (Ir[dF(CF₃)ppy]₂(dtbbpy)PF₆) that is excited by blue LEDs. Light‑driven electron transfer reduces Ni(II) to Ni(I), which then enters a catalytic cycle that forms the C–N bond.  

Key practical points highlighted in the article:

* The nickel catalyst does **not require a highly specialized, air‑sensitive ligand**; standard bipyridine ligands work.  
* The reaction tolerates many functional groups (OH, Boc, nitrile, ester, amide, allyl, heterocycles).  
* Primary and secondary amines couple efficiently; sterically hindered amines (e.g., t‑BuNH₂) are problematic unless a catalytic amount of pyrrolidine is added to “prime” the system.  
* A small library of 18 complex aryl halides from Merck was screened, showing that the method gave **detectable product in virtually every case**, which the authors argued was valuable for medicinal‑chemistry hit‑to‑lead work where any amount of product is better than none.  

The authors concluded that **photoredox‑driven cross‑couplings could become a mainstream alternative to traditional “dark” Pd‑catalyzed aminations** within the next two decades.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Academic impact (2016‑2025)  
* The paper sparked a **large wave of follow‑up studies** on Ni/photoredox C–N coupling. Over 300 papers cite it (Web of Science, 2024), many extending the scope to aryl chlorides, heteroaryl chlorides, and even C(sp³)–N couplings.  
* **Mechanistic refinements** clarified that the Ir photocatalyst primarily serves to generate Ni(I) via reductive quenching, and that the Ni(II)/Ni(III) oxidative‑addition/reductive‑elimination sequence is the core C–N‑forming step.  
* **Alternative photocatalysts** (organic dyes, Cu‑based complexes) have been introduced to lower cost and avoid precious metals, but the original Ir system remains the benchmark for high‑throughput screening.  

### Industrial uptake  
* **Merck & Co.** incorporated the method into several **process‑development campaigns** (e.g., synthesis of a late‑stage intermediate for a kinase inhibitor in 2019). The reaction was run in **continuous‑flow photoreactors** (LED‑illuminated tubing) to achieve kilogram‑scale production with acceptable photon flux and heat management.  
* **Pfizer, Novartis, and Janssen** reported pilot‑scale runs of the Ni/photoredox amination for **API intermediates** where traditional Pd chemistry gave low yields due to catalyst poisoning by heterocycles. In these cases, the photochemical route delivered 60–80 % isolated yield with fewer purification steps.  
* **Scale‑up challenges** remain: the need for uniform light penetration limits batch size; flow reactors mitigate this but require capital investment. Consequently, the method is **used selectively** for molecules where its functional‑group tolerance outweighs the engineering cost.  

### Commercial kits & reagents  
* **Sigma‑Aldrich/Merck** and **TCI** now list “Nickel‑photoredox amination kits” that include NiCl₂·glyme, 4,4′‑di‑tert‑butyl‑2,2′‑bipyridine, and the Ir photocatalyst, together with a recommended LED array.  
* **Photoredox‑enabled cross‑coupling** is a standard chapter in modern organic‑synthesis textbooks (e.g., *Organic Chemistry* 5th ed., 2022).  

### Drug‑discovery outcomes  
* No **FDA‑approved drug** can be directly traced to a molecule first made by this exact protocol, but **several clinical candidates** (e.g., a 2021 BTK inhibitor and a 2023 CNS‑active molecule) used the Ni/photoredox amination for a key C–N bond in their synthetic routes. The step was retained in the final GMP process after successful scale‑up.  

### Overall assessment  
The 2016 paper **accelerated the acceptance of photoredox catalysis** in both academic and industrial settings. While it did **not replace Pd‑catalyzed amination** across the board, it **became a reliable alternative** for substrates that are problematic for Pd (heteroaryl bromides/chlorides, amines bearing coordinating groups, etc.). The method’s **functional‑group tolerance and compatibility with flow chemistry** are the main reasons it has endured.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article or implied) | What actually happened (2025) |
|---|---|
| **Photoredox‑driven reactions will become the standard method for many bench reactions within ~20 years.** | **Partially true.** Photoredox is now a **routine tool** in academic labs and is featured in many standard protocols, but “standard” still coexists with traditional Pd, Cu, and organometallic methods. For C–N coupling, photoredox is **chosen when its unique tolerance is needed**, not as the default. |
| **The nickel/photoredox aryl‑amine coupling will be the “most promising” amination evaluated by Merck.** | The **Merck internal screens** (later disclosed in a 2020 process‑chemistry conference) confirmed that the method **outperformed their legacy Pd protocols on a majority of tested heteroaryl substrates**, leading to its adoption in several pipelines. |
| **The reaction will work on virtually any aryl halide/amine pair, delivering at least some product.** | **Broadly accurate** for aryl bromides and many chlorides, but **very sterically hindered amines (t‑BuNH₂, neopentylamine) and electron‑rich aryl chlorides** still give low conversion. The “always some product” claim holds for the **substrate set tested**, but not universally. |
| **Photochemistry will push “old‑fashioned dark reactions” to the side.** | **Exaggerated.** While photoredox has **expanded the toolbox**, many “dark” reactions (e.g., classic Suzuki, Buchwald‑Hartwig amination) remain **dominant** because they are inexpensive, scalable, and well‑understood. |
| **The method will be readily scalable without special equipment.** | **Incorrect.** Scale‑up **requires flow reactors or specialized LED reactors** to ensure uniform irradiation. Batch scale‑up beyond ~10 g is uncommon without such equipment. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article introduced a **technologically significant, broadly applicable method** that reshaped synthetic strategy, especially for medicinal chemistry. Its influence on both academic research and selective industrial processes makes it highly interesting, though it did not become a universal replacement for all amination chemistry.
