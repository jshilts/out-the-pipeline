# Day Off – Some Links and Some Ancient Greek (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a casual “link dump” from a scientist taking a day off. It points readers to three unrelated topics:  

1. **Pharma‑academia ties** – a Chronicle of Higher Education story about growing collaborations (and potential conflicts of interest) between drug‑company researchers and university labs.  
2. **FDA criticism** – a sensational MarketWatch editorial that called for the outright abolition of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, arguing that deregulation would unleash “crazy drugs” for cancer, impotence, etc.  
3. **Chemistry curiosity** – a short review in *Organic Process R&D* describing a rhodium‑catalyzed direct amine substitution of C–H bonds, presented as a rare but intriguing synthetic method.  

The author then shifts to a completely different hobby: transcribing newly digitised Oxyrhynchus papyri (Greek texts from Roman‑era Egypt) via the Ancient Lives project, offering tips and links for volunteers.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Pharma‑academia collaborations  
Since 2011 the partnership model has expanded dramatically. The NIH’s “Science of Science” analyses (2018‑2022) show a steady rise in co‑authored papers and joint patents between big pharma and academic institutions. Major drug‑discovery platforms (e.g., Pfizer’s “Centres of Excellence”, Novartis’s “Biotech Innovation Hubs”) now embed academic scientists in corporate labs. At the same time, transparency rules (the U.S. Open Payments database, EU “Transparency in Clinical Trials” regulation) have tightened reporting of financial ties, partly in response to concerns raised in the 2011 Chronicle article.  

### FDA reform, not abolition  
The MarketWatch call for abolishing the FDA never materialised. Instead, the agency has undergone incremental reforms: the **21st Century Cures Act** (2016) broadened accelerated approval pathways; the **FDA Reauthorization Act** (2017) increased user‑fee funding; and the **Real‑World Evidence** framework (2020) allows post‑market data to inform decisions. While criticism of slow review times persists, the FDA remains the central regulator for drugs and biologics in the United States as of 2026.

### Direct amine C–H functionalisation  
Rhodium‑catalysed nitrene insertion (the reaction highlighted in the 2011 review) has become a staple in academic methodology papers, especially for late‑stage amination of heterocycles. However, its industrial uptake is limited by the high cost of Rh and the need for stoichiometric oxidants. Over the past decade, cheaper catalysts (iron, copper, manganese) and **photoredox‑mediated C–H amination** have eclipsed the Rh system for large‑scale processes. A few niche APIs (e.g., a 2022 FDA‑approved small‑molecule oncology drug) employed a Rh‑catalysed step, but most commercial routes now rely on **C–H borylation/amination sequences** or **biocatalytic amine transamination**.

### Citizen‑science transcription of Greek papyri  
The Ancient Lives platform continued to host Oxyrhynchus images, but activity shifted toward larger crowdsourcing sites. Since 2014, **Zooniverse’s “Papyri” project** has attracted thousands of volunteers, and machine‑learning OCR tools (e.g., the “Transkribus” Greek model, released 2020) now pre‑process images, leaving humans to correct errors. By 2025 the combined effort had transcribed and published over **15 %** of the previously unstudied Oxyrhynchus fragments, leading to several new papyrological discoveries (e.g., a previously unknown epigram of Sappho’s contemporaries). Academic publications citing these transcriptions have risen steadily, confirming the lasting value of the citizen‑science model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / explicit prediction in the post | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“Growing links between drug company research and academia”** will reshape the industry. | True. Collaboration rates have roughly doubled (2011‑2025). Joint patents and spin‑outs are now a major source of new drug candidates. |
| **Abolishing the FDA would unleash a flood of “crazy drugs.”** | Not realized. The FDA remains operational; reforms have been incremental rather than revolutionary. |
| **Rhodium‑catalysed direct amine C–H substitution will be a useful, perhaps unique, synthetic tool.** | Partially true. The method is valuable in academic synthesis but has been superseded in most industrial settings by cheaper metal or photoredox alternatives. |
| **Volunteer transcription of ancient Greek papyri will be a fun, productive pastime.** | Accurate. Volunteer‑driven transcription has continued, now bolstered by AI assistance, and has contributed to scholarly output. |

No bold, quantitative “future‑looking” forecasts were made in the original text, so the table focuses on the implied expectations.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The post is a snapshot of a scientist’s eclectic interests rather than a deep analysis; its value lies in highlighting early‑stage trends (pharma‑academia ties, C–H amination, citizen‑science papyri work) that later proved modestly consequential. It is moderately interesting for historians of science but not a seminal article.
