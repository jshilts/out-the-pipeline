# The Last Post (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief announcement from July 31, 2015 marks the final post on the Corante blogging platform for Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" series. The author announces the migration of his long-running pharmaceutical and biotechnology commentary blog to a new home at Science Translational Medicine, with the new site launching the following Monday. Lowe expresses appreciation for the commenting community that had developed around the blog, noting that reader contributions added significant value beyond his own posts. The tone is forward-looking, positioning the move as the beginning of a new phase while maintaining continuity of the established commentary format and audience engagement.

## 2. HISTORY

Derek Lowe successfully transitioned "In the Pipeline" to Science Translational Medicine (STM) in August 2015, where the blog continues to operate as of 2025—nearly a decade later. The migration marked a significant institutional transition from an independent blogging platform (Corante) to a major scientific publication under the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). STM, launched in 2009, is a peer-reviewed journal focused on translational research with a mission to move scientific discoveries toward clinical applications.

The move proved successful in maintaining both audience engagement and content quality. Lowe's blog has continued to provide critical commentary on pharmaceutical research, drug development, clinical trials, and industry trends. Importantly, the blog has maintained relevance during a transformative period for biotechnology, covering major developments including the rise of immuno-oncology, gene therapies, CRISPR applications, mRNA vaccine development (particularly relevant during COVID-19), increasing FDA approvals of novel therapies, and the growth of precision medicine approaches.

The commenting community that Lowe specifically praised has continued to thrive at the new venue, fulfilling his observation that reader expertise adds substantial value to pharmaceutical discourse. The blog remains influential among scientists, industry professionals, and informed observers, serving as an important bridge between technical research and accessible commentary.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made only one implicit prediction:

• **"I think I can promise that it's not going to be boring!"** 
  - **Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate. The subsequent period (2015-2025) witnessed extraordinary developments in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals: the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid mRNA vaccine development, major advances in CAR-T cell therapy and immuno-oncology, FDA approvals of breakthrough gene therapies including Luxturna and Zolgensma, expanded use of CRISPR technology, the growth of personalized cancer treatments and checkpoint inhibitors, significant progress in neurodegenerative disease research, and substantial evolution in regulatory approaches including accelerated approvals and adaptive trial designs. The prediction correctly anticipated that pharmaceutical and biotechnology innovation would continue at an intense pace with substantial real-world impact.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This rating reflects that while the article documents an important transition for a significant industry blog, the content is primarily administrative—announcing a platform migration rather than providing substantive commentary on biotechnology developments, scientific discoveries, or industry analysis that would have lasting analytical value.
