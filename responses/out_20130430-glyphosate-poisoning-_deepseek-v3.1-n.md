# Is Glyphosate Poisoning Everyone? (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a critical takedown of a 2013 paper published in the journal *Entropy* (MDPI) that claimed glyphosate—the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide—is responsible for numerous chronic diseases in humans. The author, a medicinal chemist, systematically dismantles the paper's central claims that glyphosate inhibits CYP enzymes, disrupts gut bacteria aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, and interferes with sulfate transport. 

The critique focuses on the paper's lack of direct evidence, pointing out that while the authors cite indirect studies and build speculative chains of reasoning filled with qualifiers like "might," "could," and "possibly," they ignore the available direct evidence. Specifically, the article highlights that actual human CYP enzyme testing showed glyphosate is inactive against most isoforms except CYP2C9 at concentrations that cannot realistically be achieved through normal human exposure routes. The author characterizes the paper as a poorly supported advocacy piece that abuses scientific publishing through low-quality "open-access" journals like MDPI's *Entropy*, comparing it to another notorious paper previously published by the same outlet.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 publication of both the criticized paper and this rebuttal, several significant developments occurred regarding glyphosate safety and regulatory oversight:

**Regulatory Actions and Assessments:**

• **EPA Evaluations (2013-2022):** The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted multiple comprehensive reviews, concluding in 2020 that glyphosate is "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans" when used according to label directions. This position was reaffirmed after court-ordered re-evaluations.

• **IARC Classification (2015):** The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2A), creating significant controversy and ongoing scientific debate. This classification was based on limited evidence in humans but sufficient evidence in experimental animals.

• **European Union Regulatory Battles:** Glyphosate's license faced multiple contentious renewal periods, with temporary approvals and intense political debate. It was ultimately reauthorized through 2023, with ongoing discussions about future restrictions.

**Legal Developments:**

• **Major Litigation:** Starting around 2018, thousands of lawsuits were filed against Bayer (which acquired Monsanto) by individuals claiming glyphosate exposure caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This resulted in substantial settlements, though Bayer maintained product safety.

• **Court Rulings:** Various courts reached different conclusions about admitting expert testimony on glyphosate carcinogenicity, creating a complex legal landscape that continues to evolve.

**Scientific Research Evolution:**

• **Large-Scale Studies:** Multiple large agricultural health studies (including the Agricultural Health Study with over 50,000 pesticide applicators) generally did not find clear associations between glyphosate exposure and most cancers, though some specific cancer types showed elevated risk in certain exposure categories.

• **Publishing Culture Issues:** The broader problem of predatory or low-quality open-access journals identified in the article continued to be a significant concern in scientific publishing, with increased awareness and crackdowns on problematic publishers.

• **The CYP Enzyme Issue:** The specific mechanistic concern about CYP enzyme inhibition largely remained a non-issue in mainstream toxicology assessments, with regulatory agencies not considering it a significant concern at realistic exposure levels.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2013 critique made several implicit predictions about how the claims would be evaluated and what the scientific/regulatory response would be:

• **That the paper was scientifically unsound and would not withstand proper scrutiny**  
  **Outcome:** ✅ **Mostly accurate** - The specific mechanistic claims about systemic toxic effects remained marginal in mainstream scientific consensus, though the IARC classification kept glyphosate safety debates alive in regulatory and legal arenas.

• **That direct evidence (human CYP studies) contradicted the indirect speculation**  
  **Outcome:** ✅ **Accurate** - Subsequent regulatory reviews continued to focus on direct experimental evidence rather than the speculative mechanisms proposed in the criticized paper.

• **That the low-quality journal publishing indicated broader problems in open-access publishing**  
  **Outcome:** ✅ **Accurate** - The "predatory publishing" problem became widely recognized in subsequent years, with institutions and funders developing policies to address problematic journals and publishers.

• **That glyphosate safety concerns were being overblown by poor quality science**  
  **Outcome:** ⚠️ **Partially accurate** - While the specific mechanisms in the criticized paper did not become major concerns, legitimate regulatory and scientific debates about glyphosate safety persisted and even intensified, particularly around cancer endpoints.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable foresight about both the specific scientific weaknesses of a particular paper and broader systemic problems in scientific publishing. The author identified methodological flaws that remained relevant throughout subsequent regulatory debates, and correctly predicted that the publishing issues highlighted would become a major concern for scientific integrity. The intersection of poor science, publishing ethics, and high-stakes regulatory decisions gives this critique lasting significance.
