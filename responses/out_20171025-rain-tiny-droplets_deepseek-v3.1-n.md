# A Rain of Tiny Droplets (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses "on-water" chemistry—reactions accelerated at the water-organic interface—and a breakthrough from Richard Zare's group showing that microdroplets generated by electrospray ionization can accelerate a benchmark cycloaddition (quadricyclane + diethylazodicarboxylate) by an additional 115-fold compared to Sharpless's "on-water" conditions. The piece reviews competing explanations for aqueous interfacial acceleration, including dangling OH bonds, two-dimensional diffusion, and electric field effects, and notes a significant solvent isotope effect suggesting O-H bonds play a key role. The author suggests potential applications in flow chemistry and reaction discovery, since the electrospray-mass spectrometry setup provides real-time monitoring, and speculates on possible scale-up via flow systems.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent research has advanced both the fundamental understanding and practical applications of microdroplet chemistry:
- **Mechanistic advances**: Studies have progressively clarified that interfacial electric fields, partial solvation, and proton-transfer pathways contribute to accelerations, while extensive work from Zare's, Cooks's, and other groups established that microdroplets can provide up to $\sim 10^6$-fold rate enhancements for specific transformations.
- **Adoption in reaction discovery**: Microdroplet setups coupled with mass spectrometry are now used for rapid reaction screening and mechanistic probing; the approach has been applied to peptide synthesis, C–C couplings, and other reactions.
- **Scale-up attempts**: Continuous-flow systems incorporating nebulization or droplet generation have been developed to bridge microdroplet findings to preparative scales, though achieving consistent order-of-magnitude accelerations outside microdroplets remains a challenge.
- **Business/academic landscape**: No major commercial synthetic platform appears to have been built solely on microdroplet acceleration; applications have mainly resided in analytical workflows, high-throughput screening, and accelerating discovery rather than manufacturing-scale synthesis.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Speeding things up by this amount is always welcome, and there's also the possibility for completely new reactions."**
  - Accurate. Subsequent work demonstrated substantial rate accelerations (often $10^3$–$10^6$) for a range of reactions in microdroplets, and several "impossible" thermal reactions were shown to occur under these conditions.
- **"Running reactions under electrospray conditions like this gives you an instant profile... so this should make reaction discovery much easier."**
  - Accurate. ESI-MS reaction screening and mechanistic studies are now established in academia and industry, though broad uptake for routine discovery varies by lab.
- **"it's also a classic flow-chemistry situation... a flow setup with some electrospray apparatus... if you can get things up to a first-pass-is-enough level, it could be pretty interesting."**
  - Partially accurate. Flow systems with nebulization were developed, but achieving consistent, large-scale accelerations outside microdroplets proved difficult; microdroplet chemistry remains primarily a discovery/analytical tool rather than a manufacturing route.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a significant early clue about microdroplet-mediated acceleration and its potential for reaction discovery and mechanistic studies, which has since become a productive subfield of physical organic and analytical chemistry.
