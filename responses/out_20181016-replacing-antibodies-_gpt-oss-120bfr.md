# Replacing Antibodies With Small Molecules (Oct 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary examined whether the rapidly expanding class of PD‑1/PD‑L1 checkpoint‑blocking antibodies could eventually be supplanted—or at least complemented—by orally available small‑molecule drugs.  It highlighted the theoretical advantages of small molecules (shorter half‑life, easier dosing, no infusion) and the practical challenges (protein‑protein interfaces are large and often hydrophobic, making high‑affinity, drug‑like ligands hard to discover).  The author surveyed the state of the art at the time: crystal structures of the PD‑1/PD‑L1 complex, several review articles, and early‑stage programs such as Bristol‑Myers‑Squibb’s PD‑L1 dimerizers, Aurigene/Curis’s peptidomimetic candidates (CA‑170, CA‑327), and the notion of macro‑cyclic peptide mimics.  The piece concluded that while small‑molecule “antibody replacements” are conceivable, they would require substantial time, money, and empirical optimisation, and there was no clear answer to how often such an approach would succeed.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development after 2018**  

| Company / Program | Status (2026) | Key outcomes |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Curis (CA‑170 / CA‑327)** | Development halted (2021) after Phase II trials in solid tumours showed limited efficacy and no clear biomarker‑driven advantage. The program was discontinued and the assets were not acquired. |
| **BMS (BMS‑202, BMS‑1166, BMS‑986189)** | BMS‑202 and BMS‑1166 remain **tool compounds** used in structural biology; they have not entered clinical trials. BMS‑986189, a later‑generation small‑molecule PD‑1 antagonist, entered a **Phase I** first‑in‑human study in 2020 but the trial was terminated in 2022 due to insufficient target engagement and pharmacokinetic concerns. No BMS small‑molecule PD‑1/PD‑L1 has progressed beyond early‑phase studies. |
| **Aurigene (peptidomimetic programs)** | Public disclosures stopped after 2019; no clinical data have emerged, and the company has shifted focus to other immuno‑oncology targets. |
| **Academic / collaborative efforts** | Numerous crystal‑structure‑guided screens (e.g., from the University of Michigan, Karolinska Institute) produced low‑micromolar binders that induced PD‑L1 dimerisation, but none have demonstrated the potency, selectivity, or oral bioavailability required for clinical development. |
| **Macro‑cyclic peptide platforms (e.g., PeptiDream, Cyclo‑M)** | Early pre‑clinical candidates reported (2019‑2021) but no peptide‑based PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors have entered human trials as of early 2026. |

**Regulatory and market landscape**  

- **No FDA‑approved small‑molecule PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitor** exists as of Jan 2026. The checkpoint‑inhibitor market remains dominated by monoclonal antibodies (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) and, more recently, by **bispecific antibodies** and **antibody‑drug conjugates**.  
- **Oral checkpoint inhibitors** have entered the clinic, but they target **different checkpoints** (e.g., LAG‑3 inhibitor **efmarodocokin alfa** is still antibody‑based; small‑molecule LAG‑3 inhibitors are in Phase I, but none have reached approval).  
- **Policy and reimbursement** have continued to favour established antibody therapies; no specific incentives have been introduced to accelerate oral small‑molecule checkpoint drugs.  

**Scientific progress**  

- The **PD‑L1 crystal structures** published before 2018 have been refined, and cryo‑EM structures of the PD‑1/PD‑L1 complex with antibodies have deepened mechanistic understanding, but they have not translated into a breakthrough small‑molecule scaffold.  
- **PROTAC and molecular‑glue approaches** targeting PD‑L1 for degradation have been demonstrated in vitro (e.g., Arvinas‑type degraders reported in 2021‑2023), yet none have progressed beyond proof‑of‑concept.  

Overall, the optimism expressed in the 2018 article has **not materialised into an approved oral PD‑1/PD‑L1 drug**, and most early‑stage programs have stalled or been abandoned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article did not list explicit numeric forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

- **Prediction:** Small‑molecule PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors could become clinically viable and offer dosing advantages over antibodies.  
  **Outcome:** *Not realized.* All programs remain pre‑clinical or early‑phase; no oral agent has demonstrated sufficient efficacy to challenge antibody standards.

- **Prediction:** Macro‑cyclic peptides or “de‑peptidized” peptidomimetics would provide a tractable path to stable, orally bioavailable checkpoint inhibitors.  
  **Outcome:** *Unfulfilled.* While macro‑cyclic peptides have shown improved stability in vitro, none have entered human trials for PD‑1/PD‑L1 as of 2026.

- **Prediction (implicit):** Companies such as BMS, Aurigene, and Curis would advance at least one candidate into late‑stage clinical testing within a few years.  
  **Outcome:** *Partially false.* Curis’s CA‑170 reached Phase II but was discontinued; BMS’s small‑molecule candidates never progressed beyond Phase I; Aurigene’s efforts have not produced clinical data.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The structural knowledge of the PD‑1/PD‑L1 interface would accelerate small‑molecule discovery.  
  **Outcome:** *True for academic chemistry* (more crystal structures, better docking tools), but the translation to drug candidates has been limited.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  

The article is a clear, well‑argued snapshot of a niche but strategically important question in immuno‑oncology. Its relevance persists because the “oral checkpoint inhibitor” goal remains a coveted but unrealised target, making the piece a useful historical reference despite the lack of subsequent breakthroughs.
