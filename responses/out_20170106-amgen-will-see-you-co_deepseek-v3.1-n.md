# Amgen Will See You In Court - Again (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a high-stakes patent battle in the pharmaceutical industry involving Amgen's PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha (evolocumab). In January 2017, a federal judge granted Amgen's request for a permanent injunction against Regeneron and Sanofi, ordering them to stop selling their competing PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab). This followed a jury verdict finding that the companies had infringed Amgen's patent covering a specific epitope on PCSK9 antibodies.

The article highlights the rarity of such injunctions in patent cases and questions whether the ruling would hold up under the four-factor test established by eBay v. MercExchange requiring proof of irreparable injury, inadequate legal remedies, balance of hardships, and consideration of public interest. The case represented a pivotal moment in the commercialization race for PCSK9 inhibitors, which were seen as promising new cardiovascular drugs that could significantly lower LDL cholesterol.

## 2. HISTORY

The PCSK9 patent litigation took several dramatic turns after January 2017:

**Legal Developments:**
In January 2017, the injunction was stayed pending appeal. In January 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit largely upheld the infringement verdict but remanded the case back to the district court to reconsider the injunction using the proper four-factor eBay test. Subsequently, the district court stayed the injunction, allowing Praluent to remain on the market, and the parties eventually reached settlement agreements.

**Clinical Outcomes:**
The clinical promise of PCSK9 inhibitors was validated when major cardiovascular outcomes trials showed clear benefits:
- **FOURIER trial (2017)**: Repatha demonstrated a 15% reduction in major cardiovascular events, meeting its primary endpoint.
- **ODYSSEY Outcomes trial (2018)**: Praluent showed a 15% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events.

**FDA Approvals and Market Impact:**
Both drugs received expanded FDA approvals for cardiovascular risk reduction in 2017-2019. Despite proven efficacy, market uptake was significantly limited by high costs ($14,000+ annually) and payer restrictions requiring prior authorization. By 2022-2023, biosimilar competition emerged and combined sales for both drugs plateaued at approximately $2-3 billion annually, falling well short of the initial multi-billion dollar blockbuster projections.

**Current Status:**
The legal battles resulted in ongoing royalty payments but did not significantly alter competitive dynamics. PCSK9 inhibitors remain niche treatments used primarily for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or those who cannot tolerate statins. The expensive litigation contributed to the drugs' high costs and likely limited broader patient access.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions that can be evaluated:

• **"Whether or not [the injunction] stays in force during the appeals process"** - The injunction was indeed stayed and ultimately not enforced, allowing Praluent to remain on the market throughout the appeals process. ✓ Accurate uncertainty acknowledged

• **Implicit prediction of dramatic courtroom battles** - The legal battles continued but eventually settled, representing business litigation rather than a complete market shutdown. Partially accurate

• **Implicit prediction about PCSK9 outcomes trials needing to demonstrate actual benefits** - The outcomes trials did succeed, validating that PCSK9 inhibition provides real-world cardiovascular benefits beyond just LDL lowering. ✓ Accurate

• **Implicit prediction about dramatic uncertainty in cardiovascular outcomes** - The uncertainty was resolved with positive outcomes data published later in 2017-2018. ✓ Resolved

• **Implicit expectation of market landscape transformation** - The injunction did not actually result in Amgen gaining competitive advantage or market exclusivity. The predicted legal resolution through appeals occurred. ✓ Accurate

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in biopharma patent law during a critical window when the future of PCSK9 commercialization hung in the balance. While the injunction ultimately did not stand, the case established important precedent for antibody epitope patents and illustrated how legal battles can significantly impact drug pricing and patient access, making it highly relevant for understanding the intersection of intellectual property and patient care in the pharmaceutical industry.
