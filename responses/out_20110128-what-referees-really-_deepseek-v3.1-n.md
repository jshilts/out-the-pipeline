# What The Referees Really Think (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a blog post highlighting how the journal *Environmental Microbiology* published a collection of anonymous peer reviewer comments from the previous year. The journal took the unusual step of sharing both positive and negative feedback received during the peer review process. The examples provided include harsh criticisms of manuscript quality, such as complaints about terrible writing styles, poor science, and inadequate datasets. The author expresses appreciation for this transparency and wishes more journals would follow this practice of revealing what referees really think about submitted work.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2011 article, transparency in peer review has seen mixed developments:

**Increased transparency initiatives:**
- Several platforms began experimenting with open peer review, including Publons (acquired by Web of Science in 2017), which allowed reviewers to get credit for their work
- Some journals like BMJ and BMC series adopted transparent peer review where reviewer reports and author responses are published alongside articles
- Preprint servers like bioRxiv and arXiv made research available before formal peer review

**However, the core peer review system remained largely unchanged:**
- Most journals continued traditional single-blind or double-blind review processes
- Review quality and consistency remained ongoing concerns in the scientific community
- The rise of predatory journals further complicated the peer review landscape

**Business developments:**
- The peer review management market expanded with companies like ScholarOne, Editorial Manager, and Aries Systems providing platforms
- Publons grew as a reviewer recognition platform before being acquired

By 2011-2024, while some transparency experiments continued, the fundamental anonymous peer review system described in the article remained the dominant model in most scientific publishing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction:** The author's wish that "more journals did this" suggested hope for greater transparency in peer review.
  
**Actual outcome:** While some journals adopted transparent peer review practices, the majority maintained traditional anonymous review systems. The movement toward transparency was gradual and limited rather than widespread adoption.

- **Implicit prediction:** That sharing reviewer comments would be valuable and appreciated by the scientific community.

**Actual outcome:** Transparent peer review did gain some traction, with studies showing benefits for early career researchers and improved review quality, but implementation remained patchy across different fields and publishers.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This blog post provides minor historical insight into early transparency efforts in peer review, but addresses a relatively narrow topic with limited long-term impact on biotechnology or broader scientific developments. It's more of a passing commentary than a substantive article about the field.
