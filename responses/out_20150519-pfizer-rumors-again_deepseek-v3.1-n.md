# Pfizer Rumors, Again (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary addresses recurring rumors that Pfizer might acquire GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The author expresses skepticism about such mega-mergers in the pharmaceutical industry, noting that while these large M&A deals often appear "insane" to them, many get completed anyway. The article speculates that the rumors may be driven by Wall Street firms anticipating massive fees from such a large transaction. The author hopes nothing substantial comes of these rumors.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 Pfizer-GSK merger rumors did not materialize. However, Pfizer's subsequent M&A activity followed a different trajectory:

**What actually happened:**
- **2016**: Pfizer pursued Allergan in a $160 billion deal that ultimately collapsed due to US Treasury regulations targeting tax inversion deals
- **2019**: Pfizer completed a much different strategic move - spinning off its Upjohn division (established drugs) and merging it with Mylan to form Viatris, while Pfizer focused on innovative medicines
- Pfizer continued smaller, strategic acquisitions in areas like oncology (Array BioPharma in 2019 for $11.4B)

**GlaxoSmithKline developments:**
- GSK underwent its own major restructuring, including spinning off its consumer healthcare division as Haleon in 2022
- GSK remained an independent company through this period

The biotech/pharma M&A landscape did see significant consolidation in subsequent years, but the specific Pfizer-GSK combination never occurred.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's predictions:**
• *That Pfizer might actually acquire GSK despite seeming "insane"* - **FALSE**: No such deal occurred
• *That Wall Street was driving rumors to generate fees* - **PARTIALLY TRUE**: While investment banks do profit from M&A, no actual deal materialized from these specific rumors

**Broader context**: The author's general skepticism about large pharma M&A was somewhat validated - no transformative mega-mergers on the scale of Pfizer-GSK occurred between major pharmaceutical companies during this period. Instead, most deals were more targeted, strategic acquisitions focused on specific therapeutic areas rather than massive consolidation plays.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a brief industry rumor commentary with little lasting significance. The specific rumor proved false, and the article doesn't provide deeper analysis of the pharmaceutical industry or biotechnology developments. While it captures some contemporary M&A speculation, it lacks the scientific or policy insights that would make it more enduringly interesting.
