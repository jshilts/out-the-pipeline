# Actavis and Namenda (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Actavis's controversial strategy regarding their Alzheimer's drug Namenda (memantine). The company had developed an extended-release (XR) version of the drug and planned to discontinue the original immediate-release formulation to force patients and prescribers to switch to the newer, presumably more profitable version. This tactic, known as a "hard switch" or "forced switch," was criticized as being anti-competitive and harmful to patients who were stable on the original formulation. John LaMattina's Forbes column condemned this approach as damaging to the pharmaceutical industry's reputation. At the time of the article, the issue was in court due to an injunction preventing Actavis from implementing this strategy, with Actavis having appealed the decision.

## 2. HISTORY

The Namenda case became a significant legal and regulatory precedent in pharmaceutical competition and antitrust law. In February 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York permanently enjoined Actavis (which later became part of Allergan through mergers) from discontinuing the original Namenda formulation. The court found that the "forced switch" strategy violated antitrust laws as it was designed to prevent generic competition—once the original formulation was off the market, generic manufacturers would have no reference product to bioequivalent for ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application) approval.

This case established important legal precedents regarding "product hopping" or "forced switching" tactics in the pharmaceutical industry. The court's reasoning was that removing the original formulation from the market before generic entry was anti-competitive because it prevented consumers from accessing lower-cost generic alternatives. 

Memantine (Namenda) itself continued to be available, both as the XR formulation and eventually in generic forms of the immediate-release version. The drug remained one of the treatments for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, though its efficacy has been questioned over time, and treatment guidelines have evolved. The case influenced how pharmaceutical companies approach formulation switches and lifecycle management strategies, making them more cautious about forced discontinuation tactics that could trigger antitrust scrutiny.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that the tactic would "vanish from the earth" if stopped by law**: This proved largely accurate. The court injunction and subsequent legal precedents made pharmaceutical companies significantly more cautious about forced switching tactics. While not completely eliminated, the practice became much less common due to the legal risks established by this case.

• **Prediction that "we'll get worse if this sort of thing continues"**: The legal intervention did prevent the escalation of such tactics. The case created lasting precedent that helped deter similar anti-competitive behavior in the industry.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article captured a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical antitrust law and industry practices. The case established important legal precedents that continue to influence how pharmaceutical companies manage product lifecycle transitions and compete with generic alternatives, making it highly relevant for understanding pharmaceutical regulation and business practices.
