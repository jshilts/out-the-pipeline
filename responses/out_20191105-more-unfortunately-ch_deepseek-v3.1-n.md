# More, Unfortunately, on the Chinese Alzheimer's Drug Approval (November 5, 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's follow-up article examines the controversial approval of GV-971 (sodium oligomannate), an Alzheimer's drug from Chinese company Green Valley Pharmaceuticals. The piece builds on his previous coverage to present additional concerning information that emerged after the initial approval announcement. Lowe reports that Phase II trial data appears not to have reached statistical significance versus placebo, making the progression to Phase III puzzling. The article highlights several red flags: a 2019 conference presentation slide showing a strange 2.54-point ADAS-Cog improvement where the placebo group inexplicably dropped between weeks 24-36; questions about the mechanism of action from microbiome researchers; Green Valley's problematic regulatory history including marketing of a Ganoderma lucidum product with unsupported cancer cure claims that attracted law enforcement attention and lawsuits; and PubPeer concerns about image duplication in publications from the lead author's laboratory at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica. The article expresses even greater skepticism than Lowe's initial piece, characterizing the situation as having multiple red flags.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2019 approval in China, GV-971 (marketed as Oligomannate or 九期一) faced continued scientific scrutiny internationally. The drug was approved in China based on a single 36-week Phase III trial in 818 patients, but regulatory agencies in other countries remained unconvinced. Several groups called for more robust evidence and peer-reviewed publication of the trial data.

In September 2020, Green Valley Pharmaceuticals initiated a global multi-center Phase III clinical trial, partnering with IQVIA to conduct studies across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. This was viewed as an attempt to address the concerns raised about insufficient evidence and potentially support regulatory submissions in other markets.

By 2021, the drug generated significant revenue in China, with reports indicating it achieved sales of several hundred million yuan, demonstrating market adoption within China despite ongoing international skepticism. However, the company faced continued criticism about the quality of evidence and transparency regarding trial data.

In subsequent years, Green Valley expanded its research and conducted additional trials, including studies on COVID-19-related cognitive impairment and other neurological conditions, though Oligomannate remained their primary focus. The broader Alzheimer's field continued to struggle with drug development failures from major pharmaceutical companies, which made the Chinese approval of GV-971 stand out as either a breakthrough or an outlier depending on perspective.

The global Alzheimer's therapeutic landscape evolved significantly with the controversial FDA approval of Aduhelm (aducanumab) in 2021 and Lecanemab in 2023, which brought renewed attention to the challenges of Alzheimer's drug development and regulatory standards. These developments occurred in parallel with ongoing questions about GV-971's mechanism and efficacy data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Lowe expressed several concerns and predictions in the article:
• **Prediction: "I am even less thrilled than I was yesterday about the prospects for this drug"** - This proved accurate in terms of international scientific reception. The drug has not received approval in the US, Europe, or other major markets, and the skepticism Lowe expressed has been shared by much of the international research community.

• **Implication that the drug would face an uphill battle for acceptance due to quality of evidence and company history** - This has been borne out. Despite Chinese approval and domestic sales, the drug has not achieved widespread international scientific acceptance or regulatory approval elsewhere. The concerns about trial data transparency, mechanism of action understanding, and company reputation have continued to be discussed in scientific forums.

• **Suggestion that the planned larger Phase III trial "will be of great interest"** - This predicted significance of future trials has materialized in that Green Valley did initiate global trials, though the results and whether they address the initial concerns remain points of discussion in the field. The international trials represent an attempt to validate the drug using standards expected by Western regulatory agencies.

The article's overall skeptical tone regarding the drug's prospects for broad acceptance has largely aligned with subsequent developments, as GV-971 has remained primarily a Chinese-market product rather than achieving global therapeutic adoption.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article merits moderate-high interest because it highlights important questions about regulatory standards, evidence quality, and transparency in drug approvals, while addressing the persistent challenge of finding effective Alzheimer's treatments. It connects scientific methodology concerns with real-world pharmaceutical and regulatory issues that remain relevant to ongoing debates about drug development and approval processes worldwide.
