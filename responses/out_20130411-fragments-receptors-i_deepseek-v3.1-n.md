# Fragments For Receptors: It Can Be Done (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the emerging possibility of applying fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a major class of drug targets. Prior to the availability of real X-ray crystal structures for these membrane receptors, drug discovery relied heavily on homology modeling and SAR (structure-activity relationship) approaches, which the author describes as not very helpful. With the recent advent of experimental GPCR structures—particularly beta-adrenergic receptors—there was new potential for rational drug design.

The piece highlights a Journal of Medicinal Chemistry report from Heptares Therapeutics (led by Miles Congreve) demonstrating successful fragment-based screening on the beta-1 adrenergic receptor using SPR (surface plasmon resonance) screening, followed by radioligand assays and eventual X-ray crystallography. The researchers identified arylpiperazine fragments as hits. While this represented significant progress, the author characterizes it as a proof-of-concept from world experts in GPCR crystallography, noting that FBDD for GPCRs was not yet ready for widespread application until structures of more difficult receptors became routinely available.

## 2. HISTORY

**GPCR Structural Biology Explosion**: In the years following 2013, GPCR crystallography expanded dramatically. The number of unique GPCR structures grew from approximately 20 in 2013 to over 400 by 2023, covering multiple receptor families including opioid receptors, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, and many others implicated in disease.

**Heptares Therapeutics Development**: Heptares (now part of Sosei Heptares after Sosei Group's acquisition) continued to be a leader in GPCR structure-based drug discovery. The company advanced multiple programs into clinical trials, including:
- HTL0018318 (muscarinic M1 receptor agonist) for dementia/Lewy body dementia (reached Phase 2)
- HTL0009936 and other candidates targeting various GPCRs

**Fragment-Based Drug Discovery Adoption**: FBDD became increasingly established in GPCR drug discovery through the 2010s. Companies like Roche, Novartis, Pfizer, and others successfully applied fragment approaches to various GPCR targets. The methodology evolved beyond just beta-adrenergic receptors to include adenosine receptors, chemokine receptors, and other pharmaceutically relevant targets.

**GPCR Drug Approvals**: Several drugs developed using structure-based approaches (though not necessarily FBDD specifically) reached market approval, validating the broader structural biology approach to GPCR drug discovery. However, I cannot confidently state specific examples of FDA-approved drugs that originated specifically from the fragment-based GPCR work described in this article.

**Technical Advances**: SPR and other biophysical techniques became more robust for GPCR fragment screening. Cryo-EM also emerged as a complementary structural technique for studying GPCR-ligand complexes, providing additional structural information beyond X-ray crystallography.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• "FBDD is still not ready for the spotlight in this field"**: This prediction proved conservative. While GPCR FBDD remained challenging, it became increasingly viable through the mid-to-late 2010s as structural information expanded. Major pharmaceutical companies successfully applied fragment approaches, though it's true that GPCR FBDD never became as routine as FBDD for soluble protein targets like kinases.

**• "Until the structures of more difficult receptors are available with more regularity, I don't think we'll see too much fragment work in the area"**: This prediction was largely accurate. The expansion of GPCR FBDD closely tracked with the availability of new receptor structures. As structures for diverse GPCR families became available (roughly 2015-2020), fragment-based approaches were successfully applied to receptors beyond just beta-adrenergic targets.

**• The author expected continued progress but gradual adoption**: This proved correct. GPCR FBDD remained a specialized technique requiring significant expertise, though the field did advance beyond the proof-of-concept stage described in the 2013 Heptares paper.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important methodological transition point in GPCR drug discovery, correctly identifying both the potential and limitations of FBDD in this challenging target class. The prediction of gradual adoption tied to structural biology progress proved accurate, making this a insightful analysis of a developing field.
