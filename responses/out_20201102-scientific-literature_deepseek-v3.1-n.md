# The Scientific Literature's Own Pandemic (November 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article critiques the decline in scientific publication quality during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying several categories of problematic papers. The author distinguishes between excusable early observational studies conducted under emergency conditions and less defensible publications, including researchers opportunistically rebranding existing work with COVID-19 relevance and papers that would likely never meet normal publication standards. The piece highlights specific examples from watchdog sites Retraction Watch and For Better Science, including duplicate publications of mental health studies and poor-quality Vitamin D research. The article's centerpiece is a detailed critique of an Elsevier-published paper in *Science of the Total Environment* that claims serpentinization-induced magnetic anomalies mediate COVID-19 via magnetic catalysis and recommends jade amulets as protective measures. The author lambasts this paper's scientific methodology, calling for retraction and criticizing all parties involved in its publication.

## 2. HISTORY
The concerns raised in this November 2020 article proved prescient as the pandemic progressed. The paper discussed ("Can Traditional Chinese Medicine provide insights into controlling the COVID-19 pandemic...") was indeed retracted by Elsevier in early 2021 following widespread criticism and the Retraction Watch coverage mentioned in the article. This became part of a broader pattern - Retraction Watch's list of retracted COVID-19 papers grew to over 200 entries by 2022, with prominent cases including the infamous Surgisphere scandal and multiple hydroxychloroquine studies.

The Vitamin D research flood mentioned in the article did indeed complicate the scientific picture. Subsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest benefits for severe outcomes but no definitive preventive effect. The controversy continues, illustrating how poor-quality research can obscure genuine scientific questions.

The predatory and low-quality journal issue worsened during the pandemic. Elsevier's *Science of the Total Environment*, the journal that published the jade amulet paper, faced significant criticism but continues to publish. However, the incident contributed to broader conversations about journal quality standards and the need for better peer review processes, though structural reforms have been limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **The retraction list "will surely grow ever longer"** - Confirmed. Retraction Watch's COVID-19 retraction list exceeded 200 papers by 2022, including major scandals like the Surgisphere papers in *The Lancet* and *NEJM*.

• **Early observational studies being superseded by larger, more controlled ones** - Confirmed. The RECOVERY trial and other large RCTs provided definitive answers on many early hypotheses, validating some early observations (dexamethasone) while disproving others (hydroxychloroquine).

• **Implied prediction that low-quality work would make it harder to determine Vitamin D's actual effects** - Confirmed. The subsequent literature remained highly contradictory, and major health organizations did not adopt routine Vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 prevention despite ongoing research.

• **That extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence** - The magnetic catalysis paper was retracted, confirming it lacked sufficient evidence, though this represents continued application of existing scientific principles rather than a new development.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This article identified an important secondary effect of the pandemic on scientific publishing that continued to worsen, making it more prescient than many contemporary analyses. The specific examples and broader trends it highlighted proved representative of larger problems in academic publishing and research quality during crisis conditions.
