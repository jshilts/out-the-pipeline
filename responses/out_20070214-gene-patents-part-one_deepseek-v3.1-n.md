# Article Title (February 2007): Genes As Chemicals

## 1. SUMMARY

The article explores the complex legal and scientific questions surrounding gene patents, specifically focusing on "composition of matter" patents for isolated genes. The author uses analogies with industrial polymers and natural polymers (like silk and cotton) to illustrate the philosophical and practical challenges of patenting DNA sequences. The piece argues that while isolated genes are technically different from their natural state (making them potentially patentable), their enormous size and the fact that they exist in nature creates a conceptual dilemma. The author discusses key patent law concepts like the "doctrine of equivalents" and utility requirements, noting how DNA's unique properties—structurally simple enough to isolate but complex enough that small changes create dramatically different functions—make it particularly suited for intellectual property disputes. The article references tightening regulations around utility requirements in the 1990s, when broad gene patent applications with vague proposed uses were common.

## 2. HISTORY

The gene patent landscape underwent dramatic changes after this 2007 article was published, culminating in one of the most significant biotechnology legal decisions in history. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.*, ruling that isolated human genes could not be patented because they were "products of nature." The Court held that merely isolating a gene sequence from its natural environment did not constitute sufficient human invention to warrant patent protection. However, the decision preserved patent eligibility for complementary DNA (cDNA), synthetic sequences, and diagnostic methods that used natural genes.

This landmark decision invalidated thousands of existing gene patents and significantly altered biotech business models that had relied on gene patent exclusivity. Companies like Myriad Genetics, which had built diagnostic testing businesses around patented BRCA1/BRCA2 genes (for breast cancer risk assessment), faced immediate competition from other laboratories once the patents were struck down. The ruling affected not just cancer diagnostics but the entire landscape of genetic testing, including tests for inherited conditions, pharmacogenetics, and carrier screening.

In terms of real-world implications, the Myriad decision led to a proliferation of genetic testing options, reduced costs for many genetic tests, and increased patient access. However, it also created challenges regarding standardization of testing quality across multiple laboratories and interpretation consistency. The diagnostic industry adapted by focusing more heavily on method patents, software-based interpretation algorithms, and proprietary databases rather than raw gene sequence patents.

For the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the ruling necessitated a strategic shift toward more complex intellectual property protection strategies, often combining multiple patent types (methods, formulations, delivery systems, synthetic sequences) rather than relying solely on composition-of-matter claims for naturally-occurring sequences.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction about gene patent continuation**: The article suggested that gene patenting would continue to be controversial and legally complex. → **Outcome**: Correct—the controversy culminated in the 2013 Supreme Court ruling, but the complexity continues as lower courts grapple with applications of the decision to related technologies.

• **Prediction about utility requirements**: The author noted that utility requirements had been tightened since the 1990s shotgun approach to gene patenting. → **Outcome**: Partially accurate—while utility requirements remained important, the Supreme Court decision made the issue largely moot for isolated natural genes by rendering them unpatentable regardless of utility.

• **Implicit prediction about business models**: The article suggested that gene patents would continue being valuable assets subject to "intellectual property wrangling." → **Outcome**: The Supreme Court ruling dramatically disrupted this prediction by invalidating the foundation of many gene-based business models, forcing adaptation to new IP strategies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article shows strong analytical foresight in identifying fundamental tensions in gene patent law that would soon explode into Supreme Court litigation. The technological and legal analysis remains highly relevant for understanding today's synthetic biology, CRISPR, and personalized medicine patent debates, even though the specific legal framework changed dramatically soon after publication.
