# What Can Academia Do? (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article argues that academic scientists should generally avoid direct drug discovery, as modern drug development demands broad, specialized resources (medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, molecular biology, toxicology, formulation chemistry, modeling, scale-up) that are more efficiently organized within companies than cobbled together from postdocs and graduate students. Instead, academia can best contribute through foundational research that uncovers new drug targets and by tackling fundamental pharmaceutical challenges. The author particularly highlights poorly understood yet critical areas: pharmacokinetics, oral availability, human versus animal toxicology, better disease models, dosing large proteins, improved formulations, predicting blood-brain barrier penetration, and active transport mechanisms. Progress in these areas, while difficult, would yield huge value and could garner both funding and recognition.

## 2. HISTORY

Over the years following 2007, several of the challenges outlined in the article saw meaningful, though uneven, progress. Pharmacokinetics and oral availability became major domains for academic and industry collaborations, driven by improved in vitro models (e.g., Caco-2, PAMPA, more sophisticated liver microsomes), better LC–MS sensitivity, and wider use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. BBB penetration prediction evolved with in silico models, MDCK-MDR1 assays, and later human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain endothelial cells, though prediction remains probabilistic rather than deterministic.

Taxol-like formulation hurdles spurred academic and industrial work on nanoparticles, liposomes, and alternative solvents/surfactants (e.g., cremophor-free paclitaxel formulations such as Abraxane gained traction post-2007). Large-protein dosing advanced via subcutaneous delivery technologies, Fc-fusion strategies, and later long-acting formulations and gene therapies, partly enabled by academic research in protein engineering and delivery. Human versus animal toxicology gained sharper focus after high-profile failures; microdosing, organ-on-a-chip, and later organoids helped, though translation remains challenging.

Better disease models gained momentum with patient-derived xenografts, genetically engineered mouse models, humanized mice for immuno-oncology, and, by the mid-2010s, CRISPR-engineered models and organoids. Active transport understanding progressed through transporter- transfected cell lines, proteomics for transporter abundance, and functional imaging, though species differences remain a key source of attrition.

For academic–industry interaction, models matured beyond simple target discovery: target-validation platforms, phenotypic screening campaigns, open-data initiatives (e.g., NIH Molecular Libraries Program), and precompetitive consortia (e.g., IMI, SGC) addressed shared roadblocks. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) and machine learning entered academic toolkits to tackle the same inefficiencies the article described. Despite this, many drug programs still fail for the exact reasons cited in 2007, indicating that progress has been incremental rather than revolutionary. Approved drugs emerging directly from academic screens remained relatively rare, but academic targets and disease biology insights continued to seed industry pipelines and, occasionally, approvals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Academia should avoid large-scale drug discovery and instead focus on basic research and mechanistic understanding.**
  - Comparison: This largely held true. Most small-molecule drug discovery and clinical development still occurs in industry. Academia provided new targets, mechanisms, biomarkers, and enabling tools rather than end-to-end drug programs. Consortia and translational centers reduced the friction between academic findings and industrial development, but the core resource-intensive integration remained industry-led.

- **Academic progress on pharmacokinetics, oral availability, and toxicology would be valuable and gain recognition.**
  - Comparison: Validated. Academic work on transporter biology, PBPK, organ-on-a-chip, toxicogenomics, and computational ADME/Tox found uptake in industry practices. Many investigators in those areas garnered significant funding and recognition without necessarily inventing drugs themselves.

- **Making improvements in disease models and dosing of proteins would repay the effort.**
  - Comparison: Partially realized. Disease models improved (organoids, CRISPR, humanized mice), but predictive validity remains incomplete. Protein dosing evolved (better formulations, Fc fusion, sc dosing), yet high costs and frequency of administration still limit broad access for some biologics. Advances were steady rather than transformative.

- **Better formulations for insoluble compounds and control of anaphylaxis risk would help.**
  - Comparison: Mixed. Cremophor-free paclitaxel formulations lowered hypersensitivity risks, but did not eliminate all toxicities. Nanomedicine and nanoparticle formulations made headway but still face regulatory, scale-up, and heterogeneity hurdles. Novel excipients are often constrained by safety and regulatory precedent.

- **Predicting blood-brain barrier penetration and active transport would be high-impact.**
  - Comparison: Progress was made. In silico and in vitro tools got much better, yet reliable quantitative prediction remains elusive. Species differences in efflux/uptake still cause late-stage failures. Academic efforts refined assays and concepts but did not deliver fully predictive platforms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This commentary was prescient in identifying the specific development-phase bottlenecks that persistently plagued pharma; the issues it raised remained central to attrition and cost for many years after 2007, lending it lasting relevance.
