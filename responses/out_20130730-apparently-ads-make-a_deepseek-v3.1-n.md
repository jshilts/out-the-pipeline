# Apparently, Ads Make Antihistamines Work Better (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a PNAS paper from researchers at the University of Chicago titled "Advertisements impact the physiological efficacy of a branded drug." The study conducted two randomized clinical trials examining how direct-to-consumer advertising affects the physiological effectiveness of Claritin, a leading antihistamine.

The key finding was that exposure to Claritin advertisements significantly increased the drug's efficacy—but only in subjects without actual allergies. Among non-allergic participants, those exposed to Claritin ads showed substantially greater drug efficacy at 120 minutes compared to those shown Zyrtec ads or control ads. This effect correlated with changes in beliefs about the drug's effectiveness. However, in participants with actual allergies, the advertisements had no significant positive impact on Claritin's efficacy, and curiously showed a slight negative effect at 60 minutes. The mechanism appeared to work through influencing subjects' beliefs about the drug's potency, creating a form of branded placebo effect that manifested in measurable physiological responses to a histamine skin challenge.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 PNAS study by Shiv et al. represents a landmark investigation into how marketing influences drug efficacy through psychological mechanisms, but it did not fundamentally change drug advertising practices or regulatory oversight. Direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising has remained largely unchanged in the United States since this publication, with the FDA maintaining its existing framework without implementing major reforms related to efficacy claims.

The antihistamine market continued evolving independently of these findings. Claritin (loratadine) remained available over-the-counter, while newer antihistamines like Xyzal (levocetirizine) and Allegra (fexofenadine) gained market share. Merck continued marketing Claritin, but there's no evidence this research influenced their specific advertising strategies or that they claimed enhanced efficacy through advertising exposure.

Importantly, this line of research did not lead to FDA-approved drugs that explicitly leverage advertising-enhanced efficacy. No pharmaceutical company has obtained approval to market drugs with claims that advertising improves their physiological performance, as the regulatory pathway for such claims would be complex and unprecedented.

The broader placebo effect research field has continued to grow, with ongoing studies into expectation-modulated drug responses, but the specific advertising-mediated efficacy pathway explored in this paper has not become a standard consideration in clinical trial design or drug approval processes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The commentary speculated about several potential developments:

• **Follow-up studies would emerge**: ✓ **PARTIALLY FULFILLED**  
  While the placebo effect field has expanded, there hasn't been a major stream of research specifically replicating or extending the advertising-efficiency connection. The University of Chicago team published their findings, but this didn't spawn a robust subfield of advertising-enhanced drug efficacy studies.

• **Understanding whether ads make drugs work better or competitor ads make them work worse**: ✗ **NOT ADDRESSED**  
  The specific mechanism question posed in the commentary has not been systematically resolved in subsequent literature. The complex interplay between positive expectations from product ads versus negative interference from competitor ads remains largely unexplored in this context.

• **Translation to real-world conditions and other therapeutic classes**: ✗ **NOT DETERMINED**  
  There's no evidence that this effect has been demonstrated in real-world clinical settings across different drug classes. Pharmaceutical companies have not widely adopted advertising strategies based on claimed efficacy enhancement.

• **Economic or public health implications**: ✗ **NOT QUANTIFIED**  
  The cost-benefit analysis suggested in the commentary has not been systematically evaluated. The potential public health benefit (if any) of advertising-enhanced drug efficacy remains theoretical and unmeasured.

• **Regulatory or industry practice changes**: ✗ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**  
  The commentary wondered if this research would influence how drugs are marketed or regulated. No significant changes to FDA advertising guidelines or industry practices have emerged from these findings.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an intriguing question about the intersection of psychology and pharmacology, but the ultimate real-world impact and follow-up research have been limited. The topic has niche academic interest but hasn't translated into clinical practice, regulatory changes, or broader scientific understanding of drug efficacy mechanisms.
