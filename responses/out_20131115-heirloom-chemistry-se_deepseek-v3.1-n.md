# The Heirloom Chemistry Set (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the "Heirloom Chemistry Set" project on Kickstarter, which was an attempt to recreate classic chemistry sets from 50-60 years prior. The author had previously recommended Thames and Kosmos chemistry sets and now highlighted this new retro-style option for science-minded young people. However, the article raised concerns about a disclaimer from the manufacturer noting that "some states do frown on its citizens owning chemical glassware," specifically mentioning standard lab equipment like Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers, and graduated cylinders. The author questioned whether owning such basic scientific glassware could actually lead to legal trouble, expressing skepticism that typical illicit drug producers would use proper laboratory glassware.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 article, the Heirloom Chemistry Set successfully funded on Kickstarter, raising over $440,000 from more than 3,700 backers, far exceeding its $35,000 goal. The product launched commercially and operated successfully for several years. However, the concerns raised about glassware regulations proved relevant as various US states (including Texas and Tennessee, among others) do have laws regulating laboratory glassware ownership, often enacted as part of anti-methamphetamine legislation. These laws typically allow educational purchases but can require documentation or be subject to local interpretation. The education-focused chemistry set market has continued to evolve since 2013, with both retro-style sets like the Heirloom and modern alternatives from Thames and Kosmos coexisting. The fundamental tension between encouraging STEM education through hands-on chemistry and regulatory concerns around controlled substance production has persisted, with manufacturers navigating varying state requirements while trying to provide educational materials. The Heirloom Chemistry Set represents part of a broader 2010s trend toward nostalgic, hands-on STEM education tools, though regulatory landscape remains complex for chemistry set manufacturers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

*The original article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It primarily raised immediate questions about glassware regulations rather than forecasting future trends in chemistry education, STEM toys, or regulatory policy.*

## 4. INTEREST

**4 out of 9**

The article addresses an important intersection of STEM education and regulatory policy, capturing a specific moment in chemistry set evolution and highlighting legitimate concerns about legal barriers to educational science equipment.
