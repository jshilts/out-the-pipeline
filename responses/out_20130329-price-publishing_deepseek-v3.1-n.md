# The Price of Publishing (Mar 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 commentary examines the economics of scientific publishing, focusing on the costs and profits associated with academic journal publishing. The article cites a Nature overview that reports the science-publishing industry generated $9.4 billion in 2011, publishing approximately 1.8 million articles at an average revenue of $5,000 per article. Profit margins were estimated at 20-30% for the industry overall, with specific examples showing Wiley reporting 40% pre-tax profits (though noting that allocating shared services costs would halve this), Elsevier at 37-50% margins for STM publishing, Hindawi reaching 50% profit on open-access articles, and Nature declining to disclose its margins. The author notes that scientific publishing appears "slightly less risky" than drug discovery and expresses intention to analyze pharmaceutical profit margins in future writing.

## 2. HISTORY
Several significant developments in scientific publishing occurred after this 2013 article:

**Policy Changes**: The most impactful development was the evolution of open access mandates. The 2013 Obama administration memo requiring federal agencies to develop public access plans accelerated the shift, culminating in the 2022 OSTP "Nelson Memo" requiring immediate public access to federally funded research by 2026. The Plan S initiative launched in 2018 by European funding agencies required immediate open access for funded research. Major funders like the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation adopted similar policies.

**Market Evolution**: The open access market expanded significantly post-2013. Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) grew from ~4,500 journals in 2013 to over 17,000 by 2022. Article Processing Charges (APCs) became standard, with PLOS ONE charging $1,595 in 2013 (later increased to $2,290), and many prestige journals adopting hybrid models with APCs ranging from $3,000-5,000+. BioRxiv launched in 2013 and grew substantially for life sciences preprints.

**Publisher Consolidation and Innovation**: Traditional publishers adapted through acquisitions (Elsevier acquired SSRN, bepress) and launching new OA journals. New models emerged including preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv), mega-journals (Scientific Reports expanded), and institutional repositories. However, concerns about predatory journals also grew substantially, with estimated thousands of such journals operating by the late 2010s.

The article's financial figures remained broadly reflective of industry economics, though exact margins varied. The fundamental tension between publishing as business vs. research dissemination infrastructure persisted, but open access became increasingly institutionalized rather than marginal.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The 2013 article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions, instead presenting a snapshot analysis of publishing economics at that time. The author mentioned planning "a big post on pharmaceutical profit margins" which would "sound like an accounting seminar," but this appears to have been editorial commentary about future writing plans rather than predictive analysis.

 No specific predictions about publishing industry evolution, drug discovery outcomes, or related policy developments were included that could be systematically evaluated against subsequent events.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article provides useful economic context about scientific publishing during a transitional period when open access was gaining momentum. While it helped document industry economics, it was more descriptive than prescient about the major transformations that would follow.
