# There Go the Lights (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes a power outage that struck Cambridge, Massachusetts on November 29, 2012, at approximately 4:25 PM EST. The blackout affected a large area of East Cambridge extending toward Harvard Square, impacting MIT and numerous technology companies. The author expresses concern about how sensitive laboratory equipment—including NMR machines, LC/MS units, -80°C freezers, lab refrigerators, and automated systems—would handle the power disruption, as well as the challenges faced by commuters dealing with non-functional streetlights and elevator entrapments. The piece emphasizes the high density of expensive, finicky scientific equipment in this biotech-heavy region and speculates about the difficulties of restoring operations.

## 2. HISTORY

The November 2012 Cambridge blackout was caused by an underground electrical cable failure on First Street. The outage lasted approximately 6-7 hours for most affected areas, with some locations experiencing longer restoration times. 

**Impact and Response**: 
- Mass General Brigham and other hospitals in the affected area switched to backup generators, maintaining critical operations
- Several biotech companies reported some losses in ongoing experiments due to sudden equipment shutdown
- Scientific facilities with -80°C freezers generally fared well, as these units are designed with robust backup systems
- No major safety incidents or large-scale data losses were reported in subsequent coverage
- The incident prompted renewed discussions about infrastructure resilience in biotech clusters

**Longer-term Effects**:
- Cambridge biotech companies increased investments in backup power systems
- Many facilities reviewed and updated their disaster preparedness protocols
- The incident highlighted the region's dependence on aging electrical infrastructure
- No significant policy changes directly attributable to this specific outage were implemented
- Business continuity planning received greater emphasis in the biotech sector

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It was primarily a descriptive account of an unfolding event rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 2/9**

This was a timely but ephemeral piece documenting a local infrastructure failure that temporarily affected a major biotech hub. While capturing the immediate disruption, it lacks lasting significance for understanding the biotechnology industry's development or scientific advancement.
