# Exiting Two Therapeutic Areas (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Bristol-Myers Squibb's announcement that it was restructuring with the loss of approximately 75 jobs and the reorganization of 300 more positions. The company declared it was exiting two major therapeutic areas: neuroscience and diabetes/metabolic disorders.

For neuroscience, the author notes that this field is "famously difficult and specialized" with huge opportunities precisely because success has been so elusive. The article highlights major challenges including poor animal models, expensive and tricky clinical trials, and mechanistic black boxes for diseases like Alzheimer's, chronic pain, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Neuroscience was described as containing "some of the biggest tar pits of drug discovery."

For diabetes, the reasoning was different. Type II diabetes represented a large and growing market, but the therapeutic landscape had become crowded with multiple existing options. Combined with increasingly stringent cardiovascular safety requirements, diabetes had become "not as attractive for new drug development as it was ten or fifteen years ago." Meanwhile, Type I diabetes research was focused on islet cell restoration and potential cures rather than incremental improvements.

## 2. HISTORY

**Bristol-Myers Squibb's Strategic Evolution (2013-2024):**
Following the 2013 announcement, Bristol-Myers Squibb continued to refine its therapeutic focus. The company doubled down on oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular diseases, which became its core areas. This strategic shift proved largely successful, particularly in oncology where the company's immuno-oncology drug Opdivo (nivolumab) became a blockbuster, generating over $8 billion annually by 2021. The company also continued to develop Eliquis (apixaban), a cardiovascular drug that became one of the world's top-selling medications with nearly $12 billion in annual sales.

The decision to exit diabetes coincided with major challenges in that market. Several diabetes drugs faced increased cardiovascular safety scrutiny and some high-profile failures. For example, Merck's TECOS cardiovascular outcomes trial for sitagliptin and concerns around SGLT2 inhibitors' safety profile emerged in subsequent years. The diabetes market did become increasingly competitive with multiple established drug classes and significant pricing pressures. By the mid-2020s, GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) had become dominant, but this represented a different mechanism than what Bristol-Myers Squibb had been pursuing in 2013.

**Neuroscience Drug Development Landscape (2013-2024):**
The neuroscience challenges described in the article proved prescient. Between 2013 and 2024, the field experienced numerous high-profile failures, including:

- **Alzheimer's disease:** Multiple amyloid-targeting drugs failed in Phase III trials. Aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 but had limited clinical benefit and faced insurance coverage challenges. Lecanemab showed modest benefit but with safety concerns.

- **Depression and mental health:** Ketamine-based therapies emerged as a new treatment paradigm, but traditional antidepressant development remained challenging.

- **Parkinson's disease:** Several promising approaches failed to demonstrate significant benefits in clinical trials.

The neuroscience challenges around animal models and clinical trial design largely persisted. The need for large, expensive trials in neuroscience remained a barrier, particularly for small companies.

**Research and Funding Patterns:**
The article's prediction about the neuroscience business model largely held true. Small biotech companies continued to focus on reaching proof-of-concept milestones that would attract larger partners or acquirers. However, the biotech funding environment became more challenging after 2021, with venture capital investment in neuroscience declining along with broader biotech sector contractions. The model of "selling to Big Pharma after Phase II" became even more critical as clinical trial costs continued to escalate.

**Regulatory Changes:**
The FDA did implement some changes to address neuroscience challenges, including adaptive trial designs and patient-focused drug development initiatives. However, fundamental methodological issues in neuroscience research persisted, and the agency maintained rigorous efficacy standards for psychiatric and neurological indications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** "Neuroscience is in a particularly tough spot...the massive clinical trials needed make it nearly impossible for a small company to get serious traction."  
**Reality:** Accurate. Small neuroscience companies continued to struggle with funding expensive clinical trials. Many pursued early-stage development followed by acquisition by larger companies. The neuroscience biotech sector remained challenging with high failure rates.

• **Prediction:** Startups would focus on "getting shiny numbers (and shiny funding) rather than finding out whether the drug has a more solid chance of working"  
**Reality:** Partially accurate. While some companies may have pursued this strategy, the broader neuroscience sector showed genuine scientific advancement in areas like gene therapy, RNA-based approaches, and precision medicine, though clinical success remained limited.

• **Prediction:** Diabetes field "getting undeniably a bit crowded" with "very stringent cardiovascular safety requirements" making it less attractive  
**Reality:** Mostly accurate. The diabetes market did become increasingly competitive with new drug classes (SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists) emerging, and cardiovascular safety remained a major regulatory concern. Many companies reduced or exited diabetes research in subsequent years.

• **Prediction:** Neuro "tar pits" (Alzheimer's, chronic pain) would remain extremely challenging  
**Reality:** Highly accurate. Alzheimer's research continued to have exceptionally high failure rates through 2024, with most trials failing and few drugs showing meaningful clinical benefit.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article demonstrates strong analytical insight into pharmaceutical industry strategic dynamics and accurately identifies fundamental challenges in both therapeutic areas. The author's understanding of neuroscience's structural difficulties and diabetes market pressures proved remarkably prescient, with subsequent events largely validating these assessments.
