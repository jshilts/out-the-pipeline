# Databases and Money (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary warned that the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB)—the NIH‑funded repository for NMR data on proteins, nucleic acids and metabolites—was facing a funding cliff. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) had reduced the BMRB’s grant in 2009 and announced that all external‑center grants would be allowed to expire, leaving the BMRB without guaranteed support after September 2014. The author argued that, despite the BMRB’s clear scientific value, no obvious source of sustainable financing had been identified, and the same problem applied to other NLM‑supported bio‑databases.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Funding after 2014** – Contrary to the article’s implication that the BMRB would shut down, the repository secured new support before the 2014 deadline. In 2015 the NIH’s National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) awarded a multi‑year U24 grant (U24GM113229) to the BMRB as part of the “Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank” program. This grant has been renewed repeatedly (2020, 2023), providing a stable core budget of roughly $2–3 million per year.

**Integration with the wwPDB** – In 2016 the BMRB formally joined the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) partnership, alongside the RCSB‑PDB, PDBe, and PDBj. This collaboration broadened the BMRB’s visibility, linked NMR data to deposited atomic coordinates, and encouraged joint funding proposals. The partnership has been supported by a mix of NIH, European (EMBL‑EBI), and Japanese (JPM) contributions.

**Community uptake** – The BMRB remains the primary public archive for NMR chemical‑shift assignments, restraints, and raw spectra. As of early 2024 it hosts > 30 000 entries, covering > 10 000 distinct biomolecules. Major software suites (e.g., NMRPipe, CcpNmr, SPARKY) and structural‑biology pipelines routinely deposit data to the BMRB. The archive is cited in > 5 000 peer‑reviewed articles since 2015, indicating continued relevance.

**Policy and broader database landscape** – The funding crisis highlighted in 2012 contributed to NIH’s later “Data Management and Sharing” policy (2020) that encourages long‑term stewardship of research data. While the policy does not earmark specific funds for legacy databases, it has prompted many institutes to allocate internal resources to critical repositories, including the BMRB.

**Business/organizational health** – The BMRB’s operating organization, the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Center for NMR Research, has remained intact. No major layoffs or service interruptions have been reported. The site continues to offer free public access, with optional value‑added services (e.g., data validation, custom export) that generate modest revenue.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“The BMRB will have no means of financial support after September 2014 and may have to cease operations.”*  
  **Outcome:** False. The BMRB obtained a new NIH‑NIGMS U24 grant in 2015 and has been funded continuously to the present. The repository is still active and expanding.

- **Implicit prediction:** *“Without a clear funder, the volume of NMR data will outpace any central repository, leading to data loss or fragmentation.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true in the sense that NMR data volumes have continued to grow, but the BMRB’s integration with the wwPDB and ongoing NIH support have prevented major fragmentation. The archive now handles a larger, more diverse dataset than in 2012.

- **Implicit prediction:** *“Other NLM‑supported databases will face the same fate.”*  
  **Outcome:** Mixed. Some NLM‑funded resources (e.g., certain specialized metabolomics databases) have indeed been retired or transferred to other agencies, while others (e.g., PubChem, GenBank) have been re‑funded through different NIH mechanisms. The BMRB’s survival is an exception rather than the rule.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of a funding moment that sparked policy discussion, but its specific alarm about imminent closure proved inaccurate; the broader lesson about sustainable data‑infrastructure funding remains relevant.
