I notice that you've referenced an article from Science Magazine about biotechnology patents, but the full content appears to be missing from your message. The text you included contains only the header, navigation elements, and metadata, but not the actual article content that discusses the patent issues.

Could you please provide the complete article text so I can properly analyze it? I'll need to see the full content where Derek Lowe discusses:

- The specific patent issues he's addressing
- His arguments about patent quality
- The examples he provides
- His predictions or concerns about the trajectory

Once you share the complete article, I'll be happy to provide the thorough analysis you're looking for across all four sections (Summary, History, Predictions, and Interest scoring).
