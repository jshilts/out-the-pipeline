# All The Way Down to the Hydrogens (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a breakthrough in structural determination using electron diffraction to locate hydrogen atoms in small-molecule crystals. While X-ray diffraction is excellent for heavier atoms, it's nearly blind to hydrogen atoms, which are typically added using computational "riding models" rather than being experimentally determined. The article highlights a Science paper demonstrating electron diffraction on tiny crystals (~500 nm) that successfully pinpointed hydrogen positions, including challenging cases like distinguishing between hydroxyl groups (OH) and oxide anions (O⁻), carboxylic acids versus carboxylates, and water versus hydroxide.

The technique offers several advantages over X-ray diffraction: it works on extremely small crystals that would be too small for even synchrotron X-ray sources, and it provides crucial structural information that's fundamentally inaccessible to X-rays. The authors demonstrated this by first confirming a known acetaminophen structure, then solving a novel zeolitic cobalt aluminophosphate material where cobalt atoms exhibited partial site occupancy—a common but difficult structural challenge with important implications for catalytic activity.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2017 publication, microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and related electron diffraction techniques saw significant advancement and adoption:

**Technical Development and Adoption:**
- The 2018-2024 period saw substantial refinement of MicroED methods, with improved instrumentation, lower electron doses to prevent beam damage, and better data processing algorithms.
- Major structural biology centers adopted these techniques for small molecules, peptides, and proteins. The method became particularly valuable in natural product discovery and drug development where only small amounts of crystalline material were available.
- Commercial cryo-electron microscopes increasingly incorporated MicroED capabilities, democratizing access beyond specialized labs.

**Drug Discovery Applications:**
- MicroED has been increasingly used to determine structures of:
  - Natural products with limited availability
  - Small molecule drug candidates
  - Peptide-based therapeutics
  - Polymorph screening in pharmaceutical development
  
**Industrial Catalysts:**
- The ability to determine hydrogen positions in zeolites and other porous materials has advanced catalyst design, particularly for:
  - Petrochemical refining catalysts
  - Environmental catalysis
  - Solid acid catalysts

**Scientific Community Impact:**
- MicroED became a standard tool in structural chemistry and materials science
- The technique reduced dependency on large single crystals, enabling structure determination from materials previously considered uncharacterizable
- Integration with pharmaceutical research accelerated in the early 2020s

However, widespread adoption faced challenges including the high cost of advanced electron microscopes, the need for specialized expertise, and competition from complementary techniques like solid-state NMR.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions and their outcomes:

• **Prediction**: Electron diffraction would become an essential tool for difficult structural problems
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Mostly validated** - MicroED did become important, though primarily in specialized contexts rather than replacing X-ray diffraction universally

• **Prediction**: The ability to see hydrogen atoms would revolutionize understanding of catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, and structural materials
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Partially validated** - The technique contributed to catalyst development, but didn't produce revolutionary breakthroughs in photovoltaics or superconductors

• **Prediction**: These methods would become routine for small crystals that are problematic for X-ray methods
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Validated** - MicroED is now routinely used for nanocrystalline and microcrystalline samples

• **Prediction**: Distinguishing OH vs O⁻, acetic acid vs acetate, water vs hydroxide would have important practical implications
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Validated** - These distinctions proved valuable in both materials science and drug development

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important technical development that has become increasingly relevant to drug discovery and materials science. While electron diffraction didn't revolutionize the entire field of structural determination as dramatically as initially suggested, it has become a valuable specialized tool with concrete applications in pharmaceutical development and industrial catalyst design.
