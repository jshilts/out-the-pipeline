# A Storm in a Teacup (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses GlaxoSmithKline CEO Andrew Witty's characterization of the Sirtris controversy as "a storm in a teacup." Sirtris was a biotechnology company GSK had acquired for $720 million, which was focused on developing sirtuin-activating compounds, most famously resveratrol (found in red wine), as potential longevity and metabolic disease treatments.

The Forbes story referenced in the article highlights ongoing scientific debates about whether the mechanisms Sirtris was pursuing—particularly around sirtuins and their role in extending lifespan—were real and translatable to human therapeutics. The author expresses cautious hope that GSK's investment would prove worthwhile, acknowledging the interesting underlying biology but noting that the controversy would only be settled through clinical trials.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2010 article, the Sirtris story took a disappointing turn:

**Clinical Failures**: GSK's sirtuin-activating compounds failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. The lead compound, SRT501 (a formulation of resveratrol), was abandoned after a Phase II trial for multiple myeloma showed no benefit and some patients developed kidney complications.

**Program Cancellations**: By 2013, GSK had largely dismantled Sirtris's research programs. Several clinical trials were terminated, including studies for diabetes and other metabolic conditions. No sirtuin-activating drugs from Sirtris received FDA approval.

**Scientific Replication Crisis**: Between 2010-2013, multiple laboratories failed to replicate key findings from sirtuin research. Several high-profile papers from prominent Sirtris-associated researchers were found to contain methodological flaws or were retracted, undermining confidence in the fundamental biology.

**Business Outcome**: Sirtris essentially became a cautionary tale in the pharmaceutical industry about the dangers of premature acquisition based on early-stage, hyped science. While GSK absorbed the intellectual property, the promised therapeutic pipeline never materialized.

**Scientific Consensus**: The broader scientific consensus shifted to view the Sirtris story as an example of overstated claims about anti-aging compounds, leading to greater skepticism about sirtuin activators and increased scrutiny of longevity research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The author's predictions/wishes:**
- That good things would come out of sirtuin research
- That GSK hadn't wasted $720 million
- That the story would be settled in the clinic
- Hope that GSK wouldn't need the "good luck" the author feared they might require

**Outcomes versus predictions:**
- The hoped-for good outcomes did not materialize; instead, the clinical data was negative
- GSK essentially wasted the $720 million acquisition cost
- The story was indeed settled in the clinic—but with negative results
- GSK did need the luck, and it didn't arrive

**Implicit predictions in the controversy:**
- **Sirtuin activation as a therapeutic approach:** Failed to translate to clinical benefit
- **Resveratrol or synthetic sirtuin activators as drugs:** No approved products emerged
- **Sirtris technology as valuable pipeline:** The acquisition premium was not justified by outcomes

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a telling moment in biotech/pharma history when major companies were making expensive bets on longevity research. The eventual failure of Sirtris became a case study in separating scientific hype from therapeutic reality, making it highly relevant for understanding research translation challenges.
