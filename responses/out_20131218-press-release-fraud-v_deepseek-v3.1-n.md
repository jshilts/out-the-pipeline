# Press Release Fraud - The Verdict Stands (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article reports that the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of W. Scott Harkonen, the former CEO of InterMune, letting stand his original fraud conviction related to a 2008 press release about the drug Actimmune (interferon gamma-1b). The press release had claimed the drug showed a survival benefit in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients based on a failed Phase III trial that missed its primary endpoint, but highlighted a post-hoc subgroup analysis. Harkonen argued this was protected scientific speech; the government successfully prosecuted it as fraudulent marketing. The legal case hinged on when scientific communication crosses into criminal fraud. The article also notes the impending shutdown of the Pharmalot industry news operation.

## 2. HISTORY
**Pre-2013 background**: InterMune's 2008 press release touted Actimmune's "reduction in mortality by 68%" in IPF based on a retrospective analysis of the INSPIRE trial, which had actually failed its primary endpoint (progression-free survival). Harkonen was convicted in 2009 of wire fraud. The 2013 Supreme Court denial left his conviction intact, requiring him to serve six months of home confinement and pay a $20,000 fine.

**Post-2013 developments**: The Harkonen case became a landmark precedent establishing that selectively presenting subset analyses from failed trials in promotional materials can constitute criminal fraud, even when discussing actual (but cherry-picked) trial data. This significantly influenced FDA enforcement and industry communications standards around post-hoc analyses. Harkonen appealed again in 2014 on different grounds (disclosure of juror deliberations), which was also denied. The case is now frequently cited in compliance training as a clear boundary between scientific debate and fraudulent marketing.

InterMune itself was acquired by Roche in 2014 for $8.3 billion (primarily for their other drug, pirfenidone, which actually was approved for IPF). Actimmune remains FDA-approved only for chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis, not for IPF. No subsequent evidence has emerged supporting Actimmune's efficacy in IPF—confirming that the press release claims were indeed misleading.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction about legal precedent**: The article suggested the Supreme Court's potential ruling would be important for defining boundaries of scientific speech vs. fraud. **Outcome**: While SCOTUS didn't rule (denied cert), the case nevertheless established a strong precedent through its affirmation, with lasting impact on biotech communications. Prediction largely validated.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6/10**

This is an important case study at the intersection of biotech commercialization, statistics, and legal accountability, establishing lasting precedents about data communication ethics, but the core scientific claims were never truly controversial—Actimmune was clearly ineffective for IPF.
