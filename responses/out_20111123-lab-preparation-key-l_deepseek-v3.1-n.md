# Lab Preparation: Key Lime Pie (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a recipe blog post for key lime pie published on the Science magazine website's "Pipeline" blog, authored by Derek Lowe. Written around Thanksgiving 2011, the post presents a detailed laboratory-style procedure for preparing key lime pie, adapted from Cooks Illustrated. The recipe includes specific instructions for zesting limes, preparing a yolk-lime juice-condensed milk filling that sets through acid denaturation of proteins, and making a Graham cracker crumb crust. The author notes the pie's "short half-life" due to popularity and provides substitutions and variations, including humorous comparisons to medicinal chemistry SAR (structure-activity relationships).

## 2. HISTORY
The article had no subsequent impact on biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, FDA approvals, or public policy regarding science or medicine. It was not cited in scientific literature and did not lead to any clinical trials, drug development programs, or changes in laboratory practice. The Microplane zester recommendation remained available on Amazon, continuing to be a popular kitchen tool. The Cooks Illustrated source material continued publishing cooking science content, but this particular blog post did not influence scientific research directions or business developments in biotechnology. No biotechnology companies mentioned in or related to this content experienced growth or failure as a result. The blog "Pipeline" (part of Science magazine's blogs network) continued operating, with Derek Lowe maintaining his commentary on drug discovery and medicinal chemistry through subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There were no predictions about future biotechnology developments, pharmaceutical pipelines, drug approvals, or scientific advances in this article. The post was exclusively focused on cooking methodology and did not contain speculative statements about future trends in science, medicine, or biotechnology.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 0**

This ranks in the bottom 10% of interest for biotechnology analysis because it is a cooking recipe with no relevance to biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, or scientific research impact, despite being hosted on a science magazine website.
