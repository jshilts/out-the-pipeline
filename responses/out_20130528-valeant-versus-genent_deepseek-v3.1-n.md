# Valeant Versus Genentech: Two Different Worlds (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article contrasts two fundamentally different business models in the pharmaceutical industry through the lens of two companies and their CEOs. Valeant, under CEO Mike Pearson (formerly of McKinsey), pursued an aggressive strategy of cutting R&D spending to the bone while focusing on mergers and acquisitions of established treatments generating $10-200 million annually. The underlying philosophy was that most R&D doesn't provide good returns to shareholders. Instead, Valeant would acquire companies, slash costs, and partner with larger firms for drug development while collecting royalties.

This approach is contrasted with Genentech's research-driven model under CEO Art Levinson, which prioritized internal R&D and scientific innovation. The article raises concerns about what would happen if Pearson's strategy became widely adopted—who would conduct the foundational research that companies like Valeant could later acquire? The author notes that while the industry had been moving toward more external partnerships, full adoption of Valeant's approach seemed impractical due to market dynamics and the industry's need to maintain its science-driven public image.

## 2. HISTORY
Valeant's trajectory after 2013 provides a dramatic real-world test of the article's concerns. The company continued its acquisition spree, most notably purchasing Salix Pharmaceuticals for $11 billion in 2015 and pursuing (but failing to acquire) Allergan in 2014. However, the strategy began unraveling in late 2015 when Valeant faced scrutiny over its drug pricing practices and its relationships with specialty pharmacies like Philidor.

The turning point came in 2015-2016 when Valeant became embroiled in major controversies over dramatic price increases for drugs like Isuprel and Nitropress (prices increased by 525% and 212% respectively after acquisition), investigations by Congress, and accounting irregularities. CEO Mike Pearson was eventually forced out in 2016. The company's stock, which had traded above $250 in 2015, plummeted to under $20 by late 2016. Valeant eventually rebranded as Bausch Health Companies in 2018, attempting to distance itself from the Pearson era.

The broader industry did not follow Valeant's extreme approach. While pharmaceutical companies continued to engage in M&A activity and increasingly partnered with smaller biotech firms, most maintained substantial internal R&D operations. Companies like Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, and Roche continued investing billions annually in research, though they also pursued strategic acquisitions (such as Pfizer's $14 billion acquisition of Medivation in 2016 and Bristol-Myers Squibb's $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019).

The biotech industry did see consolidation, but the fundamental ecosystem of startups conducting innovative research continued thriving. Academic institutions, government funding (NIH budgets remained substantial), and venture capital continued supporting early-stage research that larger companies would later acquire or license. The industry did not devolve into "mounting perplexity and dismay" as the article suggested was theoretically possible.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions about industry trends:

**• Prediction: "I can't imagine the industry going all one way or all the other" and widespread adoption of Valeant's virtual R&D model would cause deal costs to increase dramatically**
- **Outcome**: Correct in that the industry didn't fully shift to Valeant's model, but the mechanism described (deal cost increases) became real. Valuations for biotech companies with promising assets did increase significantly through the 2010s, though this was driven more by investor enthusiasm and low interest rates than by companies adopting Valeant-like strategies.

**• Prediction: Small startups are "the triumph of hope over experience" but remain necessary for innovation**
- **Outcome**: Mixed validation. Startups continued to have high failure rates as predicted, but they remained crucial to the ecosystem. However, the rise of new funding mechanisms (including crossover funds, SPACs, and continued venture capital) suggested investors continued seeing potential returns despite the risks.

**• Implicit prediction: Valeant's strategy would face challenges as described by Shayvitz**
- **Outcome**: Highly accurate. Valeant's aggressive approach did prove unsustainable due to public backlash, regulatory scrutiny, and ultimately the mathematical implausibility of endless cost-cutting without underlying value creation. The company became a cautionary tale about short-term financial engineering versus long-term value creation through innovation.

**• Implicit prediction: The Genentech model would prove more sustainable**
- **Outcome**: Largely confirmed. Genentech's parent company Roche continued to be highly successful with a strong R&D pipeline. Other research-focused companies like Regeneron, Vertex, and Alnylam also demonstrated that substantial internal R&D could generate both scientific breakthroughs and shareholder value.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article was remarkably prescient in identifying the fundamental tensions in pharmaceutical business models and accurately predicting the potential pitfalls of Valeant's approach, making it highly relevant to understanding how the industry actually evolved over the subsequent decade.
