# Pfizer Bails on PCSK9 antibodies (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article reports on Pfizer's November 2016 decision to discontinue development of bococizumab, its PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for cardiovascular disease. The company had invested substantial resources in the drug, having completed at least four of six planned Phase III trials involving 17,000 patients. However, Pfizer discovered that bococizumab induced an immune response that gradually reduced its effectiveness over time, coupled with higher rates of injection-site reactions compared to existing competitors. With two other PCSK9 inhibitors already on the market (Repatha and Praluent), Pfizer concluded the drug would "not likely provide value to patients, physicians, or shareholders," marking a significant late-stage pipeline loss.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2016 discontinuation, the PCSK9 inhibitor landscape continued to evolve:

**Market developments for remaining drugs:**
- **Repatha (evolocumab, Amgen)** and **Praluent (alirocumab, Sanofi/Regeneron)** remained the only marketed PCSK9 inhibitors. Both were FDA-approved in 2015.
- **Clinical outcomes trials:** The FOURIER trial (Repatha, 2017) and ODYSSEY Outcomes trial (Praluent, 2018) demonstrated significant cardiovascular risk reduction, converting coverage and physician acceptance.
- **Pricing challenges:** Initially priced at $14,000+ annually, both drugs faced limited uptake due to payer restrictions. Major price reductions followed: Repatha dropped to approximately $5,850 annually by 2018, with patient assistance programs improving access.

**Commercial impact:**
- Combined PCSK9 inhibitor sales reached approximately $1.5-2 billion annually by 2021, representing slower-than-expected adoption despite proven efficacy.
- Market expansion occurred primarily through improved payer coverage and outcomes data, rather than new drug approvals.
- No additional PCSK9 antibodies received FDA approval after 2015, validating Pfizer's assessment of the competitive landscape.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events. The analysis focused instead on explaining Pfizer's strategic decision in light of existing market conditions and observed clinical problems with bococizumab.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **6/10**
The article illuminates a critical moment in PCSK9 inhibitor development, showing how late-stage failures occur even in major pharmaceutical companies, with relevance to drug development economics and competitive market dynamics.
