# A Bad Assay: Better Than None? (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2007 commentary critiques the Caco-2 cell assay, a widely used in vitro model in drug development intended to predict oral absorption and efflux transport. The assay uses a human colon cancer cell line grown as a monolayer to mimic the gut-blood barrier, measuring passive diffusion and active transport (especially via P-glycoprotein). The author describes the assay as prone to yielding noisy, poorly correlating data that fails to reliably predict real-world gut absorption or brain penetration. Key limitations noted include: using colon cells instead of small intestine cells where most absorption occurs; cancer-derived cells losing native functions in culture; and species mismatch when human cell data are used to interpret rodent pharmacokinetics. Despite these shortcomings, the assay continued to be used out of hope rather than proven utility, with published success stories possibly suffering from publication bias.

## 2. HISTORY
After 2007, the Caco-2 assay remained embedded in pharmaceutical screening cascades due to regulatory inertia and the lack of clearly superior alternatives, but its limitations became more widely acknowledged. Industry practice shifted toward using Caco-2 as one imperfect data point among many, rather than a definitive predictor.

Parallel developments occurred:
- **P-glycoprotein (P-gp) research advanced**: Recognition grew that P-gp substrate status is complex and context-dependent; regulatory guidance evolved to recommend P-gp interaction studies during drug development, but with clearer acknowledgement that Caco-2 alone is insufficient.
- **Alternative and complementary assays emerged**: MDR1-MDCK cell models gained traction as more P-gp-specific systems. More sophisticated in vitro tools were developed, including triple-culture blood-brain barrier models and organ-on-a-chip systems that better recapitulate tissue architecture.
- **Computational approaches improved**: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and machine learning gradually supplemented experimental data, though prediction accuracy remained modest.
- **In silico modeling gained ground**: Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling increasingly incorporated multiple data sources to predict absorption and distribution, reducing over-reliance on any single assay.

Despite these advances, no single assay replaced Caco-2 entirely. The assay persists in modern drug discovery as a standardized early screen, but with tempered expectations and greater emphasis on orthogonal validation using multiple methods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made one implicit prediction:
- **Prediction**: That Caco-2 data would continue to show poor correlation with gut absorption and brain levels, and that people would keep running the assay out of hope rather than proven utility.
- **Outcome**: This prediction largely proved accurate. The assay remains in use today despite ongoing recognition of its limitations. Subsequent research confirmed the fundamental issues: Caco-2 permeability shows variable correlation with human intestinal absorption (often 60-80% depending on the compound set), and P-gp efflux ratios from Caco-2 frequently fail to predict brain penetration in vivo. Rather than being abandoned, Caco-2 evolved into a standardized early filter used alongside more sophisticated methods, with the field accepting its role as an imperfect but convenient first-pass screen rather than a definitive predictor.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
While the article insightfully critiqued a flawed but widely used industry assay, its scope was narrow and focused on a single tool rather than fundamental scientific questions or breakthrough technologies. It had limited long-term impact beyond reinforcing what many practitioners already suspected about Caco-2 limitations.
