# The Happiest Darn Drug Company in America (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article sarcastically challenges a Forbes survey that named Pfizer as "the happiest company in America." The author expresses skepticism about this designation, given Pfizer's recent history of major organizational changes and workforce reductions. The tone suggests that calling Pfizer the happiest company seems incongruous with the reality of significant layoffs and restructuring that had been occurring in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly at Pfizer, during that period.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2012 article, Pfizer's actual trajectory proved the "happiest company" designation to be largely disconnected from reality:

**Continued Workforce Reductions**: Between 2012-2019, Pfizer conducted multiple rounds of significant layoffs, cutting thousands of positions globally as part of ongoing restructuring efforts.

**Failed Mega-Merger Attempts**: In 2014, Pfizer attempted a $118 billion acquisition of AstraZeneca, which would have been one of the largest pharmaceutical mergers in history. The deal ultimately failed due to regulatory and political opposition. In 2016, Pfizer pursued a $160 billion merger with Allergan, which also collapsed due to new US Treasury regulations designed to prevent tax inversion deals.

**Strategic Divisions and Restructuring**: In 2019, Pfizer announced it would combine its off-patent drug business with Mylan to form Viatris, effectively splitting into two companies. This created Upjohn (later Viatris) for older drugs and a new Pfizer focused on innovative medicines.

**Real Workforce Sentiment**: Employee satisfaction surveys and glassdoor ratings during this period consistently showed Pfizer ranking in the middle tier of pharmaceutical companies, not at the top. The company faced ongoing challenges with morale due to repeated restructuring and uncertainty about job security.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in the original article - it was primarily commentary on the absurdity of the "happiest company" designation at that moment in time.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 2**

This article serves as a useful case study in how corporate reputation surveys can diverge dramatically from actual employee experiences and company realities, but it lacks broader scientific or medical significance.
