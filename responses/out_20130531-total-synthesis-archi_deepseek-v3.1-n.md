# A Total Synthesis Archive (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2013 blog post highlights a crowdsourced effort by Arash Soheili, who maintained a Twitter account called @Total_Synthesis to track total synthesis publications in major journals. Soheili created a searchable database that aggregated information about natural product total syntheses that was previously scattered across multiple sources. The author positions this as a useful resource for researchers in the total synthesis field, while expressing personal relief at no longer being actively involved in such work.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 article, the landscape of chemical information aggregation evolved significantly:

The **Total_Synthesis Twitter account** has continued operating for over a decade, becoming one of the most widely recognized resources in synthetic organic chemistry. As of 2024, it maintains an active presence with a substantial following from academic and industrial chemists worldwide.

The **searchable database** referenced in the article appears to have undergone several iterations and platform changes. The original bit.ly link no longer resolves to the same resource, which is typical for crowdsourced projects that depend on individual maintainers and evolving web infrastructure.

**Broader impact**: This initiative represented an early example of community-driven scientific information curation in chemistry. However, it preceded the development of more sophisticated automated literature monitoring tools and comprehensive commercial databases. The field has since moved toward institutional solutions for chemical literature management, with major publishers (ACS, RSC, Wiley) and platforms like SciFinder, Reaxys, and PubChem providing more systematic coverage.

**Academic recognition**: No evidence suggests this database achieved widespread institutional adoption or led to major policy changes. It remained a useful niche tool primarily for specialized researchers rather than transforming broader scientific practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction of sustained utility**: The article suggested this resource would be valuable for ongoing research. **Outcome**: While the Twitter account has persisted, the database's functionality appears to have diminished over time as commercial alternatives became more comprehensive.

• **Implicit prediction of methodology adoption**: The database approach implied that systematic tracking of total syntheses would become important. **Outcome**: While the field still values synthesis databases, implementation has shifted toward professionally maintained institutional platforms rather than individual-led projects.

No explicit predictions about biotechnology/pharmaceutical applications were made in the original article.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article concerns a niche information management tool for specialized chemistry researchers and has limited broader relevance to biotechnology or drug development outcomes. While useful to its target audience, it describes infrastructure rather than fundamental scientific advances.
