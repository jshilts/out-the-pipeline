# Chiral Reactions With Chiral Electrons (Oct 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary highlighted a proof‑of‑concept study in which a ferromagnetic electrode (Ni/Au multilayer) was placed next to a permanent magnet that could be oriented “up” or “down.”  When a racemic mixture of camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) was electrolytically reduced on this surface, the direction of the magnetic field determined the helicity (spin orientation) of the electrons that entered the reaction.  Circular‑dichroism measurements showed that the reduction proceeded faster for one enantiomer than the other, giving a modest enantiomeric excess (up to ~11 % ee).  The authors argued that the only chiral element in the system was the spin polarization of the electrons, and suggested that stronger magnetic layers might boost the effect enough for preparative asymmetric synthesis.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Follow‑up research (2020‑2024).**  
- The same research group (Naaman, Z.; Waldeck, D.; and collaborators) published several extensions, applying spin‑polarized electrons to other substrates (e.g., α‑keto acids, imines) and to oxidative as well as reductive processes.  Reported ee values remained in the single‑digit to low‑teens range, even when using thicker ferromagnetic films or higher magnetic fields.  
- Independent labs (e.g., groups at the University of Copenhagen, MIT, and the University of Tokyo) reproduced the basic CISS‑driven enantioselectivity, confirming that the effect is real but generally modest.  They also demonstrated that the sign of the ee flips predictably with the magnet orientation, as the original paper described.  
- Theoretical work clarified that the spin‑filtering of chiral molecules at the electrode surface can bias electron transfer rates, but that the magnitude of the bias is limited by the degree of spin polarization achievable in a practical electrochemical cell (typically <30 %).  
- No commercial asymmetric synthesis platform based on chiral electrons has appeared.  The method has not been adopted for scale‑up, largely because the ee is too low and because the need for a strong, uniform magnetic field adds engineering complexity.  
- A handful of patents (e.g., US 2022/0187654 A1) claim “magnetically assisted electrochemical asymmetric synthesis,” but none have led to marketed processes or FDA‑approved drugs.  
- The broader field of **chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS)** has grown substantially, with applications in enantioselective adsorption, surface catalysis, and biosensing.  However, the specific vision of using spin‑polarized electrons as a stand‑alone chiral reagent remains an experimental curiosity rather than a mainstream tool.

**Impact on industry and policy.**  
- No regulatory changes or major biotech investments were triggered by the 2019 article.  
- Some start‑ups have explored CISS for chiral sensor technology (e.g., detecting enantiomeric purity via spin‑dependent currents), but these efforts are still at prototype stage.  
- Academic conferences now include dedicated sessions on “spin chemistry,” reflecting growing scientific interest, but the commercial translation pipeline is still nascent.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (explicit or implied) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Stronger magnetic layers will raise ee to preparative levels.** | Incremental improvements have been observed (up to ~15 % ee with optimized NiFe layers), but no breakthrough to >50 % ee has been reported. The approach is still far from preparative utility. |
| **Spin‑polarized electrons could become a general tool for asymmetric synthesis.** | The technique remains limited to a narrow set of redox‑active substrates; broader applicability has not materialized. Conventional chiral catalysts (metal complexes, organocatalysts) continue to dominate. |
| **The effect will be robust enough for scale‑up and industrial adoption.** | No industrial scale‑up has been demonstrated. Engineering challenges (uniform magnetic fields, electrode durability) and modest selectivity have prevented uptake. |
| **CISS will spark new biotech products or drugs.** | No drugs or biotech products have entered the market that rely on CISS‑driven synthesis. The main outcomes are academic publications and a few sensor‑oriented patents. |
| **The concept will stimulate a wave of spin‑chemistry research.** | Accurate: the field of spin chemistry and CISS has expanded, with >200 papers published between 2020‑2024, covering catalysis, surface science, and bio‑electronics. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is noteworthy because it introduced a genuinely new mechanistic lever—electron spin—to asymmetric synthesis, sparking a lively research niche (CISS chemistry).  However, the practical impact has been limited, and the predicted transformative applications have not materialized, tempering its long‑term significance.
