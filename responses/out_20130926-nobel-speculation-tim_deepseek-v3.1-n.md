# Nobel Speculation Time (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 commentary reflects on the annual Nobel Prize speculation season, reviewing predictions primarily from Thomson Reuters and the blog Curious Wavefunction. The author discusses several leading candidates for Chemistry and Physiology/Medicine prizes, including Sharpless/Folkin/Finn for click chemistry, Alvisatros/Mirkin/Seeman for DNA nanotechnology, Bruce Ames for the Ames mutagenicity test, single-molecule spectroscopy, nuclear receptors, electron transfer in biological systems, chaperone proteins, and cancer genetics. The piece notes uncertainty in traditional organic synthesis prizes, and suggests physical/analytical chemistry might dominate, or that the committee might recognize DNA sequencing methods or neurotransmitter research.

## 2. HISTORY
The actual 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Martin Karplus (Harvard/Strasbourg), Michael Levitt (Stanford), and Arieh Warshel (USC) for "the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems" - specifically, computational methods combining classical and quantum mechanics to model chemical reactions in biological systems. None of the predictions mentioned in the article were recognized that year.

The Ames test, proposed for recognition, remained a foundational toxicology tool but did not receive a Nobel Prize in subsequent years. DNA nanotechnology has continued developing with applications in drug delivery and materials science, though without Nobel recognition. Nuclear receptor research and cancer genetics saw continued advances, particularly with the rise of precision oncology and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies. The fundamental scientific merit of the predicted areas remains strong, though Nobel recognition follows unpredictable timing and selection criteria.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Click chemistry for Sharpless/Folkin/Finn**: K. Barry Sharpless did win his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2022 (shared with Morten Meldal and Carolyn Bertozzi) for click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry - though this came nine years later and with different co-laureates than the 2013 speculation.

• **DNA nanotechnology prize for Alvisatros/Mirkin/Seeman**: No Nobel Prize has been awarded specifically for DNA nanotechnology as of 2024, though the field has produced important advances including DNA origami and diagnostic applications. The specific individuals mentioned have not received Nobel recognition.

• **Bruce Ames for Ames test**: Ames did not receive a Nobel Prize, though the Ames test remains a standard mutagenicity screening tool used globally in regulatory toxicology.

• **Single-molecule spectroscopy**: No Nobel Prize specifically for single-molecule spectroscopy has been awarded, though single-molecule techniques have become increasingly important in biophysics and structural biology.

• **Nuclear receptors**: No dedicated Nobel Prize for nuclear receptor research has been awarded since 2013, though this field continues to be important in drug development, particularly for cancer and metabolic diseases.

• **Chaperone proteins**: No Nobel Prize specific to chaperone proteins has been awarded since 2013, though protein folding and misfolding research remains active.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article captures the annual Nobel speculation process and provides interesting insight into what prominent scientists and commentators identified as important research areas, though the actual awards proved difficult to predict. The piece's lasting value lies in documenting the disconnect between perceived scientific importance and Nobel selection timing/rationale.
