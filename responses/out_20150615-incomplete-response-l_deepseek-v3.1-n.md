# The Incomplete Response Letter (Jun 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article discusses a BMJ study by FDA authors examining how pharmaceutical companies disclose information about FDA Complete Response Letters (CRLs). A CRL is issued when a New Drug Application has significant problems requiring resolution before approval can be granted.

The study analyzed CRLs from 2008-2013 and compared them to companies' public announcements. Key findings included: 18% of companies issued no press release at all despite CRLs being material events; 21% issued press releases that "did not match any statements from the letters"; of 32 CRLs requiring new clinical trials, 40% of press releases failed to mention this requirement; and of 7 CRLs noting higher mortality in treatment groups, only one press release disclosed this critical safety concern. No company in the 61 cases studied released the complete CRL text. The article argues for greater transparency, noting the FDA's own transparency task force recommended CRL disclosure in 2009.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article's publication, regulatory transparency around CRLs has seen some improvements, though comprehensive reform has been limited.

**FDA Transparency Initiatives:** The FDA has made some information more accessible through databases like Drugs@FDA, but full CRL disclosure has not been implemented. The agency typically publishes approval packages with detailed reviews for approved drugs, while rejected applications generally remain confidential.

**Industry Disclosure Practices:** Public company reporting requirements under SEC regulations (8-K filings) compel disclosure of material events, including regulatory setbacks, but the level of detail varies significantly between companies. Some companies now provide more detailed explanations of CRL content, while others continue the minimal disclosure practices documented in the 2015 study.

**Legislative Efforts:** Various transparency bills have been introduced in Congress over the years, but none have been enacted that mandate complete CRL disclosure. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) focused more on accelerating approval pathways rather than disclosure transparency.

**Academic and Investor Response:** Investor communities and analysts increasingly pressure companies for more transparent communication about regulatory setbacks. However, companies often cite competitive and proprietary concerns as justification for limited disclosure.

The fundamental tension between commercial confidentiality and public/ investor interest in regulatory decisions remains largely unresolved since 2015.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1:** The article implied that increased pressure might lead to regulatory changes requiring CRL disclosure, possibly through Congressional action.
- **Outcome:** No federal legislation mandating CRL transparency has been enacted since 2015. Companies continue operating under existing disclosure requirements, using selective disclosure strategies.

**Prediction 2:** The article suggested someone "needs to" address the transparency gap because "the current system is just not right."
- **Outcome:** While advocacy for transparency continues from investor groups and some policymakers, systematic reform has not occurred. The FDA has not implemented the 2009 transparency task force recommendations regarding CRL disclosure, and companies maintain their selective disclosure practices.

The broader issue highlighted—that companies often minimize or omit critical safety and efficacy concerns when communicating regulatory setbacks—remains relevant today, with notable drug approval controversies continuing to emerge where companies' characterizations differ from regulatory assessments.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **8/10**

This article identifies a persistent and important issue in pharmaceutical regulation and investor communications that remains relevant nearly a decade later, with documented evidence of information asymmetry affecting market participants and potentially public health decisions. The BMJ study it references provided concrete data on disclosure practices, making this more significant than generic transparency advocacy.
