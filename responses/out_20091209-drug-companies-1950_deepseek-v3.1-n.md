# Drug Companies Since 1950 (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper by Bernard Munos (Lilly) analyzing new molecular entity (NME) approvals since 1950. The key findings revealed stark industry concentration: of 4,300 companies engaged in drug innovation, only 261 (6%) had successfully registered at least one NME since 1950, with just 32 surviving the entire 59-year period. The remaining majority failed, merged, or were acquired. 

Most strikingly, 21 companies produced half of all NMEs approved since 1950, but half of those top innovators no longer existed by 2009. Merck led with 56 approvals, followed by Lilly (51) and Roche (50). The author noted concern that no major pharma company had achieved 2-3 NMEs per year—the estimated growth target—suggesting either unrealistic expectations or fundamental productivity challenges. The author speculated about power law distributions in innovation and questioned the methodology behind counting 4,300 companies.

## 2. HISTORY

**Industry Consolidation Accelerated**: The trends identified in 2009 intensified throughout the 2010s. Major mergers included Pfizer-Wyeth (2009), Merck-Schering-Plough (2009), Roche-Genentech (2009), Novartis-Alcon (2010), and numerous others. By 2020, the landscape had consolidated further, with innovation increasingly concentrated among fewer players.

**R&D Productivity Crisis Deepened**: The worrying productivity gap persisted and worsened. Drug development costs continued rising—reaching approximately $2.6 billion per approved drug by 2016 (Tufts Center data). Industry R&D spending increased but output remained stagnant or declined relative to investment. The 2-3 NMEs per year target remained elusive for most companies.

**Emergence of Alternative Innovation Models**: The 2010s saw growth in specialty pharma, biotech startups, and external innovation partnerships as traditional Big Pharma struggled with internal R&D productivity. Companies increasingly relied on acquiring innovation rather than generating it internally. Biotech IPOs surged, particularly after 2013, creating more startup companies but also more M&A targets for larger players.

**FDA Approval Patterns**: NME approvals fluctuated but showed modest improvement in the 2010s, particularly through breakthrough therapy designations and expedited pathways. However, these remained concentrated among relatively few companies, validating the power law distribution concept.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Growth targets are unrealistic" vs. reality**: The author's speculation about hyped growth targets proved largely accurate. Major pharma companies consistently failed to achieve 2-3 NMEs annually throughout the 2010s. Most rely heavily on acquisitions, partnerships, or in-licensing rather than internal pipelines for growth. The industry adapted by accepting lower organic growth and pursuing M&A strategies.

• **Power law distribution in innovation**: This prediction held true and became even more pronounced. Innovation concentration intensified—today approximately 10-15 companies dominate approvals, with many maintaining their positions (Merck, Roche, Novartis) while others disappeared through M&A.

• **Implicit prediction about industry structure**: The massive company count (4,300) being real but mostly inactive proved accurate. The biopharma landscape includes thousands of startups and early-stage companies, but the vast majority never reach approval. The gap between companies "engaged in drug innovation" and those actually producing drugs remains enormous.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified fundamental, persistent challenges in pharmaceutical innovation that remained highly relevant for the subsequent decade. Its analysis of concentration and productivity gaps proved prescient, making it valuable for understanding industry dynamics.
