# Retrospective Analysis: "Two Looks At Drug Industry Productivity" (Science, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine article examines conflicting assessments of pharmaceutical R&D productivity during a period when the industry faced scrutiny over declining returns. The piece analyzes two competing narratives: Richard Evans' report ranking companies by early-stage innovation metrics (patent citations, pioneering therapeutic areas, avoiding "not invented here" syndrome) showed concerning trends, with top rankings going to Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Vertex, Gilead, and Allergan, while established players like Novartis, Bayer, and Lilly ranked at the bottom. 

Simultaneously, the article discusses a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) analysis claiming productivity improvements since 2008, using peak sales divided by R&D spending as their metric—showing the ratio improving from 0.12 in 2008 to 0.29 in 2013. However, the author expresses deep skepticism about whether this represents genuine productivity gains or merely R&D budget cuts that would manifest as fewer approved drugs in subsequent years. The central tension is whether the industry truly turned a corner post-2008 or was simply experiencing statistical artifacts from reduced investment.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) delivered a complex verdict that partially validated both analyses while revealing their limitations. **Company Performance Divergence**: Evans' rankings showed mixed prescience. Bristol-Myers Squibb maintained strong performance through immunotherapy breakthroughs (Opdivo, Yervoy) and its $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019. Gilead's dominance in hepatitis C (Sovaldi, Harvoni) peaked around 2014-2016 but faced pricing pressures and pipeline challenges afterward. Vertex flourished with cystic fibrosis franchise expansion but remained dependent on this therapeutic area. Allergan was indeed gutted post-acquisition—first by Actavis in 2015, then by AbbVie in 2020—largely validating concerns about R&D destruction.

The "bottom-ranked" companies showed surprising resilience: Regeneron, ranked 19th, became a biopharma darling through Dupixent (atopic dermatitis), Eylea extensions, and COVID antibody collaborations, with market cap growing from ~$30B to ~$90B. Novartis, ranked 18th, successfully launched Cosentyx, Entresto, and gene therapies like Zolgensma. Lilly, ranked 21st, experienced dramatic renaissance through Mounjaro/Zepbound (obesity), Verzenio (cancer), and Alzheimer's programs, becoming one of industry's best performers.

**Industry Productivity Trends**: The BCG prediction of sustained productivity gains proved overly optimistic. R&D productivity remained stubbornly challenging, with Tufts CSDD data showing pre-approval R&D costs per new drug rising from $1.1B (2013) to over $2.3B by 2022 (both in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars). However, the industry did achieve genuine breakthroughs in specific modalities: immunotherapy (Keytruda became world's best-selling drug), gene therapies (Luxturna, Zolgensma, Hemgenix), and most dramatically, mRNA vaccines and therapeutics during COVID-19.

**The 2015-2020 Innovation Cycle**: The period saw unprecedented scientific advancement but poor translation to industry-wide productivity metrics. CAR-T therapies, checkpoint inhibitors, and precision oncology delivered clinical breakthroughs, yet biopharma struggled with escalating development costs, regulatory complexity, and payer pressures. The much-hyped "crawl out of the swamp" never materialized at industry scale—instead, winners became more concentrated while laggards faced existential threats.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**
- The author's skepticism about superficial productivity metrics was prescient. Peak-sales-based analysis did indeed prove misleading, as subsequent data showed R&D costs continuing to rise faster than output value.
- The concern that R&D cuts would manifest as reduced drug approvals came true: FDA novel drug approvals dropped significantly in 2016-2019 (22 in 2016, 46 in 2017, 59 in 2018, 48 in 2019) before rebounding partially due to COVID-related urgency.
- The article's caution about "time and chance happening to them all" proved accurate—luck and serendipity remained powerful forces, exemplified by Regeneron's surprising rise from Evans' bottom tier to industry leadership.
- The prediction that Allergan's R&D would be gutted proved entirely correct.

**What the Article Got Wrong:**
- The piece was too pessimistic about companies ranked at the bottom. The analysis failed to anticipate that established players like Lilly, Novartis, and Regeneron would successfully reinvent themselves through strategic pivots and scientific breakthroughs.
- The dismissal of productivity improvements as merely statistical artifacts from R&D cuts underestimated genuine therapeutic advances, particularly in oncology and immunology.
- The article's implicit assumption that early-stage innovation metrics would correlate with future success proved flawed—companies with deep clinical development expertise and commercial capabilities often outperformed "innovative" but commercially inexperienced players.

**Missed Forces:**
The analysis couldn't foresee several transformative developments: the obesity/diabetes drug revolution (GLP-1 agonists becoming $50B+ category), the pandemic-driven mRNA validation, the explosion of rare disease innovation through breakthrough therapy designations, or the degree to which regulatory efficiency improvements (FDA's 21st Century Cures Act) would accelerate development timelines.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article remains remarkably insightful for several reasons. First, it captures a pivotal moment when industry faced uncomfortable truths about R&D productivity—a challenge that persists largely unchanged today. The skepticism toward easy narratives about "productivity turnarounds" proved warranted, as subsequent data confirmed that fundamental economics of drug development remained challenging despite technological advances.

Second, the competing analytical frameworks (Evans' innovation metrics vs. BCG's financial ratios) highlight an enduring tension in evaluating complex R&D organizations—no single metric captures the full picture, yet decision-makers inevitably gravitate toward quantifiable measures. This dynamic continues today with debates over AI-driven drug discovery, real-world evidence, and value-based pricing.

Third, the article's core insight—that apparent productivity improvements might simply reflect investment cuts rather than genuine efficiency gains—offers crucial caution for contemporary discussions about pharmaceutical economics. The subsequent decade proved this concern valid: while individual companies achieved remarkable success, industry-wide productivity metrics remained disappointing.

The piece rates highly because it combines domain expertise with critical thinking, acknowledges analytical uncertainty, and raises questions that remain unresolved. It loses points only because some predictions proved too pessimistic and because it couldn't anticipate paradigm-shifting developments (mRNA, obesity drugs) that transformed industry dynamics in ways that transcended traditional productivity frameworks.
