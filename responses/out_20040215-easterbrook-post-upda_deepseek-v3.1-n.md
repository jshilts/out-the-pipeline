# Easterbrook Post Updated (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief blog update from February 15, 2004, referencing a previous post titled "Cold Equations" that criticized journalist Gregg Easterbrook's analysis of some topic. The author notes receiving significant correspondence about the original post, with none defending Easterbrook's position. Easterbrook himself had not responded, and his original post remained unchanged despite the criticism. The author questions whether a blog truly qualifies as such if posts are never updated or topics revisited. The post appears to be part of a larger ongoing debate about Easterbrook's work, with the "Cold Equations" reference suggesting the discussion may relate to science, engineering, or policy analysis, though the specific subject matter is not detailed in this brief update.

## 2. HISTORY

Without access to the original "Cold Equations" post or knowledge of what specific analysis Easterbrook published, I cannot provide meaningful historical context about the aftermath. I do not have information about:
- What topic Easterbrook was analyzing
- Whether his analysis was ultimately proven accurate or inaccurate
- What concrete developments occurred in the area under discussion
- Whether this debate had any policy or industry impact
- How the public or professional reception evolved

The absence of these details prevents me from providing the requested concrete historical summary of what happened subsequent to this blog post.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This blog post does not contain predictions about future developments in biotechnology or any other field. It is a meta-discussion about blog practices and a running debate, not a forward-looking analysis. The only implicit question raised is whether bloggers should update posts when new information becomes available or when criticism emerges—a question about blogging norms rather than scientific or industry developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This appears to be entirely off-topic from biotechnology industry commentary, consisting instead of blog housekeeping about an ongoing debate with unclear relevance to biotech.
