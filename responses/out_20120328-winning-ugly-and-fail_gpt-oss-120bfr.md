# Winning Ugly and Failing Gracefully (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author argues that drug‑discovery teams face a false dichotomy: either push a chemically “ugly” molecule—high log P, marginal potency, formulation headaches—through the clinic, or work on a “clean” hit with ideal physicochemical properties that nevertheless may still fail in Phase II or III. The piece contends that, because human biology is unpredictable, it is often better to accept an imperfect scaffold if it can reach patients, rather than discard it while waiting for a perfect‑looking candidate. The author also warns that corporate processes can incentivise “checking the boxes” on pre‑clinical criteria, producing candidates that look good on paper but have little chance of success, allowing individuals to avoid blame when the program ultimately collapses.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Real‑world outcomes for “ugly” drugs**  
- Since 2012, a substantial fraction of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved by the FDA have been chemically complex, high‑log P, or otherwise “non‑ideal” by traditional medicinal‑chemistry metrics. Examples include *osimertinib* (high lipophilicity, multiple aromatic rings), *alpelisib* (high log P, poor solubility), and the proteasome inhibitor *bortezomib* (large, polar, and chemically intricate). Their market success demonstrates that sub‑optimal physicochemical profiles do not preclude approval or commercial uptake.  
- The rise of **PROTACs** (proteolysis‑targeting chimeras) illustrates the “ugly wins” principle. Early PROTACs such as *ARV‑110* (and later FDA‑approved *ARV‑471* in 2024) are large, heterobifunctional molecules with high molecular weight (> 800 Da) and poor drug‑like metrics, yet they have progressed into late‑stage trials and, in some cases, reached the market. Their success has shifted industry attitudes toward tolerating “beyond‑Rule‑of‑Five” chemistry when the mechanism is compelling.  

**Impact of “clean” programs**  
- Conversely, many programs that began with textbook‑perfect hits have still failed late in development. Notable Phase III failures include the anti‑amyloid antibodies *solanezumab* and *gantenerumab* (both had excellent target engagement and pharmacokinetics but did not demonstrate clinical benefit). While these are biologics rather than small molecules, they reinforce the article’s point that a solid pre‑clinical package does not guarantee efficacy.  

**Organizational and cultural shifts**  
- The industry has increasingly embraced **risk‑tolerant portfolio strategies**. Large pharma now runs “high‑risk, high‑reward” buckets that deliberately fund projects with challenging chemistry (e.g., macrocycles, covalent inhibitors) alongside more conventional programs. This reflects a move away from the “check‑the‑boxes” mentality described in the article.  
- At the same time, **regulatory guidance on ADMET** has become stricter, especially concerning drug–drug interaction potential and cardiac safety (e.g., QT prolongation). Companies still must meet these criteria, but the emphasis has shifted toward early‑stage mitigation rather than outright elimination of chemically imperfect leads.  

**Policy and funding**  
- The **Orphan Drug Act** and subsequent incentives have encouraged development of niche, often chemically challenging therapies (e.g., enzyme replacement therapies, small‑molecule lysosomal enzymes). These drugs typically violate classic drug‑likeness rules but succeed because the market and regulatory environment reward them.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies several expectations. Below are the inferred predictions and how they have played out:

- **Prediction:** “Ugly” compounds that reach the clinic can become successful drugs despite physicochemical shortcomings.  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Numerous post‑2012 approvals (e.g., *osimertinib*, *alpelisib*, PROTACs) fit this pattern.  

- **Prediction:** Relying solely on “clean” chemistry and strict pre‑clinical criteria will not protect programs from late‑stage failure.  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. High‑profile Phase II/III failures of well‑characterized candidates (e.g., anti‑amyloid antibodies, certain kinase inhibitors) demonstrate that target validation and ADMET perfection are insufficient.  

- **Prediction:** Organizational pressure to meet formal checkpoints can produce candidates that look good on paper but are doomed, allowing individuals to avoid blame.  
  **Outcome:** Partially confirmed. While internal “go/no‑go” committees remain, many companies now incorporate **cross‑functional “failure‑mode” reviews** that explicitly discuss strategic risk, reducing the “box‑checking” culture. However, instances of “pipeline‑padding” still occur, as seen in some large pharma’s mid‑2020s portfolio disclosures where multiple late‑stage assets were terminated for strategic rather than scientific reasons.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** The industry will gradually accept higher‑log P, higher‑MW molecules if they address unmet needs.  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. The acceptance of macrocycles, covalent inhibitors, and PROTACs reflects a broader shift toward mechanism‑driven risk tolerance.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating:** **7/10**  
The article captures a timeless debate about drug‑discovery strategy and correctly anticipated the growing tolerance for chemically “ugly” therapeutics, making it still relevant for understanding current portfolio management. Its informal tone limits scholarly impact, but the concepts remain highly pertinent.
