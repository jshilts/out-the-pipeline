# More on the GSK Shanghai Scandal (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reports on confirmed data fabrication at GlaxoSmithKline's Shanghai research facility. The case centers on a January 2010 *Nature Medicine* paper about the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in autoimmune disease, specifically multiple sclerosis. GSK revealed that the paper claimed to use blood cells from MS patients, but actually used samples from healthy donors or could not be documented at all, indicating fabrication. Jingwu Zang, lead author and former head of the Shanghai research site, was dismissed from GSK. Other employees were placed on administrative leave pending investigation, and GSK initiated retraction proceedings for the paper. The author raises concerns about the scope of the misconduct and how such fabrication could occur under senior leadership oversight.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the article's publication, several key developments occurred: The paper was formally retracted from *Nature Medicine* in 2013 with consent from all authors. The revelations at GSK Shanghai became part of a broader pattern of research misconduct cases that emerged in China around this period (2013-2015), including high-profile retractions and institutional investigations across multiple pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. This scandal occurred just before an even larger crisis for GSK in China: in 2014, GSK was fined \$489 million by Chinese authorities for widespread bribery of doctors and hospitals to prescribe GSK medications. While the research misconduct case and bribery case were separate, they collectively damaged GSK's reputation and operations in China. The company subsequently restructured its China research operations significantly. The specific IL-7 pathway research mentioned in the fraudulent paper appears to have not led to approved MS therapeutics, though IL-7 and related pathways remain active areas of research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions and concerns:

• **Whether this was an isolated incident**: The author worried this might not be isolated. This concern proved justified, as numerous research misconduct cases in China's life sciences sector emerged in the following years, suggesting systemic quality control problems at certain institutions.

• **How deeply the leadership was involved**: Jingwu Zang's dismissal suggested senior involvement. Subsequent investigations confirmed the misconduct occurred under his leadership, and the case contributed to broader scrutiny of research integrity in Chinese pharmaceutical R&D operations.

• **Impact on GSK's China operations**: The article didn't explicitly predict this, but 2013 marked a turning point. The research scandal preceded a much larger compliance crisis that fundamentally damaged GSK's China strategy and led to major operational restructuring.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article documents an important case of research misconduct that became emblematic of broader quality control challenges in pharmaceutical R&D in China during this period, though it was quickly overshadowed by the larger GSK bribery scandal that followed.
