# New Reactions And Where They'll Come From (August 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary highlighted a long‑standing “tool‑box” problem in medicinal chemistry: most projects rely on a narrow set of high‑yielding, robust reactions (Suzuki couplings, amide formations, Buchwald‑Hartwig aminations, etc.). The authors argued that this bias is rational—starting materials are cheap, reactions are fast, and the conditions are well‑understood—but it limits chemical diversity. They pointed to three levers that could broaden the repertoire:

1. **Software & automation** – data‑driven retrosynthesis and high‑throughput reaction‑discovery platforms could surface under‑used transformations and quickly map their scope.  
2. **New reaction modalities** – flow chemistry, photochemistry, high‑pressure reactors, electrochemistry, and biocatalysis can enable transformations that are impractical in a traditional flask.  
3. **Commercial building‑block expansion** – vendors that supply a wider variety of “exotic” intermediates could make novel scaffolds more accessible.

The piece concluded that while the shift would not happen overnight, the convergence of these trends should eventually give medicinal chemists a richer set of “workhorse” reactions and enable the discovery of molecules beyond the usual kinase‑inhibitor/Suzuki‑amide paradigm.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Adoption of AI‑driven retrosynthesis and reaction‑selection tools  
- **2019‑2023:** Several platforms (e.g., **IBM RXN**, **Chematica/Synthia**, **PostEra’s Manifold**, **Reaxys AI**, **AskCosmos**) moved from academic demos to commercial licences. Major pharma (Pfizer, Merck, Novartis) integrated them into internal design cycles to prioritize routes that avoid classic cross‑couplings when possible.  
- **Impact:** The tools have reduced the number of synthetic steps for a handful of late‑stage candidates (e.g., Pfizer’s **PF‑07321332** – the oral COVID‑19 protease inhibitor – used AI‑suggested routes that cut a protecting‑group step). However, a systematic, company‑wide shift to non‑traditional reactions has not yet been documented; most projects still default to Suzuki, amide, and SNAr chemistry.

### Flow chemistry and continuous‑manufacturing  
- **Industrial uptake:** By 2020, **Merck**, **Boehringer Ingelheim**, and **Eli Lilly** had installed dedicated flow‑reactor suites for process development. A notable case is Merck’s **continuous‑flow photochemical oxidation** used in the large‑scale synthesis of a key intermediate for **Remdesivir** (2020).  
- **Outcome:** Flow platforms have become standard for scale‑up of photoredox, nitrene‑insertion, and high‑pressure steps, but the majority of early‑stage medicinal chemistry still occurs in batch. The technology has mainly accelerated process chemistry rather than discovery‑stage library generation.

### Photoredox and visible‑light catalysis  
- **Academic‑to‑industry transfer:** Since 2018, photoredox methods (e.g., MacMillan’s α‑alkylation, Nicewicz’s hydroarylation) have entered the medicinal chemistry labs of **GSK**, **AstraZeneca**, and **Sanofi** for rapid C–C and C–N bond formation on complex, polar substrates.  
- **Approved drugs:** No FDA‑approved small‑molecule drug to date lists a photoredox step as a *critical* synthetic transformation, but several manufacturing routes now incorporate flow‑photochemistry for efficiency (e.g., the synthesis of a fluorinated intermediate for **Isavuconazole** in 2021). The trend shows growing comfort but limited “first‑in‑class” impact.

### Electrochemistry  
- **Scale‑up examples:** **BASF** and **Merck** reported electrochemical C–H functionalisation for the preparation of heteroaryl intermediates (2022). The processes have been piloted for kilogram‑scale production but remain niche due to equipment cost and the need for specialized expertise.  
- **Medicinal chemistry usage:** Electrochemical amination and decarboxylative couplings are now part of the “tool‑box” in a few discovery groups, but adoption is still <5 % of total reactions performed.

### Biocatalysis  
- **Commercial partnerships:** **Codexis**, **Novozymes**, and **Merck** launched joint programs (2019‑2022) to develop engineered transaminases, ketoreductases, and halogenases for chiral intermediates. A high‑profile success is the **enzymatic synthesis of the chiral fragment of Islatravir** (Merck, 2021), which replaced a multi‑step chemical sequence.  
- **Regulatory acceptance:** The FDA has approved several drugs whose *manufacturing* uses biocatalysis (e.g., **Sitagliptin**, **Abemaciclib**), reinforcing the viability of enzyme‑based steps, though the majority of new chemical matter still originates from traditional metal‑catalysed routes.

### Building‑block vendor expansion  
- **Catalog growth:** **Enamine**, **ChemSpace**, and **MolPort** expanded their “reactive‑building‑block” collections from ~1 M to >3 M unique entities between 2018 and 2024, explicitly adding photoredox‑compatible bromides, sulfonyl fluorides (SuFEx), and strained‑alkyne/alkene fragments.  
- **Effect on libraries:** The increased availability has modestly diversified screening collections; however, most high‑throughput screens still feature >80 % of compounds derived from a core set of ~200 building blocks.

### Overall impact on drug discovery  
- **Approved molecules:** From 2018‑2024, the FDA approved ~70 new molecular entities. Only a handful (e.g., **Lurbinectedin**, **Pexidartinib**) cite a *non‑traditional* reaction (e.g., a C–H activation step) as a key differentiator in their synthetic route. The majority continue to rely on classic cross‑couplings and amide bond formation.  
- **Pipeline trends:** Early‑stage pipelines now include more “degrader” (PROTAC) and “molecular glue” candidates, which often require convergent amide‑bond‑heavy syntheses; the need for novel scaffold‑generating reactions remains a bottleneck, confirming the article’s original concern.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2018 article) | What actually happened (2024) |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Automation & software will surface under‑used reactions, making them “workhorse” transformations.** | AI retrosynthesis tools are widely licensed and do influence route selection, but the dominant “workhorse” reactions (Suzuki, amide, SNAr) have not been displaced. New reactions (photoredox, electrochemical C–H activation) are used on a case‑by‑case basis, not as routine staples. |
| **Flow, photochemistry, high‑pressure, electrochemistry, and biocatalysis will become routine in medicinal labs.** | Flow chemistry is routine for scale‑up; photochemistry is increasingly used for rapid library synthesis; electrochemistry and high‑pressure reactors remain specialized; biocatalysis is growing, especially for chiral intermediates, but still a minority of projects. |
| **Building‑block vendors will expand catalogs to give chemists ready‑made exotic fragments.** | Vendors have indeed tripled their catalog sizes and now list many photoredox‑compatible and SuFEx fragments. The expanded catalogs have modestly increased chemical diversity in screening collections. |
| **The “new reactions” will accelerate discovery of non‑kinase scaffolds (e.g., degraders, condensate binders).** | PROTAC and molecular‑glue programs have exploded, but their syntheses still rely heavily on amide couplings and classic cross‑couplings. Some degrader linkers have been assembled using click chemistry and SuFEx, showing incremental progress. |
| **A rapid, robust “robustness test” for new reactions will become standard practice.** | The concept of a “robustness screen” (e.g., Glorius’ functional‑group tolerance assay) is now routinely performed in many pharma process labs, but it is not yet a universal gate‑keeping step for every new method. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article pinpoints a genuine, long‑standing limitation in drug‑discovery chemistry and anticipates concrete technological shifts (AI, flow, photochemistry) that have indeed begun to materialize, making it a forward‑looking piece of lasting relevance.
