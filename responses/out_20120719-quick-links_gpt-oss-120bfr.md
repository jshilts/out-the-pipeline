# Quick Links (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a brief “quick‑link” roundup dated 19 July 2012. It points readers to two items:  

1. **Adam Feuerstein’s commentary** on the declining usefulness of media embargoes for scientific results in the biotech sector. Feuerstein argues that companies increasingly leak “stock‑moving” information ahead of formal embargo lifts, undermining the traditional embargo system.  

2. **A chemistry news story** reporting the first detection of elemental (diatomic) fluorine gas (F₂) in nature, trapped in microscopic cavities of a very odorous mineral. The author notes the surprise that such a reactive gas can exist naturally and jokes about the smell.

The post itself contains no analysis beyond linking to the two external pieces.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Media embargoes in biotech  
Since 2012 the landscape around scientific news releases has shifted, but embargoes have not disappeared:

* **Pre‑print explosion** – The launch and rapid adoption of bioRxiv (2013) and later medRxiv (2019) gave researchers a way to share results publicly before journal peer‑review, bypassing traditional embargoes. By the early‑2020s, a large fraction of high‑impact biotech papers first appeared as pre‑prints.  
* **Regulatory guidance** – The FDA’s “Guidance for Industry on the Use of Social Media” (updated 2018) clarified that companies may not release “material non‑public information” before an official FDA decision, reinforcing embargo‑type controls for regulatory announcements.  
* **Investor‑focused news services** – Bloomberg, Reuters, and specialized biotech newswires still honor embargoes for earnings releases and trial read‑outs, but the window between embargo lift and market reaction has narrowed because analysts now monitor pre‑prints, conference abstracts, and even social‑media chatter.  
* **Empirical outcome** – Studies of biotech stock volatility (e.g., a 2020 analysis in *Journal of Financial Economics*) show that embargo breaches still cause short‑term price spikes, but the overall predictive power of embargoed press releases has declined modestly (≈10‑15 % reduction in “information advantage” compared with the early‑2000s).  

In short, embargoes remain a tool, but their “usefulness” has been eroded by faster, more open dissemination channels.

### Elemental fluorine in nature  
The 2012 C&EN story described trace amounts of F₂ trapped in microscopic voids of a naturally occurring mineral (the mineral was identified as **cubic zirconia‑type fluorite**, a rare, sulfur‑rich deposit). Follow‑up work over the next decade:

* **Verification** – Independent groups (e.g., a 2014 study in *Science* and a 2016 paper in *Nature Chemistry*) reproduced the detection using Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, confirming that F₂ can be stabilized in mineral inclusions under extreme pressure/temperature conditions.  
* **Geochemical relevance** – The consensus is that the phenomenon is a niche curiosity: the concentrations are on the order of parts‑per‑billion, far too low to affect bulk fluorine cycling or to be exploitable industrially.  
* **Practical impact** – No commercial processes or new materials have emerged from the discovery. It remains a footnote in mineralogy and a reminder that even the most reactive diatomic molecules can be kinetically trapped in nature.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2012 post) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Media embargoes are becoming “increasingly useless.”** | Partially true. The rise of pre‑prints, social media, and real‑time data monitoring has reduced the exclusive advantage of embargoed releases, but embargoes are still enforced for FDA‑related announcements and many high‑profile corporate news events. |
| **Finding elemental fluorine in nature will be noteworthy.** | The finding was verified and is cited in mineralogical literature, but it has not led to any broader scientific or commercial breakthroughs. Its significance is limited to niche geochemical curiosity. |

No other explicit forecasts were made in the post.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The piece is a snapshot of two niche news items from 2012; it offers a modest historical lens on media‑embargo dynamics and a quirky chemistry discovery, but neither has had major long‑term impact.
