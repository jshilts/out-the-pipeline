# MTH1: From Hot Topic to Devalidation? (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the controversy surrounding MTH1 (NUDT1) as a potential cancer drug target. MTH1 is an enzyme that degrades oxidized guanine nucleotides (8-oxoguanine), preventing their incorporation into DNA during rapid cell division. The hypothesis was that cancer cells, with their high replication rates, would be particularly dependent on MTH1 to maintain DNA integrity, making MTH1 inhibition a promising therapeutic strategy.

The article traces the trajectory from initial enthusiasm in 2014, when Swedish research groups published papers showing MTH1 inhibitors with strong anti-cancer effects and crystal structures, to subsequent failures by other groups (including AstraZeneca and Bayer) to replicate these findings. The Bayer group's contribution was particularly damning: they developed BAY-707, a structurally distinct MTH1 inhibitor with superior pharmacokinetics and cellular target engagement, yet found no anti-cancer efficacy in vitro or in vivo, either alone or in combination therapies. The Bayer researchers concluded that MTH1 inhibition simply doesn't affect cancer cell survival, effectively devalidating the target.

The controversy centered on whether earlier positive results were due to off-target effects of compounds like TH588, and the article concludes that MTH1 appears to be a dead end as a cancer target despite initially promising data.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in July 2017, the MTH1 story largely played out as a case study in target devalidation rather than a resurgence:

**Clinical Development:** No MTH1 inhibitors advanced to clinical trials after 2017. The major pharmaceutical companies that had shown interest (Bayer, AstraZeneca) did not pursue further development, and no new players entered clinical development for MTH1 inhibition in oncology. The target essentially disappeared from drug development pipelines.

**Research Community Response:** The scientific community largely accepted the devalidation conclusion. Subsequent reviews and meta-analyses of oncology drug targets typically cite MTH1 as an example of how initial promising results can be misleading. The debate that existed pre-2017 largely subsided, with few publications defending MTH1 as a target after the Bayer data.

**Mechanistic Understanding:** Research continued to clarify why MTH1 inhibition failed. Studies showed that cancer cells possess multiple backup mechanisms for dealing with oxidized nucleotides beyond MTH1, including other NUDIX family enzymes and alternative DNA repair pathways. The redundancy of nucleotide sanitization pathways meant that inhibiting a single enzyme like MTH1 wasn't sufficient to cause the predicted cancer cell vulnerability.

**Drug Development Impact:** The MTH1 story became a cautionary tale in pharmaceutical R&D about the importance of rigorous target validation, particularly regarding the quality of chemical probes and the need for structurally diverse tool compounds to rule out off-target effects. It reinforced the industry's movement toward more comprehensive early validation packages before committing significant resources.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself was written from a retrospective position and didn't make explicit forward-looking predictions about MTH1's future. However, it did discuss several potential scenarios and hypotheses that were circulating in the field, which can be evaluated:

• **Implicit prediction: MTH1 is not a valid cancer target** - This was strongly validated. No MTH1 inhibitors reached clinical trials, and no subsequent successful anti-cancer drugs emerged from this mechanism.

• **Concern about off-target effects of TH588 and similar compounds** - Confirmed as accurate. The Bayer data strongly supported that earlier positive results were likely due to off-target cytotoxicity rather than MTH1 inhibition.

• **Need for better chemical probes and validation tools** - This became a lasting lesson. The MTH1 story contributed to increased emphasis in drug discovery on robust chemical probe characterization, spurring initiatives like the Structural Genomics Consortium's chemical probe validation standards.

• **Complexity of MTH1 biology involving multiple isoforms and post-translational modifications** - While technically true that MTH1 biology is complex, subsequent research showed that this complexity wasn't the reason for the therapeutic failure. Instead, the fundamental premise that cancer cells depend on MTH1 was simply incorrect.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a significant cautionary tale in oncology drug development - a promising target with apparently solid early data that completely failed validation. The importance lies not in MTH1 itself, but in what the story teaches about target validation rigor, the pitfalls of early drug discovery, and the critical importance of high-quality chemical tools.
