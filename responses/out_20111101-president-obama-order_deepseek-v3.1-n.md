# President Obama Orders the FDA to. . .Do What, Exactly? (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary critiques President Obama's October 2011 executive order directing the FDA to address drug shortages. The author argues that the order lacks substance, pointing out that drug shortages stem from deep structural issues including Medicare billing changes for generic cancer drugs and manufacturing problems with overseas suppliers in a low-margin industry. The executive order primarily directed FDA to expedite reviews of new suppliers and manufacturing sites (which the author claims they were already doing), send reminder letters to companies about reporting potential shortages, and investigate potential price gouging. The author characterizes the announcement as political theater designed to provide campaign talking points rather than meaningful policy action.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2011 executive order, the FDA did implement more systematic shortage monitoring and reporting mechanisms. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 codified many shortage prevention measures, requiring manufacturers to notify FDA of potential discontinuances or interruptions in production. This ultimately had substantive impact—FDA-reported drug shortages peaked in 2011 at 267 new shortages but decreased to 71 by 2022, showing measurable improvement over the following decade.

However, drug shortages remained a persistent problem. Between 2022-2023, new shortages began rising again, reaching 130 in 2023. Critical shortages continued affecting chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics, and emergency medications. The structural issues identified in 2011—consolidated manufacturing with few suppliers, quality problems at generic drug facilities, thin profit margins discouraging investment—largely persisted. While the executive order and subsequent legislation improved early warning systems, they did not fundamentally reshape the economic incentives driving shortages.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: The executive order would prove to be empty public relations with no real impact because FDA was "already doing" the expedited reviews and the order didn't address underlying structural problems.
  - **Reality**: Partially accurate. While the order itself may have been limited, it catalyzed meaningful legislative action (FDASIA 2012) that established mandatory reporting requirements, creating a more systematic shortage prevention framework. However, the core structural problems persisted and shortages recurred.

• **Prediction**: The focus on "price gouging" investigations was economically misguided and wouldn't solve the shortage problem.
  - **Reality**: Largely accurate. Price signals during shortages remained controversial, and regulatory approaches to pricing didn't address the fundamental supply-demand imbalances or manufacturing quality issues driving shortages.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6/9**

This article captures a significant moment in drug shortage policy while correctly identifying that surface-level political announcements often fail to address deeper structural problems—an insight that proved prescient as shortages persisted despite regulatory changes.
