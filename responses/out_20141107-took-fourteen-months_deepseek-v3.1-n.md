# This Took Fourteen Months (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the aftermath of a research integrity scandal involving two papers from the Pease research group at the University of Utah published in Nano Letters and ACS Nano. The papers contained fabricated images - particularly problematic ones that appeared to have been crudely manipulated in what looked like Microsoft Paint. The Nano Letters paper was retracted relatively quickly, but there was controversy over how ACS Nano editors initially responded to criticism. The university's investigation ultimately determined that graduate student Rajasekhar Anumolu was solely responsible for the image fabrication and data falsification in both papers, while principal investigator Leonard Pease was exonerated. The investigation took fourteen months to complete, a delay the author criticizes along with what he sees as institutional resistance to post-publication criticism, including Pease's reported legal threats against bloggers who first exposed the issues.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in November 2014, the broader consequences and outcomes of this case were:

- **Research Integrity Process**: The fourteen-month timeline highlighted ongoing concerns about how academic institutions handle research misconduct investigations, with calls for more transparent and timely processes.

- **Continuing Debate on PI Responsibility**: The exoneration of Professor Pease continued to fuel debates about principal investigator accountability, particularly regarding oversight of graduate student work and manuscript review before publication.

- **Blog-Based Science Criticism Growth**: This case became part of a larger trend where scientific bloggers and online commentators increasingly served as informal watchdogs for research integrity, often identifying problems that peer reviewers and editors missed.

- **Publishing Ethics Evolution**: The controversy contributed to ongoing discussions about how journals should handle post-publication criticism, with many publishers developing better mechanisms for addressing concerns raised about published work.

- **Research Training Impact**: The case underscored the importance of research ethics training and laboratory oversight, influencing how some institutions approached mentoring and supervision of graduate students.

- **Retraction Watch's Role**: This case and others like it helped establish Retraction Watch as a significant voice in research integrity discussions, leading to its continued growth as a resource for tracking and analyzing research misconduct cases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events. Rather, it offered commentary on the then-current state of research integrity processes and post-publication criticism.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5**

This article addresses important ongoing issues in research integrity and accountability, but focuses on a moderately significant individual case rather than broader systemic change or scientific breakthroughs. While the topics of research misconduct and publication ethics remain highly relevant, this specific nanorod fabrication case was not groundbreaking.
