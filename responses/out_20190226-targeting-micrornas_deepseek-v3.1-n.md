# Targeting microRNAs (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2019 commentary highlights the shift in drug discovery toward targeting RNA species, particularly microRNAs, moving beyond the traditional focus on proteins. The article describes a study from Matt Disney's lab at Scripps-Florida demonstrating successful targeting of microRNA-515 with a dimeric small molecule that achieved nanomolar affinity and selective cellular activity. The researchers exploited an adjacent binding site strategy to achieve selectivity between miR-515 and miR-885, overcoming the challenge of targeting RNA molecules that share only four nucleotide building blocks and often lack well-defined structures.

The key biological finding showed that targeting miR-515 led to increased expression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK-1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), important mediators in inflammatory signaling and cell proliferation. The compound induced cellular effects including increased cell migration and HER2 expression, rendering previously HER2-low MCF-7 breast cancer cells sensitive to the Herceptin antibody. The article notes that while this proof-of-concept is compelling, questions remain about how broadly applicable this targeting strategy will be across different miRNA species.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2019 article, RNA-targeted drug discovery accelerated significantly, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, though the field's trajectory has been more complex than initially anticipated. Several important developments occurred:

**Clinical Successes and Failures**: While microRNA targeting specifically has faced challenges, the broader RNA therapeutics field saw major advances. The most significant success came with mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, beginning in late 2020, which demonstrated the clinical viability of RNA-based therapeutics at scale. However, small molecule RNA targeting has proven more difficult than initially hoped.

**Company Progress**: Companies dedicated to RNA-targeted small molecules emerged and faced mixed outcomes. Many early RNA-targeting biotechs struggled to translate academic discoveries into viable drug candidates. The approach highlighted in the article—targeting specific microRNAs with small molecules—has not yet produced FDA-approved drugs as of 2025.

**Regulatory Milestones**: The FDA approved several siRNA therapeutics during this period, including inclisiran (2021) for hypercholesterolemia and lumasiran (2020) for primary hyperoxaluria type 1. These approvals validated RNA-targeting as a viable therapeutic modality, though through different mechanisms than the small-molecule approach described in the article.

**Market Dynamics**: The biotech market's enthusiasm for RNA-based therapeutics peaked during 2020-2022, driven largely by the success of COVID-19 vaccines. However, as companies moved beyond vaccines to more complex RNA-based therapeutics, clinical and commercial challenges became more apparent.

**Scientific Maturation**: The field learned that targeting RNA with small molecules presents unique challenges not fully appreciated in 2019, including issues with selectivity, oral bioavailability, and achieving therapeutic levels in target tissues. While academic research continues, clinical translation has been slower than expected.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the future of microRNA targeting:

• **"people moving in to do just that"** - The prediction that researchers would expand on these findings to target other miRNA species has partially come true. Academic research in RNA-targeting small molecules has continued, but clinical translation has been limited. The field has focused more on mRNA and siRNA therapeutics rather than microRNA targeting specifically.

• **Implicit prediction that small-molecule RNA targeting would become a viable drug discovery approach** - This has shown mixed results. While the concept remains scientifically valid and research continues, few if any small-molecule RNA-targeting drugs have reached FDA approval. The field has evolved to favor other RNA therapeutic modalities (mRNA vaccines, siRNA therapeutics) that have achieved clinical success.

• **Implicit prediction about the "generalizability" of the approach** - The concern that "how many miR species are targetable in general" remains an open question. Research suggests that while some RNA targets are druggable, the challenge is greater than initially anticipated due to selectivity and delivery issues.

• **Implicit prediction about the clinical potential of miR-515 targeting specifically** - No drugs targeting miR-515 have reached clinical trials or FDA approval, indicating that the pathway described may not have translated as hoped.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured an important emerging area of drug discovery at a crucial time, correctly identifying the potential of RNA targeting while appropriately noting the uncertainties. The timing was prescient given the subsequent explosion of interest in RNA therapeutics during the pandemic, though the specific approach described (small-molecule microRNA targeting) has not yet delivered on its promise.
