# Make Sure That's What You Want to Say (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article warns about the dangers of leaving editing comments and tracked changes in documents that later become public. The author recounts how patent applications sometimes publish with internal legal commentary still embedded, citing an example where someone had written "Not sure if we can claim this!" in patent claims. The piece references a published scientific paper that contained a highlighted phrase with the comment "OMG- This paper got published with this highlighted phrase and no-one noticed?"—demonstrating how review comments can accidentally remain in final publications. The author compares such document-related mishaps to career-damaging "reply all" email incidents, sharing an anecdote about an employee who accidentally sent a derogatory comment about their company to a wide distribution list including senior executives.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2014 blog post highlighted a recurring problem in academic and legal publishing that has persisted and arguably worsened with increasingly complex digital collaboration tools. The underlying issue—accidentally publishing internal review comments or tracked changes—continues to occur in scientific and patent publications.

Since 2014, document collaboration platforms like Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, and various manuscript submission systems have become more sophisticated, but human error in managing comments and tracked changes remains common. Research institutions and publishers have developed more systematic training and review processes for manuscript preparation. Some academic publishers now explicitly include steps in their editorial checklists to verify that all tracked changes are accepted/rejected and comments removed before publication.

The broader issue the article touches upon—the digital permanence of written communications—has become even more significant with the rise of social media, where hastily written posts and comments can have lasting professional consequences. The practices of careful review and strategic communication highlighted in this piece remain relevant for researchers, legal professionals, and corporate employees.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It primarily serves as a cautionary commentary on existing practices related to document review and professional communication.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3/9**

This article addresses a niche but persistent problem in academic and legal publishing, but focuses on a relatively narrow aspect of professional communication. While the core issue remains relevant, the content is more instructional than groundbreaking.
