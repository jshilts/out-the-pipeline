# Another Funny-Looking Structure Comes Through (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary discusses a Genentech research paper where medicinal chemists successfully modified a PAK1 kinase inhibitor (FRAX1036) to address pharmacokinetic and safety issues. The original compound featured a problematic piperidine group that caused hERG ion channel activity (a cardiac safety concern) while having poor cellular permeability. The Genentech team's solution was unexpectedly creative: they replaced the problematic amine with an "atypical" dioxolane group—a structure that medicinal chemists would typically avoid because acetals are known to be acid-labile and unstable in stomach conditions. Remarkably, the dioxolane modification improved potency, reduced basicity, and maintained stability in vivo, showing good pharmacokinetics in rodents and monkeys.

## 2. HISTORY

The PAK1 inhibitor program described in this 2015 article did not result in an FDA-approved drug reaching the market. While the dioxolane modification strategy was scientifically interesting and demonstrated creative problem-solving in medicinal chemistry, PAK1 inhibitors have generally faced significant challenges in clinical development due to complex biology and potential toxicity concerns.

**Research Impact:** The approach of using atypical stabilizing groups like dioxolanes influenced subsequent medicinal chemistry strategies for kinase inhibitors, particularly in addressing hERG liabilities and improving the "druggability" of heteroaromatic scaffolds. However, this specific compound class did not translate into a marketed therapeutic.

**PAK1 Field Developments:** Since 2015, PAK1 has remained an attractive but challenging cancer drug target. Several other PAK1 inhibitors have entered clinical trials, including small molecules from other companies, but none have achieved FDA approval for oncology indications. The field has shifted toward more selective PAK1 inhibitors and combination approaches, but success has remained elusive.

**Practical Outcomes:** No drugs incorporating this specific dioxolane strategy have been approved. The approach represents a valuable case study in medicinal chemistry creativity but did not translate into a drug that reached patients or changed clinical practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about acetal stability:** The article expressed skepticism about acid-labile acetal groups surviving stomach conditions, stating "Organic chemists in general may be raising their eyebrows a bit at it, because that two-oxygens-on-one-carbon group (an acetal, in this case) is known to be labile to acid conditions. Y'know, like in the stomach, which is where your drug is going to go when someone eats it." **Reality:** The Genentech team's experimental work demonstrated that this specific dioxolane was surprisingly stable under acidic conditions—a finding that challenged conventional medicinal chemistry assumptions.

• **Implicit prediction about drug development potential:** The article's positive tone suggested this approach might be promising for advancing the compound. **Reality:** The compound did not progress to become an approved drug, reflecting the broader challenges in PAK1 inhibitor development rather than any failure of the specific chemical strategy.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5**

This article represents a moderately interesting case study in medicinal chemistry problem-solving that demonstrates creative approaches to drug optimization, though it lacks broader long-term impact since the approach didn't translate to clinical success or change drug development paradigms.
