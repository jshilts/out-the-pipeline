# The Herbal Supplement Industry Is Not A Very Funny Joke (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques the U.S. herbal supplement regulatory system, focusing on severe quality control failures. It highlights a BMC Medicine study where researchers from the University of Guelph DNA-tested 44 herbal supplement brands sold in the U.S. and Canada. The results were striking: one-third of samples contained no detectable amounts of the labeled herb, instead containing invasive weeds, Chinese ornamental plants, rice, soybeans, or other fillers. Ten of twelve companies had at least one such fraudulent product, with four companies selling products that were entirely mislabeled. The author argues that while some herbal preparations may have medicinal value, they should face the same evidence and quality control standards as pharmaceutical drugs. The piece expresses particular concern that fraudulent supplements continue selling due to placebo effects, questioning whether manufacturers knowingly sell fake products or are themselves duped by supply chain middlemen.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Aftermath (2013-2015):**
The BMC Medicine study sparked significant media attention and regulatory scrutiny. In February 2015, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into major retailers (GNC, Target, Walmart, Walgreens) after DNA testing found that 79% of supplements tested contained none of the herbs listed on labels. This led to cease-and-desist letters and increased pressure on the industry.

**Regulatory Developments:**
The FDA responded by issuing new Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines specifically for dietary supplements and increasing facility inspections. However, major legislative gaps remained—the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 still allowed supplements to be marketed without pre-market FDA approval for safety or efficacy. The FDA could only act after products were proven unsafe, creating a reactive rather than proactive regulatory posture.

**Industry Changes:**
Following the 2013 revelations and subsequent investigations, major retailers began implementing more rigorous third-party testing requirements for their supplement suppliers. Companies like GNC and Vitamin Shoppe established mandatory DNA barcoding and heavy metals testing protocols. Several class-action lawsuits were filed against supplement manufacturers for fraudulent labeling between 2014-2017, some resulting in multimillion-dollar settlements.

**Continued Problems:**
Despite improvements, subsequent investigations revealed ongoing issues. A 2018 study published in the *Journal of AOAC International* found that 46% of ashwagandha supplements tested in the U.S. contained little to no active compounds. The FDA continued issuing warning letters to supplement manufacturers throughout the 2010s for contamination with pharmaceutical drugs (particularly in sexual enhancement and weight loss supplements), heavy metals, and unlisted ingredients.

**Scientific Impact:**
The DNA barcoding techniques pioneered in the 2013 study became more widely adopted for botanical authentication. However, the industry's problems contributed to growing scientific skepticism about herbal medicine research, as researchers questioned whether study results could be replicated when raw material quality varied dramatically.

**Business Failures and Adaptations:**
Several smaller supplement companies faced bankruptcy or closure following fraud revelations and lawsuits. Larger companies invested heavily in quality control infrastructure but often passed these costs to consumers. By 2019, the supplement industry had become more vertically integrated, with major manufacturers operating their own farms or securing exclusive supplier relationships to control ingredient quality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained mostly implicit predictions rather than explicit forecasts:

• **Implicit Prediction: Industry would face consequences for poor quality control**
  - *Reality*: Partial accuracy. The New York AG investigation in 2015 and subsequent regulatory scrutiny did bring consequences to some companies, along with class-action lawsuits. However, the fundamental regulatory framework (DSHEA) remained unchanged, limiting the scope of enforcement.

• **Implicit Prediction: That people who buy this garbage would continue wasting money on fake treatments that only have placebo effect**
  - *Reality*: Accurate. The herbal supplement market continued growing from approximately $36 billion in 2013 to over $50 billion by 2020, despite ongoing quality issues. Consumer behavior largely persisted.

• **Implicit Prediction: The pharmaceutical-biased oversight and "screwed up" regulatory system were not going anywhere**
  - *Reality*: Highly accurate. No major legislative reforms to DSHEA occurred between 2013-2022. The FDA remained constrained to reactive enforcement, and pre-market approval requirements were never implemented for supplements.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

The article addresses a persistent public health and regulatory failure with significant economic and societal implications. While not primarily focused on biotechnology in the pharmaceutical sense, it documented critical infrastructure problems affecting botanical medicine quality—issues that remained largely unresolved a decade later and continued affecting both consumer health and legitimate research into plant-derived therapeutics.
