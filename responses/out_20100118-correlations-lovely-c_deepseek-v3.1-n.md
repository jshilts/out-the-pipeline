# Correlations, Lovely Correlations (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article highlights significant statistical problems in human studies research, particularly neuroimaging (fMRI) studies that correlate brain activity with behaviors and personality traits. The central issue identified is that many published fMRI studies report correlations that are mathematically impossible.

The problem stems from what came to be known as "double dipping" or circular analysis: researchers would identify brain regions that correlate with a behavior within their dataset, then use that same selected data to compute the final correlation coefficients. This creates an inflated, non-independent correlation measure. The article cites a paper by Vul and Kanwisher showing that given the known reproducibility limits of behavioral measurements (0.8) and fMRI measurements (0.7), the maximum theoretically possible correlation should be around 0.74. However, numerous published papers were reporting correlations much higher than this ceiling, indicating fundamental methodological flaws.

## 2. HISTORY

The Vul et al. (2009) paper, titled "Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience," triggered significant controversy and reform in neuroimaging research methods:

**Methodological Impact**: The field responded by developing and adopting more rigorous statistical approaches to avoid circular analysis. Key developments included:
- Widespread adoption of independent region-of-interest selection and cross-validation methods
- Development of proper correction techniques for multiple comparisons
- Requirements for clear separation between exploratory and confirmatory analyses in publications

**Publication and Funding Changes**: Major neuroscience journals revised their statistical review requirements, with many now requiring demonstration that circular analysis has been avoided. Funding agencies also began expecting more rigorous statistical validation in neuroimaging grant applications.

**Real-World Scientific Impact**: While neuroimaging research continued, the post-2010 period saw more cautious interpretation of findings and fewer dramatic claims about brain-behavior correlations. The methodological reforms led to more reliable though often less spectacular findings. No major therapeutic interventions or clinical practices were directly discredited, but confidence in previous claims was substantially reduced.

**Article Author Context**: The author, Derek Lowe, wrote this piece for Science's "In the Pipeline" blog, discussing pharmaceutical research. This particular post proved prescient in highlighting statistical rigor problems that extended beyond neuroimaging to other data-intensive fields.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not explicitly make forward-looking predictions about specific future outcomes. Instead, it identifies a systemic problem and implies that continued unexamined use of flawed correlation methods would lead to questionable findings. The implicit prediction was that the field needed methodological correction.

**Assessment of Implicit Prediction**: The prediction proved accurate - the neuroimaging field did undergo significant methodological reform. Subsequent years saw widespread acknowledgment of the issue, changes in statistical practices, and more careful interpretation of brain-behavior correlations. The timing was also correct - this problem needed immediate attention, and it received it.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addressed a fundamental methodological crisis at the intersection of neuroscience and statistics that had widespread implications for data-intensive research. It highlighted how easily statistical rigors could be compromised in popular research areas, leading to systematically inflated findings - a lesson applicable far beyond neuroimaging.
