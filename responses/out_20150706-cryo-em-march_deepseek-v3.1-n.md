# Cryo-EM On the March (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as an emerging structural biology technique showing notable successes. It emphasizes cryo-EM's key advantage of determining protein structures without requiring protein crystallization, which has historically been a major bottleneck in X-ray crystallography. The author notes that while obtaining high-resolution structures of unknown proteins via cryo-EM remained at the edge of technical feasibility in 2015, the technique had moved significantly away from the fringe and deserved monitoring as an important development in structural biology.

The article references both recent successes and a contemporary review, positioning cryo-EM as a rapidly advancing field with growing practical applications for protein structure determination.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, cryo-EM experienced explosive growth and widespread adoption in structural biology. The technique's advancement was catalyzed by several technological developments, including better direct electron detectors, improved image processing algorithms, and enhanced computational capabilities.

By 2017-2020, cryo-EM had become a mainstream technique in structural biology, with many research institutions establishing core cryo-EM facilities. The method proved particularly valuable for studying large macromolecular complexes, membrane proteins, and dynamic systems that are difficult to crystallize. Numerous high-impact structures were published using cryo-EM, including important drug targets, viral proteins, and molecular machines. The Protein Data Bank saw a dramatic increase in cryo-EM-derived structures, and the technique became integral to structure-based drug design pipelines.

Major research centers and pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in cryo-EM infrastructure, recognizing its complementarity to X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The technique also impacted structural genomics initiatives by enabling structure determination for previously intractable targets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Cryo-EM would see "a lot more work in this area"** - This prediction proved accurate. Cryo-EM experienced dramatic growth in adoption, publications, and infrastructure investment in the years following 2015. The field expanded from a niche technique to a mainstream structural biology method.

• **Prediction: High-resolution structures of unknown proteins via EM was "an edge-of-what's-possible technique"** - The assessment was appropriate for 2015, but the field advanced rapidly. Within 5 years, cryo-EM routinely achieved near-atomic resolution for many protein complexes, though challenges remained for smaller proteins and achieving consistently high resolution across all sample types.

• **Implicit expectation: The technique would continue improving and become more accessible** - Technological advances in detectors, computational methods, and sample preparation significantly improved both resolution and throughput, making cryo-EM more widely accessible and reliable.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated strong scientific insight in identifying an important emerging technology at a critical inflection point when cryo-EM was transitioning from a specialized technique to a mainstream structural biology tool. The brief commentary captured the significance of crystallization-free structure determination and accurately forecast the technique's expanding role, which had substantial impact on both academic research and drug discovery applications.
