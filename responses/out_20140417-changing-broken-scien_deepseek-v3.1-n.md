# Changing A Broken Science System (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a PNAS paper proposing comprehensive reforms to the biomedical research system in the United States. The authors identified a fundamental problem: the research enterprise had become unsustainable due to a structural mismatch between funding availability and the rapidly growing number of researchers competing for resources. The system was described as being on an "unsustainable path" driven by a Malthusian dynamic where the training pipeline produces more scientists than available positions in academia, government, and industry.

The authors traced this to the post-World War II expansion of federal science funding, particularly the NIH budget doubling in 2003, which created perverse incentives for universities to expand PhD programs and research capacity beyond sustainable levels. This led to hyper-competition for grants, favoring short-term "translational research" over fundamental science, and creating selection pressure for researchers who could navigate this system rather than pursue innovative, high-risk projects. The paper proposed eleven specific reforms including reducing PhD student numbers, increasing postdoc salaries, funding people rather than projects, supporting more staff scientist positions, and revising indirect cost recovery systems.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2014 article, many of the systemic issues identified persisted and even intensified. NIH funding remained relatively flat in real terms, with the success rate for grant applications continuing to decline from already low levels. The hyper-competition for funding intensified, with average age of first R01 grant reaching new highs and many promising researchers leaving academia altogether.

However, there were some notable developments. The NIH implemented some changes aligned with the proposals, including the creation of the "Next Generation Researchers Initiative" in 2017 to support early-career investigators, and various mechanisms to fund high-risk, high-reward research like the NIH Director's Pioneer Awards and Transformative Research Awards. Some institutions did begin to reduce PhD program sizes, though this varied widely across universities.

The broader biomedical workforce crisis became more widely acknowledged, with numerous reports from the National Academies and other bodies validating the core concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic created temporary funding increases, but these were largely targeted at coronavirus research and did not fundamentally alter the underlying structural problems.

The translational research emphasis that the authors criticized in 2014 continued to dominate, with even greater pressure to demonstrate commercial applications. This was partly driven by the pharmaceutical industry's ongoing productivity challenges and the high cost of drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article and the underlying PNAS paper made several implicit predictions about the biomedical research system:

• **The system would remain unsustainable without reform** - This largely came true. Funding competition intensified, success rates remained low, and many talented researchers continued to leave academia.

• **The focus on translational research would detract from fundamental science** - This prediction was mixed. Translational research continued to dominate funding priorities, but fundamental research also saw some resurgence, particularly in areas like genomics, structural biology, and basic disease mechanisms where major advances were made.

• **The graduate student and postdoc system would continue producing excess scientists** - This persisted, though the rate of foreign student applications saw some fluctuations due to immigration policy changes and global competition for talent.

• **The proposed reforms would face resistance from established interests** - This prediction was accurate. While some incremental changes occurred, the fundamental restructuring proposed did not materialize on a systemic scale.

• **Competition would favor conservative, fundable projects over innovative work** - This trend continued, with many researchers reporting that novel ideas were increasingly difficult to fund through traditional mechanisms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addresses a persistent, structural problem in biomedical research that affects thousands of scientists and the broader scientific enterprise. The issues identified remain highly relevant and largely unresolved, making this analysis prescient and important for understanding the ongoing challenges facing academic science. The proposed solutions provide a framework for meaningful reform discussions that continue today.
