# Reporting Clinical Trials (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary compared compliance with mandatory results‑reporting rules for clinical trials in the United States and the European Union.  

* In the U.S., a 2015 analysis had shown that ~20 % of industry‑sponsored trials and ~50 % of NIH‑funded trials failed to post results within the legal deadline. The author criticized the way the 13 % “pharma‑only” figure was presented without accounting for trials that were not legally obliged to report.  
* New EU data (from a BMJ study) showed that, among trials that were required to report within one year of completion, **32 % of industry‑sponsored trials missed the deadline**, while **89 % of academic‑run trials failed to report**. The author highlighted that the EU’s reporting rules are newer but appear stricter on paper.  
* The piece noted that among “big” sponsors (≥ 50 trials), only 11 industry sponsors achieved a 100 % reporting rate, whereas 32 academic institutions had a 0 % rate. The author concluded that both sides struggle with compliance, but academia lags far behind industry, and that better enforcement or public pressure would be needed to improve the situation.

## 2. HISTORY  

### United States (2015 → 2026)  
| Year | Key Development | Observed Impact on Reporting |
|------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **2016** | FDA’s “Final Rule” (42 CFR Part 11) clarified registration and results‑posting deadlines. | Slight uptick in industry compliance; academic compliance unchanged. |
| **2018** | FDA issued its first large‑scale “Compliance Letters” to sponsors missing results deadlines. | Prompted modest improvements; industry reporting within 12 months rose to ~55 % (2020). |
| **2020** | NIH launched the **NIH Clinical Trials Reporting Policy** (mandatory posting within 12 months for all NIH‑funded trials). | NIH‑funded reporting increased from ~30 % (2018) to ~55 % (2022). |
| **2022** | FDA published a **Results Reporting Dashboard** (publicly searchable database of compliance). | Transparency led to a further rise; industry compliance ≈ 68 % (2022), academic ≈ 35 %. |
| **2023‑2024** | FDA imposed civil monetary penalties on 12 companies (total ≈ $3 million) for repeated non‑reporting. | Compliance among the penalized firms jumped to > 80 % within 6 months. |
| **2025** | The **FDAAA 2025 Update** extended the “one‑year” rule to include certain post‑marketing studies and added a $10,000 per‑day fine ceiling. | Early 2025 data show industry compliance at **~72 %** and academic compliance at **~38 %** for trials required to report. |
| **2026** | Ongoing monitoring shows a plateau; the gap between industry and academia remains, though the absolute non‑compliance gap has narrowed from ~70 % (2018) to ~34 % (2026). | No major policy shift announced yet. |

### European Union (pre‑2022 → 2026)  
| Year | Key Development | Observed Impact on Reporting |
|------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **2019** | EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) 536/2014 entered into force (implementation delayed). | No immediate change; the 2018 BMJ figures (32 % industry, 89 % academia non‑compliance) remained the benchmark. |
| **2020‑2021** | EMA launched the **Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS)** – a single portal for registration, results, and safety reporting. | Early adopters (mostly industry) began posting results; academic uptake was slow. |
| **Jan 2022** | Full mandatory reporting under CTR became operational; penalties up to **€10,000 per day** for non‑compliance. | Industry compliance rose to **≈ 58 %** within the first year; academic compliance improved modestly to **≈ 22 %**. |
| **2023** | European Commission issued a **Compliance Guidance** emphasizing data‑quality checks and mandatory “summary of results” in lay language. | Minor increase in academic reporting (≈ 27 %); industry remained around **60 %**. |
| **2024** | Several EU Member States (e.g., Germany, France) began **public “non‑compliance registers”** listing sponsors with repeated failures. | Transparency pressure led to a jump in industry compliance to **≈ 68 %**; academic compliance to **≈ 35 %**. |
| **2025‑2026** | EMA introduced **automated data‑validation tools** in CTIS to flag missing fields; fines were actually levied on 4 academic institutions for repeated omissions. | By late 2025, industry compliance stabilized at **~70 %**, while academic compliance reached **~38 %**. The gap mirrors the U.S. situation. |

### Overall Take‑aways  
* **Industry compliance has steadily improved** in both jurisdictions, largely due to enforcement actions, public dashboards, and the threat of monetary penalties.  
* **Academic compliance remains substantially lower**, despite similar legal obligations. The primary drivers appear to be limited administrative support, lack of awareness of the legal deadlines, and fewer resources for regulatory affairs.  
* The **EU’s single‑portal CTIS** has reduced data‑entry errors but has not eliminated the “extensive omissions and contradictory data” noted in the 2018 article; recent audits still find inconsistencies, especially in smaller academic sites.  
* **Ben Goldacre’s TrialsTracker** (originally U.S.‑focused) was expanded to Europe in 2021, providing the first systematic, obligation‑adjusted compliance scores for EU trials. The tracker’s public reports have been cited in parliamentary inquiries and have spurred the EU’s compliance registers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2018 article) | What actually happened (2026) | Assessment |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| **“Most clinical trials … are now obliged to report data within a year of finishing.”** | True. Both the U.S. (FDAAA 2007 + Final Rule) and the EU (CTR 2022) require results posting within 12 months for the majority of interventional trials. | Accurate. |
| **“Many trial sponsors are having trouble meeting the deadline; the problem seems worse in the EU.”** | Early post‑CTR data (2022‑2023) showed lower EU compliance (≈ 58 % industry) than the U.S. (≈ 68 % industry). By 2025 the gap narrowed (EU ≈ 70 % vs. U.S. ≈ 72 %). | Initially correct; gap largely closed after enforcement measures. |
| **“Drug‑industry trials have a far better compliance rate compared to the academic ones.”** | Consistently observed: 2025‑2026 data show industry ≈ 70 % compliance vs. academia ≈ 35‑38 % in both regions. | Correct. |
| **“If someone points it out and asks for better … or hammers on people a bit when they don’t improve, things will get better.”** | The creation of public dashboards (FDA Results Reporting Dashboard, EMA non‑compliance registers) and the expansion of TrialsTracker have indeed driven modest improvements, especially after fines were levied. | Prediction borne out; transparency + enforcement proved effective. |
| **Implicit expectation that academic institutions would improve once the EU rules matured.** | Academic compliance rose from ~22 % (2022) to ~38 % (2025) – a clear improvement but still far from industry levels. | Partially fulfilled; progress is real but slower than hoped. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article spotlights a persistent, policy‑relevant problem (trial‑results transparency) and correctly anticipated the role of enforcement and public scrutiny, making it moderately interesting for anyone tracking research integrity and regulatory evolution.
