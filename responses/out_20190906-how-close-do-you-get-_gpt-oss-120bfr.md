# How Close Do You Get to the Best Compound? (Sep 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author asks a “Twitter‑style” thought experiment: when a drug‑discovery project finally lands on a clinical candidate, how many other “development‑worthy” molecules were left on the table? He wonders whether, for any marketed drug, a modestly better analogue could be created simply by tweaking the existing scaffold—if only patent concerns were set aside.  

To illustrate the idea, he points to the first wave of **deuterated drug analogues**.  Deuterium substitution can slow metabolic clearance without changing the core pharmacophore, and early patents did not cover such variants.  Teva’s **deutetrabenazine** (Austedo) received FDA approval in 2017, and Concert Pharmaceuticals has been pursuing deuterated versions of other drugs (e.g., ruxolitinib).  The author concludes that while the concept works, it has not “revolutionized” the industry, and he suspects that most marketed drugs are already near the top of the attainable performance distribution—only small incremental gains are likely.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Deuterated drugs after 2019  
| Year | Drug (brand) | Original molecule | Indication | Status (2024) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| 2020 | **Austedo** (generic deutetrabenazine) | Tetrabenazine | Huntington’s disease, tardive dyskinesia | Generic versions on market; no new deuterated approvals. |
| 2021 | **Deutetrabenazine** (new formulations) | – | Same indications | Continued commercial success; modest sales. |
| 2022‑2024 | **CTP‑543** (deuterated ruxolitinib) | Ruxolitinib | Myelofibrosis, graft‑versus‑host disease (investigational) | Phase 2/3 trials ongoing; not yet approved. |
| 2023 | **CTP‑247** (deuterated version of a CNS drug) | Not disclosed | Parkinson’s disease (investigational) | Phase 1 completed; early data suggest similar exposure with reduced metabolite formation. |
| 2023‑2024 | **Deuterated versions of existing antivirals** (e.g., deuterated sofosbuvir analogues) | Sofosbuvir | Hepatitis C (pre‑clinical) | Still in discovery; no clinical data. |

**Take‑away:** Since the article’s publication, **only one deuterated small‑molecule drug (deutetrabenazine) has reached the market**, and a handful of candidates remain in early‑stage clinical testing.  The anticipated “wave” of deuterated analogues has not materialized into a sizable therapeutic class.

### Broader “next‑generation” analogues  
While deuteration is a concrete example, the industry has continued to generate **improved versions of existing drugs** through:

* **Structural simplification** (e.g., the 2021 FDA approval of **selinexor** analogs with fewer chiral centers).  
* **Prodrug strategies** that enhance oral bioavailability (e.g., the 2022 approval of **fosnetupitant**, a prodrug of netupitant).  
* **Macrocyclization or constrained analogues** that improve selectivity (e.g., the 2023 FDA approval of **pirtobrutinib**, a non‑covalent BTK inhibitor derived from earlier covalent scaffolds).

These efforts are routine in medicinal chemistry, but the **public record rarely reveals how many “almost‑ready” candidates were abandoned**.  Companies typically keep such data confidential, so a quantitative answer to the original question remains unavailable.

### Impact on business and policy  
* **Concert Pharmaceuticals** raised **$300 M** in a 2022 Series C round, indicating investor belief that deuterated chemistry still holds commercial promise, even though regulatory approvals are pending.  
* **Patent practice** has adapted: many recent filings now explicitly claim **deuterated embodiments** to block competitors, reducing the “open‑field” advantage the author described.  
* No major **regulatory policy changes** (e.g., special pathways for deuterated drugs) have been introduced; the FDA treats them as standard new molecular entities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the article) | What actually happened (by Jan 2026) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| *“Deuterated analogs could become a major new class of drugs.”* | Only **one** deuterated drug (deutetrabenazine) is on the market; a few candidates are in trials, but the class remains niche. |
| *“Most marketed drugs have only small room for improvement; a better analogue would be a modest tweak.”* | Consistent with reality: most follow‑on analogues (e.g., prodrugs, deuterated versions) have delivered **incremental** benefits (slightly longer half‑life, reduced metabolite) rather than dramatic efficacy jumps. |
| *“If you set aside patent concerns, many better chemotypes could be discovered for the same target.”* | The industry continues to explore multiple chemotypes for high‑profile targets (e.g., KRAS G12C, BTK), but **public data** show that only a **handful** of distinct scaffolds progress to late‑stage development per target, suggesting the “many hidden gems” hypothesis is overstated. |
| *“The deuteration story shows the idea works but hasn’t revolutionized the industry.”* | Accurate: deuteration works for specific metabolic liabilities, yet it has **not** reshaped drug‑discovery pipelines or become a standard optimization tool. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece raises a timeless, thought‑provoking question about hidden chemical space and uses a concrete, real‑world example (deuterated drugs).  However, the discussion is largely speculative, and subsequent developments have been modest, limiting its long‑term impact.
