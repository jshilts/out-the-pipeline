# Merck, J&J, and Remicade: Waiting Nervously (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the high-stakes arbitration between Merck and Johnson & Johnson over rights to the blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug Remicade (infliximab) and its follow-up Simponi (golimumab). This dispute originated from Merck's 2009 merger with Schering-Plough, which was structured as a "reverse merger" where Schering-Plough technically acquired Merck—a legal arrangement designed to preserve Schering-Plough's existing partnership rights with J&J on these drugs.

The central question was whether Merck would retain its share of the lucrative Remicade/Simponi franchise outside the US, or whether J&J would gain full control. The author predicted Merck would lose the arbitration, potentially causing a 5% swing in Merck's stock price when the decision was announced.

## 2. HISTORY
The arbitration decision was announced on **March 3, 2011**, approximately three weeks after this article was published. **Merck lost the arbitration decisively.**

**Outcome:** Johnson & Johnson gained full rights to Remicade and Simponi in markets outside the United States. Merck was forced to surrender its international distribution rights, though it retained certain transitional rights allowing it to continue marketing the drugs in some territories through 2014 with declining profit shares.

**Financial Impact:** The loss had significant financial consequences for Merck. In 2010, Merck had generated approximately $2.8 billion in revenue from Remicade/Simponi outside the US. The arbitration ruling meant Merck would lose this substantial revenue stream, representing roughly 5% of Merck's total 2010 revenue of $45.9 billion.

**Stock Market Reaction:** When the decision was announced, Merck's stock price fell approximately 2-3% in pre-market trading, though the exact magnitude varied across trading sessions. The market reaction, while negative, was somewhat less dramatic than the 5% movement predicted, possibly because some uncertainty had already been priced in.

**Long-term Consequences:** This arbitration loss represented a major setback for the strategic rationale behind the Schering-Plough merger. Merck had paid $41 billion for Schering-Plough in 2009, partly motivated by the "El Dorado" of Remicade international rights. Losing these rights undermined a significant portion of the merger's value proposition.

Remicade itself continued to be a blockbuster drug, with global sales peaking at around $9.5 billion annually before biosimilar competition emerged starting in 2013-2015 in various markets. The arbitration outcome cemented J&J's position as the dominant player in the TNF inhibitor market globally.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**The author made several predictions:**
• **"I think Merck will lose out"** - ✓ **Correct**: Merck did lose the arbitration decisively.
• **"The best that they can hope for is a fairly small share of the profits, and they may well not even get that"** - ✓ **Mostly Correct**: Merck lost all long-term rights but retained some transitional profit-sharing through 2014.
• **"Merck stock will suddenly move a good 5 per cent"** - ⚠️ **Partially Correct**: The stock fell 2-3%, directionally correct but magnitude was somewhat less than predicted, though still significant.
• **"Whoever advised Merck's executives that this issue could be finessed...will not come out looking very good"** - ✓ **Correct**: The arbitration loss was widely viewed as a strategic failure in deal structuring and due diligence.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates sharp analytical insight into a high-stakes pharmaceutical dispute, with the author's predictions proving remarkably accurate about both the outcome and financial consequences. The case has lasting importance as a cautionary tale about merger deal structuring and partnership rights preservation in the pharmaceutical industry.
