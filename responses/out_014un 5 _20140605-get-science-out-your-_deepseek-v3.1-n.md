# Analysis of "Get the Science Out of Your Yogurt" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a marketing campaign by yogurt company Chobani that used the slogan "Nature got us to 100 calories. Not scientists. #howmatters" - framing this as part of a broader "Science = icky" cultural attitude that the author finds both intellectually dishonest and commercially cynical. The author argues this represents a fundamental hypocrisy: an industrial-scale food company that absolutely relies on food science, industrial fermentation, large-scale logistics, and sophisticated manufacturing processes promoting an anti-science message that dishonestly positions their products as "natural" rather than scientifically engineered. The deeper critique targets the marketing strategy itself - that companies deliberately cultivate anti-science branding to appeal to consumers who prefer "natural" products, creating what the author sees as a dishonest and manipulative commercial relationship that undermines public understanding of science.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 Chobani campaign this article criticized proved to be a defining moment in food marketing, occurring at the peak of the "clean label" and "natural foods" movement. In the decade following this article:

**Chobani's continued trajectory**: The company maintained its position as a market leader in Greek yogurt, but eventually moved away from overtly anti-science messaging. They faced increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies about health claims, and by the late 2010s, their marketing evolved to emphasize protein content, probiotics, and nutritional science rather than anti-science positioning.

**Industry-wide shift**: The initial 2010s trend toward "natural" and "non-GMO" marketing reached its zenith around 2016-2018, but gradually became more nuanced. Many food companies discovered that while anti-science positioning initially resonated with consumers, it created long-term brand limitations and regulatory risks.

**Scientific backlash grows**: Articles like this one were part of a broader scientific and academic pushback against what became known as "scienceploitation" - the appropriation of scientific mistrust for commercial purposes. This led to increased FTC scrutiny of health claims and "natural" labeling.

**Regulatory crackdown**: By 2016-2020, the FDA and FTC began cracking down on unfounded health claims in food marketing, forcing companies to be more careful about how they positioned their products relative to science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions that were largely accurate**:

- **Commercial motivation**: The author correctly identified this as a "really cynical outlook" designed to exploit consumer attitudes, not genuine ideology. Subsequent history showed this was indeed calculated marketing that Chobani and other companies adjusted as market conditions changed.

- **Underlying hypocrisy**: The observation that industrial food production "has to be produced... with lots of stainless steel equipment" proved prescient, as consumers became increasingly aware of the industrial realities behind "natural" foods.

- **Customer manipulation**: The prediction that consumers who responded to such messaging "can be sold all sorts of stuff" proved accurate - the 2010s saw a boom in "clean label" products often priced at premiums despite similar nutritional profiles.

**Predictions that were partially or completely wrong**:

- **Permanence of anti-science messaging**: The author's somewhat pessimistic tone suggested this trend might continue indefinitely. In reality, while anti-science food marketing never fully disappeared, it peaked within 2-4 years and became more sophisticated and less overt.

- **Company viability**: Implicit in the critique was the idea that such marketing would eventually prove unsustainable or backfire significantly. While there were regulatory consequences, Chobani remained successful and adapted their messaging rather than suffering major consequences.

- **Broader anti-science momentum**: The article seemed to fear this represented an accelerating trend. In retrospect, 2014 was arguably near the peak of this particular marketing approach, which largely plateaued or declined afterward.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6** (70th percentile)

This article deserves credit for identifying a genuine cultural and commercial phenomenon at a crucial moment. The author recognized that anti-science sentiment was being actively cultivated as a marketing strategy rather than simply reflecting organic consumer preferences, which was analytically prescient.

However, the article's long-term importance is moderate rather than exceptional because:

- The specific marketing trend it addressed proved to be somewhat ephemeral
- The analysis, while accurate about motivations, underestimated the speed at which market dynamics would evolve
- Other contemporaneous pieces made similar observations about "scienceploitation"

What gives it enduring relevance is how it captured a specific cultural moment when the organic/health food movement intersected with marketing psychology and anti-intellectual currents. The framework it established for understanding how commercial interests manipulate public attitudes toward science remains applicable even as specific marketing tactics evolve.

The article is most interesting as a case study in the complex relationship between science, commerce, and public perception - particularly how quickly commercial positioning can change when early marketing strategies encounter regulatory and market limitations.

**Decile: 6/9**
