# An Alzheimer's Blood Test? Not So Fast. (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This July 2014 commentary critiques overly optimistic media coverage of a research paper claiming progress toward an Alzheimer's blood test. The original study from King's College London and Proteome Sciences identified ten proteins that could predict Alzheimer's disease progression with approximately 87% accuracy in their cohort. However, the author emphasizes that this accuracy rate—while seemingly impressive—is insufficient for clinical use, especially given the statistical challenges of screening tests in general populations where disease prevalence affects false positive rates dramatically.

The article notes that the research involved a multivariate model with complicating factors including patient age, gender, plasma storage duration, and collection center effects, indicating the test was far from ready for clinical deployment. The author also points out that this was not the first such claim, referencing a 2009 prediction that an Alzheimer's blood test would enter clinics within 12-18 months—which clearly hadn't materialized by 2014. The commentary stresses that the researchers themselves acknowledged much more validation work was needed.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2014 article, blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease have evolved from research curiosities into increasingly viable clinical tools, though progress has been more gradual and complex than early headlines suggested.

The most significant development has been the emergence of blood-based amyloid and tau assays. By the early 2020s, several platforms demonstrated the ability to detect amyloid pathology with accuracy comparable to expensive PET scans or invasive CSF analysis. The **C₂N Diagnostics PrecivityAD test** became the first blood test for amyloid-beta pathology to become clinically available (though initially with limitations on interpretation). Other notable platforms include **Quanterix's Simoa technology**, which can detect ultra-low levels of neurodegenerative biomarkers, and assays like the **Roche Elecsys p-tau217** and **Eli Lilly's p-tau217 blood test**, which showed strong correlation with amyloid PET status.

The FDA approved the first Alzheimer's blood test for clinical use in 2020 (C₂N's PrecivityAD), though with important caveats about interpretation and appropriate use. Subsequent years saw improved versions with better accuracy and additional markers. These tests have primarily been used to identify candidates for anti-amyloid therapies and to reduce the need for expensive PET scans in clinical trials and specialized memory clinics.

However, real-world adoption has been uneven. While technically available, widespread implementation in general practice has been limited by cost (tests ranged from $500-1,200 initially, though prices have decreased), lack of standardized protocols, and the reality that until recently, limited treatment options reduced the clinical urgency for earlier diagnosis. The approval of disease-modifying therapies like **aducanumab** (2021) and **lecanemab** (2023), which require confirmation of amyloid pathology, has increased demand for accessible diagnostic tools.

Proteome Sciences, mentioned in the original article, continues to operate in the biomarker space but has not emerged as a dominant player in Alzheimer's diagnostics. The field evolved toward focusing on specific phosphorylated tau species and amyloid ratios rather than the broader protein panels explored in 2014.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: 87% accuracy is insufficient for clinical use**  
✓ **Largely validated.** Most current blood tests achieve higher accuracy (85-95% for amyloid detection), and the field recognized that different accuracy standards apply to screening versus diagnostic confirmation. Current tests are primarily used as triage tools rather than definitive diagnoses.

**• Prediction: False positive/negative rates would be problematic in general population screening**  
✓ **Proven accurate.** Blood tests have found their niche in targeted populations (people with cognitive symptoms) rather than mass screening. The positive predictive value challenge in low-prevalence populations remains a concern that has limited broad screening applications.

**• Prediction: Multivariate models with many covariates suggest the test isn't ready for clinical rollout**  
✓ **Validated.** The field moved toward simpler, more robust assays focusing on specific, well-validated biomarkers rather than complex multi-protein panels. Current tests typically rely on 1-3 key markers with established biological relevance.

**• Prediction: The timeline for clinical availability would be longer than claimed**  
✓ **Strongly validated.** While technically available by 2020, meaningful clinical integration took even longer—the 2009 "12-18 months" prediction was off by more than a decade, and widespread adoption is still ongoing.

**• Prediction: Brain imaging data integration would be complex and not necessarily additive**  
? **Mixed validation.** The 2014 study found imaging didn't improve prediction; in clinical practice today, blood tests are sometimes used to triage who needs PET scans or combined with other clinical information, suggesting integration is valuable but in different ways than originally studied.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about the practical challenges of biomarker development and deserves recognition for correctly identifying the gap between research findings and clinical reality. It highlighted statistical and implementation issues that proved central to the field's subsequent decade of development, making it a valuable case study in realistic assessment of medical technology claims.
