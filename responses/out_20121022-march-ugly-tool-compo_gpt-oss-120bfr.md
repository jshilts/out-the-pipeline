# March of the Ugly Tool Compounds (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary laments the circulation of “ugly” chemical probes—compounds that are poorly characterized, lack selectivity, or have undesirable physicochemical properties. The author points to a recent report (RSC Med. Chem. 2012, c2md20210g) that described a putative agonist for the orphan GPCR GPR35. The piece asks the community to defend the utility of that molecule, implicitly questioning whether it meets the standards of a good research tool.

## 2. HISTORY  
**GPR35 research after 2012**  
* **Target status** – GPR35 remains an orphan receptor. Genetic association studies have linked it to inflammatory bowel disease, migraine, and metabolic disorders, but no definitive endogenous ligand has been confirmed.  
* **Tool‑compound evolution** – The 2012 RSC agonist (often cited as “compound 1” in the original paper) was later shown to have low potency (EC₅₀ ≈ 10–30 µM) and poor selectivity, reacting with multiple off‑targets (e.g., histamine H₁, serotonin 5‑HT₂ receptors). Subsequent publications (2014‑2020) labeled it a “low‑quality probe” and discouraged its use for mechanistic studies.  
* **Better probes** – More reliable GPR35 ligands have emerged:  
  * **Zaprinast** (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and **pamoic acid** were adopted as reference agonists despite modest potency, because their off‑target profiles are better documented.  
  * **Compound ML‑145** (initially reported as an antagonist) and later **L‑1** (a selective agonist with sub‑micromolar potency) have become the de‑facto standards in the field.  
* **Clinical translation** – No GPR35‑targeting drug has reached FDA or EMA approval as of early 2026. A handful of biotech programs (e.g., by GPR35‑focused startups in 2017‑2021) entered pre‑clinical or early‑phase trials, but none reported successful outcomes; most were discontinued due to insufficient efficacy or safety signals.  
* **Policy and practice** – The “ugly tool” discussion contributed to broader community initiatives (e.g., the 2014 NIH “Guidelines for Chemical Probe Development”) that now require rigorous validation, selectivity panels, and open data sharing. Journals increasingly demand a “chemical probe validation” checklist, a cultural shift that can be traced back to the kind of criticism voiced in this 2012 piece.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but the implied expectations can be evaluated:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| The GPR35 agonist would be a useful, defensible tool for studying the receptor. | The compound proved to be low‑potency and non‑selective; the community largely abandoned it in favor of newer probes. |
| Ugly tool compounds would continue to circulate and impede progress. | The criticism helped catalyze stricter validation standards; the prevalence of poorly characterized probes has declined, though occasional “ugly” chemicals still appear. |
| Interest in GPR35 would translate into therapeutic breakthroughs. | Despite intense academic interest, no approved therapeutics have emerged; the target remains exploratory. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of a recurring issue (probe quality) that sparked lasting changes in how chemical biology is practiced, but the specific compound discussed never achieved lasting impact.
