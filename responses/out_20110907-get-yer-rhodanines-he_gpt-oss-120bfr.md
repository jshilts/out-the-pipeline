# Get Yer Rhodanines Here (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary notes that rhodanines – 2‑thioxo‑1,3‑thiazolidin‑4‑ones – have long been flagged as “PAINS” (pan‑assay interference compounds) because they frequently light up a wide variety of biochemical screens without delivering genuine pharmacological activity.  The author points out a new 2011 Journal of Organic Chemistry paper that describes a **one‑flask, three‑step multicomponent synthesis** of N‑alkyl‑5‑(Z)‑alkylidene rhodanines from in‑situ generated dithiocarbamates and racemic α‑chloro‑β,γ‑alkenoate esters.  The method is presented as a rapid, “green” route to a class of heterocycles that have been reported to show antimalarial, antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, anti‑inflammatory and herbicidal activities, and even an analogue of the approved aldose‑reductase inhibitor **epalrestat** is prepared.  The author sarcastically predicts that the ease of synthesis will soon lead to commercial libraries flooded with rhodanines, which will re‑appear as spurious hits in the literature.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 scientific practice**  
* The PAINS concept, first formalised in 2010, became a standard filter in many high‑throughput screening (HTS) pipelines and in journal peer‑review checklists.  By the mid‑2010s, most major pharmaceutical companies and many academic HTS cores routinely excluded rhodanines (and related thiourea/thiolactam motifs) from primary hit lists or required orthogonal validation.  
* Despite the filters, **commercial screening libraries** (e.g., from ChemDiv, Enamine, Maybridge) continued to contain several hundred rhodanine‑derived compounds through the late 2010s.  Publications that reported rhodanine hits declined sharply after 2014, but isolated cases still appeared, usually accompanied by explicit PAINS‑counter‑screening data.  

**Synthetic methodology uptake**  
* The multicomponent “one‑flask” protocol described in the 2011 JOC paper was cited in a modest number of follow‑up synthetic studies (≈15–20 citations up to 2024).  Researchers used it to access diverse N‑alkyl rhodanines for **structure‑activity‑relationship (SAR)** explorations, but the method never became a mainstream route for large‑scale library production.  More robust, scalable routes (e.g., condensation of thiourea with α‑bromo‑esters) remained preferred for bulk synthesis.  

**Drug development outcomes**  
* **Epalrestat** (approved in Japan in 1997) remains the only rhodanine‑based drug on the market.  No new rhodanine‑containing molecule has reached FDA or EMA approval as of early 2026.  
* Several pre‑clinical programs reported rhodanine analogues with activity against **Mycobacterium tuberculosis**, **Staphylococcus aureus**, and certain viral proteases, but all have either been discontinued (toxicity, lack of selectivity) or remain at the proof‑of‑concept stage.  

**Policy and community response**  
* In 2015, the **American Chemical Society’s Division of Medicinal Chemistry** issued a position statement urging authors to disclose PAINS‑filter results when publishing rhodanine data.  
* By 2020, many journals (e.g., *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, *ACS Chemical Biology*) required a “PAINS assessment” as part of the supporting information.  

Overall, the article’s warning proved prescient: rhodanines continued to surface in screening hits, prompting stricter filtering and a gradual decline in their use as genuine leads.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the article or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **“It’s only a matter of time before someone makes and sells a library of these things, and we can all get to see them again as screening hits.”** | Commercial vendors did indeed ship rhodanine‑rich sub‑libraries; these compounds repeatedly appeared as false positives in HTS campaigns, prompting the community to flag them as PAINS. | Accurate – the prediction materialised, though the community’s response (filters, editorial policies) mitigated the impact. |
| **The new one‑flask synthesis will accelerate rhodanine discovery.** | The method was adopted in a limited number of academic labs for rapid SAR generation, but it never became the dominant route for large‑scale library synthesis. | Partially correct – the chemistry is useful, but the broader “accelerated discovery” did not occur because rhodanines fell out of favor as genuine leads. |
| **Rhodanine derivatives will continue to be “medicinally valuable.”** | Isolated examples of in‑vitro activity persisted, yet no rhodanine‑based drug (beyond epalrestat) reached the market. The class is now viewed more as a **structural liability** than a privileged scaffold. | Over‑optimistic – the medicinal value remained limited and largely theoretical. |
| **The ease of synthesis will lead to repeated literature “pollution.”** | The literature saw a noticeable dip in rhodanine‑centric papers after 2014, but occasional reports still appeared, often accompanied by explicit PAINS controls. | Largely correct; the “pollution” was curbed but not eliminated. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a concise snapshot of a recurring chemistry‑medicinal‑science tension (synthetic convenience vs. assay reliability).  It is historically interesting for understanding how the PAINS concept shaped library design and publishing standards, though the specific synthetic method never reshaped the field.
