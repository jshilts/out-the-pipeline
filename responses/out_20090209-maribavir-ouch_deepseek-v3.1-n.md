# Maribavir, Ouch (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article reports on ViroPharma's Phase III clinical trial failure of maribavir, an antiviral drug targeting cytomegalovirus (CMV) that the company had licensed from GSK. The drug showed no difference in CMV infection rates compared to placebo in bone marrow transplant patients, despite promising Phase II results. The author draws parallels to ViroPharma's earlier failure with Pleconaril in the late 1990s, an antiviral that was hyped as potentially curing the common cold before collapsing in 2000 and causing significant stock volatility. The piece serves as commentary on the unpredictable nature of drug development and the gap between Phase II promise and Phase III reality.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2009 Phase III failure, maribavir's development took an interesting trajectory that the original article couldn't have predicted. Shionogi acquired the rights to maribavir and conducted additional Phase II trials, leading to FDA approval in November 2021 under the brand name Livtencity (maribavir) for treatment of post-transplant CMV infection/disease in adults who are resistant or refractory to prior antiviral treatment. The drug works through a novel mechanism as a viral terminase complex inhibitor rather than the typical DNA polymerase mechanism that failed in 2009. Clinical uptake has been moderate but meaningful, particularly for transplant patients with limited treatment options where it fills a specific niche for drug-resistant CMV.

Regarding ViroPharma, the company experienced several more development cycles before being acquired by Horizon Pharma (now part of Amgen) in 2014 for approximately \$4.2 billion, demonstrating that biotech companies can recover from major clinical failures through pipeline diversification and strategic pivots. The company ultimately found success with hereditary angioedema treatments rather than antivirals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained relatively few explicit predictions, but several implicit assessments about drug development challenges proved accurate:
- **Phase II success does not guarantee Phase III success**: The article's central message about the gap between Phase II and Phase III proved generally accurate across biotech, with recent analyses showing approximately 60-65% of drugs that succeed in Phase II fail in Phase III across various therapeutic areas
- **Antiviral drug development is challenging**: This assessment remained accurate, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when despite massive investment, developing effective antivirals proved extremely difficult, though some successes like Paxlovid emerged
- **Maribavir's future appeared bleak**: The implicit prediction that maribavir had failed proved premature, as the drug was eventually approved 12 years after this article

The article's broader theme about biotech volatility and the difficulty of antiviral development was prescient, though the specific case of maribavir demonstrated that failed compounds can sometimes be resurrected through different development strategies and patient populations.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article captures an important moment in drug development and illustrates both the unpredictability of clinical trials and the reality that drugs can fail in unexpected ways, while also showing that comprehensive historical knowledge requires following development over many years. The narrative around biotech volatility and the specifics of antiviral challenges remain relevant.
