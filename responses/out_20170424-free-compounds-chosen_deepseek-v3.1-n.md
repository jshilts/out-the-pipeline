# Free Compounds, Chosen By Software (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Atomwise's announcement of offering free AI-driven drug discovery services to academic researchers. Through its "AIM" program, Atomwise would use its AtomNet deep convolutional neural network to screen millions of molecules for researchers' specified disease targets and provide 72 top candidate compounds ready for laboratory testing. The author expresses significant skepticism about several aspects: whether the "artificial intelligence" terminology is appropriate marketing hype, the scientific validity of AtomNet's assumption that distant atoms rarely affect each other in molecular binding (contrary to medicinal chemistry experience with structure-activity relationships), and the press release's characterization of screening hits as "72 potential medicines." The author acknowledges that the program represents a genuine attempt to validate AtomNet's technology through real-world testing, but questions whether the approach will demonstrate meaningful improvement over traditional virtual screening or even random compound selection.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2017 announcement, Atomwise has continued to develop and deploy its AI drug discovery platform, achieving several notable milestones:

**Industry Partnerships and Expansion**: Atomwise has formed partnerships with pharmaceutical companies beyond the initial Merck collaboration mentioned in the article, including agreements with Eli Lilly, Bayer, Hansoh Pharma, and others. These partnerships have focused on drug discovery programs across multiple therapeutic areas.

**Technology Validation Through Published Results**: Atomwise has published peer-reviewed studies demonstrating AtomNet's performance. Notably, the platform successfully identified candidate compounds for various diseases including Ebola, multiple sclerosis, and various cancers. However, I should note that while the company has reported positive results in academic publications, I cannot confidently confirm the extent of clinical translation of these specific discoveries.

**Continued Academic Collaborations**: The AIM program has expanded, with Atomwise reporting collaborations with hundreds of academic researchers across multiple institutions, providing what the company terms "AI-discovered" compounds for testing against various targets.

**Investment and Commercial Growth**: The company has raised substantial funding, including a $123 million Series B round in 2021, indicating investor confidence in the approach. The business model has evolved to include both academic partnerships and commercial pharmaceutical collaborations.

**Scientific Recognition**: AtomNet and similar deep learning approaches have gained broader acceptance within computational chemistry, though debates continue about the optimal integration of AI with traditional medicinal chemistry expertise.

The approach described in the article—using deep neural networks to predict molecular binding—has become an established, though still evolving, methodology in drug discovery, with multiple companies now offering similar AI-driven screening services.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **"I'll be surprised if there's much of an enhancement for many of these"**: This prediction has proven **partially accurate**. While Atomwise and similar companies have demonstrated some successes, the dramatic revolutionary impact that some press releases suggested has not fully materialized. The field has shown promise but remains one of several tools rather than a complete replacement for traditional drug discovery methods.

• **Skepticism about "72 potential medicines" terminology**: This prediction has proven **largely correct**. The compounds identified through AI screening remain early-stage hits requiring extensive additional development and validation, much like traditional screening hits. The characterization as "potential medicines" was indeed marketing hyperbole, as these early hits face the same attrition rates as compounds from any discovery method.

• **Implicit prediction about the challenge of protein flexibility and binding site accommodation**: This has proven **accurate but addressable**. These remain significant challenges in computational drug discovery, though improved algorithms and increased computational power have enabled better handling of protein flexibility than was possible in 2017.

• **Skepticism about distant atom effects**: The assumption about local interactions has proven **oversimplified but workable for initial screening**. More sophisticated modern approaches incorporate longer-range effects and more nuanced understanding of molecular interactions, though the basic concept of identifying initial hits through local interaction patterns has shown utility.

• **Prediction that Atomwise genuinely wants to validate their technology through this program**: This has proven **accurate**. The program has provided valuable data and case studies that Atomwise has used to refine AtomNet and demonstrate its capabilities to potential commercial partners.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article warrants high interest because it captured a pivotal moment in the democratization of AI drug discovery tools, raised fundamental questions about the promises and limitations of computational approaches that remain relevant today, and predicted some of the overhype that would characterize the field while acknowledging the genuine scientific merit in attempting such validation programs.
