# Chemical Probe Compounds: Time to Get Real (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article highlights a significant quality control problem in biomedical research: the widespread use of inappropriate or poorly characterized chemical probe compounds. The author, Derek Lowe, notes that many commonly used inhibitors are non-selective and have been superseded by better alternatives, yet they continue to be used extensively and sold by vendors with misleading descriptions of their selectivity. Examples cited include LY294002 (promoted as a selective PI3K inhibitor despite promiscuous activity), staurosporine (used as a PKC inhibitor but actually a broad kinase inhibitor), dorsomorphin (a poor AMPK signaling inhibitor), and chaetocin (not a selective histone methyltransferase probe). The piece announces a new paper in *Nature Chemical Biology* and the launch of a community-curated wiki-based resource, chemicalprobes.org, intended to catalog validated, high-quality chemical probes and help researchers avoid flawed reagents. The author calls for researchers, suppliers, reviewers, and journals to help clean up the literature and reduce the propagation of unreliable results stemming from poor tool compounds.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article was published, efforts to improve chemical probe quality gained substantial traction in the biomedical community. The Chemical Probes Portal (chemicalprobes.org) became a recognized, centralized resource for vetted, selective chemical tools and was later updated and re-launched. Major funding bodies, institutions, and journals began adopting policies requiring chemical probe validation and reporting standards for papers using tool compounds. For example:
- Grant reviewers at major agencies increasingly scrutinized the quality of chemical probes proposed in applications.
- Journals implemented guidelines encouraging or requiring authors to justify probe choices and cite recommendations from the Portal or similar resources, and some introduced checklists to flag common problematic probes.
- Institutional training and vendor catalogs started directing researchers to the Portal to reduce inappropriate use.

Community-driven initiatives expanded beyond a simple wiki: crowdsourced annotations grew, and expert groups published updated criteria and scoring rubrics to guide probe selection. While awareness and scrutiny improved, inadequate chemical tools did not disappear from the literature immediately; lower-quality vendors continued to sell poorly characterized compounds, and studies continued to use outdated probes (LY294002 and staurosporine remained common), but the proportion of high-quality studies citing validated probes increased. This wave of reform contributed to a broader push for rigor and reproducibility in preclinical pharmacology and chemical biology, complementing initiatives like the NIH Principles and Guidelines for Reporting Preclinical Research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Chemicalprobes.org will become a resource that everyone can turn to for validated probes.**  
  **Outcome:** The site developed into a widely recognized, expert-curated resource, expanding coverage with crowdsourced feedback and gaining adoption by researchers, funders, and journals. It helped establish norms for probe validation, though uptake was gradual and incomplete across the global research community. It did not fully replace catalog descriptions, but provided a credible alternative that influenced procurement and publication standards.

- **The excuses for using worthless chemical probes will eventually disappear.**  
  **Outcome:** Excuses did diminish, but did not vanish. Stricter editorial policies and reviewer checklists reduced unexamined use of poor probes in high-profile journals, while many researchers remained unaware, under-resourced, or unwilling to retire legacy reagents. The problem shifted from near-universal neglect to a “long tail” of use in lower-tier publications and early-stage labs, with persistent but improving rates of compliance.

- **Supplier catalogs might reference chemicalprobes.org, and reviewers and authors would pay attention to its listings.**  
  **Outcome:** This largely materialized over time. Leading suppliers began to align catalog entries and selector guides with chemicalprobes.org recommendations, and many journals adopted guidance encouraging citation of the Portal to justify probe choices. Many peer reviewers now routinely flag inadequate probes in manuscripts, leading to improved reporting and tool selection in better-funded and higher-impact studies.

- **Use of outdated probes like LY294002 and staurosporine should decline.**  
  **Outcome:** Use of these classic flawed probes did decrease in higher-quality studies, especially those funded by major agencies or published in reputable journals, but they continue to appear in less rigorous literature. More selective alternatives entered widespread use, validating the core recommendation, yet the persistence of these reagents in catalogs and older protocols means they still show up in papers and sometimes confuse interpretation.

- **The problem will get worse without a portal to fix it.**  
  **Outcome:** With the Portal and associated policy shifts, the problem’s trajectory improved. Without these interventions, continued proliferation of poor probes and reproducibility issues would likely have accelerated; instead, the field saw slow but steady improvements in baseline rigor. The effort did not eliminate all poor tool usage but likely prevented further degradation.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **8/10**  
A thoughtfully written and influential advocacy piece that catalyzed meaningful reforms in chemical probe practices and contributed to broader reproducibility efforts in biomedicine. Its recommendations have had lasting impact on community standards and reporting norms.
