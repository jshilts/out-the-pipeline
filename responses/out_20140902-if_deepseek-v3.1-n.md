# What If? (2 Sep 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a brief announcement about Randall Munroe's newly released book "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions," published on September 2, 2014. The author notes that Munroe, creator of the webcomic XKCD, addresses peculiar hypothetical scenarios submitted by readers, applying scientific reasoning to absurd questions. The writer mentions being quoted in the chapter discussing the consequences of constructing a periodic table using cube-shaped bricks made of each corresponding element, cautioning that this would be ill-advised for elements like astatine and francium due to their radioactive and hazardous properties.

## 2. HISTORY
The book "What If?" became a commercial success following its 2014 publication, reaching The New York Times bestseller list and establishing itself as a popular science communication resource. Randall Munroe continued building his reputation as a science educator through his XKCD webcomic, subsequent books including "How To" (2019) and "What If? 2" (2022), and regular publication of educational content that makes complex scientific and mathematical concepts accessible to broad audiences. The book's approach of combining rigorous scientific analysis with humor and creative hypothetical scenarios influenced science communication practices and demonstrated the public appetite for engaging, offbeat scientific exploration.
