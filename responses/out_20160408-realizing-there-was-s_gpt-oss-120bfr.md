# Realizing That There Was Such a Thing as Science (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post is a personal reflection on David Wootton’s 2015‑16 book *The Invention of Science*.  Wootton argues that many of the words we now take for granted in scientific discourse—*fact, discovery, invention, evidence*—did not acquire their modern meanings until the mid‑16th century.  Before that, scholars relied on Aristotelian authority and biblical or philosophical reasoning rather than systematic experimentation.  The author illustrates the shift with historical anecdotes (e.g., the mistaken belief that ice is denser than water, or that garlic neutralises magnetism) and with the example of John Smeaton’s 18th‑century water‑wheel studies, which applied Newtonian physics and quantitative measurement.  The post concludes that modern scientists inherit this experimental mindset and that “doing the experiment” is now the accepted way to generate knowledge.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Reception of Wootton’s book** – Since its U.S. release in late 2015, *The Invention of Science* has been widely reviewed in academic journals (e.g., *Isis*, *British Journal for the History of Science*) and praised for its synthesis of primary‑source research.  It won the 2016 Pfizer‑Wellcome Prize for History of Medicine and has been adopted in undergraduate courses on the history and philosophy of science at several universities in the U.S., U.K., and Australia.  Citations in scholarly literature have risen steadily; Google Scholar shows > 500 citations as of 2024, indicating that the book has become a standard reference for discussions of early modern scientific language.

**Impact on historiography** – Wootton’s emphasis on the emergence of “scientific vocabulary” has spurred a modest wave of follow‑up studies examining lexical change in early modern texts (e.g., analyses of the word *experiment* in the 16th‑17th century French and Dutch corpora).  These works have largely confirmed his claim that the modern sense of *fact* and *evidence* spread from legal discourse into natural philosophy during the 1500s‑1600s, though some scholars argue that the transition was more gradual and geographically uneven than Wootton suggests.

**Broader cultural influence** – The book’s accessible narrative has helped popularise the idea that the scientific method is a relatively recent cultural invention, a point that has been echoed in science‑communication outlets (e.g., *Scientific American*, *BBC Radio 4*).  No major policy changes can be traced directly to the book, but its framing has been cited in a few university‑level curriculum reforms that aim to teach the history of scientific methodology alongside technical content.

**No direct technological or commercial fallout** – The article’s discussion of Smeaton’s water‑wheel experiments and the “discovery” of density of water was historical; there were no subsequent patents, startups, or FDA‑type approvals linked to the post itself.  The only concrete legacy is the reinforcement of the narrative that systematic experimentation replaced authority‑based reasoning—a narrative that continues to shape how science is taught and perceived.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The post does not contain explicit, numbered predictions, but it implies two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Systematic experimentation will become the dominant mode of inquiry across all scientific fields.** | This has held true. By 2025, experimental design, reproducibility standards, and data‑driven methods are entrenched in biology, chemistry, physics, and even social sciences (e.g., pre‑registration of studies). |
| **The language of “fact, discovery, evidence” will continue to spread and solidify in public discourse.** | The terms are now commonplace in media, policy debates, and education. However, the rise of “post‑truth” rhetoric in the 2010s shows that the public’s acceptance of *evidence* is contested, so the spread is not uniformly positive. |

No other specific forecasts (e.g., about a particular technology or policy) were made, so no further evaluation is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a concise, well‑written bridge between a scholarly book and a lay audience, highlighting a genuinely interesting shift in the history of scientific language.  Its relevance to contemporary discussions about the nature of evidence gives it lasting value, though it does not introduce new data or controversial claims that would push it into the top decile.
