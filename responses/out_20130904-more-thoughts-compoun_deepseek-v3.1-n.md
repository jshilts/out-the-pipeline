# More Thoughts on Compound Metrics (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

In this commentary from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, the author responds to a Practical Fragments blog post by Dan Erlanson discussing the Michael Shultz paper on compound metrics used in drug discovery. The article focuses on the challenges of applying various molecular metrics across different molecular weight and lipophilicity ranges. 

The key issue discussed is that metrics based on Heavy Atom Count (HAC) become unstable in the low-molecular-weight range during fragment-based drug discovery. The Lipophilic Ligand Efficiency (LLE), also called LipE, is highlighted as Shultz's preferred metric because it's size-independent and avoids problems that plague the LELP measure at very low LogP values. However, the author argues that size-independent metrics like LLE are not ideal for early fragment optimization stages, where the goal is to identify starting points with maximum binding for their size. The article concludes that for fragment work, the author will continue using both LLE alongside size-dependent metrics like LE (Ligand Efficiency) or BEI (Binding Efficiency Index), accepting that weighting these requires professional judgment.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2013 article, the field of compound metrics in drug discovery continued to evolve, though many of the fundamental challenges persist. Lipophilic Ligand Efficiency (LLE/LipE) gained wider adoption in the pharmaceutical industry as a key metric for optimizing drug candidates, particularly because it helps balance potency against lipophilicity, which correlates with many drug failure modes.

The tension between size-dependent and size-independent metrics that the article discusses has remained largely unresolved. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) continued to grow as a field, with multiple FDA-approved drugs emerging from fragment origins, such as vemurafenib and venetoclax. These successes validated the fragment approach but didn't fundamentally solve the metric selection problem—teams still use multiple complementary metrics rather than relying on a single "best" one.

The period after 2013 saw increased awareness that no single metric can capture all aspects of drug quality, leading to multiparameter optimization (MPO) approaches that consider multiple physicochemical properties simultaneously. The concepts discussed in this article—balancing binding efficiency, lipophilicity, and molecular size—remain central to modern drug discovery practice, though the specific implementation varies by organization and project needs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in the biotechnology industry, focusing instead on current methodological preferences and technical analysis of metrics. The author's stance was primarily about personal practice rather than forecasting industry trends.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important and enduring technical challenge in drug discovery, but the highly specialized nature of the topic and limited scope keep it in the mid-range of interest for a broader biotech audience.
