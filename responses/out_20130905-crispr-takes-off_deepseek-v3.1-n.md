# CRISPR Takes Off (Sep 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article describes the burgeoning CRISPR gene-editing technology, which emerged from the discovery that bacteria possess an adaptive immune system using CRISPR sequences to defend against bacteriophages. The piece highlights that in the 8 months preceding publication, multiple research teams had demonstrated CRISPR's ability to precisely delete, add, activate, or suppress targeted genes across diverse organisms including human cells, mice, rats, zebrafish, fruit flies, yeast, and crops. Key developments included the Church lab at Harvard and a multi-institutional team (Broad Institute, MIT, etc.) showing successful applications in mammalian cells in early 2013. The article emphasizes CRISPR's superior efficiency and ease of use compared to existing gene manipulation techniques, with applications spanning genetic model organism creation, potential gene therapy in humans, and agricultural biotechnology.

## 2. HISTORY

CRISPR technology rapidly transformed from laboratory curiosity to clinical and commercial reality in the decade following this article. The most significant development was the Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded in 2020 to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier for developing CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing tool, validating the article's prediction about Nobel recognition. 

Several biotech companies successfully commercialized CRISPR applications, notably Editas Medicine, CRISPR Therapeutics, and Intellia Therapeutics, all of which went public and advanced therapies to clinical trials. Multiple CRISPR therapies are now FDA-approved or near approval, including treatments for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. In December 2023, the FDA approved Casgevy (developed by CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex) for both conditions. Clinical trials have shown remarkable efficacy—nearly all sickle cell disease patients treated remained free from pain crises, and most beta thalassemia patients remained transfusion-independent. However, these treatments carry significant costs and require intensive procedures. 

The technology's broader adoption surpassed expectations, becoming ubiquitous in biomedical research laboratories worldwide and fundamentally changing how genetic experiments are conducted. While the article mentioned agricultural applications, these progressed separately but significantly, with CRISPR-edited crops developed for improved nutritional content, disease resistance, and other traits, though regulatory frameworks varied by jurisdiction.

The predicted challenge of determining Nobel Prize recipients materialized, with Doudna and Charpentier ultimately recognized, though significant controversy existed regarding patent rights and credit involving other researchers, particularly Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "Modifying cell lines has just gotten easier"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. CRISPR revolutionized cell line modification, becoming standard in laboratories globally and enabling routine genetic manipulations previously requiring months to be completed in weeks or days.

**Prediction: "Genetically altered rodent models could be produced much more quickly"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. CRISPR dramatically accelerated transgenic model organism production, reducing timelines from over a year to several months while enabling more sophisticated genetic modifications.

**Prediction: "People are already forming companies aiming at just this sort of thing [gene therapy]"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. Multiple CRISPR-focused companies launched and achieved significant market capitalization, including Editas Medicine (founded 2013), CRISPR Therapeutics (2013), and Intellia Therapeutics (2014), with market caps reaching billions of dollars.

**Prediction: "Much faster and cleaner way to genetically modify crops"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Partially accurate**. While CRISPR advanced crop modification technology significantly, regulatory frameworks and consumer acceptance limited widespread adoption compared to laboratory settings. Regulatory status varied internationally, with some countries treating CRISPR-edited crops differently than traditional GMOs.

**Prediction: "The Nobel people will have the problem of figuring out how to award the eventual prize"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The Nobel Prize was indeed awarded (2020), though with some controversy regarding credit allocation, fulfilling the prediction that recognizing the work would be complex.

**Overall Prediction Quality**: Strong accuracy, with most predictions either fully realized or substantially confirmed, though agricultural applications progressed more slowly than research applications due to regulatory and social factors.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **10/10**
