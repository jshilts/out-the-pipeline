# 2012 In Startups (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary responds to Bruce Booth's optimistic assessment of the biotech startup funding landscape for 2012. The author notes a concerning "notch" or gap in the small pharma/biotech ecosystem representing companies that failed to form in recent years. The article implicitly supports the view that restoring this missing cohort of startups would benefit the industry, framing the formation of new companies as essential for sector health.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following 2012 proved to be transformative for biotech startups and funding:

**Funding Recovery and Boom (2012-2015):** Booth's optimism was largely validated. Between 2012-2015, biotech venture funding saw significant recovery, with venture capital investment in biotech exceeding $6 billion annually by 2014-2015, reaching levels not seen since the mid-2000s.

**IPO Renaissance:** 2013-2015 marked a remarkable biotech IPO window, with over 100 biotech companies going public during this period. This represented the strongest IPO market for biotech since the 2000 genomics bubble era.

**Ecosystem Gap Filled:** The "notch" identified in the article - representing missing company formations from 2008-2011 - was indeed addressed. Hundreds of new biotech startups formed between 2012-2016 across therapeutic areas including oncology, rare diseases, and immunology.

**Long-term Capital Flow:** The funding momentum continued beyond 2015, with 2020-2021 experiencing unprecedented biotech investment levels driven by COVID-19 vaccine/therapeutic development and broader market enthusiasm. However, the market cooled significantly in 2022-2023 amid rising interest rates and regulatory challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Bruce Booth's optimism about 2012 funding recovery:** This proved largely accurate. 2012 marked the beginning of a multi-year biotech funding and IPO boom that lasted through 2015.

• **Implicit prediction that filling the startup formation gap would be beneficial:** The subsequent boom in startup formation did correlate with increased innovation and drug development activity, though causation is complex. The wave of companies formed during this period contributed to a robust pipeline of new therapeutic candidates.

• **Concern about ecosystem gap:** The concern was valid, and the gap's subsequent filling appears to have been consequential for sector health in the 2012-2020 timeframe.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This brief commentary captured a meaningful inflection point in biotech funding cycles, but its brevity and lack of explicit predictions limit its long-term analytical value. It reflected the cautious optimism at the start of what became a significant biotech boom period.
