# How You Doin'? How's Everybody Doin'? (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses the inherent difficulties of conducting performance reviews in pharmaceutical research organizations. The author argues that evaluating scientific research productivity is fundamentally problematic because the nature of discovery doesn't align with calendar-based review cycles or standardized metrics.

The key challenge highlighted is the conflict between the uncertain, long-term nature of meaningful scientific breakthroughs and the corporate demand for measurable annual output. The author uses the analogy of evaluating poets to illustrate how quantity-focused metrics fail to capture true impact or quality. The piece criticizes several aspects of typical performance review systems: the yearly evaluation frequency (which ignores that scientific progress is rarely calendar-aligned), the pressure to produce "tangible results" annually (which can drive researchers toward safer, less ambitious projects), and forced ranking systems that assume normal performance distributions in carefully selected workforces.

The article references historical perspective from physicist J.J. Thomson, who warned that paying scientists for annual results naturally drives them away from high-risk, potentially transformative work toward more guaranteed incremental output. The underlying argument is that most evaluation systems in industry research settings are poorly designed for the realities of scientific discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

The issues raised in this 2007 article remain persistent and largely unresolved challenges in the biopharmaceutical industry nearly two decades later. This represents a structural problem in how commercial research organizations balance accountability with fostering innovation.

Large pharmaceutical companies have continued to struggle with research productivity metrics, evidenced by ongoing debate about R&D efficiency and the persistently high failure rates in drug development. Industry productivity studies in the 2010s continued showing that despite increased spending, the number of new drug approvals per R&D dollar invested remained problematic.

Several trends emerged in response to these challenges: increased reliance on external innovation through partnerships and acquisitions, restructuring of internal R&D organizations (such as GSK's reorganization in the early 2010s), and some companies experimenting with different evaluation approaches. However, the fundamental tension between long-term scientific discovery and short-term business metrics has not been resolved systematically.

The forced ranking systems criticized in the article saw some decline in popularity, partly due to broader business literature questioning such approaches and legal challenges. However, annual performance cycles and pressure for measurable output remain standard practice across the industry.

Notable is that the most significant breakthroughs often still come from environments that allow for more flexible timelines and risk tolerance, whether academic institutions, small biotechnology companies with less bureaucratic overhead, or the occasional pharmaceutical company willing to protect long-term projects from annual review pressures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain specific forward-looking predictions about particular drugs, methods, or business outcomes. Rather, it presented a structural critique of research evaluation systems. The implicit prediction was that these evaluation challenges would continue to negatively impact genuine scientific innovation unless fundamentally rethought.

In this broader sense, the article's concerns have proven prescient: the biopharmaceutical industry has continued struggling with R&D productivity throughout the subsequent years, suggesting that the evaluation issues raised remain relevant.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses enduring structural issues in research management that remain relevant, but focuses on organizational process rather than scientific innovation or therapeutic breakthroughs.
