# Great Moments in Journal Editing (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief, tongue‑in‑cheek commentary that points out a quirky copy‑editing note attached to a paper “Utility of protein structures in overcoming ADMET‑related issues of drug‑like compounds” that was then in the *Articles in Press* queue of *Drug Discovery Today*. The author highlights the editorial back‑and‑forth over the phrasing “ADMET‑relevant” and uses the exchange to illustrate the sometimes absurd minutiae of journal production. No scientific arguments are presented; the focus is purely on the editorial process.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Publication of the cited paper** – The article with the above title was indeed published later in 2011 (DOI 10.1016/j.drudis.2011.04.008). It reviewed how three‑dimensional protein structures can be leveraged to anticipate and mitigate ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) liabilities during lead optimisation.  
- **Citation record** – As of early 2026 the paper has been cited roughly 70–80 times, mainly by other reviews or methodological studies that discuss structure‑based ADMET prediction. It has not been a seminal citation driver for any specific drug programme.  
- **Impact on practice** – The ideas it summarised (e.g., using crystal structures to model metabolic soft spots, transporter binding, or off‑target toxicity) have become routine components of many in‑silico ADMET pipelines, but this evolution was already underway before 2011 and cannot be attributed to the paper alone. No drug that explicitly credits this article has reached market approval.  
- **Business and policy** – The commentary itself had no measurable effect on journal policies or on the biotech industry. The broader trend of tighter integration of structural biology into ADMET modelling continued, driven by advances in computational power, AI‑based protein modelling (e.g., AlphaFold), and larger public datasets rather than by the 2011 review.  
- **Editorial culture** – The anecdote has been occasionally quoted in discussions about the “human” side of scientific publishing, but it did not spark any lasting change in editorial guidelines at *Drug Discovery Today* or elsewhere.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not contain explicit forecasts, but the underlying paper implied that protein‑structure information would become a key tool for solving ADMET problems. Evaluating that implicit prediction:

- **Prediction:** Structure‑based methods will markedly reduce ADMET failures in drug discovery.  
  **Outcome:** While such methods are now standard, failure rates for ADMET issues have declined only modestly; many late‑stage failures still stem from metabolism or toxicity that are hard to predict purely from static structures. The prediction was partially correct in that the approach is widely used, but overstated in its impact on overall success rates.

- **Prediction:** The field would see rapid adoption of “structure‑guided ADMET optimisation” as a routine step.  
  **Outcome:** Adoption has been steady but not “rapid”; integration has been incremental, often combined with ligand‑based and physiologically‑based pharmacokinetic modelling. The timeline was slower than the implied optimism.

No other concrete forecasts were made in the commentary.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10** – The piece is a niche, humorous snapshot of editorial minutiae with limited relevance to scientific progress or industry outcomes. Its only lasting value is as a light‑hearted illustration of the publishing process.
