# How Long Is Roche Prepared to Wait?

## 1. SUMMARY

This February 2009 commentary analyzes Roche's unusual approach to its tender offer for Genentech. The article notes that Roche left their $86.50 per share offer open without a set deadline, which was atypical for such deals. The author questions this strategy, pointing out that tender offers normally have deadlines to pressure shareholders into decisions and create urgency. The piece raises concerns about the financial implications of an extended timeline, including the moving-target problem of fluctuating stock prices and the potential cost of issuing bonds to fund a deal that hasn't closed yet. The article expresses surprise at what it characterizes as uncharacteristically non-cautious behavior from the typically conservative Swiss pharmaceutical company.

## 2. HISTORY

Roche's acquisition of Genentech did eventually close, but through a protracted and complex process. In March 2009, just over a month after this article, Roche lowered its offer to $86.50 (down from the previous $89) after initially offering $89 in July 2008. The deal finally closed in March 2009 for approximately $46.8 billion. However, the post-acquisition period proved challenging. The biotech industry landscape shifted dramatically, with concerns emerging about Roche's ability to maintain Genentech's innovative culture. Integration faced significant hurdles, and there were widespread fears that the acquisition would destroy the entrepreneurial environment that had made Genentech so successful in drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction: The extended timeline would create financial complications and prove costly for Roche.**  
  **Outcome:** The prediction was accurate. The prolonged six-month negotiation period created substantial uncertainty, and Roche did face increased complexity in financing. The deal's eventual closing at a lower price than initially offered suggested the extended process worked against optimal deal terms.

- **Prediction: The lack of deadline would be problematic and uncharacteristic for Roche's careful approach.**  
  **Outcome:** This reflected the market's surprise at the time. However, it may have been a strategic miscalculation to think this was atypical behavior. Large pharmaceutical acquisitions often involve complex negotiations and extended timelines, and the final outcome suggested the approach was ultimately successful from Roche's perspective, even if the process appeared unusual.

- **Prediction: The acquisition would face industry skepticism and integration challenges.**  
  **Outcome:** This was strongly validated. Major anxieties emerged in the biotech community about whether Roche could preserve Genentech's distinctive research culture and innovative capacity, which had been central to its success. Integration challenges persisted extensively.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical industry consolidation history, providing insight into the strategic thinking and market dynamics surrounding one of biotech's most significant acquisitions. The deal's outcome fundamentally influenced how large pharmaceutical companies approach biotech acquisitions and integration strategies.
