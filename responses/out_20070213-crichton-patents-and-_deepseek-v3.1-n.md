# Crichton, Patents, and Genes (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques a New York Times op-ed by Michael Crichton on gene patenting. The author argues that Crichton oversimplifies a complex issue, creating confusion rather than clarity. The piece explains that U.S. Patent Office policy allows patents on isolated or purified genes (as "new chemical substances" not found in nature), distinguishes between patenting genes versus patenting uses for genes, and highlights the importance of the "utility" requirement that the Patent Office tightened around 2000. The author notes that significant legal challenges were ongoing, referencing the Metabolite case that the Supreme Court had recently declined to hear, and points readers toward more balanced analyses like a Congressional Research Service report.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2007 commentary, gene patenting faced major legal and policy challenges that ultimately reshaped the landscape:
- **Myriad Genetics case progression**: The legal battle over BRCA1/BRCA2 gene patents intensified, culminating in the landmark 2013 Supreme Court decision *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics*. The Court ruled unanimously that isolated human genes are not patentable because they are products of nature.
- **Post-Myriad impact**: After the 2013 decision, thousands of gene patents became invalid, though cDNA and methods of using genes remained patentable. This reduced barriers to genetic testing and research.
- **Ongoing litigation**: Despite the Supreme Court's definitive ruling, boundary cases continued in lower courts regarding what constitutes "natural" versus "man-made" in biotechnology.
- **Industry adaptation**: Companies shifted toward patenting diagnostic methods, gene-based therapies, and synthetic biology applications rather than raw gene sequences.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article hinted at several developments:
- **Continued legal challenges**: The author noted that "there will be more" court cases beyond the Metabolite case. **Accurate** - The Myriad case and subsequent lawsuits validated this prediction.
- **Complexity ignored at peril**: Crichton's oversimplification was criticized as counterproductive. **Prescient** - Later legal scholarship and court decisions indeed grappled with the nuanced distinctions the author highlighted.
- **Utility requirements mattering**: The emphasis on utility standards proved **correct** - courts increasingly scrutinized whether gene patents demonstrated specific, substantial, and credible utility.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a pivotal moment in biotechnology law before the landmark Myriad decision, offering needed nuance on gene patent complexity during a period of significant policy evolution.
