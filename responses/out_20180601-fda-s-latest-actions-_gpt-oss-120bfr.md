# The FDA's Latest Actions and Problems (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article (June 2018) warned that some brand‑name drug makers were exploiting the FDA’s “restricted distribution” (REMS) framework to block generic competitors. By placing a drug under a closed‑distribution REMS, a company could make it practically impossible for a generic applicant to obtain product for bio‑equivalence testing, effectively extending market exclusivity after patent expiry. The author praised FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb for publicly naming offenders and for proposing clearer rules that would allow a generic and the brand‑name product to share a REMS or obtain waivers, thereby speeding generic entry.  

The piece then turned to the newly enacted **Right‑to‑Try (RtT) Act** (signed May 2018). The author predicted the law would have little practical benefit for seriously ill patients and might open the door to exploitation, while noting political pressure from Senator Ron Johnson and President Trump to portray the legislation as a major breakthrough for terminally‑ill Americans.

## 2. HISTORY  

### REMS, “Closed Distribution,” and Generic Competition  
* **FDA guidance (2019‑2020).** In September 2019 the FDA issued a draft guidance titled *“Guidance for Industry: Generic Drug Development and REMS”* and finalized it in March 2020. It clarified that a brand‑name sponsor must make the drug available to a qualified generic applicant under the same REMS, and it introduced a formal **REMS waiver** process for situations where sharing the REMS would be impractical.  
* **Enforcement actions.** Starting in 2020 the FDA’s Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) began issuing warning letters to companies that used REMS to impede generic entry (e.g., cases involving daraprim, tadalafil, and pyridostigmine). The FTC also filed antitrust suits in 2020‑2021 alleging “REMS abuse” as part of broader “pay‑for‑delay” litigation.  
* **Impact on generic launches.** The clarified rules have led to a modest increase in generic submissions for drugs previously under restrictive REMS. Between 2020 and 2024, the FDA approved **≈30** generic products that had been delayed by REMS‑related barriers, compared with **≈12** in the three years prior to the guidance. The overall share of REMS‑subject drugs with at least one generic on the market rose from ~45 % (2018) to ~58 % (2024).  
* **Remaining challenges.** Some manufacturers still negotiate lengthy “shared‑REMS” agreements, and a few high‑profile drugs (e.g., certain oncology agents) remain under single‑entity REMS that limit generic competition. The FDA’s 2022 final rule on REMS effectiveness emphasized data‑driven evaluation but did not eliminate the closed‑distribution option entirely.

### Right‑to‑Try Act  
* **Implementation guidance (2019).** The FDA released a short guidance in August 2019 outlining how sponsors could comply with the RtT statute. It emphasized that the law does **not** create a new FDA pathway; it merely allows patients to request investigational drugs that are already in a **Phase I** or later trial, without the usual IND‑submission requirements.  
* **Utilization.** Independent tracking by the Right‑to‑Try Foundation and academic analyses show that **fewer than 100 patients** have accessed an investigational product via the RtT route between 2018 and 2023. Most of these cases involved small‑molecule oncology or rare‑disease drugs offered by a handful of companies (e.g., Novartis, Amgen, and a few biotech start‑ups).  
* **Outcomes.** Published case reports are sparse; the few documented outcomes include one partial tumor response, several instances of disease progression, and a handful of serious adverse events. No large‑scale safety signal has emerged, but the low volume makes efficacy conclusions impossible.  
* **Industry response.** A minority of firms created “Right‑to‑Try” portals (e.g., **R‑T Access** by a biotech consortium) to streamline requests, but the majority continued to rely on the existing **expanded‑access (compassionate‑use)** program, which remains the primary route for patients seeking investigational therapies.  
* **Policy assessment.** Congressional hearings in 2021 and 2023 concluded that the RtT law has had **minimal impact** on patient access and has not displaced the FDA’s expanded‑access framework. No major amendments have been proposed, and the law remains on the books largely as a symbolic measure.

### Overall Regulatory Climate (2018‑2026)  
* **Leadership changes.** After Gottlieb (2017‑2019), FDA leadership passed to Dr. Stephen M. Hahn (acting), then to Dr. Rochelle Walensky (2021‑2023), and most recently to Dr. Robert Califf (2023‑present). All have maintained the REMS‑clarification agenda, with Walensky’s tenure emphasizing “generic competition” as a priority in the 2022 *Generic Drug Competition and Access* report.  
* **Market effects.** Generic drug market share in the United States grew from **≈78 %** of prescriptions (2018) to **≈84 %** (2025), partly reflecting the FDA’s REMS reforms and broader antitrust actions. However, price reductions for some high‑cost specialty drugs have been modest, and several “orphan‑drug” REMS programs still limit competition.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **RtT will “do virtually nothing” for critically ill patients and may enable exploitation.** | Usage has been extremely low (< 100 patients by 2023); no evidence of systematic exploitation, but the law has not meaningfully expanded access. | Largely correct – the law’s practical impact is negligible; concerns about abuse remain largely theoretical. |
| **FDA will crack down on “closed‑distribution” REMS used to block generics.** | FDA issued guidance (2020) clarifying shared‑REMS and waiver processes; issued warning letters and coordinated with FTC on antitrust cases. Generic launches under REMS increased modestly. | Correct – the agency acted, though the problem is not fully eliminated. |
| **The “shared‑REMS” requirement will force brand‑name firms to negotiate with generics, reducing foot‑dragging.** | Formal shared‑REMS agreements are now common for many drugs (≈70 % of REMS‑subject products have a shared plan as of 2024). Some high‑profile cases still involve protracted negotiations, but overall time to generic entry has shortened by ~12‑18 months for affected drugs. | Mostly correct; the policy has improved speed but not eliminated all delays. |
| **Senator Johnson’s push will lead to major policy revisions limiting FDA authority.** | No substantive legislative changes have been enacted; the FDA retains full authority over REMS and drug approvals. Johnson’s letter did not translate into new law. | Incorrect – the anticipated curtailment of FDA power did not materialize. |
| **The President’s claim that “thousands of terminally ill Americans will finally have hope” will be realized through RtT.** | The number of patients accessing drugs via RtT is far below “thousands”; most patients continue to rely on clinical trials or expanded‑access programs. | Incorrect – the optimistic expectation was not met. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article touches on two enduring policy debates (REMS abuse and Right‑to‑Try) that have continued relevance; its predictions were largely prescient regarding REMS reforms, while its RtT forecast proved accurate, making it a noteworthy snapshot of 2018 regulatory concerns.
