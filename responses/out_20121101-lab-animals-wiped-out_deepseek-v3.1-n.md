# Lab Animals Wiped Out in Hurricane Sandy (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on the devastating loss of thousands of genetically engineered and specially bred research rodents at an NYU animal facility due to flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The most significant loss mentioned was the Fishell lab's entire stock of 2,500 mice, representing a decade of research work. The piece conveys the severe impact on researchers whose careers depended on these specialized animal models, highlighting how a single natural disaster could wipe out years of scientific investment and preparation.

## 2. HISTORY
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, research institutions significantly enhanced their disaster preparedness protocols for animal facilities. NYU and other affected institutions invested heavily in flood barriers, backup power systems, and emergency relocation procedures for research animals. 

The scientific community responded by improving data sharing and backup storage of genetic materials. Notably, many institutions began implementing cryopreservation programs for genetically modified mouse lines, where sperm or embryos are frozen and stored at multiple locations. This practice has since become standard at major research institutions, ensuring that valuable genetic lines can be recovered even if live colonies are lost.

The immediate impact on research varied by lab. Some researchers were able to rebuild their colonies by obtaining mice from collaborators or commercial suppliers, though this set back their work by months to years. Funding agencies like the NIH developed emergency supplemental funding mechanisms to help researchers recover from such disasters. The incident also accelerated adoption of the NIH's policy on sharing biomedical research resources, encouraging broader distribution of genetically modified animal models.

However, the fundamental challenge that certain research lines were unique and irreplaceable remained true - when specialized strains were lost without backup, that specific research trajectory essentially ended.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this brief article - it was primarily a report of immediate events and their impact rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

This article represents a significant but contained event - while devastating for the affected researchers, it documented a specific institutional loss rather than broader industry trends, and its long-term importance is moderate as a cautionary case study in research infrastructure resilience.
