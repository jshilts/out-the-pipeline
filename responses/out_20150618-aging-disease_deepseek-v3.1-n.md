# Aging As a Disease (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the regulatory challenges facing anti-aging therapies, noting that the FDA has historically not considered aging itself as a disease, but rather as "the baseline against which disease appears." This regulatory stance has forced companies developing anti-aging interventions to frame their clinical trials around specific age-related conditions like diabetes or osteoporosis rather than aging per se.

The piece highlights the upcoming TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial as a potential breakthrough approach. Researchers planned to test metformin in thousands of elderly patients with or at risk for cancer, heart disease, or cognitive impairment, monitoring whether the drug could prevent the onset of additional age-related conditions. A key FDA meeting was scheduled for June 24, 2015, where researchers would argue that if TAME succeeded, it would establish aging as a treatable disorder and set a precedent for future anti-aging drug development. The article notes that FDA officials appeared open to this possibility based on earlier discussions.

## 2. HISTORY

The TAME trial faced significant delays and funding challenges after the article's publication in 2015. While the concept gained scientific traction, practical implementation proved difficult due to the large scale required (initially proposed as 3,000-4,000 participants) and the substantial funding needed for a preventive trial of this magnitude.

Research on metformin's potential anti-aging effects continued through smaller observational studies and existing epidemiological data. Several large retrospective studies of diabetic patients taking metformin showed promising associations with reduced cancer incidence, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality compared to other diabetes treatments. However, these observational findings have limitations due to potential confounding factors.

In terms of regulatory progress, the FDA has maintained its cautious approach. No anti-aging drug has been approved specifically for "aging" as an indication. The agency continues to require traditional disease endpoints rather than accepting aging biomarkers or composite outcomes related to aging.

Metformin remains widely used for type 2 diabetes treatment and has maintained a good safety profile over decades. Some research has explored its potential repurposing for specific conditions like cancer prevention and cognitive decline, but large randomized controlled trials specifically testing anti-aging outcomes have not materialized as originally envisioned.

The TAME trial concept evolved but faced ongoing challenges with study design and funding. Interest in aging research has grown significantly, with major academic centers and pharmaceutical companies increasingly focusing on aging biology, though most development continues to target specific age-related diseases rather than "aging" as an indication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The June 24, 2015 FDA meeting would potentially convince officials that "if the trial succeeds, they will have proved that a drug can delay ageing" and "set a precedent that ageing is a disorder that can be treated with medicines."

**Reality**: The FDA maintained its regulatory framework requiring disease-specific endpoints. No precedent was established for approving drugs specifically for "aging" as an indication. The agency continued to require traditional disease outcomes rather than accepting aging biomarkers or composite aging measures.

• **Prediction**: The TAME trial would proceed as designed, testing metformin in thousands of elderly patients to see whether it "forestalls the illnesses they do not already have, as well as diabetes and death."

**Reality**: The TAME trial faced substantial delays and has not been completed as originally envisioned. The large scale and long duration required made funding and execution challenging. While the concept influenced aging research directions, a definitive large-scale randomized controlled trial testing metformin specifically for aging outcomes has not been successfully conducted.

• **Prediction**: Establishing aging as a treatable disorder would "spur progress and funding for ageing research."

**Reality**: Research funding for aging biology has grown substantially since 2015, with major academic institutions, private companies, and government agencies (including the National Institute on Aging) significantly expanding aging research programs. However, this growth occurred without FDA recognition of aging as a disease indication, driven instead by scientific advances in understanding aging mechanisms and the recognition of aging as the primary risk factor for chronic diseases.

• **Prediction**: Metformin and rapamycin would be among compounds fitting this new regulatory framework.

**Reality**: Both compounds continue to be studied for their potential effects on aging and age-related conditions. Rapamycin (and rapalogs) has shown promising anti-aging effects in animal models and is being investigated for various applications, but neither drug has been approved for anti-aging indications. Research focus has expanded to include senolytics and other emerging anti-aging interventions.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article identified a critical regulatory challenge that remains highly relevant and captures a significant shift in how aging is viewed scientifically and medically, even though the specific regulatory breakthrough hasn't materialized as predicted.
