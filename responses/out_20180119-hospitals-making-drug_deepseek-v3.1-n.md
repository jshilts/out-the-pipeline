# Hospitals Making Drugs? (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a New York Times story about major hospital systems (led by Intermountain Healthcare) planning to enter the generic drug manufacturing business to combat drug shortages and price gouging. The piece acknowledges the real problem of drug shortages and price spikes but expresses skepticism about the proposed solution. It distinguishes between two different problems: genuine manufacturing shortages versus cases where a single manufacturer has been granted market exclusivity (often through FDA incentives for bringing old drugs into modern regulatory compliance) and can therefore charge monopoly prices. The author notes that hospital-led manufacturing faces significant regulatory hurdles, particularly FDA approval backlogs, and questions whether using third-party manufacturers actually increases supply versus just creating another customer for existing suppliers. The article suggests that regulatory and legal framework issues are the root causes that won't be solved simply by hospitals deciding to "make their own drugs."

## 2. HISTORY

The hospital-led generic drug manufacturing initiative launched with significant fanfare in 2018, but its real-world impact has been modest and slower than anticipated:

**Intermountain's Initiative**: The hospital consortium (Intermountain, Trinity Health, Ascension, SSM Health, and others) formed Civica Rx in September 2018 as a nonprofit generic drug company. Civica initially focused on 14 hospital-system-defined essential drugs facing shortages or price spikes.

**Manufacturing Approach**: Rather than building their own manufacturing facilities, Civica pursued partnerships with established contract manufacturers, including Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Xellia Pharmaceuticals, which aligns with the article's prediction that "making the drugs themselves" would be challenging.

**FDA Regulatory Progress**: Scott Gottlieb's FDA did accelerate generic drug approvals, with generic approvals reaching record numbers in 2018-2019. The FDA's priority review for shortage mitigation drugs helped, but the approval process remained a significant timeline factor.

**Market Impact**: Civica has brought some drugs to market, including essential sterile injectables like antibiotics and cardiovascular medications, and claims to have helped stabilize prices for certain products. However, it has not fundamentally solved the generic drug shortage problem, which continued through 2019-2021, particularly exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic when supply chain disruptions worsened existing shortages.

**Scalability Limitations**: The initiative has remained relatively small-scale compared to major generic manufacturers like Teva, Mylan (now Viatris), or Sandoz. While providing some buffer for member hospitals, it has not dramatically altered market dynamics for most generic drugs.

**Continued Problems**: Drug shortages actually worsened in subsequent years, with the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists reporting over 200 active shortages by 2023-2024, particularly affecting cancer drugs, antibiotics, and injectable medications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "Making even a relatively simple old generic drug is a much different thing than a hospital does, and getting that going will not be simple." 
  **Reality**: **Accurate**. Civica Rx chose to partner with existing manufacturers rather than build hospital-based manufacturing, confirming that direct hospital manufacturing was impractical.

• **Prediction**: Regulatory approval would remain a significant bottleneck: "you have to get in line for the FDA to review your application to sell the compound(s). And that's one of the logjams"
  **Reality**: **Partially accurate**. While FDA prioritized shortage drugs, approval timelines remained substantial, and Civica's rollout was much slower than initial announcements suggested. However, the FDA did streamline some processes under Gottlieb.

• **Prediction**: Hospitals would struggle with whether they were actually "increasing the number of suppliers" or "just asking an existing one to supply you as well"
  **Reality**: **Accurate**. Civica's model largely relies on contracting with existing manufacturers rather than creating truly new manufacturing capacity, though it does provide more predictable demand signals.

• **Implicit Prediction**: The initiative would face friction with existing FDA regulatory frameworks that grant exclusivity to certain manufacturers
  **Reality**: **Accurate**. Civica focused primarily on true shortage drugs rather than challenging the exclusivity arrangements for drugs like Daraprim or colchicine, where regulatory exclusivity remained a barrier.

• **Broader Prediction**: The "shot across the bow" would not quickly solve the underlying problems
  **Reality**: **Accurate**. While Civica provided some benefit to member hospitals, generic drug shortages and pricing issues persisted and even worsened in subsequent years, showing the initiative did not fundamentally restructure the market.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article proved prescient in identifying the regulatory and practical hurdles that would limit the hospital manufacturing initiative's impact, correctly distinguishing between different types of drug access problems and predicting which would be most amenable to this approach.
