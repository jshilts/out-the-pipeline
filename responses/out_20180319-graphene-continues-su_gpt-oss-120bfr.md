# Graphene Continues to Surprise (Mar 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article highlighted the 2010 Nobel‑winning discovery of graphene by the “sticky‑tape” method and then focused on a fresh breakthrough from MIT: when two graphene sheets are stacked with a tiny twist of about 1.1°, the resulting “magic‑angle” bilayer becomes superconducting at cryogenic temperatures. The author suggested that the superconducting phase resembled that of copper‑oxide (cuprate) high‑temperature superconductors, implying that twisted graphene might help resolve the long‑standing debate over the pairing mechanism in cuprates. The piece also speculated that this new material could eventually enable stronger, more homogeneous superconducting magnets for compact fusion reactors, hinting at a possible future Nobel Prize for work that grounds the cuprate mystery.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) research (2018‑2025)**  
- The 2018 Nature paper by Pablo Jarillo‑Herrero’s group confirmed superconductivity with a critical temperature (Tc) of ~1 K at the magic angle.  
- Within a few years, dozens of “moire‑engineered” systems (twisted trilayer graphene, twisted transition‑metal dichalcogenides, etc.) were discovered, showing correlated insulating states, ferromagnetism, and superconductivity.  
- Despite intense effort, the highest Tc achieved in graphene‑based moiré systems remains below 5 K (reported in 2022 for certain trilayer configurations). No material in this family has approached the liquid‑nitrogen regime.  
- The field has become a major sub‑discipline of condensed‑matter physics, spawning dedicated conferences (e.g., “Moiré 2023”) and large‑scale collaborations (e.g., the “Twistronics” consortium).  
- The original hope that tBLG would directly solve the cuprate mechanism has not materialised; while the systems provide a clean platform to test theoretical ideas, consensus on the pairing glue is still lacking.  

**Nobel and awards**  
- As of early 2026, no Nobel Prize has been awarded for twisted‑graphene superconductivity. The 2022 Physics Nobel went to work on topological phases, not on moiré materials.  

**Commercial and technological impact**  
- No commercial superconducting devices (e.g., magnets, qubits) based on tBLG have entered the market. The low Tc and the need for precise twist control make large‑scale engineering impractical at present.  
- Research on tBLG has, however, influenced the broader “twistronics” approach, which is being explored for novel electronic devices (e.g., tunable transistors) but these remain at the prototype stage.  

**Fusion magnet development**  
- The article’s link to an MIT spin‑out referred to Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS). CFS has successfully built a 20‑tesla REBCO (rare‑earth‑barium‑copper‑oxide) magnet prototype (2023) and is targeting a compact tokamak (SPARC) with net‑gain fusion by the late 2020s.  
- No graphene‑based superconductors have been used in any fusion magnet concept; the industry has continued to rely on high‑temperature superconductors (HTS) such as REBCO, which operate at 20‑30 K and can carry the required currents.  

**Overall impact**  
- The discovery sparked a vibrant research area that deepened our understanding of strongly correlated electrons, but it has not yet translated into high‑temperature superconductors, commercial technologies, or fusion‑magnet breakthroughs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the article | What actually happened (up to Jan 2026) |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **tBLG will shed light on cuprate superconductivity and possibly lead to a Nobel Prize** | tBLG has provided a clean testbed for correlated‑electron theories, but a definitive resolution of the cuprate pairing mechanism remains absent. No Nobel Prize has been awarded for this work. |
| **Superconductivity in twisted graphene could be used to build stronger, more homogeneous magnets for compact fusion reactors** | Fusion magnet development has proceeded with REBCO HTS, not graphene‑based materials. tBLG’s low Tc and fabrication challenges preclude its use in large‑scale magnets. |
| **The field will become “hotter” and drive major practical applications** | The field indeed became “hot” academically, spawning many papers and conferences. Practical applications (e.g., commercial superconducting wires, fusion magnets, large‑scale electronics) have not yet materialised. |
| **A near‑certain second Nobel in physics will follow** | As of 2026, only one Nobel (2010) related to graphene has been awarded; no second Nobel tied to twisted‑graphene physics has been announced. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment that launched a highly active research frontier (twistronics). Its scientific relevance is high, though the speculative technological promises have not yet been realised.
