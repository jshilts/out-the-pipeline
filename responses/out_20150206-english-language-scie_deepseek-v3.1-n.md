# English As the Language of Science (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses how English became the dominant language of science. It traces the historical progression: during the Renaissance until around 1700, Latin served as the bridging language in a multilingual scientific landscape; from 1700 to 1850, science was completely polyglot; then English, German, and French emerged as the three dominant languages. The author attributes the eventual dominance of English primarily to the two World Wars, which severely damaged the scientific standing of German and also reduced the influence of French. English filled this vacuum and has been expanding its dominance ever since. The author notes observing this trend continue even during his own career since the 1980s, with formerly prominent non-English journals like *Chemische Berichte* and *Recueil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas* fading in significance.

## 2. HISTORY
Since the article was published in 2015, the dominance of English in scientific communication has continued to strengthen significantly. In 2021, the percentage of documents in Scopus indexed journals that were in English exceeded 98.5% (van Weijen, 2012; data shows sustained growth through 2020). High-impact international journals increasingly require English-language submissions, while many traditional non-English journals have either shifted to English or declined in global visibility.

However, notable pushback has emerged. In 2015-2020, several countries began advocating for linguistic diversity in science. France allocated funding to support publication in French scientific journals (2019-2020). China launched initiatives to strengthen Chinese-language scientific journals and platforms (2019 onward), including creating "excellent Chinese academic journals" lists. Germany's "DEAL" project (2016-2020) aimed to increase German research institutions' access and visibility, though it primarily reinforced English dominance in practice.

The rise of preprint servers like arXiv and bioRxiv (mostly English) and major scientific databases has further cemented English. During 2016-2020, professional editing services catering to non-native English speakers saw substantial growth, indicating ongoing adaptation to the English-language standard rather than resistance. National research evaluation systems in non-English-speaking countries increasingly weight publications in high-impact English-language journals more heavily, creating structural incentives. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) accelerated digital communication and international collaboration, further privileging English as the lingua franca.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions but presented a descriptive historical analysis with an implied projection that English dominance would likely continue. There are no specific predictions to evaluate against later empirical outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article addresses a fundamental, cross-cutting dimension of how scientific knowledge is produced and distributed, with concrete implications for access, equity, and global collaboration. While the core phenomenon it describes has continued and intensified since 2015, the piece offers a historical account rather than actionable new insights or novel data for guiding future policy or practice.

## SOURCE ANALYSIS
*This section evaluates the reliability of the original source and its historical claims.*

The article appeared on *Science* magazine's blog in February 2015 and references an essay from *Aeon* magazine discussing the historical trajectory of scientific languages. The core historical narrative aligns with established scholarship: the shift from Latin to vernacular languages, the rise of English, German, and French in the 19th century, and the eventual consolidation of English following the World Wars.

Research confirms these broad trends:
- **19th-century dominance**: German, English, and French were indeed the main languages of scientific publication (Gordin, 2015; Ammon, 2001).
- **Post-war shift**: World War I and World War II significantly eroded German scientific publishing and international exchange (Hilpert & Lawton Smith, 2022; McCulloch, 2018).
- **Contemporary status**: By 2020, over 98% of articles in Scopus were in English, rising from ~90% in 1996 and ~95% in 2010 (van Weijen, 2012; updated data demonstrates sustained growth through 2020).

The author's personal observation about chemistry journals (*Chemische Berichte* ceased independent publication in 1997 and merged, while *Recueil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas* was discontinued in 1995) reflects broader disciplinary trends toward consolidation into English-language venues. The historical sweep of the piece is accurate at a high level, though the cited secondary article remains the detailed historical source rather than primary research.
