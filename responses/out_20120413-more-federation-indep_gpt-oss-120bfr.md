# More on the Federation of Independent Scientists: Journal Access (Apr 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a follow‑up to an earlier commentary about creating a “Federation of Independent Scientists” (FIS).  Its narrow focus is how unaffiliated entrepreneurs, recently unemployed researchers, and very small biotech companies could obtain affordable access to the scientific literature that they need for product development.  The author (Derek Lowe) collects community suggestions that were raised in the comments of the earlier post, including:

* **Rent‑instead‑buy models** such as DeepDyve, which lets a user view an article for a day‑plus for about $1, but does not allow printing or permanent download.  
* **Group licences** for a modest number of users (e.g., 10–100) that would be cheaper than a full institutional subscription.  
* **Pressure on societies (e.g., the American Chemical Society) to negotiate lower‑cost or subsidised access for independent researchers.**  
* **Revenue‑generating side‑projects** (advert‑supported portal, paid directory of consultants/CROs, small fees for posting RFPs) that could fund a shared “library” for the federation.

The post ends by asking for additional ideas and promising to turn the brainstorm into concrete action points.

## 2. HISTORY  

### DeepDyve and rental‑type services  
* DeepDyve continued operating after 2012 and remains a commercial “article‑rental” platform.  Its pricing stayed roughly in the $0.99–$2.99 range per article, with a subscription‑style “Unlimited” plan for heavy users.  Adoption among small biotech firms has been limited; most companies still rely on institutional subscriptions or inter‑library loans.  

### Society‑driven discounts & ACS policy  
* The American Chemical Society (ACS) introduced **ACS AuthorChoice** (open‑access publishing) and **member‑only discounts** for article purchases, but it never created a dedicated low‑cost access tier for independent researchers.  In 2015 the ACS launched **ACS Publications Free Access** for a limited set of articles (e.g., COVID‑19‑related content) but this was situational, not a permanent programme.  

### Group licences & consortia  
* No widely‑publicised “FIS‑style” consortium emerged.  However, **smaller societies** (e.g., the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening) and **regional biotech clusters** have negotiated **group licences** for a handful of journals, typically covering 5–20 users.  These arrangements are ad‑hoc and not coordinated through a single federation.  

### Open‑access growth & alternative access routes  
* The most consequential development has been the **expansion of open‑access (OA) publishing**.  By 2026, roughly **30 % of the biomedical literature** is OA, driven by funder mandates (NIH, EU Horizon 2020, etc.) and the **Plan S** initiative (2021).  
* **Preprint servers** (bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, medRxiv) have become mainstream, providing free early access to many papers that would otherwise sit behind paywalls.  
* **Unpaywall** (browser extension launched 2015) and **OpenAlex** have made it easy for anyone to locate legally‑available OA versions of pay‑walled articles.  
* **Sci‑Hub**, despite legal challenges, has dramatically increased de‑facto access to the literature for unaffiliated researchers worldwide, though it operates outside the law.  

### Business models for subsidised access  
* No large‑scale, ad‑supported “journal‑access portal” has taken off.  The closest analogue is **ResearchGate**, which offers a mix of author‑uploaded PDFs and a modest “Premium” subscription, but it does not provide systematic publisher licences.  
* Paid directories of CROs/consultants exist (e.g., **CROsearch**, **Biotechgate**), but they are commercial marketplaces rather than community‑funded libraries.  

### Overall impact on the independent scientist community  
* Independent researchers now have **more legal free content** (OA, preprints) than in 2012, but **pay‑walled articles remain a barrier** for many niche topics.  The specific “Federation of Independent Scientists” model never materialised as an organisation with a shared subscription fund.  Instead, the community has largely relied on **individual article rentals (DeepDyve), inter‑library loan requests, and the growing OA ecosystem**.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied in the post) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **DeepDyve will become a primary source of cheap access for small biotech and unemployed scientists.** | DeepDyve stayed operational but never became the dominant route; most users still prefer institutional access or OA sources. | Partially true – service exists but limited uptake. |
| **A group‑licence model (10–100 users) will be negotiated with publishers, lowering costs for small companies.** | Small consortia have negotiated limited licences, but no universal “FIS” programme was created. | Mostly false; only sporadic, ad‑hoc deals. |
| **The ACS (or similar societies) will introduce subsidised or discounted access for independent researchers.** | ACS introduced modest member discounts and occasional free‑access campaigns, but no dedicated independent‑researcher tier. | Mostly false. |
| **Revenue from ads, CRO directories, or RFP posting will fund a shared library.** | No such ad‑supported library has launched; CRO directories exist as separate commercial services. | False. |
| **Independent scientists will gain substantially better access to the literature through community‑driven initiatives.** | Access improved mainly because of the broader OA movement, not because of the specific FIS ideas. | True in outcome, but the mechanism was different. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a snapshot of early‑2010s frustration with pay‑walls and proposes concrete, community‑focused solutions.  While the specific proposals largely did not materialise, the piece foreshadowed the later shift toward open‑access and preprint culture, making it moderately interesting for historians of science policy.
