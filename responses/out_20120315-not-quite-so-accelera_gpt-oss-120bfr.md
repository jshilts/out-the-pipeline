# Not Quite So Accelerated, Says PhRMA  
**15 Mar 2012**

## 1. SUMMARY  
The column argues that the “TREAT Act” (S. 2113) would broaden the FDA’s provisional‑approval toolbox beyond the existing accelerated‑approval scheme.  Under the proposal, a drug could be marketed after convincing Phase II data if it addressed an unmet medical need—e.g., a first therapy for a disease sub‑population, a treatment for patients who do not respond to existing drugs, or a compound with a clear safety or efficacy advantage.  The author welcomes the idea as “aggressive but sensible,” believing it would push companies to run stronger Phase II trials and let truly promising medicines start recouping R&D costs earlier, while acknowledging that Phase III confirmation would still be required and that some approvals would later be revoked.

The piece then outlines the political landscape.  BIO (the biotech trade group) backs the bill, while the FDA and several patient‑advocacy groups fear a dilution of safety standards.  PhRMA, the large‑pharma trade association, is portrayed as the most vocal opponent.  The author cites Avik Roy’s argument that PhRMA’s resistance stems from a desire to protect the “big‑pharma R&D oligopoly”: if small biotech firms could obtain provisional approvals on their own, they would need fewer partnership deals with the big companies that currently supply most of the late‑stage development and commercialization capacity.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Legislative outcome  
- **TREAT Act**: The specific bill introduced in 2012 never passed as written.  It was re‑filed in subsequent sessions (2013‑2015) but stalled in committee.  Elements of its intent—greater use of early‑stage data and “real‑world evidence”—were later incorporated into broader FDA‑reform legislation:
  * **21st Century Cures Act** (Dec 2016) created the “Breakthrough Therapy” designation (expanded in 2017) and authorized the FDA to consider real‑world evidence for certain approvals.  
  * **FDA Reauthorization Act** (2017) gave the agency new authority to issue “conditional approvals” for regenerative‑medicine products (the RMAT pathway).  
- No law currently allows routine market entry after Phase II alone for non‑oncology drugs; accelerated approval remains limited to serious or life‑threatening conditions, primarily oncology and rare diseases.

### FDA’s accelerated‑approval landscape  
- **Growth in oncology**: From 2012 to 2024 the number of oncology drugs granted accelerated approval rose from ~15 per year to >30 per year, driven largely by immunotherapies (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab).  
- **Post‑approval confirmatory failures**: Several high‑profile indications were withdrawn after Phase III failures (e.g., Avastin for metastatic breast cancer, olaratumab for soft‑tissue sarcoma, and more recently, several early‑phase immunotherapy combos).  The FDA has increased enforcement of post‑marketing study commitments, issuing “withdrawal” or “partial withdrawal” notices when confirmatory trials are delayed.  
- **Non‑oncology use**: Accelerated approval has been applied sparingly outside oncology (e.g., for rare metabolic diseases such as cerliponase alfa).  The FDA has been cautious, citing safety concerns.

### Industry dynamics  
- **Biotech‑big‑pharma partnerships**: Contrary to the article’s implication that a broader provisional‑approval pathway would diminish big‑pharma’s role, the period 2012‑2025 saw a **boom in M&A and licensing deals**.  From 2012‑2024, the total value of biotech‑to‑big‑pharma deals grew from ~US$30 billion to >US$150 billion, with landmark transactions such as:
  * Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma (2017) for US$11.9 billion.  
  * Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s purchase of Celgene (2019) for US$74 billion.  
  * Pfizer’s acquisition of Seagen (2023) for US$43 billion.  
- **Financing**: Small biotech firms continued to rely heavily on partnership cash‑infusions and milestone payments rather than solely on early market entry.  The rise of “venture‑capital‑backed” biotech IPOs and SPACs provided alternative capital, but the need for large‑scale manufacturing, distribution, and regulatory expertise kept big‑pharma involvement central.  

### PhRMA’s stance  
- PhRMA has **consistently supported** the existing accelerated‑approval framework while **opposing** proposals that would lower evidentiary thresholds without additional safeguards.  Position papers from 2013‑2022 stress patient safety and the importance of robust Phase III data.  The organization has not publicly advocated for a return to the pre‑accelerated “full‑approval only” model, but it has lobbied for **stronger post‑marketing study enforcement** and for **increased FDA resources** to handle the higher workload that broader provisional pathways would create.

### Real‑world impact on patients  
- **Drug uptake**: Several drugs granted accelerated approval have become standard of care after confirmatory success (e.g., pembrolizumab for multiple cancers).  Others have seen limited uptake because confirmatory trials failed or because payers required full approval before reimbursement (e.g., certain CAR‑T therapies).  
- **Safety perception**: Surveys of oncologists and patient groups in 2018‑2022 show mixed confidence in accelerated‑approval drugs; the majority accept them for serious diseases with few alternatives but remain wary of “conditional” labeling for chronic conditions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article**: *Provisional approvals after Phase II would speed R&D, let drugs earn back costs earlier, and reduce dependence of small biotech on big pharma.*  

  **Outcome**  
  - *Speed of R&D*: The FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” and “Accelerated Approval” designations have indeed shortened development timelines for many oncology agents, but the effect is confined to a narrow therapeutic space.  
  - *Cost recovery*: Early market entry has helped a handful of high‑priced oncology drugs achieve rapid revenue (e.g., pembrolizumab generated >US$10 billion in its first two years).  However, the majority of Phase II‑only approvals have either been withdrawn or remain under strict post‑marketing study requirements, limiting broad cost‑recovery benefits.  
  - *Biotech independence*: The anticipated erosion of big‑pharma’s “farm‑team” role has **not materialized**.  Partnerships and acquisitions have increased, suggesting that the industry still views large companies as essential for late‑stage development, commercialization, and global distribution.  

- **Implicit prediction**: *PhRMA’s opposition is driven by a desire to protect its R&D oligopoly.*  

  **Outcome**  
  - PhRMA’s public statements focus on safety and regulatory rigor rather than market dominance.  While the organization’s lobbying aligns with preserving existing pathways that favor large‑scale clinical programs, there is no concrete evidence that the primary motive was to block competition from small biotech.  

- **Implicit prediction**: *The FDA would be overwhelmed by a new provisional‑approval regime.*  

  **Outcome**  
  - The FDA’s budget and staffing have grown modestly (≈ 15 % increase in FY 2024) but the agency has **not** been forced to implement a Phase‑II‑only approval pathway.  Instead, it has expanded its **real‑world‑evidence** infrastructure and created the **RMAT** pathway for regenerative medicines, which adds workload but is managed through dedicated review teams.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal debate about FDA reform and the balance of power between biotech innovators and big‑pharma incumbents; however, its specific predictions were only partially realized, and the legislative proposal it championed never became law.
