# There'd Better Not Be an Argon Receptor (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the discovery of unconventional gaseous signaling molecules in physiology. The author describes how nitric oxide (NO) became accepted as a neurotransmitter despite initial skepticism, followed by evidence in the 1990s for two even more toxic gases—hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and carbon monoxide (CO)—playing physiological roles in the brain and body. The article notes H₂S effects on smooth muscle and long-term memory, and CO's involvement in vasodilation, immune response, and cellular protection. The author anticipates drug development efforts targeting these pathways, similar to the extensive NO research that preceded them, and speculates about other small-molecule gases (ammonia, SO₂, N₂O) possibly having undiscovered signaling functions, while jokingly drawing the line at halogens or noble gases having physiological receptors.

## 2. HISTORY

Research on H₂S and CO as gasotransmitters expanded significantly after 2004, though therapeutic translation has been challenging:

- **Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S)**: The field developed numerous pharmacological tools (donors like NaHS and GYY4137; inhibitors of endogenous synthesis). H₂S was found to modulate ion channels, inflammation, and oxidative stress, with cardiovascular and neuroprotective effects demonstrated in animal models. However, **no H₂S-based drugs achieved regulatory approval** in the subsequent two decades. Clinical trials explored H₂S donors for heart failure and other conditions, but results were mixed and did not lead to approved therapies. Research continues on harnessing H₂S's cytoprotective effects while managing dosing and delivery challenges.

- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: Therapeutic CO delivery (low-dose inhaled CO, CO-releasing molecules/CORMs) showed anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective potential in preclinical models. **Small clinical trials tested CO for organ protection and inflammatory conditions**, but again, no CO-based therapy reached FDA/EMA approval. Research continues on controlled CO delivery for acute kidney injury, lung injury, and transplantation.

- **Drug Discovery Impact**: While the mechanisms became "fleshed out," progress from mechanism to approved drug was slow. The pathway did not produce blockbuster drugs akin to PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil) that arose from NO research, nor did it spur widespread adoption in clinical pipelines beyond experimental studies.

- **Newer Gasotransmitters**: Interest in other potential gasotransmitters continued, but none achieved the same consensus status as NO, CO, and H₂S.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Look for more and more work on these in the drug industry as their mechanisms get fleshed out."**
  - Outcome: Substantial academic research unfolded across the 2000s–2010s, establishing detailed mechanisms for H₂S and CO signaling (KATP channels, NF-κB, HIF-1α). Drug industry engagement was modest and focused on tool compounds and early exploratory programs rather than major pipeline investments. No H₂S/CO-targeting drugs reached the market or achieved broad clinical uptake, contrasting sharply with the author's implicit comparison to NO (which had multiple approved drugs and successful therapeutic targeting by 2004).

- **Speculation about additional gases (ammonia, SO₂, N₂O, methylamine, dimethyl sulfide) having pathways:**
  - Outcome: These did not become established gasotransmitters. While some effects were reported (e.g., N₂O anesthesia, ammonia in hepatic encephalopathy), they lack the endogenous, receptor-like physiological signaling roles analogous to NO/CO/H₂S.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article correctly anticipated expansion of research into H₂S and CO, but the therapeutic payoff never matched that of NO. The piece has historical value as an early perspective on gasotransmitter biology, though its predictions for drug development proved optimistic relative to actual outcomes over the subsequent two decades.
