# Strangely Good Results in Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted two seemingly paradoxical findings that challenged prevailing clinical thinking.  

* **Statins in low‑risk people:** Citing a Lancet analysis, the author noted that even individuals with a 5‑year cardiovascular risk < 10 % experienced an absolute reduction of ~11 events per 1,000 when LDL was lowered by 1 mmol/L. The author argued that such a benefit “greatly exceeds any known hazards” and suggested that primary‑prevention guidelines, which at the time excluded most low‑risk adults, might need revision.  

* **Metabolic (bariatric) surgery for type‑2 diabetes:** The piece described early reports that gastric‑bypass could normalize glucose control within weeks—well before substantial weight loss—implying a gut‑hormone‑mediated mechanism. The author called for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to confirm the effect, warned that non‑randomized data could be biased, and noted that without NIH endorsement and insurance coverage the approach would remain limited.

Overall, the article used these two examples to illustrate how nonlinear biology can produce unexpectedly large therapeutic gains, and it warned that the medical establishment often lags behind such signals.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Statins for primary prevention  
* **Guideline evolution:** The ACC/AHA 2013 guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol introduced a risk‑based approach, recommending moderate‑intensity statins for adults 40‑75 y with a 10‑year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5 % (even if “low‑risk” by older standards). Subsequent updates (2018, 2022) have lowered the risk threshold in many societies (e.g., European ESC/EAS 2019, AHA/ACC 2019) and now endorse statins for many individuals with a 5‑year risk well below 10 %.  

* **Evidence base:** Large primary‑prevention trials published after 2012—most notably JUPITER (rosuvastatin, 2008, but its impact grew), the HOPE‑3 trial (2016, rosuvastatin in intermediate‑risk adults), and the ASCOT‑LLA trial (2008, but long‑term follow‑up published later)—confirmed modest absolute risk reductions consistent with the article’s numbers. Meta‑analyses (e.g., Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration, 2019) reaffirmed that each 1 mmol/L LDL drop yields ~10–12 fewer major vascular events per 1,000 over 5 years, matching the cited figure.  

* **Clinical uptake:** Statin prescriptions in the United States rose sharply from ~200 million annual fills in 2012 to > 300 million by 2020, driven largely by primary‑prevention use. Uptake varies by region; some European countries still show more conservative prescribing.  

* **Safety perception:** Post‑marketing surveillance has not uncovered any major new safety signals; the “hazards” remain limited to modest increases in diabetes incidence and rare myopathy, which are outweighed by cardiovascular benefit in most risk groups.

### Metabolic surgery for type‑2 diabetes  
* **Key RCTs:**  
  * **STAMPEDE (2014)** – Compared gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and intensive medical therapy in patients with BMI 27‑43 kg/m². Both surgical arms achieved higher diabetes remission (≈30 % at 5 y) and better glycemic control than medical therapy.  
  * **Diabetes Surgery Study (DSS, 2015)** – Showed similar superiority of gastric bypass over conventional care in patients with BMI 30‑35 kg/m².  
  * **MOSAIC (2017)** – Demonstrated durable remission after sleeve gastrectomy in patients with BMI 35‑45 kg/m².  

* **Guideline endorsement:** The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2017 and later updates, as well as the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) 2020 consensus, now list metabolic surgery as a treatment option for T2DM in patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², and for BMI 30‑34.9 kg/m² when hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled. Some societies (e.g., NICE UK 2020) have extended coverage to BMI 30‑35 kg/m² with comorbidities.  

* **Insurance coverage:** In the U.S., Medicare began covering bariatric surgery for diabetes in patients with BMI 30‑35 kg/m² (with uncontrolled diabetes) in 2020. Private insurers have followed suit, though coverage criteria remain heterogeneous.  

* **Mechanistic insights:** By 2022, gut‑hormone research had identified rapid post‑bypass rises in GLP‑1, PYY, and changes in bile‑acid signaling as primary drivers of early glycemic improvement. This mechanistic clarity helped legitimize “metabolic surgery” as a distinct therapeutic class.  

* **Long‑term outcomes:** Real‑world registries (e.g., the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program, MBSAQIP) report diabetes remission rates of 30‑60 % at 5 years, with a gradual relapse in ~20 % of patients. Mortality benefits have been demonstrated in large observational cohorts (e.g., Swedish Obese Subjects, 30‑year follow‑up published 2020).  

* **Competing pharmacology:** The explosion of GLP‑1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) and dual GIP/GLP‑1 agents (tirzepatide) since 2019 has provided non‑surgical alternatives that achieve comparable HbA1c reductions, but they do not replicate the weight‑loss magnitude of surgery.  

Overall, the predictions that RCTs would be needed and that the field would move from “experimental” to “guideline‑endorsed” have been borne out.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2012 article | What actually happened |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Statins should be considered for “everyone” (including low‑risk adults) because the benefit exceeds the hazards.** | Guidelines now recommend statins for many low‑to‑moderate risk adults (10‑year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5 % or even lower in some societies). Prescription rates have risen, but universal use is not mandated; clinicians still weigh individual risk, age, and patient preference. |
| **Metabolic surgery will become a validated therapy for type‑2 diabetes, but RCTs are needed before NIH/insurance endorsement.** | RCTs (STAMPEDE, DSS, etc.) were completed between 2014‑2017, confirming superiority over medical therapy. NIH‑backed trials (e.g., the Diabetes Surgery Study) led to updated ADA and IFSO guidelines, and insurance coverage expanded in the late 2010s. |
| **The mechanism is likely gut‑hormone mediated; turning this into a drug will be difficult.** | Hormonal mechanisms (GLP‑1, PYY, bile acids) were elucidated, inspiring drug development. GLP‑1 receptor agonists and dual agonists now achieve glycemic control comparable to surgery, though they do not fully replicate the weight‑loss effect. |
| **Guidelines for statins will be reconsidered because of the new data.** | Major cholesterol guidelines (ACC/AHA 2013, ESC/EAS 2019, AHA/ACC 2022) lowered the risk threshold and broadened statin eligibility, reflecting the data highlighted in the article. |
| **Insurance companies will be reluctant to pay for surgery without NIH sanction.** | After the pivotal RCTs, Medicare and many private insurers began covering metabolic surgery for diabetes in patients with BMI 30‑35 kg/m² (2020 onward), showing the prediction was accurate for the short term but later overcome by evidence. |

**Overall assessment:** The article’s forward‑looking statements were largely correct; the anticipated RCTs and guideline shifts materialized within a 5‑10 year window.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is noteworthy because it anticipated two major shifts (primary‑prevention statin use and metabolic surgery for diabetes) that have reshaped clinical practice and health‑policy, yet it remains a concise opinion piece rather than a seminal research article.
