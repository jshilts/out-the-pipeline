# Ah, Remember Those Days? How Will We Remember These? (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece looks back at the “genomics frenzy” of the early 2000s, using a 2000 Adam Feuerstein interview with Millennium Pharmaceuticals CEO Mark Levin as a touch‑stone. Levin boasted that Millennium’s “gene‑to‑patient” platform would rev up productivity so that, by 2005, the company would be launching one or two new drugs annually while feeding the pipeline with at least five new clinical‑trial candidates each year. The author notes that such optimism was widespread then, contrasts it with the more pessimistic mood of 2011, and wonders whether future observers will view the 2000 hype as a quirky footnote.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Millennium Pharmaceuticals after 2005**  
- Millennium’s most celebrated product, the proteasome inhibitor **bortezomib (Velcade)**, received FDA approval in 2003 and remained its primary revenue driver. No other novel NMEs reached the market under the Millennium brand after that.  
- In 2008, Takeda Pharmaceutical acquired Millennium for ≈ $8 billion. Post‑acquisition, the “gene‑to‑patient” branding was largely retired; Takeda integrated Millennium’s assets into its broader oncology portfolio.  
- The promised pipeline of five new clinical‑trial candidates per year never materialised at the scale Levin described. While Millennium did advance several early‑stage programs (e.g., **MLN9708**, later **ixazomib**, which entered Phase III in 2014 and was approved in 2020 for multiple myeloma), these came years after the 2005 target and were not the result of a sustained high‑throughput launch cadence.

**Mark Levin’s later activities**  
- After leaving Millennium, Levin co‑founded **Third Rock Ventures** (2007). Third Rock has incubated a dozen biotech start‑ups (e.g., **Audentes**, **Decibel**, **Alnylam**‑related ventures). A few of these companies have progressed to late‑stage clinical trials, and **Audentes’ gene‑therapy AAV‑MYO** entered a pivotal trial in 2022, but none have yet produced a blockbuster approved product.  
- Levin remains an active venture partner, but his post‑Millennium track record, while respectable, does not match the “turbo‑charged” drug‑development pace he once forecast.

**The broader “gene‑to‑patient” promise**  
- Whole‑genome sequencing costs fell dramatically (from > $100 M per genome in 2000 to <$ 1 k by the late 2010s), enabling precision‑medicine initiatives and companion diagnostics.  
- Nevertheless, the overall number of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved annually in the U.S. has hovered around 30–40 per year throughout the 2000s‑2020s, a modest increase over the pre‑genomics era but far short of the exponential productivity boost implied by Levin’s 2000 statement.  
- Many high‑profile genomic targets (e.g., KRAS G12C inhibitors) have only recently yielded approved drugs (sotorasib, 2021), illustrating that the translation from genomic insight to marketable therapy remains slow and attritional.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Levin’s 2005 drug‑launch target (1–2 new drugs per year)**  
  - *Outcome*: Not achieved. Millennium’s only post‑2005 approved drug was ixazomib (2020), well after the 2005 horizon, and it was the sole new NME from the company in that period.  

- **Levin’s pipeline target (≥ 5 new clinical‑trial candidates each year)**  
  - *Outcome*: The pipeline never sustained that volume. Public data show only a handful of new IND filings per year, with many programs discontinued before reaching human trials.  

- **Implicit prediction that genomics would “turbo‑charge” industry productivity**  
  - *Outcome*: Genomics has undeniably reshaped target identification and patient stratification, but the macro‑level productivity metrics (time‑to‑market, number of approvals) have improved only incrementally. The industry still grapples with high attrition rates, and the anticipated wave of genomics‑driven drugs has been more gradual than the early‑2000s hype suggested.  

- **Broader sentiment shift (optimism → pessimism)**  
  - *Outcome*: The sentiment swing described in the article is accurate. By the early 2010s, many investors and analysts were wary of “big‑data” promises, a mood that persisted through the “valley of death” in biotech financing until the recent resurgence driven by mRNA vaccines and gene‑therapy successes.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a vivid snapshot of biotech optimism at the turn of the millennium and serves as a useful reference point for evaluating how those expectations have unfolded, though it offers limited new analysis beyond the quoted hype.
