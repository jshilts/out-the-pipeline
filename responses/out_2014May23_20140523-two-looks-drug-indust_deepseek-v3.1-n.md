# Critical Analysis: "Two Looks At Drug Industry Productivity" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 article examines conflicting assessments of pharmaceutical R&D productivity through analysis of two competing methodologies. The piece centers on Richard Evans' innovation ranking system, which evaluated 22 biopharma companies based on early-stage metrics like forward-looking patents and entry into novel therapeutic areas, yielding a top-five ranking of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Vertex, Gilead, and Allergan. 

The article juxtaposes Evans' dire assessment—demonstrated through charts showing poor returns on R&D investment minus capital costs—with a more optimistic Boston Consulting Group analysis suggesting productivity had improved since 2008. The BCG report argued that peak-sales-to-R&D ratios had doubled from 0.12 to 0.29, approaching the 0.25-0.35 range needed to meet cost of capital. However, the author expresses skepticism about both methodologies and doubts whether any genuine productivity turnaround had actually occurred.

## 2. HISTORY

**Industry-Wide Developments (2014-2024):**
The subsequent decade largely validated the article's skeptical stance. Industry R&D productivity did not experience the dramatic improvement BCG predicted, though the landscape evolved in complex ways. Drug development costs continued climbing, with the average cost to bring a drug to market exceeding $2.8 billion by 2022 (up from ~$1.3 billion in 2014). However, approvals increased significantly during the 2014-2019 period, particularly for specialty drugs and biologics.

**Company-Specific Validation:**
- **Bristol-Myers Squibb** (ranked #1) enjoyed major success with immuno-oncology drugs like Opdivo but faced patent cliffs by the early 2020s
- **Gilead** (#4) achieved massive success with hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, validating their R&D capabilities, though their HIV franchise faced increasing competition
- **Celgene** (#2) maintained strong performance until acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2019, largely justifying its ranking
- **Vertex** (#3) successfully transitioned from hepatitis C to become the dominant player in cystic fibrosis therapeutics

**Lower-Ranked Companies:**
- **Regeneron** (#19) proved Evans' ranking dramatically wrong, achieving major success with drugs like Eylea and Dupixent, becoming one of the industry's most valuable R&D engines
- **Novartis** (#18) continued as a major player with mixed R&D productivity, suggesting the ranking may have been too harsh

**Methodological Lessons:**
The Evans methodology's failure to predict Regeneron's success highlights the inherent limitations of using patent metrics and early-stage indicators as proxies for future innovation success. The company's focus on therapeutic antibodies and genetically-defined diseases proved highly productive despite not fitting traditional R&D assessment models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**
1. **Skepticism about productivity claims was justified**: The author's doubts about BCG's optimistic 2013 assessment proved prescient. While some improvement occurred, the industry never returned to late-1990s productivity levels.

2. **R&D cuts would hurt future pipelines**: The author's concern that cost-cutting rather than efficiency gains drove apparent improvements proved accurate. The article's warning that "we're likely going to pay for those in a few years with a smaller number of approved drugs" was partially validated—while approvals remained strong through 2019, concerns about pipeline sustainability grew post-2020.

3. **Methodological problems with peak-sales metrics**: The article's questioning of BCG's reliance on peak-sales estimates was well-founded, as such projections remain notoriously unreliable and subject to manipulation.

**What the Article Got Wrong:**
1. **Underestimating specific companies**: The unquestioning acceptance of Regeneron at #19 proved dramatically incorrect, as they became one of the decade's most innovative companies. This suggests the Evans methodology had systematic blind spots.

2. **Focus on industry-wide aggregate trends**: The article gave insufficient attention to how different therapeutic areas and company strategies would diverge. The biotechnology sector's outperformance relative to traditional pharma wasn't adequately captured.

3. **The optimistic scenario was possible**: While the author's skepticism was largely justified, the period did see genuine improvements in targeted therapies and precision medicine, though these were concentrated in specific companies and therapeutic areas.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9 (percentiles 70-79)**

This article deserves a relatively high interest score because it illustrates several enduring truths about technology assessment and industry analysis. It captures a crucial moment when the pharmaceutical industry was grappling with existential questions about its R&D model, and it demonstrates the difficulty of measuring innovation through any single methodology.

The piece is particularly valuable for its methodological skepticism and emphasis on back-testing—principles that remain relevant across all technology sectors. It highlights how even sophisticated analysts can miss paradigm-shifting innovations (like Regeneron's antibody platform) when relying on backward-looking metrics.

However, the article falls short of the highest interest tier (8-9) because its analysis, while thoughtful, doesn't fully grapple with the structural reasons for R&D productivity challenges or offer genuinely novel frameworks for understanding innovation. The discussion remains somewhat confined to financial metrics rather than deeper considerations of scientific paradigms or technological disruption.

The article's greatest lasting value lies in its demonstration that even in data-rich environments, predicting which companies will succeed at innovation remains extraordinarily difficult—a lesson that applies far beyond pharmaceuticals to all technology sectors.
