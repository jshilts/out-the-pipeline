# A Blood Test for Alzheimer's?
March 2014

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a newly published study in *Nature Medicine* by researchers from Georgetown and Rochester, presenting a potential early diagnostic blood test for Alzheimer's disease. The test used a ten-lipid biomarker panel that the authors claimed achieved 90% accuracy in predicting cognitive decline within three years. The author expresses cautious optimism while noting statistical concerns—the small absolute number of patients showing the effect, the risk of spurious correlations from biomarker "fishing expeditions," and the parallel to overfitted QSAR models needing multiple parameters. Practical considerations are raised about false-positive/false-negative rates and the psychological implications of early diagnosis given the lack of available treatments. However, the author recognizes the potential utility for clinical trial enrichment if the test proves valid.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 ten-lipid panel study did not translate into a clinically viable blood test for Alzheimer's disease. Subsequent validation efforts failed to reproduce the reported accuracy, and the approach was ultimately abandoned.

The Alzheimer's blood test field has since moved in different directions, with most successful approaches focusing on **amyloid and tau biomarkers** rather than lipids. Between 2014-2020, multiple research groups demonstrated that blood-based measurements of amyloid-β ($\text{Aβ}_{42}/\text{Aβ}_{40}$ ratio) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181, p-tau217) could detect Alzheimer's pathology with high accuracy.

The real breakthrough came from **immunoassay and mass spectrometry methods** that could reliably measure these proteins in blood plasma. Several commercial assays have now been developed, some achieving diagnostic accuracy comparable to CSF analysis and PET imaging, with sensitivity/specificity often exceeding 85-90%. These tests are being adopted in clinical trials for patient screening and are moving toward routine clinical use.

One notable success is the **Lumipulse G p-tau181 blood test** (Fujirebio), which received FDA clearance in 2021 for use in Alzheimer's evaluation. Other companies including Quanterix, Roche, and C₂N Diagnostics have developed similar assays. Insurance coverage remains limited but is expanding as clinical utility data accumulate.

In contrast to the article's skepticism about utility without treatments, blood-based biomarkers are now considered **essential for clinical trial recruitment** into early-stage prevention trials, a prediction that proved accurate.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and observations:

• **"This could indeed be real, and if it is, a larger sample will nail it down"**: **Correct in principle, but wrong for this specific test.** While the general principle that larger samples validate biomarkers is sound, this particular ten-lipid panel failed subsequent validation. Researchers moved to entirely different biomarker classes (amyloid/tau proteins) rather than lipid panels.

• **"It'll also be interesting to see if the time horizon can be improved past three years"**: **Achieved, but through different methods.** Blood biomarkers now being used can detect Alzheimer's pathology 10-20 years before symptom onset, far exceeding the 3-year prediction window the 2014 study claimed. This enables truly preclinical detection.

• **"If this works out, though, it would also seem to be very useful for future clinical trials"**: **Largely correct in principle.** Accurate biomarkers for early-stage Alzheimer's have become integral to clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies, including anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs. Blood tests are now actively used for trial recruitment and enrichment.

• **"The usual worries about an Alzheimer's diagnostic apply - some people will want to know, and others won't, since there's no treatment"**: **Still true but evolving.** The approval of monoclonal antibody treatments (aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab) has somewhat changed this equation, though availability and effectiveness remain limited. The ethical considerations of early diagnosis persist.

• The implied concern about **statistical overfitting ("bit like seeing a QSAR model that needs ten parameters")** was **prescient but misdirected**. While the specific lipid panel likely suffered from overfitting, the biomarker field successfully transitioned to single-analyte or few-analyte protein-based tests with robust performance.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures an important moment in Alzheimer's diagnostics development, highlighting legitimate scientific skepticism and reasonable caution about early exciting results. While the specific study being discussed didn't pan out, the broader themes—biomarkers for early detection, clinical trial utility, and validation challenges—remain highly relevant to the field's trajectory. The article understands the methodological pitfalls well, even if its specific conclusions weren't entirely aligned with how the field actually developed.
