# New Forms of Carbon? (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article discusses the controversy surrounding two newly reported forms of carbon: carbyne and Q-carbon. Carbyne is described as a hypothetical one-dimensional carbon allotrope consisting of sp-hybridized carbon chains with alternating triple bonds, theoretically completing a series alongside diamond (sp³) and graphite/graphene (sp²). However, as the article notes, shorter poly-ynes were already known to be violently unstable, making bulk carbyne formation highly questionable. Nobel laureate Harry Kroto is quoted saying researchers couldn't have made carbyne "because they are still alive," reflecting deep skepticism in the chemical community.

The second material, Q-carbon, was reported by researchers at NC State as an intermediate phase between graphite and diamond, produced through laser heating with unusual magnetic and optical properties. The article treats both claims with cautious skepticism, noting that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and that replication would be essential before these materials could be accepted.

## 2. HISTORY

The skepticism expressed in the 2015 article proved well-founded, though the subsequent years revealed a more complex picture than simple confirmation or refutation.

Regarding carbyne, subsequent research largely validated the article's cautious stance. While bulk crystalline carbyne as originally claimed did not withstand scientific scrutiny, research on finite-length carbon chains (poly-ynes/cumulenes) has continued. By 2016-2018, it became clear that extremely long poly-ynes remain highly unstable and challenging to synthesize, though shorter chains (up to ~44 carbons) have been stabilized under specific conditions. Rather than a true bulk allotrope, carbyne exists primarily as short, end-capped chains that require careful stabilization. No practical applications emerged from bulk carbyne, and the initial controversial claims were not independently reproduced.

For Q-carbon, the situation developed differently. Research continued at NC State and other institutions, with multiple publications appearing through 2016-2020. However, the material never achieved broad scientific acceptance as a distinct carbon allotrope. Critically, independent confirmation remained limited, with few research groups successfully reproducing the reported synthesis. While the NC State team proposed applications in diamond synthesis and magnetic storage, these never translated to commercial deployment. The unusual magnetic properties reported remain disputed, as ferromagnetism in pure carbon systems contradicts established understanding.

Neither material achieved the transformative impact initially suggested. No industrial processes, commercial products, or approved medical applications emerged from either carbyne or Q-carbon. The carbon nanomaterials field instead continued focusing on graphene, carbon nanotubes, and diamond-like carbon films—materials with established properties and growing commercial adoption.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **Prediction**: Carbyne and Q-carbon claims would undergo intense scrutiny and require replication
  - **Reality**: Both materials faced significant skepticism and attempts at replication. Carbyne was largely discredited as a bulk material, while Q-carbon failed to achieve broad scientific consensus despite continued research efforts.

• **Prediction**: Carbyne's existence was doubtful given known poly-yne instability; Harry Kroto's skepticism was highlighted
  - **Reality**: This proved largely correct. Bulk carbyne did not become established as a viable carbon allotrope, though finite poly-yne chains continued to be studied as molecular species requiring special stabilization.

• **Prediction**: Q-carbon might offer a route to diamond synthesis and had unusual magnetic properties worth investigating
  - **Reality**: The diamond synthesis claim showed limited promise and never achieved industrial relevance. The claimed magnetic properties in Q-carbon remained controversial and unproven for practical applications.

• **Implicit prediction**: Laser processing of carbon materials might reveal unexpected phases
  - **Reality**: While Q-carbon specifically didn't revolutionize the field, laser processing of carbon materials continues as an active research area, particularly for graphene synthesis and diamond-like carbon deposition, though with incremental rather than breakthrough advances.

## 4. INTEREST

Score: **4/10**

This article addressed claims that generated transient excitement but had limited long-term impact. While carbon allotropes remain scientifically important, these specific claims did not lead to major breakthroughs or commercial applications, making the article more historical curiosity than prescient analysis of transformative developments.
