# GSK Continues R&D Cuts (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is continuing its research and development site consolidation strategy, announcing the planned closure of its facility in Les Ulis, France, outside Paris. This was part of GSK's broader "strategic refocusing" initiative to concentrate R&D operations into two main hubs: Stevenage in the UK and Upper Providence, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. The company planned to spend several months seeking a buyer for the French site, after which it would proceed with complete closure if no buyer emerged. The article noted that French labor laws would likely extend the timeline but that the final outcome was essentially predetermined.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2015 announcement, GSK continued its R&D restructuring throughout the late 2010s. The consolidation reflected broader pharmaceutical industry trends toward centralized R&D operations rather than maintaining numerous smaller regional facilities. In 2018, GSK announced further restructuring of its R&D organization with an increased focus on biopharmaceuticals and specialty medicines. The company invested in expanding its Upper Providence site as planned, while continuing to strengthen its UK presence. However, this period also saw GSK facing challenges with its pharmaceutical pipeline, leading to strategic shifts toward consumer healthcare (later separated into Haleon) and vaccines/oncology focus. The R&D restructuring coincided with industry-wide cost pressures and the need to improve research productivity. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, GSK's R&D investment remained substantial but increasingly targeted toward areas like immuno-inflammation, oncology, and rare diseases rather than broad-based research across multiple facilities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Forecast**: The article predicted the site closure was inevitable despite French labor law complications
  **Outcome**: The site closure proceeded as anticipated, consistent with GSK's broader R&D consolidation strategy

• **Forecast**: Implicit prediction that R&D consolidation would continue through focus on Stevenage and Upper Providence
  **Outcome**: GSK maintained investment in both sites, though the company's overall R&D strategy evolved toward more targeted therapeutic areas rather than maintaining broad research capabilities across all disease areas

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article documents a routine corporate restructuring that reflects ongoing pharmaceutical industry consolidation but lacks broader implications or groundbreaking developments that would make it of lasting significance.
