# Tickling Individual Bonds (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a novel chemical reaction technique using femtosecond infrared (IR) pulses to selectively accelerate specific bond formations. The author contrasts this elegant approach with traditional "brute force" methods—heating reactions or adding excess reagents—that simply increase molecular collisions. The research, from a German-Egyptian collaboration, demonstrated that targeted IR pulses directed at particular bonds (O-H stretches in alcohols or double bonds in isocyanates) could accelerate carbamate formation by 24% without thermally heating the reaction mixture. Quantum yields were modest, and the experimental setup required expensive equipment, making immediate lab-bench adoption unlikely. The technique also showed potential for precise applications like photolithography, where IR beams could selectively write patterns in chemical films.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2018 study represented early progress in bond-selective chemistry, but this research direction did not lead to immediate widespread adoption. Femtosecond IR techniques remain primarily in specialized academic and industrial R&D settings due to their complexity and cost. While the concept of using ultrafast lasers to probe transition states is well-established in physical chemistry and spectroscopy, its practical application to scalable organic synthesis remains limited. No therapeutic drugs have been approved or progressed through clinical trials based on this specific IR-bond activation technique, largely because large-scale pharmaceutical manufacturing prioritizes cost-effective thermal, catalytic, or flow-chemistry methods. The described reaction has clinical relevance as carbamates appear in several FDA-approved drugs (e.g., rivastigmine, darunavir), but these are not synthesized via selective IR excitation. Policy and funding for industrial biotechnology have not shifted toward femtosecond laser-enabled synthesis, and no major commercial ventures emerged from this specific approach. Photolithography applications using selective chemistry have advanced, but generally through conventional photochemical or thermal methods rather than IR-bond activation. Overall, while scientifically intriguing, the technique has remained a research curiosity rather than a transformative manufacturing approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Technique won't migrate to organic lab benches due to expensive equipment needs.**  
**Outcome:** This proved accurate. Twelve years later, femtosecond IR pulse instruments remain rare in routine organic synthesis labs, confined to specialized physical chemistry facilities. Standard industrial synthesis continues relying on thermal, catalytic, and continuous-flow methods.

• **Prediction: Could become part of automated chemistry systems (referencing a flow chemistry vision).**  
**Outcome:** Partially realized but not widespread. While automated flow chemistry has grown considerably (e.g., GSK's self-optimizing platforms, MIT's automated synthesis modules), IR-bond-selective control has not become a standard feature. General photochemistry and microwave heating have seen broader industrial adoption for process intensification.

• **Prediction: Photolithography applications could emerge to "write" chemical patterns.**  
**Outcome:** Limited impact. While direct laser writing and lithography have advanced, they typically use conventional UV/visible photochemistry or two-photon absorption, not the specific IR-bond excitation mechanism studied here.

• **Implicit prediction: This represents an elegant alternative to "brute force" synthetic methods.**  
**Outcome:** Over the past decade, process chemistry has instead emphasized other precision approaches—flow chemistry, electrochemistry, photoredox catalysis, and enzymatic transformations—that offer better scalability and cost-effectiveness than femtosecond IR control.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The work represents a scientifically elegant proof-of-concept in physical organic chemistry, but it did not drive major technological shifts or produce practical medicines.
