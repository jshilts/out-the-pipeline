# "You Do The Easy Stuff; I'll Do the Easier" (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2007 commentary addresses how medicinal chemists' synthetic capabilities and personal preferences influence which compounds actually get synthesized in drug discovery. The core thesis is that chemists tend to gravitate toward "low-hanging fruit" – molecules that are easier to synthesize using familiar reactions and methods.

The article highlights the explosion of bi-aryl compounds following the development of Suzuki coupling chemistry, questioning whether this reflects a genuine realization that bi-aryls are valuable drug molecules or simply that Suzuki chemistry makes them easy to produce. Several factors drive this behavior: pressure to produce results quickly, natural tendency toward familiar methods, and the reality that small changes (adding a methyl group or para-fluoro) can significantly alter biological activity and fix metabolic problems.

The author suggests that hiring chemists with diverse synthetic backgrounds can mitigate this effect, as different definitions of "easy" might prevent everyone from converging on the same structures. Modern literature searching capabilities are noted as a democratizing force that makes previously obscure reactions more accessible, potentially reducing the impact of individual chemist experience on compound selection.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends and behaviors described in this 2007 article have persisted and evolved significantly over the subsequent 17 years:

**Synthetic Chemistry Evolution**: Suzuki coupling and related cross-coupling reactions have indeed become workhorse methods in medicinal chemistry. By 2010-2020, these reactions were standard tools in drug discovery, enabling more complex architectures. However, this accessibility came with the predicted consequence: bi-aryl motifs became extremely common in drug discovery programs.

**Drug Development Reality**: The concern about making only "easy" compounds proved partly justified by later developments. Analysis of drug discovery pipelines shows that while synthetic accessibility correlates with success (easier-to-make compounds are more likely to reach clinical trials), this has created a "tractable space" bias. Complex natural products and challenging architectures remained underrepresented in pharmaceutical pipelines despite their potential biological value.

**Technology Impact**: Modern literature searching did democratize synthetic knowledge as predicted. The rise of SciFinder, Reaxys, and later machine learning tools (post-2015) made reaction information more accessible. However, this didn't eliminate the "easy stuff" bias – instead, it shifted it. When everyone has access to the same literature, the same "proven" reactions become popular across the industry.

**Diversity Hiring**: The call for "chemical and scientific diversity" gained traction. By the late 2010s, pharmaceutical companies increasingly recognized that diverse synthetic perspectives were valuable. This led to more varied reaction portfolios in some organizations, though economic pressures still favored rapid, predictable synthesis.

**The Methyl/Para-Fluoro Observations**: These simple modifications remain crucial tools. Analysis of approved drugs shows that fluorine substitution and methyl group addition are among the most common strategies for modulating drug properties. The 2007 observation that "activities totally altered by one methyl group" proved prescient – these remain first-line approaches for addressing metabolic stability, potency, and selectivity issues.

**Late-2010s AI Influence**: From 2015 onward, machine learning began influencing synthetic design. retrosynthesis tools and reaction prediction algorithms started suggesting synthetic routes, but initially these models learned from existing data and thus reinforced existing "easy" pathways. Only recently have AI tools begun suggesting novel, non-obvious routes that could break the "easy stuff" cycle.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions and observations about future trends:

• **Suzuki chemistry accessibility would drive continued bi-aryl proliferation**: This proved accurate. Bi-aryl motifs are extremely common in drugs approved between 2007-2024. Analysis shows sustained high utilization of these structural elements in pharmaceutical compounds.

• **Modern literature searching would reduce individual chemist bias**: This partially came true. Literature searching did democratize knowledge, but instead of eliminating bias, it created industry-wide convergence on popular methods. The prediction missed that easy access to the same literature would lead to herd behavior.

• **Hiring diverse chemical backgrounds would broaden synthetic capabilities**: This showed mixed results. While companies did increasingly value synthetic diversity, economic pressures still pushed toward rapid, proven approaches. The tension between innovation and predictability remained unresolved.

• **Small changes would continue driving major activity improvements**: This proved remarkably accurate. The methyl group and para-fluoro strategies remain fundamental medicinal chemistry approaches. Post-2007 drug discovery continued relying heavily on these simple modifications for property optimization.

• **Pressure and laziness would keep chemists doing easy reactions**: This trend persisted but evolved. The definition of "easy" expanded as new methods became routine, but the underlying behavior pattern – favoring accessible, proven approaches – remained embedded in pharmaceutical culture through 2024.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captured an important and persistent bias in drug discovery that has influenced pharmaceutical research patterns for decades. While not revolutionary, it identified a real phenomenon with measurable impact on pipeline composition and drug design strategies that remains relevant today.
