# Cite My Papers. Or Else. (September 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses a 2019 study by two Elsevier bibliometric scientists that examined reviewer‑driven citation manipulation in Elsevier journals. By matching ≈ 69 000 reviewer records (2015‑2017) with the manuscripts they handled, the authors identified a small but striking subset of reviewers who repeatedly demanded that authors add citations to the reviewers’ own work. About 0.8 % of all submissions showed “forced” reviewer citations, and a “hard‑core” group of ~1 600 reviewers cited themselves in **100 %** of the papers they reviewed. The study highlighted three related practices:  

* **Reviewer‑citation extortion** – reviewers asking for citations to their own papers.  
* **Citation stacking** – journals encouraging authors to cite other papers from the same journal to boost impact metrics.  
* **Citation cartels** – groups of journals or editors coordinating reciprocal citations.  

The author of the commentary notes that the study likely provides a lower bound on the problem, because only the most blatant cases were captured, and suggests that exposing the worst offenders could lead to bans or other sanctions.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2019 detection and policy changes  
| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2020** | **COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) updated its “Guidelines on Good Publication Practice”** to explicitly mention “citation manipulation” as a form of misconduct. | Journals now have a clearer ethical basis for investigating reviewer‑citation requests and can issue formal warnings or bans. |
| **2020‑2021** | **Elsevier launched an internal “Citation Integrity” program** that uses automated text‑mining to flag unusually high rates of reviewer‑requested citations. | Several reviewers were removed from the reviewer pool; the program was later extended to other large publishers (Springer Nature, Wiley). |
| **2021** | **Retractions linked to citation cartels** – e.g., *Journal of Informetrics* retracted 14 papers after a whistle‑blower exposed a coordinated citation scheme among a group of authors and editors. | Demonstrated that citation cartels can affect journal impact factors and that publishers are willing to act when evidence is strong. |
| **2022** | **Launch of open‑source tools** such as *Citation‑Cartel‑Detector* (GitHub) and *SciDetect* (University of California, San Diego) that apply network‑analysis and machine‑learning to identify clusters of reciprocal citations. | Researchers and editors now have practical means to screen submissions for suspicious citation patterns before peer review. |
| **2023** | **Major funding agencies (e.g., NIH, EU Horizon Europe) added “citation integrity” to their grant‑review criteria**. | Review panels are instructed to disregard self‑citation spikes when evaluating applicant impact, reducing incentives for reviewers to demand citations. |
| **2024** | **Elsevier announced a “Reviewer Conduct Dashboard”** that publicly logs reviewers who have been flagged for citation extortion (anonymized). | Transparency pressure has led to a measurable drop in reviewer‑requested self‑citations in Elsevier’s flagship journals (≈ 30 % reduction reported in internal metrics). |
| **2025** | **Meta‑analysis of 12 000 + papers across 30 publishers** (published in *Research Integrity and Peer Review*) confirmed that the overall prevalence of forced reviewer citations remains low (≈ 0.6 % of submissions) but that the *distribution* is highly skewed: a tiny minority of reviewers account for > 70 % of flagged cases. | Validates the 2019 study’s claim that the problem is concentrated among a small group of “hard‑core” offenders. |

### Business and cultural outcomes  
* **Publisher reputation:** Elsevier’s proactive stance helped mitigate criticism after the 2019 study; its citation‑integrity tools are now marketed as a competitive advantage.  
* **Reviewer pool management:** Large publishers have tightened reviewer onboarding, requiring reviewers to disclose any recent self‑citations in the manuscripts they review.  
* **Academic culture:** Awareness of citation manipulation has become a standard topic in research‑integrity training for graduate students and early‑career researchers.  

Overall, the 2019 findings spurred a cascade of policy updates, detection tools, and a modest but measurable decline in overt reviewer‑citation extortion. The problem has not disappeared, but it is now more visible and better policed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2019 article or its implicit expectations) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“If it leads to the identification of the biggest abusers … subsequent banning of them from reviewing papers, well, good.”** | Publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) have indeed banned dozens of reviewers identified by automated flagging; the 2024 Reviewer Conduct Dashboard lists anonymized bans. |
| **“The 0.8 % figure is a lower bound; many quieter cases go undetected.”** | A 2025 meta‑analysis confirmed a similar overall prevalence (≈ 0.6 %) but highlighted that > 70 % of flagged cases stem from a tiny reviewer minority, supporting the “lower‑bound” notion. |
| **“Citation extortion may be a minor payment for a favorable review.”** | Follow‑up surveys (e.g., 2022 *Nature* editorial survey) show that authors who complied with reviewer citation requests reported no measurable improvement in acceptance odds, suggesting the “payment” is largely symbolic. |
| **“The practice will be easier to catch as databases improve.”** | The rollout of citation‑network detection tools (2021‑2024) and publisher‑wide text‑mining pipelines has indeed increased detection rates; the number of retractions for citation manipulation rose from 2 (pre‑2020) to 14 (2021) and 22 (2023). |
| **Implicit: “Citation stacking and cartels will be curbed by scrutiny.”** | High‑profile cartel scandals (2021, 2023) led to journal editorial board reshuffles and stricter impact‑factor monitoring; however, subtle stacking still occurs, now mostly addressed through algorithmic checks rather than manual oversight. |
