# Like Moving Furniture Across a Tightrope (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a first-person commentary reflecting on the author's negative experiences with long, multi-step natural product synthesis during graduate school and contrasting this with more practical large-scale synthesis in the drug industry. The author describes the arduous nature of lengthy academic synthetic sequences (mentioning his own 27-step attempt that was still six steps short), the diminishing material yields at each step, and the analytical challenges of characterizing tiny amounts of intermediates. He shares a specific anecdote about struggling to obtain an optical rotation measurement on a late-stage intermediate, ending up with a questionable reading that he nonetheless included in his dissertation. The piece uses this personal experience to express relief at having left academic natural product synthesis behind while acknowledging that industrial drug development still requires large-scale work for legitimate purposes like toxicity testing.

## 2. HISTORY

In the two decades since this article was published, several significant shifts have occurred in pharmaceutical synthesis and development:

**Industrial Practices:** The pharmaceutical industry has increasingly moved away from traditional multi-step linear synthesis toward more efficient approaches. Process chemistry has heavily adopted convergent synthesis strategies, continuous flow chemistry, and enzymatic/biological routes that reduce step count and improve overall yields. Many companies have invested in automation and high-throughput experimentation to accelerate route scouting and optimization, directly addressing the pain points the author described.

**Drug Development Efficiency:** The average time from discovery to FDA approval has remained lengthy (10-12 years), but there have been notable advances. The rise of biologics, antibody-drug conjugates, and gene therapies has shifted some focus away from purely synthetic small molecules, though small molecules still dominate the market. The industry has seen increased use of computer-aided drug design and AI-driven synthesis planning to reduce synthetic challenges upfront.

**Academic Synthesis Evolution:** Academic natural product synthesis has continued but with greater emphasis on efficiency and practical applications. Many research groups now focus on developing new synthetic methodologies that streamline complex syntheses, and there's been growing collaboration between academic and industrial labs to accelerate translation of discoveries.

**Clinical Outcomes:** Many drugs entering development around 2005 faced typical attrition rates (approximately 90% failure from Phase 1 to approval), but major therapeutic areas like oncology and rare diseases have seen increased success rates with targeted therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains retrospective reflection rather than forward-looking predictions. The author expresses personal relief at leaving academic synthesis behind but doesn't make explicit predictions about industry trends or technological developments. The piece is more focused on contrasting past academic experiences with current industrial practice circa 2005, serving as commentary rather than forecasting.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This is a moderately interesting personal reflection that captures the frustrations many synthetic chemists experienced in academic settings, but it lacks broader industry analysis or predictive insights that would make it more valuable from a historical perspective.
