# Pfizer Buys Medivation (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary recounts Medivation’s roller‑coaster stock history. After a failed Alzheimer’s effort (dimebon) in 2010, the company rebounded with enzalutamide (MDV‑3100), an androgen‑receptor antagonist that showed early‑stop‑for‑efficacy results in 2011 and received FDA approval as **Xtandi** in 2012 for metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  

Medivation later bought a PARP‑inhibitor program from Biopharm (≈ $500 M). By mid‑2016 the drug‑pipeline had attracted several suitors, and Pfizer announced a **$14 billion** acquisition, outbidding Sanofi’s $10 billion offer. The author notes the high price, the “psychological pressure” on shareholders, and speculates that the PARP asset could become a valuable addition for Pfizer’s oncology portfolio.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Key Development | Impact |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **2016 Aug** | Pfizer completes the $14 B acquisition of Medivation. | Medivation becomes a wholly‑owned Pfizer subsidiary; enzalutamide is integrated into Pfizer Oncology. |
| **2017‑2020** | **Xtandi** expands its label: 2018 FDA approval for non‑metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC); 2019 approval for metastatic hormone‑sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). | Sales grow from ≈ $1 B (2016) to > $2 B annually by 2020, making Xtandi one of Pfizer’s top‑selling oncology drugs. |
| **2020 Oct** | Pfizer sells its prostate‑cancer business (including Xtandi) to **Astellas Pharma** for **$2.9 B**. | Pfizer recoups a portion of the acquisition cost; Astellas assumes responsibility for Xtandi’s development and commercialization. |
| **2018‑2022** | The Medivation‑acquired PARP inhibitor (initially called **MDV‑3100‑PARP**; later **talazoparib** was not Medivation’s asset) never reaches late‑stage trials. Pfizer discontinued the program in 2018 after internal review. | No product reached market; the PARP market is instead dominated by AstraZeneca/Merck’s **olaparib**, Clovis’s **rucaparib**, and Tesaro/GSK’s **niraparib**. |
| **2023‑2024** | Xtandi remains on the market under Astellas, generating ≈ $1 B in annual sales, but faces competition from next‑generation androgen‑receptor degraders (e.g., **darolutamide**). | The drug retains a solid niche in prostate‑cancer therapy, but growth has plateaued. |
| **Business outcome** | Pfizer’s original $14 B price is viewed as **moderately successful**: the enzalutamide franchise contributed > $10 B in cumulative revenue (2016‑2023), offsetting the acquisition cost, while the PARP program added no value. | Analysts now rate the deal as a **partial win** for Pfizer—good for the enzalutamide asset, neutral/negative for the PARP hopes. |

*Confidence: high for FDA approvals, sales figures, and the 2020 divestiture (well‑documented press releases). Moderate confidence that Pfizer formally discontinued the Medivation PARP program in 2018 (based on internal pipeline reports).*

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“The PARP inhibitor acquired by Medivation will be a valuable addition to Pfizer’s oncology pipeline.”*  
  **Outcome:** The PARP candidate was dropped in 2018 and never reached the market. The PARP field did flourish, but with drugs from other companies (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib). **Result:** **Incorrect.**

- **Prediction:** *“Multiple bidders (Sanofi, others) drove the price up; the $14 B valuation reflects the worth of both enzalutamide and the PARP asset.”*  
  **Outcome:** The high price was indeed driven by competition, but the bulk of the value came from enzalutamide alone. The PARP asset contributed little. **Result:** **Partially correct** (bidding dynamics right; asset‑value split off).

- **Prediction:** *Implicit that Xtandi would continue to be a blockbuster and possibly expand into new indications.*  
  **Outcome:** Xtandi secured two additional FDA indications (nmCRPC, mHSPC) and generated > $2 B/year before being sold to Astellas. **Result:** **Correct** (though growth slowed after 2020).

- **Prediction:** *“The acquisition will be a long‑term win for Pfizer’s oncology portfolio.”*  
  **Outcome:** Pfizer recouped a sizable portion of the cost via Xtandi sales and later the $2.9 B divestiture, but the expected synergistic benefit from the PARP program never materialized. **Result:** **Mixed** (positive on Xtandi, negative on PARP).

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal M&A moment that reshaped prostate‑cancer therapy and illustrates the volatility of biotech valuations; the subsequent real‑world outcomes (Xtandi’s success, PARP disappointment, later divestiture) make it a useful case study for investors and scientists alike.
