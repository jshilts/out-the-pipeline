# NIH Taking on More Risk? (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses NIH Director Francis Collins's proposal to increase funding for individual researchers rather than specific research proposals, inspired by the success of the Pioneer awards program. At the time, NIH spent less than 5% of its $30 billion budget on individual researcher grants, with the Pioneer awards providing $500,000 annually for five years to seven researchers - contrasting sharply with the predominant R01 grants that awarded $250,000 per year for 3-5 years but required extensive preliminary data.

The piece points to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) funding model as a potential template, where grants are awarded more toward the principal investigator than the stated projects. However, the article highlights critical concerns about evaluation metrics - while Pioneer awardees published more highly-cited papers, critics like MIT economist Pierre Azoulay questioned whether this reflected the impact of longer funding windows rather than the "people versus projects" approach. Daniel Sarewitz raised concerns that increased publications might not translate to actual health outcomes or clinical translation. The author endorses the concept of funding high-risk, high-reward research with low probability of success but potentially transformative impact if successful.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2013 article, NIH did expand its commitment to high-risk, high-reward research through several concrete initiatives. The NIH Common Fund's High-Risk, High-Reward Research Program grew significantly, encompassing not just Pioneer Awards but also New Innovator Awards, Transformative Research Awards, and Early Independence Awards. By 2016-2018, these programs collectively represented over $200 million in annual funding, though this remained a small fraction of NIH's total budget.

The evaluation methodology evolved somewhat - NIH began tracking not just citation metrics but also downstream translation outcomes, though the balance between people-focused and project-focused funding remained contentious. Some Pioneer awardees did achieve notable breakthroughs; for example, Jennifer Doudna (a 2006 Pioneer awardee) went on to develop CRISPR technology, though this preceded the 2013 period. However, tracking direct causal links between these specific funding mechanisms and clinical translation proved challenging.

The R01 grant system, despite calls for reform, remained NIH's backbone funding mechanism. By 2019-2020, NIH's overall budget had grown to approximately $40 billion, but the percentage allocated to high-risk, high-reward mechanisms remained in the single digits. The debate continued about optimal metrics - whether publication impact, clinical translation, or other measures should guide funding allocation. 

No major policy changes comparable to a wholesale shift toward HHMI-style funding occurred during this period, though incremental adjustments continued. The fundamental tension between accountability for taxpayer funds and support for potentially transformative but uncertain research persisted through subsequent NIH administrations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **NIH would move toward more HHMI-style "people versus projects" funding**: This change occurred only incrementally. NIH expanded high-risk programs but did not fundamentally restructure its funding philosophy away from project-based grants toward the degree envisioned.

• **R01 grants would remain dominant but some rebalancing would occur**: Accurate - R01s remained the backbone of NIH funding, but modest expansion of investigator-focused programs did occur within the high-risk, high-reward portfolio.

• **Publication metrics might not correlate with actual health outcomes**: Supported by subsequent research on research impact, which continued to show that traditional bibliometric measures don't reliably predict clinical translation or public health impact.

• **Sorting through high-risk applications would be "painful"**: Likely accurate given the growth in applications to programs like the New Innovator Awards, which saw application numbers rise substantially, creating significant review burdens.

• **Funding ideas with "low chance of working but big news if successful" would be valuable**: Partially validated by specific breakthrough examples, though systematic evaluation of this approach's overall effectiveness remained challenging.

• **"Freedom with an expiration date" might limit innovation compared to HHMI's longer windows**: The data remained mixed - some Pioneer awardees produced transformative work, but the optimal duration and conditions for high-risk funding continued to be debated.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

The article addresses a persistently relevant tension in research funding between supporting innovative, high-risk science and ensuring accountability and impact from public investment. The core policy questions it raised remain unresolved and actively debated.
