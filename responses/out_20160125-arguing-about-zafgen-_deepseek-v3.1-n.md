# Arguing About Zafgen's Chances (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary from January 2016 discusses Zafgen, a biotech company whose weight-loss drug beloranib was showing promise for treating Prader-Willi syndrome but faced major safety concerns. The article was prompted by a negative report from hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital, which was shorting Zafgen's stock. Zafgen had recently reported that two patients died during clinical trials of beloranib, creating significant safety concerns, yet the company's stock had paradoxically risen because the drug appeared efficacious for weight loss in Prader-Willi patients. The author notes the compound was "really interesting" with potential applications beyond Prader-Willi syndrome, but emphasizes that the patient deaths created major regulatory hurdles for FDA approval. The author expresses pessimism about beloranib's prospects and the stock's valuation, stating that until safety issues were resolved, the drug's future—including potential expansion into broader patient populations—remained highly uncertain.

## 2. HISTORY

**Beloranib's clinical trajectory and Zafgen's subsequent fate:**

In January 2016, Zafgen was reeling from two patient deaths in its Phase 3 trial of beloranib for Prader-Willi syndrome, though the drug had demonstrated weight-loss efficacy. Despite the safety crisis, the stock had risen on the efficacy data, prompting Kerrisdale Capital's short attack arguing the safety issues would prevent approval.

**What actually happened:**

- **October 2016: Zafgen terminated the beloranib program** following FDA feedback that additional clinical trials would be required due to the thrombotic (blood clot) safety signal. The company halted all development of the drug.

- **December 2016: Zafgen pivoted to a new drug candidate**, ZGN-1061, a second-generation MetAP2 inhibitor with what the company claimed would be better safety properties than beloranib.

- **The company struggled financially and operationally** following the beloranib failure, conducting layoffs and restructuring.

- **November 2019: Zafgen merged with Therachon**, a rare disease company, in an all-stock deal, effectively ending Zafgen as an independent entity focused on MetAP2 inhibitors.

- **The beloranib "class" of drugs never achieved commercial success**—no MetAP2 inhibitor has received FDA approval for any indication as of this writing. The mechanism, while interesting scientifically, proved too dangerous for clinical use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Article's concern about FDA approval odds**: The author predicted that patient deaths would "lengthen the odds of FDA approval very much." → **ACCURATE**. The FDA ultimately required additional trials that Zafgen could not complete, leading to program termination in October 2016—exactly 9 months after this article.

- **Concern about inability to identify at-risk patients**: The author questioned whether Zafgen could figure out if deaths were drug-related and identify high-risk patients. → **ACCURATE**. Zafgen never resolved the safety mechanism sufficiently to satisfy regulators, leading to abandonment of the entire platform.

- **Doubt about expansion potential**: The author noted that moving "past Prader-Willi patients and into a wider patient population" depended on safety, which was "very much up for debate." → **ACCURATE**. The drug never progressed beyond the initial indication, let alone expanded to broader obesity treatment markets.

- **Kerrisdale Capital's negative assessment**: The short-seller argued that safety problems "completely wipe out" the weight-loss benefits. → **ACCURATE**. This is exactly what happened—regulatory concern over thrombotic events (the safety signal) prevented approval despite demonstrated efficacy.

- **Author's general pessimism**: The author expressed pessimism "until there's more clarity on those patient deaths." → **ACCURATE**. Clarity never emerged in a way that satisfied regulators, and the program was abandoned.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article was prescient in capturing a pivotal moment where clinical safety signals—properly identified through clinical trial vigilance—prevented what could have been a dangerous drug approval, while also foreshadowing the company's eventual failure. It illustrates the critical importance of safety in drug development and shows how market optimism about efficacy data can blind investors to fundamental regulatory realities. The case study of Zafgen and beloranib represents a textbook example of why safety signals cannot be ignored, regardless of efficacy, making it highly relevant for understanding biotech risk assessment.
