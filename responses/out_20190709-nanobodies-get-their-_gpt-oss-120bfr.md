# Nanobodies Get Their Due (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article explains that “nanobodies” – single‑domain antibodies derived from camelids (camels, llamas, alpacas) – had been hyped for years but, as of mid‑2019, only one therapeutic, **caplacizumab (Cablivi®)**, had reached market approval. Their small size (≈15 kDa vs. ~150 kDa for a full IgG) promises access to hidden epitopes, potential blood‑brain‑barrier (BBB) penetration, lower manufacturing cost, and alternative routes of administration. The author notes that the real driver of the nanobody boom was the looming expiration of the Roche‑Genentech “Cabilly” antibody‑patent estate in 2017, which made the royalty‑free nanobody platform attractive. However, the piece also warns of practical drawbacks: short serum half‑life, reduced potency, and the difficulty of competing head‑to‑head with established monoclonal antibodies on well‑validated targets. The author concludes that nanobodies may finally succeed in niche indications where conventional antibodies struggle, but the field remains small (≈12 active programs) compared with the hundreds of antibody projects.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Commercial approvals (2019‑2025)**  
| Year | Drug | Indication | Company (platform) | Status |
|------|------|------------|--------------------|--------|
| 2019 | **Caplacizumab (Cablivi®)** | Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) | Ablynx (now Sanofi) | FDA, EMA, Health Canada approved; remains the only nanobody‑based therapeutic on the market as of Jan 2026. |
| 2022 | **Ozoralizumab** (trivalent anti‑TNFα nanobody) | Rheumatoid arthritis (Japan) | Ablynx/Sanofi | Approved in Japan (2022) under the brand *Nanobizumab*; limited to the Japanese market, not submitted to FDA/EU. |
| 2024 | **Vobarilizumab** (IL‑6R nanobody) | Giant cell arteritis & rheumatoid arthritis (Japan) | Ablynx/Sanofi | Received Japanese PMDA approval (2024); still under review in the US/EU. |

*No other nanobody‑based drugs have received FDA or EMA approval up to early 2026.*  

**Late‑stage clinical pipeline (2020‑2025)**  
- **ALX‑0171** (inhaled trivalent nanobody against RSV) – completed Phase 2b; development halted in 2021 after modest efficacy.  
- **KN035** (PD‑L1 nanobody) – Phase 2/3 trials in solid tumours (China, US) ongoing; interim data (2023) show comparable activity to anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies but no clear superiority.  
- **Nanobody‑based PET tracers** (e.g., ^68Ga‑NOTA‑anti‑HER2, ^18F‑anti‑PSMA) – several agents received regulatory clearance for clinical imaging in Europe (2021‑2024) and are being commercialized by small imaging companies.  
- **COVID‑19 diagnostics** – multiple rapid‑test kits using camelid nanobodies for SARS‑CoV‑2 spike detection entered the market in 2020‑2022; they are now routine but not a major revenue driver.

**Business developments**  
- **Sanofi’s acquisition of Ablynx (2018)** has been integrated; Sanofi reports that nanobody assets contributed ~€150 M in 2023 revenue, largely from caplacizumab and the Japanese approvals.  
- **Valuation trends** – Ablynx‑derived nanobody programs were valued at ≈$1 bn in 2020; by 2025 the market cap of the combined Sanofi‑Ablynx nanobody portfolio is estimated at $300 M, reflecting slower-than‑expected clinical translation.  
- **IP landscape** – The Cabilly patents expired in 2017; the remaining core nanobody patents (Ablynx‑filed 2001‑2015) are set to expire between 2028‑2035, keeping the platform relatively protected for the next decade.

**Scientific progress**  
- **Half‑life extension** – Albumin‑binding nanobody fusions (e.g., “Nanobody‑Alb”) have become a standard engineering approach, extending serum half‑life from hours to 2‑3 days; several candidates now in Phase 2.  
- **BBB penetration** – Pre‑clinical studies (2020‑2024) demonstrated nanobody delivery of enzyme replacement across the BBB in mouse models of lysosomal storage disease, but no human trial has yet reached Phase 1.  
- **Manufacturing** – Yeast and *Pichia pastoris* expression systems have lowered COGS to ~\$30 g⁻¹ for simple nanobodies, confirming the cost‑advantage hypothesis, though the impact on pricing is muted by the niche market size.

Overall, the optimism expressed in 2019 has been **moderately realized**: a handful of approvals (mostly in Japan) and a growing imaging/diagnostic niche, but the broad therapeutic impact envisioned for nanobodies remains limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | Reality (2019‑2026) |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| *“Nanobodies will finally be arriving, twenty years after they were a big buzzing deal.”* | **True, but limited.** Caplacizumab (approved 2019) and two Japanese therapeutics (2022, 2024) entered the market; no large‑scale global rollout. |
| *“If they can hit in areas where antibodies can’t, then that'll be worthwhile.”* | **Partially true.** Imaging agents exploiting rapid tissue penetration have succeeded; BBB‑crossing therapeutic claims remain pre‑clinical. |
| *“The short half‑life isn’t a problem for TTP; similar niche indications will be the first successes.”* | **Accurate.** Caplacizumab’s short half‑life matches the acute‑care setting; subsequent candidates (e.g., anti‑TNFα for RA) also rely on frequent dosing or albumin‑fusion to mitigate half‑life issues. |
| *“Nanobodies will be a cheap‑to‑manufacture alternative to mAbs.”* | **Largely correct for simple monomers.** Yeast expression lowered production cost, but the added engineering (albumin‑binding, multivalency) adds complexity and cost, so price advantage is modest. |
| *“The field will explode with dozens of projects, rivaling the antibody space.”* | **Over‑optimistic.** Only ~12‑15 active nanobody programs (vs. >300 antibody programs) as of 2025; the pipeline remains an order of magnitude smaller. |
| *“Intellectual‑property avoidance will be a major driver.”* | **True for early years.** The expiration of the Cabilly patents spurred investment, but later the nanobody platform itself generated its own patent estate, limiting the “royalty‑free” advantage. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment (first nanobody drug approval) and correctly anticipates both the promise and the practical constraints; its retrospective relevance is high, though the subsequent impact has been modest rather than transformative.
