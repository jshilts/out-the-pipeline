# Not On My Street - I Hope (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the case of an Escondido, California man who operated a large-scale explosives manufacturing operation in his home, producing kilogram quantities of highly dangerous explosives including PETN and HMTD. The situation became so hazardous that local law enforcement abandoned their search of the property, deeming it too dangerous to continue investigating. The man's criminal background included bank robbery as his "day job." Authorities decided the safest option was to build a sixteen-foot fire-resistant wall around the house and burn it down rather than risk sending personnel inside to search through drawers and containers.

## 2. HISTORY

The Escondido incident involved George Djura Jakubec, who was eventually arrested and charged with multiple federal crimes. Jakubec, a Serbian immigrant, had indeed constructed an extensive home laboratory capable of producing significant quantities of explosives. When authorities finally gained access after the controlled burn, they discovered approximately 100 explosive devices and materials for making more. 

Jakubec pleaded guilty in 2011 to federal charges including possession of unregistered destructive devices, bank robbery, and other explosives-related offenses. He was sentenced to 13 years and 9 months in federal prison. The controlled burn of his home took place safely without injury to surrounding properties. The case highlighted gaps in monitoring the purchase and possession of precursor chemicals that can be used to manufacture explosives. However, no major policy changes resulted from this specific incident, and similar cases of individuals stockpiling explosives or manufacturing them illegally have continued to occur periodically across the United States.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not contain explicit predictions about future events or developments - it was primarily a commentary on a current news event rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 2**

While the article deals with a dramatic and dangerous situation involving homemade explosives, the incident, while serious, had limited broader implications for science policy, biotechnology, or public safety regulations. It represents a criminal case rather than developments in scientific research or industrial practices.
