# What If the Journal Disappears? (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post highlighted a concerning incident where an online-only journal called "Journal of Advances in Developmental Research" ceased publishing and apparently deleted its entire website and archives. The author characterized this as a predatory "bottom-of-the-barrel" publishing venue that accepted papers across virtually any field as long as payment was received. The central question raised was what happens to the research record when such digital-only journals disappear, particularly if any worthwhile papers become permanently inaccessible. The post referenced Jeffrey Beall's criteria for predatory publishers, noting that lack of digital preservation policies was a key warning sign, and observed that "wipe the hard drive" seemed to be this journal's de facto preservation strategy.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2013 article, the issues it raised evolved significantly:

**Predatory Publishing Growth and Response**: The problem of predatory journals expanded dramatically from 2013-2023. Jeffrey Beall's list of predatory publishers (referenced in the article) grew exponentially before he took it down in 2017 due to pressure and legal threats. However, this spurred more systematic responses: the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) strengthened its vetting criteria significantly by 2014-2016, Cabell's launched a predatory journal blacklist in 2017, and institutions like ThinkCheckSubmit emerged to help researchers identify legitimate journals.

**Digital Preservation Infrastructure Development**: Major digital preservation initiatives expanded: PubMed Central (launched 2000) became mandatory for NIH-funded research; CLOCKSS (Controlled LOCKSS) and Portico grew substantially; and CrossRef's multi-publisher preservation efforts strengthened. The Keepers Registry was launched to track which journals are preserved by which services.

**Real-World Impact**: Multiple documented cases emerged where journals disappeared without preservation, including legitimate journals that failed and predatory ones that intentionally vanished. This particularly affected researchers from developing countries who had unknowingly published in predatory venues. Numerous academic fraud cases involved paper mills that published in journals that subsequently disappeared, making investigation difficult.

**Policy Changes**: By the mid-2010s, many funding agencies and universities mandated deposition in institutional repositories regardless of where papers were published. Plan S (launched 2018) further emphasized sustainable open access infrastructure and preservation requirements for compliant journals.

**Business Failures**: Even legitimate publishers faced challenges - in 2020, Springer briefly threatened to shut down entire journal portfolios during contract disputes, highlighting ongoing fragility. However, robust preservation infrastructure for established publishers generally prevented actual content loss.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article made no explicit predictions, instead framing itself as raising questions about an emerging problem. The implicit concern was that this pattern might continue and worsen as online-only publishing expanded - a concern that proved valid.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article identified a real and growing problem in scholarly communication infrastructure, though it focused on low-quality predatory journals rather than the more concerning cases where legitimate journals disappear. The digital preservation issue it highlighted genuinely worsened over the subsequent decade and required institutional responses.
