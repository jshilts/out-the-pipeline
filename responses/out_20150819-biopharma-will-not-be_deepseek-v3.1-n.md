# Biopharma Will Not Be Dull As Long As Martin Shkreli's Around (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Martin Shkreli's controversial activities in the biopharmaceutical industry. At the time of writing, Retrophin had just filed a $65 million lawsuit against its former CEO Shkreli, alleging financial improprieties including using the company as a "personal piggy bank" and failing to disclose a disastrous investment in Orexigen. Shkreli had been ousted from Retrophin and formed a new company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, which appeared to follow the same business model of acquiring obscure drugs and dramatically increasing their prices. The article also mentions Shkreli's proposal through Turing to pay drug inventors direct royalties, which the author notes could have unintended consequences for scientific collaboration. The piece references Shkreli's active social media presence and his tendency to generate controversy and legal challenges.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent events dramatically exceeded the scope anticipated in this 2015 article:

**Legal and Regulatory Outcomes:**
- In December 2015 (just months after this article), Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine) and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill, triggering a national outcry and congressional investigations.
- In December 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI on securities fraud charges related to his time at Retrophin and his hedge fund MSMB Capital Management.
- In August 2017, Shkreli was found guilty on three counts of securities fraud.
- In March 2018, he was sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to forfeit $7.4 million.
- In January 2022, Shkreli was released from prison and placed on supervised release.
- In February 2022, he was banned from the pharmaceutical industry for life by a federal judge.

**Drug Pricing Impact:**
- The Daraprim price hike became emblematic of pharmaceutical pricing abuses and contributed to sustained public and political pressure on drug pricing reform.
- The controversy fueled legislative efforts including drug price negotiation provisions that eventually became part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

**Company Outcomes:**
- Retrophin continued operations after Shkreli's departure, eventually changing its name to Travere Therapeutics in 2020.
- Turing Pharmaceuticals faced intense public backlash; the company's reputation never recovered from the scandal.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Article predictions vs. actual outcomes:**

• **"Things won't be dull" with Shkreli around**: **Accurate**. The subsequent Daraprim price hike, congressional testimony, criminal conviction, and lifetime industry ban exceeded even the article's expectation of continued controversy.

• **Legal troubles would continue**: **Accurate**. The article anticipated more court drama; however, the scale was underestimated. Rather than just civil litigation with Retrophin, Shkreli faced federal criminal prosecution and substantial prison time.

• **Turing's business model would follow Retrophin's pattern**: **Accurate**. Turing indeed pursued the obscure-drug acquisition and price-hike strategy, though the Daraprim case became far more notorious than anything at Retrophin.

• **Royalty payment system for inventors might backfire**: **Too early to evaluate**. This prediction about unintended consequences of direct inventor compensation never got properly tested, as Turing's main notoriety came from pricing rather than R&D compensation models.

• **"May be infuriating, or incomprehensible, or land everyone in court again"**: **Accurate on all counts**. The Daraprim episode was indeed infuriating to the public, legally incomprehensible in its brazenness, and did result in extensive litigation—both civil and criminal.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 8/10**

This article captured a critical moment in pharmaceutical industry ethics at the start of what became one of the most notorious healthcare scandals of the decade. Written just before the Daraprim price hike that would define Shkreli's public persona, it demonstrated prescient awareness of the business practices and legal vulnerabilities that would soon explode into national consciousness. The piece serves as valuable historical documentation of early warning signs in what became a landmark case study in pharmaceutical regulation, white-collar crime, and drug pricing reform.
