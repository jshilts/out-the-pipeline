# Merck Pulls One Out (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Merck's anticoagulant drug vorapaxar, a thrombin antagonist that had faced significant clinical challenges and doubts about its viability. The drug had just received a positive FDA advisory committee vote, which was notable given its troubled development history. The author mentions having followed this compound for years and expresses surprise that Merck managed to overcome the obstacles. Vorapaxar was positioned for treating patients who had already experienced a cardiac event, targeting a substantial market segment. The piece reflects the inherent difficulties in developing anticoagulants and expresses cautious optimism about the drug's potential approval and market prospects. The author notes that Merck had to navigate the delicate balance between efficacy and bleeding risks, a common challenge in this therapeutic area.

## 2. HISTORY

Vorapaxar (brand name Zontivity) was approved by the FDA in May 2014, a few months after the advisory committee vote, for reducing thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of heart attack or peripheral artery disease.

However, the drug struggled significantly in the post-approval period:

**Clinical Impact**: While approved, vorapaxar faced serious challenges. The FDA approval came with a black box warning about significant bleeding risks, including potentially fatal bleeding. It was specifically contraindicated for patients with prior stroke, TIA, or intracranial hemorrhage, significantly limiting its patient population.

**Market Performance**: Zontivity had disappointing commercial uptake. Despite the large potential market mentioned in the article, prescribing rates remained low due to concerns about the bleeding risk and the narrow approved indications.

**Business Outcome**: The drug failed to meet commercial expectations and generated only modest revenue for Merck - in the low hundreds of millions annually rather than the blockbuster numbers initially hoped for. In 2020, Merck sold the rights to vorapaxar to Aralez Pharmaceuticals, which later discontinued the product. The drug was ultimately withdrawn from the market, representing a disappointing outcome despite the initial optimism following the positive regulatory vote.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"what sort of market it can carve out"** - The author predicted potential market activity, noting the "good-sized market" for secondary prevention after cardiac events.

*Outcome*: While approved, vorapaxar captured only a small fraction of this potential market due to safety concerns and limited prescribing, ultimately failing commercially and being discontinued.

• **Implied market success** - While not explicitly stated, the article's tone suggested the drug might succeed given FDA approval.

*Outcome*: Despite regulatory approval, the drug had poor real-world adoption and was eventually removed from the market, representing a commercial failure.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article exemplifies the important lesson that FDA approval alone doesn't guarantee clinical or commercial success, especially for high-risk anticoagulants. It captures a moment of regulatory optimism that ultimately proved misleading about the drug's real-world prospects.
