# “Why Are You Forcing My Son to Take Chemistry?” (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is Derek Lowe’s commentary on a Washington Post blog post in which a father complains that his 15‑year‑old son, who shows no interest in science, is being required to take a year of high‑school chemistry. Lowe acknowledges the father’s point that a single chemistry class will not make the boy a scientist, but he argues that the objection could be made about any elective. He asks how much scientific knowledge is truly necessary for a non‑scientist and suggests that the most valuable outcome of a chemistry class is not the factual list (periodic table, Lewis structures, acid–base balances) but the habit of experimental thinking—isolating variables, forming hypotheses, and interpreting data. Lowe doubts that a full year of chemistry is needed to acquire those habits and worries that a lack of basic scientific literacy can leave people vulnerable to “science‑by‑authority” arguments in everyday life.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Curriculum reforms** – In the years following 2012 the United States adopted the *Next Generation Science Standards* (NGSS, 2013). NGSS emphasizes “science practices” (e.g., modeling, data analysis, argumentation) over rote memorization, echoing Lowe’s call for experimental habits of mind. Many districts have re‑structured middle‑ and high‑school science into integrated “three‑year” sequences (e.g., Earth‑Space‑Life‑Physical) rather than separate year‑long chemistry, physics, and biology courses.  

**Requirement persistence** – Despite the reforms, chemistry remains a graduation requirement in the majority of states (≈ 70 % as of 2023). Some states (e.g., California, Texas) have allowed “alternative pathways” such as AP Environmental Science or a “conceptual chemistry” track that focuses on applications rather than detailed stoichiometry. The overall enrollment in high‑school chemistry has been stable (≈ 3 million students per year) with a modest decline in the proportion of students taking the AP Chemistry exam (from 71 % of AP science takers in 2012 to 58 % in 2022).  

**Scientific literacy outcomes** – Large‑scale assessments (NAEP Science 2019, 2022) show modest gains in “science practices” but persistent gaps in content knowledge, especially in chemistry concepts such as mole calculations and acid–base equilibria. Studies published after 2015 (e.g., National Academies 2020 report *Science for All*) conclude that a basic chemistry foundation improves health‑related decision‑making (e.g., understanding nutrition labels, medication interactions).  

**Policy and public discourse** – The COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2022) amplified calls for broader scientific literacy. Several state education boards introduced “critical thinking” modules that draw on chemistry (e.g., vaccine storage, disinfectant chemistry) but did not eliminate the chemistry requirement. No major legislation has been passed that exempts non‑STEM students from chemistry altogether.  

**Industry and workforce** – The biotech and pharmaceutical sectors have continued to expand (global market > $1.5 trillion in 2025). Entry‑level positions still list “basic chemistry” as a preferred skill, but many roles (e.g., data analysis, regulatory affairs) rely more on quantitative reasoning than on detailed chemical knowledge. Apprenticeship and “boot‑camp” programs for non‑scientists often include a short “science fundamentals” module rather than a full year of chemistry.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not contain explicit, numbered predictions, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Many students will not need a full year of chemistry to acquire scientific habits of mind.** | NGSS‑based curricula have indeed shifted many districts toward integrated, practice‑focused science sequences, reducing the emphasis on a stand‑alone chemistry year for non‑STEM tracks. |
| **A lack of basic chemistry knowledge can make people vulnerable to pseudoscientific claims.** | Post‑COVID surveys (e.g., Pew Research 2021) show that individuals with higher high‑school science scores are less likely to endorse misinformation about vaccines and climate change, supporting the concern. |
| **Chemistry may be an unnecessary burden for students who will never use it professionally.** | Enrollment data show a modest decline in AP Chemistry participation, and several states now allow alternative science pathways, indicating that the burden argument has gained some policy traction. |
| **Science education should prioritize experimental reasoning over factual recall.** | NGSS and subsequent state standards explicitly prioritize scientific practices; teacher professional‑development programs (e.g., NSF’s *Science Learning Centers*) have adopted this focus. |

Overall, the article’s intuition about the need for a more practice‑oriented science education has been borne out, while the specific suggestion that chemistry could be dropped entirely for most students has not been realized at the national level.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The commentary touches on a perennial education debate and anticipates curriculum reforms that later became mainstream (NGSS). Its relevance to scientific literacy and policy makes it moderately high‑interest, though it does not present novel data or a breakthrough argument.
