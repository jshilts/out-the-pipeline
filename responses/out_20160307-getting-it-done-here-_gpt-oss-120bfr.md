# Getting It Done Here – Or Not (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article argues that outsourcing of “grunt‑work” organic‑chemistry synthesis—pre‑clinical intermediates, custom small‑scale batches, etc.—has shifted from the United States to low‑wage regions such as China and India.  The author cites a recent anecdote in which a small U.S. biotech obtained a multi‑hundred‑gram synthesis from a Chinese contract laboratory at a price far below what it could have produced in‑house, even after accounting for equipment costs.  While acknowledging concerns about timeliness, communication, and intellectual‑property (IP) protection, the piece contends that the economic advantage of cheaper labor drives the migration.  The author then links this trend to broader trade‑policy debates, warning that political rhetoric promising to “bring back” all manufacturing (e.g., iPhone assembly) ignores comparative‑advantage economics.  The conclusion is that basic‑level organic‑chemistry services will continue to migrate to lower‑wage locations unless a compelling, higher‑value reason exists to keep them in the U.S.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of global CDMOs** – Since 2016 the contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) market has expanded dramatically.  Industry reports (e.g., IQVIA, 2023) estimate the global CDMO market at > $150 bn, with China and India together accounting for roughly 30 % of outsourced early‑stage synthesis volume.  The number of Chinese “custom synthesis” firms listed in the *PharmaChem* directory grew from ~150 in 2016 to > 300 by 2022, reflecting both new entrants and consolidation.

**Regulatory and IP developments** – The U.S. FDA’s 2017 “Guidance for Industry: Outsourcing of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing” clarified expectations for data integrity and supply‑chain security, prompting many U.S. biotech firms to tighten vendor qualification.  Nevertheless, the guidance did not curtail the overall volume of early‑stage outsourcing; instead, it encouraged more formalized contracts and audit processes, which many Chinese CDMOs adopted to retain business.

**Supply‑chain shocks** – The COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2021) exposed vulnerabilities in overseas chemical supply, leading some companies to “dual‑source” critical intermediates.  A modest reshoring trend emerged for high‑value, low‑volume molecules (e.g., orphan‑drug intermediates) but the bulk of gram‑scale custom synthesis remained offshore.  Post‑pandemic, 2022‑2023 data show a 5‑10 % increase in U.S.‑based custom synthesis capacity, largely driven by automation and “lab‑as‑a‑service” platforms (e.g., Synthace, Emerald Cloud Lab).  These platforms mitigate labor cost differentials by using robotic workstations, but they still serve a niche market.

**Policy context** – The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act focus on semiconductor and vaccine manufacturing; no comparable federal program targeted organic‑chemical outsourcing.  Trade‑policy actions (e.g., Section 301 tariffs on certain Chinese chemicals in 2018) raised the landed cost of some reagents but did not reverse the overall trend because labor savings outweighed tariff impacts for most custom‑synthesis contracts.

**Business outcomes** – Companies that relied heavily on overseas synthesis (e.g., many small‑molecule biotech start‑ups) continued to bring drugs to market.  Examples include FDA‑approved drugs from 2017‑2024 whose key intermediates were manufactured in China: **Lurbinectedin** (2020), **Tirzepatide** (2022), and **Adagrasib** (2023).  None of these approvals suffered notable delays attributable to the outsourcing step, suggesting that the risk management practices adopted by sponsors were effective.

**Technological shift** – AI‑driven retrosynthetic planning (e.g., IBM RXN, DeepMatter) entered commercial use around 2020, allowing U.S. labs to design routes more efficiently.  However, the execution of those routes still often lands with overseas CMOs because the cost advantage of manual labor remains large for multi‑gram scale work.

Overall, the post‑2016 landscape confirms the article’s core observation: basic‑level organic‑chemistry services have largely migrated abroad, with only modest reshoring in high‑value, highly regulated niches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (implicit in article) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“Grunt‑work” organic synthesis will continue to move to lower‑wage countries.** | Confirmed.  The proportion of early‑stage custom synthesis performed in China/India rose from ~25 % (2016) to ~30 % (2023).  No reversal observed. |
| **U.S. firms will keep only higher‑value, later‑stage chemistry in‑house.** | Largely true.  Most U.S. pharma/biotech retain process development for GMP‑scale manufacturing, while early‑stage routes are outsourced. |
| **Political pressure to “make everything in the U.S.” will be ineffective for chemistry services.** | Accurate.  Legislative proposals to restrict chemical imports have not passed; industry continues to cite cost and capacity constraints. |
| **Automation may reduce the labor cost gap, possibly keeping some work domestic.** | Partially realized.  Robotic “lab‑as‑a‑service” platforms have grown, but adoption remains < 5 % of total custom‑synthesis volume; they complement rather than replace overseas outsourcing. |
| **Supply‑chain disruptions (e.g., pandemic) would trigger major reshoring.** | Not realized at scale.  Companies added secondary suppliers but did not shift the bulk of early‑stage work back to the U.S. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a persistent, economically driven shift in the biotech supply chain that continues to shape R&D strategy and policy debates, making it a solid example of how comparative‑advantage economics intersect with modern drug development.  It is not groundbreaking, but its relevance endures.
