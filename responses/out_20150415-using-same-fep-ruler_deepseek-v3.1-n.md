# Using the Same FEP Ruler (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary from April 2015 discusses free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations gaining prominence in drug discovery, referencing Sanofi's partnership with Schrödinger. The author highlights a newly published paper proposing a common framework for analyzing FEP results, noting that different research groups were using their own methodologies making it impossible to compare approaches. The article suggests that standardizing benchmarking tools would represent significant progress for the field, even if the proposed framework wasn't necessarily optimal.

## 2. HISTORY
After this 2015 article, free energy perturbation methods continued to mature and gained broader adoption in pharmaceutical research:

**Regulatory and Industry Impact:** FEP calculations became increasingly integrated into drug discovery pipelines, though primarily as a supportive tool rather than the primary driver of drug approvals. Major pharmaceutical companies expanded their computational chemistry capabilities, with FEP methods being used for lead optimization and predicting binding affinities.

**Scientific Adoption:** The call for standardized benchmarking was partially answered through initiatives like the SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands) challenges, which provided community-wide benchmarks for computational methods including FEP. Various research groups published comparative studies using standardized datasets.

**Commercial Developments:** Schrödinger, mentioned in the original article, continued to develop and market its FEP-based platform. The company went public in 2020, indicating sustained commercial interest in computational drug discovery tools. However, FEP remained one tool among many in the drug discovery toolkit rather than becoming the dominant paradigm.

**Real-world Impact on Drug Approvals:** While FEP methods contributed to the discovery of some approved drugs, they did not revolutionize drug discovery in the way some had hoped. Many companies found FEP most valuable for rank-ordering compounds and optimizing existing leads rather than de novo drug design.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction:** Standardizing benchmarking tools for FEP would represent "a step up" for the field
  - **Actual outcome:** This partially materialized through community initiatives like SAMPL challenges and standardized datasets, though complete standardization across all research groups was never achieved. The field did benefit from better benchmarking practices.
  
- **Implicit prediction:** FEP was having "its time in the calculational spotlight" and would continue to grow in importance
  - **Actual outcome:** FEP methods indeed became more widely adopted and sophisticated, but they did not become the dominant computational approach in drug discovery. They found their niche as valuable tools alongside other computational and experimental methods, with steady but not explosive growth in adoption.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
This article addressed an important technical issue in computational drug discovery, but the standardization of FEP benchmarking tools had relatively narrow impact compared to broader biomedical developments during this period.
