# One Step Beyond! Maybe More. (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of developing drugs that fall outside the conventional "Rule of Five" metrics used in medicinal chemistry. The author reviews a paper that categorizes these compounds into "extended Ro5" (eRo5) and "beyond Ro5" (bRo5) compounds, with molecular weights ranging up to 3000 Daltons. 

The research found that bRo5 compounds tend to bind to flat and groove-shaped protein sites rather than traditional pockets, with macrocycles being particularly enriched in this space. More than half of the flat/groove binding compounds in the bRo5 set are macrocycles, suggesting their unique disk- and sphere-like shapes are well-suited for these binding sites. The article concludes that as drug targets become more challenging, the pharmaceutical industry will need to explore these larger chemical spaces, despite synthetic challenges and the vast size of chemical space at higher molecular weights.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2015 article, macrocyclic drugs and bRo5 compounds have shown steady but measured progress rather than transformative breakthrough. Several macrocyclic drugs have received FDA approval, including:

- **Lorlatinib (2018)**: ALK inhibitor for lung cancer
- **Venetoclax combinations**: While venetoclax itself is not macrocyclic, combination therapies exploring similar spaces expanded
- **Peptide-based therapeutics**: Continued growth in this area, though many are larger than the 3000 MW cutoff

The field has seen both successes and notable failures. Large pharmaceutical companies have continued investing in macrocyclic platforms, with companies like Bicycle Therapeutics advancing macrocyclic peptides through clinical trials. However, the "couple of million diversely functionalized macrocyclic compounds" screening set envisioned in the article has not materialized at the scale predicted. While DNA-encoded library technology has advanced, the challenge of systematically exploring bRo5 space remains formidable due to synthetic complexity and the astronomical size of chemical space.

Academic research has provided deeper understanding of macrocycle permeability and conformational properties, but practical drug discovery in this space still faces significant hurdles in synthesis, characterization, and optimization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"[A]s we move into more and more difficult target spaces in med-chem, that we're going to have to learn how to explore these larger chemical spaces"**: ✓ This has occurred, with continued expansion into difficult targets like protein-protein interactions and challenging enzymes, though progress has been more evolutionary than revolutionary.

- **"The best thing I can think of is a modular approach - mixing and matching sets of subunits"**: ✓ Modular and fragment-based approaches have gained traction, though implementation remains challenging for very large compounds.

- **"A collection of a couple of million diversely functionalized macrocyclic compounds would be a very interesting screening set indeed, but no one has such a thing yet... I think we'll have to"**: ✗ This prediction has not been fulfilled at the envisioned scale. While screening libraries have expanded, the multi-million compound macrocycle libraries remain elusive due to synthetic constraints.

- **Implicit prediction that bRo5 exploration would accelerate**: ⚠️ Partial success. While the field has advanced, the "totally beserk" size of chemical space has indeed proven challenging, and progress has been more gradual than explosive.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

The article identifies important trends in drug discovery expansion beyond conventional chemical space, correctly anticipating continued movement into bRo5 territory. However, the predicted acceleration and large-scale screening capabilities have not materialized as envisioned, reflecting the genuine difficulty of the synthetic and computational challenges involved.
