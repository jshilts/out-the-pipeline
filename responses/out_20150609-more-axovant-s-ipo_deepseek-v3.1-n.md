# More on Axovant's IPO (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe criticizes Axovant Sciences' impending IPO for an Alzheimer's drug candidate acquired from GSK for $5 million. The piece highlights the questionable circumstances: a hedge fund manager (Vivek Ramaswamy) formed a company to purchase an abandoned GSK Alzheimer's therapy, then planned to take it public just six months later at a valuation exceeding $1 billion without conducting any additional clinical development. The offering involved favorable terms for insider hedge funds (RA Capital and Visium Asset Management), including shortened 90-day lock-up periods instead of the standard 180 days. Lowe presents this as emblematic of biotech market irrationality, suggesting the IPO's success would signal unsustainable market conditions where investors are throwing money at speculative ventures without proper due diligence.

## 2. HISTORY

**Axovant's subsequent trajectory proved the skepticism justified:**

Axovant's drug, intepirdine (RVT-101), failed spectacularly in its Phase 3 MINDSET trial in September 2017. The drug showed no significant benefit over placebo in treating mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. This failure came despite the company having raised hundreds of millions in additional capital post-IPO.

**The business outcome:** Following the clinical failure, Axovant's stock collapsed, losing approximately 75% of its value in one day. The company eventually pivoted to other candidates, was acquired by Roivant Sciences in 2018, and later merged with Argos Therapeutics before ultimately being acquired by Immunovant in 2020.

**Clinical context:** The failure continued a troubling pattern in Alzheimer's drug development. The 5-HT6 receptor mechanism that intepirdine targeted had shown promise in earlier studies but ultimately did not translate into clinical benefit. This reinforced the broader challenge that Alzheimer's drug development has faced for decades—extremely high failure rates despite promising preclinical data.

**Public policy impact:** No significant policy changes resulted specifically from this case, though it contributed to ongoing discussions about pharmaceutical company valuations and the risks of early-stage biotech investment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"If this IPO goes off well this week, I'm going to have to take it as a sign of undeniable craziness in the market"** - This prediction proved accurate. The IPO did succeed initially (the stock rose after going public), but the broader market irrationality Lowe identified was confirmed when the drug ultimately failed, devastating investors who had bought into the hype.

• **The article strongly implied that the drug's prospects were poor and that GSK had good reason to abandon it for only $5 million** - This was entirely validated. GSK's decision to license the drug so cheaply reflected their internal assessment of its likely clinical failure, an assessment that proved correct.

• **The suggestion that this represented unsustainable market conditions** - The biotech market did experience a correction in subsequent years, though this specific case was more about individual company failure than broader market collapse.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional prescience in identifying a speculative bubble scenario before the clinical failure that would devastate investors. It serves as a valuable case study in biotech investment due diligence and the risks of premature public offerings based on hype rather than clinical evidence.

## 5. ANALYSIS

Looking back, this article represents sharp analytical work that correctly identified multiple red flags:

**The valuation disconnect:** A $5 million acquisition yielding a >$1 billion valuation in six months without additional clinical work was indeed unsustainable, as subsequent events proved.

**The mechanism concerns:** The 5-HT6 serotonin receptor target had shown mixed results in development, and Lowe's implicit skepticism about its prospects was well-founded based on the broader field's experience.

**The insider arrangements:** The favorable terms for hedge fund insiders created misaligned incentives that should have warned outside investors about the risks.

**Market timing:** The article correctly identified that the biotech bull market of 2015 was creating conditions where fundamentally weak assets could attract substantial investment through hype rather than scientific merit.

The Axovant case became one of the more memorable cautionary tales in biotechnology investing, illustrating the importance of clinical validation over financial engineering and the dangers of IPO markets that prioritize narrative over data.
