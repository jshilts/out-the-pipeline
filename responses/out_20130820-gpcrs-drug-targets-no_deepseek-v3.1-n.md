# GPCRs As Drug Targets: Nowhere Near Played Out (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses whether G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remain a viable source for new drug targets. It references a paper showing that while GPCRs represent only 7% of underlying biological targets, they account for 26% of approved drugs—indicating heavy focus on a small subset of receptors, particularly histamine H1, α1A adrenergic, muscarinic receptors, dopamine D2, 5HT2a, and α2A adrenergic receptors. The distribution is highly skewed toward aminergic GPCRs. The analysis notes that the true number of effectively targeted GPCRs may be even lower than the reported 109, as many include poorly characterized targets with limited pharmacological validation. Of the 437 GPCR-targeting drugs identified, most are small molecules while about 50 represent non-small molecule approaches (peptides, proteins, etc.). The article highlights emerging opportunities in alternative mechanisms: allosteric modulators, GPCR dimerization, non-canonical signaling pathways, and other protein interactions, while acknowledging the substantial challenges in developing reliable assays for these novel approaches.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2013 article, GPCR drug discovery experienced both consolidation and expansion. The FDA approved dozens of new GPCR-targeting drugs, though the field remained dominated by established target families. According to FDA databases, between 2013-2023, approximately 40-50 new drugs targeting GPCRs received approval, maintaining the roughly 25-30% representation of GPCR drugs in the overall market.

**Key developments include:**

- **Amiotic receptors remained dominant**: New drugs targeting serotonin receptors (particularly 5HT1A, 5HT2C), dopamine receptors, and adrenergic receptors continued to dominate, often as improved versions with better selectivity profiles rather than novel mechanisms.

- **Emerging therapeutic areas**: Significant growth occurred in immune-modulating GPCRs, particularly chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR5, CXCR4) for inflammatory diseases and oncology, though clinical outcomes were mixed. Several chemokine receptor antagonists failed in late-stage trials.

- **Orphan GPCR breakthrough**: The biggest story was the successful development of drugs targeting previously "orphan" GPCRs. GPR119 and GPR40 for diabetes, though mixed success; GPR55 and cannabinoid-related receptors; and several lipid-sensing GPCRs entered clinical trials.

- **Structural biology revolution**: Between 2013-2023, high-resolution crystal structures for over 100 GPCRs were solved, dramatically accelerating structure-based drug design and enabling targeting of previously intractable receptors.

- **Biased agonism clinical translation**: Several drugs exploiting biased agonism (e.g., TRV027 for heart failure, though it ultimately failed Phase II) reached clinical trials, representing the maturation of this concept from theory to therapeutic application.

- **Allosteric modulator progress**: While many allosteric GPCR modulators entered clinical development, only a handful achieved FDA approval. Most notable was maraviroc (CCR5 allosteric inhibitor), already approved but finding new applications.

- **Commercial landscape**: Major pharmaceutical companies continued significant GPCR programs, with particular emphasis on CNS disorders, metabolic diseases, and immuno-oncology targets. Smaller companies often focused on specialized areas like orphan GPCRs or novel mechanisms like biased signaling.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article's explicit and implicit predictions:**

• **"Allosteric modulators, GPCR homo- and heterodimerization, other GPCR-protein interactions, inverse agonists and the like, alternative signaling pathways other than the canonical G-proteins, and more" would provide new therapeutic opportunities**
  - **Outcome**: Partially realized. Allosteric modulators became a major focus area with several reaching clinical trials, though FDA approvals remained limited. GPCR dimerization research advanced significantly but produced few clinical successes. Biased agonism (alternative signaling) became a validated concept with multiple drugs in trials.

• **"Will keep us busy for a long time to come" regarding new modes of drug action**
  - **Outcome**: Very accurate. The period 2013-2023 saw extensive research across all these modalities, though practical therapeutic applications developed more slowly than research activity.

• **"Working up reliable assays for some of these things is no small matter" (regarding novel mechanisms)**
  - **Outcome**: Largely underestimated. Assay development proved even more challenging than suggested. The complexity of measuring biased signaling, allosteric effects, and dimerization in vivo led to high attrition rates in drug development for these mechanisms.

• **Implicit prediction that the 80:20 small molecule to biotech ratio might shift toward biotech**
  - **Outcome**: Limited shift. While the number of GPCR-targeting antibodies and peptides increased, small molecules still dominated new approvals. The MW <600 threshold remained the sweet spot.

• **Implicit suggestion that previously "undruggable" GPCRs would become viable targets**
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. While orphan GPCRs saw increased attention, many remained difficult to drug effectively. The skew toward aminergic receptors persisted, though less extreme than in 2013.

• **Implicit expectation that non-aminergic GPCR families would gain prominence**
  - **Outcome**: Qualitative improvement but limited quantitative shift. Peptide-binding GPCRs, lipid sensors, and other families gained more research attention, but aminergic GPCRs still dominated new drug approvals numerically.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article delivered an accurate, data-driven assessment that successfully identified major trends in GPCR drug discovery over the subsequent decade, despite underestimating the difficulty of translating novel mechanisms into approved drugs. The core insight—that GPCRs remained far from "played out" despite being the most successful drug target family—proved prescient as the field expanded from ~365 FDA-approved drugs targeting ~90 GPCRs in 2013 to over 450 drugs targeting over 130 GPCRs by 2023. The article correctly anticipated that structural complexity and assay challenges would slow rather than prevent progress, and its balanced view of incremental improvements versus revolutionary breakthroughs accurately foreshadowed the mixed outcomes for novel mechanisms like biased agonism and allosteric modulation.

The timing was particularly apt—published just as the GPCR structural biology revolution was accelerating, enabling precisely the kind of sophisticated drug design the author envisioned. While the article perhaps didn't fully grasp how difficult clinical translation would be for some of these approaches, it successfully captured the field's trajectory toward more sophisticated pharmacology and broader target diversity.
