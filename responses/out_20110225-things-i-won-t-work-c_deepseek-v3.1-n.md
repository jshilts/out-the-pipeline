# Things I Won't Work With: Chlorine Azide (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post discusses chlorine azide, an extremely unstable and explosive chemical compound. The author reviews a 1943 JACS paper that documented the first comprehensive study of this substance, noting how researchers working with chlorine azide experienced "numerous explosions, often without assignable cause." The article describes the extreme safety precautions taken, including iron masks and breastplates, and recounts experimental details such as violent reactions with sodium metal at -78°C. The post has a humorous tone while emphasizing the compound's dangerous nature and the researchers' persistence despite repeated explosions. The author speculates about potential World War II research funding but concludes that chlorine azide remained safely confined to basic chemical research.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2011, chlorine azide has remained exactly what the article described: an extremely dangerous laboratory curiosity with no practical applications. No approved drugs, medical treatments, or industrial processes have been developed using chlorine azide. The compound continues to be studied primarily for fundamental chemical research on azide chemistry and reaction mechanisms, with occasional papers appearing in specialized chemistry journals.

Research has focused on understanding its decomposition pathways and reactivity patterns rather than developing commercial applications. Safety protocols for handling such compounds have become more standardized, but the essential dangers persist. The "Things I Won't Work With" series by Derek Lowe (the author) continued until 2023, covering other dangerous chemicals, establishing this as one of the most-read chemistry blog series. The 1943 JACS paper remains a frequently cited historical reference for halogen azide chemistry, but has not led to breakthrough applications.

No pharmaceutical companies have pursued chlorine azide for drug development, no regulatory approvals have been sought, and no public policy changes resulted from research on this compound.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made one explicit prediction:
- **"chlorine azide has not been weaponized, nor will it be"** - $\checkmark$ **CORRECT**: Twelve years later, chlorine azide remains confined to laboratory research with no military or weaponized applications developed.

The author's implicit suggestion that chlorine azide would remain "off in a part of chemical science that's safe from human exploitation" also proved accurate - no commercial or industrial uses have emerged since publication.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article provides entertaining historical context about dangerous chemistry and the persistence of 1940s researchers, but addresses a chemical compound with no practical applications or broader scientific impact. While well-written and amusing, it describes what remains essentially a chemical curiosity rather than a substance with commercial, medical, or societal importance.
