# Photochemistry Marches On (Instant Heterocycle Substituents)
23 Sep 2015

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes a new photochemical method developed by the Nicewicz lab at UNC for directly attaching nitrogen-containing heterocycles (imidazoles, pyrazoles, triazoles) onto aromatic rings through C-H functionalization. The reaction uses an acridinium catalyst, TEMPO, and benzoquinone under blue LED illumination. A key advantage highlighted is the method's selectivity—it avoids attacking benzylic CH groups, which had been problematic for other C-H substitution reactions. The authors also demonstrated late-stage functionalization of complex molecules including naproxen, dihydroquinidine, and acetylecapsaicin, adding heterocycles cleanly without alternative good synthetic routes available. The technique was positioned as a valuable addition to medicinal chemists' toolkits for accessing new molecular scaffolds.

## 2. HISTORY
This 2015 Science paper by the Nicewicz group introduced what became known as the "anti-Markovnikov hydroheteroarylation" of alkenes via photoredox catalysis. The field of photoredox catalysis using acridinium catalysts expanded significantly following this publication. The Nicewicz lab continued developing this chemistry, and photoredox catalysis became an established synthetic methodology adopted by medicinal chemistry groups in pharmaceutical companies.

However, the specific heterocycle stapling reaction described did not revolutionize drug discovery or lead to approved drugs through this particular synthetic route. While the methodology was scientifically elegant and expanded synthetic capabilities, it joined a growing toolbox of C-H functionalization methods rather than becoming a dominant transformation. Photoredox catalysis more broadly has been successfully applied in pharmaceutical synthesis, but this particular transformation did not demonstrate the exceptional selectivity or efficiency needed to displace more conventional methods for large-scale adoption.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: The method would become a welcome addition to medicinal chemists' toolboxes and enable access to new molecular scaffolds.
  - **Outcome**: The field of photoredox catalysis did expand, but this specific transformation did not become a workhorse reaction in drug discovery programs. Other C-H functionalization methods and existing synthetic routes remained more practical for most applications.

• **Prediction**: Late-stage functionalization of complex molecules like naproxen and dihydroquinidine would generate significant interest due to lack of alternative good synthetic routes.
  - **Outcome**: While scientifically demonstrated, late-stage functionalization using this method did not translate into widespread practical use in pharmaceutical R&D. The complexity of regio- and chemoselectivity in real drug molecules limited broad adoption.

• **Prediction**: Avoiding benzylic CH group attack would solve a real problem compared to other C-H substituting reactions.
  - **Outcome**: This selectivity advantage was real, but competing methods evolved that also addressed selectivity challenges, preventing this method from achieving unique dominance in the field.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This represents solid academic photochemistry research introducing a genuinely useful synthetic method. While it expanded the synthetic toolbox and demonstrated impressive selectivity control, it did not fundamentally transform drug discovery practices or lead to unexpected therapeutic breakthroughs. The work contributed to the broader maturation of photoredox catalysis as a field rather than standing alone as a landmark advance.
