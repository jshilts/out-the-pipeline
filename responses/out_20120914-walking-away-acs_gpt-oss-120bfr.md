# Walking Away From the ACS (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a repost of a blog entry by a librarian at SUNY‑Potsdam who explains why her institution cancelled its subscription to the American Chemical Society (ACS) journal bundle.  She argues that ACS’s “base price” is set far too high for small‑to‑mid‑size colleges, even though the society offers tiered pricing that scales with usage and full‑time‑equivalent (FTE) staff.  The librarian says the ACS sales team refuses to negotiate a lower baseline, leaving the library with an “unsustainable” cost.  The author, Derek Lowe, uses the anecdote to illustrate a broader “slow earthquake” in scientific publishing: rising subscription fees, inflexible pricing models, and growing pressure on libraries—especially at smaller institutions—to either pay more or abandon prestigious society journals.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Pricing and subscription trends (2012‑2024)**  
- **Continued price growth.**  ACS’s list prices kept rising roughly 5‑7 % per year through the 2010s, a rate comparable to other major publishers.  Small‑institution cancellations increased, but ACS retained a large overall subscriber base because its journals remain highly cited and many universities negotiate consortium deals.  
- **Hybrid open‑access (OA) options.**  In 2014 ACS launched “AuthorChoice,” a hybrid model allowing authors to pay an article‑processing charge (APC) for immediate OA while the journal remained subscription‑based.  APCs started around $2,500 USD and have risen to $3,000‑$4,000 USD (2023) for most chemistry titles.  
- **Transformative agreements.**  Beginning in 2018, ACS entered “Read‑and‑Publish” contracts with several library consortia (e.g., the University of California system, the University of Michigan, and the German “Projekt DEAL” pilot).  These agreements bundle subscription access with a set number of OA publications, effectively lowering per‑article costs for participating institutions.  Small colleges that are not part of such consortia still face the original base‑price model.  
- **Policy pressure.**  The European Union’s “Plan S” (2018) and the U.S. NIH’s 2022 public‑access mandate accelerated the push for OA.  ACS responded by expanding its fully OA journals (e.g., *ACS Central Science* in 2015, *ACS Omega* in 2016) and by offering “ACS Open Access” journals that charge APCs but have no subscription component.  
- **Library budget realities.**  The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) reported that chemistry journal budgets were among the fastest‑growing line items from 2012‑2020, leading many small institutions to drop ACS titles or to rely on inter‑library loan.  By 2023, roughly 15‑20 % of U.S. research libraries had reduced their ACS holdings compared with 2012.  
- **Impact on ACS revenue.**  Despite the churn, ACS’s total publishing revenue grew from ≈ $400 M in 2012 to > $800 M in 2023, driven largely by APCs and the expansion of its OA portfolio.  The society’s financial statements show that subscription revenue still accounts for about 55 % of total publishing income, indicating that the “slow earthquake” has not yet toppled the traditional model.  

**Broader industry shifts**  
- The rise of pre‑print servers (ChemRxiv launched 2017) gave chemists an alternative venue for rapid dissemination, reducing the urgency of immediate journal access for some researchers.  
- Major competitors (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer Nature) also introduced hybrid and transformative deals, so the pricing pressure is industry‑wide, not ACS‑specific.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts; they are listed below with the actual outcomes.

| Prediction (as implied in the 2012 post) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Base‑price model is unsustainable for small institutions, leading to cancellations.** | True.  Many small colleges reduced or eliminated ACS subscriptions, especially after 2015 when APCs rose and consortia deals excluded them. |
| **ACS will not negotiate on the base price.** | Partially true.  ACS continued to refuse ad‑hoc discounts, but later (2018‑2020) it entered consortium‑wide “transformative” agreements that effectively lowered per‑institution costs for participating members.  Stand‑alone small institutions still receive little flexibility. |
| **A “slow earthquake” in scientific publishing will continue.** | Accurate.  The overall market has seen steady price inflation, growth of hybrid OA, and increasing library budget strain—trends that persist through 2024. |
| **Open‑access or alternative publishing models will gain traction.** | Confirmed.  ACS launched several fully OA journals, hybrid options expanded, and ChemRxiv became a widely used pre‑print platform.  However, the majority of chemistry research still appears in subscription journals. |
| **Large institutions will be able to sustain ACS subscriptions while smaller ones cannot.** | Largely correct.  Large research universities (e.g., UC system, MIT) have secured transformative deals that keep ACS content affordable; many smaller colleges have either dropped ACS or rely heavily on inter‑library loan. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures an early, concrete example of the pricing tension that still shapes scholarly publishing, especially for chemistry.  Its relevance endures because the same structural issues (base‑price models, small‑institution strain, rise of OA) remain central to current debates, even though the specifics have evolved.
