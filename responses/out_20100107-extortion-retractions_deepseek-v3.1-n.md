# Extortion, Retractions, And More (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a 2010 Science magazine report about two retracted papers from Peter Schultz's Scripps research group. The papers, published in 2004 in Science and JACS, detailed methods for incorporating glycosylated amino acids (glucosamine-serine and galactosamine-threonine) directly into proteins, with postdoc Zhiwen Zhang as a primary contributor.

After another postdoc struggled to reproduce the work in 2006, Schultz's lab attempted replication but found Zhang's lab notebooks were missing from his office. While most of Zhang's other work was replicable, the glycosylated amino acid studies could not be reproduced as reported. Concurrently, Zhang—by then a faculty member at University of Texas—began receiving anonymous extortion emails demanding $4000, signed by "Michael Pemulis" (a character from David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest), threatening to expose fraud and cause his termination. After police identified a suspect, Zhang chose not to press charges, but anonymous hostile letters were later sent to Scripps, UT-Austin, and Science editors. Zhang was denied tenure in 2009, and the postdoc who originally identified the problems published a JBC paper detailing the irreproducibility issues.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2010 article, several concrete developments occurred:

**Retraction Finalization**: The two papers were formally retracted. The 2004 Science paper (DOI: 10.1126/science.1093282) was retracted in 2010, and the 2004 JACS paper (DOI: 10.1021/ja906705a) was also retracted, both citing irreproducibility of key results.

**Academic Impact**: Zhiwen Zhang's tenure denial at University of Texas-Austin in 2009 effectively ended his academic career trajectory. The retractions and associated controversy fundamentally compromised his research credibility within the scientific community.

**Research Direction Shift**: Peter Schultz's laboratory at Scripps continued its broader research program in chemical biology and expanded therapeutic areas, but the incident highlighted challenges in postdoctoral supervision and scientific reproducibility. Schultz later became Director of the California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr) and expanded into drug discovery through Scripps' spin-offs.

**Methodological Impact**: The specific claims about direct incorporation of glycosylated amino acids into proteins did not become a widely adopted methodology in protein engineering. While protein glycosylation research advanced significantly through other approaches, the direct incorporation methods described in the retracted papers did not enter mainstream use or lead to commercial applications.

**Scientific Community Response**: The case contributed to growing awareness about reproducibility issues in biochemistry and the importance of rigorous documentation. It preceded broader discussions about research integrity that intensified in the 2010s, though it remained a relatively isolated scandal rather than triggering systematic policy changes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article contained no explicit predictions about future developments. Instead, it presented a retrospective analysis of an unfolding scientific misconduct case. The author's observation was primarily descriptive rather than predictive, focusing on the unusual circumstances of the extortion attempt and the psychological pressures in academic environments.

The author did comment on the mental health pressures facing graduate students and postdocs, noting that "a disproportionate number of the people I've worked with over the years that I consider to have had serious mental problems are still from my academic years." This reflected a recognition that the case might highlight broader systemic issues in academic training, but this was framed as personal observation rather than a testable prediction.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This case represents an unusual intersection of scientific misconduct, academic politics, and criminal behavior that provides insight into research integrity challenges. The extortion element and literary pseudonym add unique dimensions that elevate it beyond typical retraction stories.
