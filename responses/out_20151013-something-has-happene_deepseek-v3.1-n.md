# Something Has Happened to Zafgen, But What? (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on a sudden, unexplained crisis at Zafgen, a small biotech developing an unusual appetite/obesity therapy. On October 13, 2015, the company canceled two scheduled presentations without warning or explanation, while remaining unresponsive to inquiries. This triggered investor panic and a roughly 40% stock plunge amid speculation about negative clinical news. The author updated the post the same day noting further declines, and added a subsequent update on October 14 revealing that Zafgen had disclosed a patient death in one of its clinical trial treatment groups, with cause unknown and under investigation at the time.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent to this article, on October 16, 2015, Zafgen disclosed that a second patient in the Phase 3 trial of beloranib (ZGN-433) had died, and the FDA placed the study on clinical hold. By December 2015, Zafgen announced it was discontinuing beloranib development entirely due to safety concerns and venous thromboembolic events. Zafgen pivoted to develop a successor compound, ZGN-1064, which also failed to show sufficient efficacy and was discontinued in 2019. 

The company later rebranded as Larimar Therapeutics and shifted focus to rare diseases, particularly Friedreich's ataxia. As of 2024-2025, Larimar continued to develop CTI-1601 for Friedreich's ataxia, but faced regulatory challenges including an FDA clinical hold in 2021 (later lifted) and a Complete Response Letter in May 2024, with the FDA requesting additional data before approving the drug. The stock has remained volatile, trading significantly below historical levels from the 2015 era.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- The article anticipated that Zafgen was preparing to release "material information" from the clinic - **this proved accurate**, as the patient death disclosures followed shortly after
- The author suggested the company's behavior indicated "presumably something from the clinic" - **this was correct**, the issue was indeed clinical trial safety data
- The mystery around the company's silence was characterized as potentially "not in a good way" - **this proved prescient**, given the serious safety issues and eventual discontinuation of the drug

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

The article captures a pivotal moment in a cautionary tale about drug development challenges, but the long-term impact was confined to a single company rather than broader industry implications.
