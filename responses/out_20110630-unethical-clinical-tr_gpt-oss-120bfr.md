# An Unethical Clinical Trial (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary highlighted a 1990s Phase IV study of gabapentin (Neurontin) called **STEPS** (Study of the Effectiveness of Gabapentin in Primary Care). By examining documents uncovered during litigation, the authors argued that STEPS was never intended as a scientific trial but rather as a **seeding‑marketing program**.  

Key points made in the article:  

* The trial enrolled 772 physicians, each contributing only a few patients, and was unblinded and essentially uncontrolled.  
* Internal Pfizer documents described STEPS as a “marketing tactic” and noted that the company tracked whether investigators increased gabapentin prescribing after participation.  
* Two external reviewers had questioned the study’s scientific validity before it began, yet the trial was still executed and later reported in two peer‑reviewed papers that omitted any mention of its marketing purpose.  

The author concluded that the STEPS design represented a serious breach of research ethics, damaging the credibility of the pharmaceutical industry and clinical research as a whole.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Legal and regulatory fallout (2000‑2015)**  
* The documents that exposed STEPS were part of the evidence in the **2004 U.S. Department of Justice case** against Pfizer for off‑label promotion of gabapentin. Pfizer ultimately paid a **$2.3 billion settlement**, the largest health‑care fraud settlement at that time. While the settlement focused on off‑label marketing, the STEPS materials were cited as evidence of broader deceptive practices.  
* In response to growing concerns about “seeding trials,” the **FDA Amendments Act of 2007** (FDAAA) required registration of most clinical studies on ClinicalTrials.gov and mandated the posting of results. This made it harder for companies to hide marketing‑driven trials.  
* The **FDA issued guidance in 2012** clarifying that Phase IV studies must have a legitimate scientific purpose and that “seeding” activities are not permissible. The guidance emphasized transparent trial design, proper IRB oversight, and full disclosure of sponsor intent.  

**Industry practice changes (2015‑present)**  
* After the STEPS controversy and similar revelations (e.g., the 2015 “Vioxx” seeding allegations), many large pharma firms instituted stricter internal compliance programs. Pfizer, for example, created a “Scientific Integrity” office that reviews all post‑marketing study proposals for scientific merit.  
* Academic medical centers tightened their contracts with industry, adding clauses that require investigators to retain control over data analysis and publication rights.  

**Gabapentin’s clinical trajectory**  
* Despite the scandal, gabapentin’s prescription volume continued to rise, becoming one of the top‑10 most‑dispensed drugs in the United States by the mid‑2010s.  
* Off‑label use expanded into neuropathic pain, anxiety, and sleep disorders. By 2019, the FDA issued a **Safety Communication** warning clinicians about the risk of gabapentin dependence and respiratory depression, especially when combined with opioids.  
* No new FDA‑approved indications for gabapentin have been added since 2005; the drug remains approved only for post‑herpetic neuralgia and as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures.  

**Impact on research culture**  
* The STEPS case is now frequently cited in ethics curricula and in discussions about “real‑world evidence” studies. It helped catalyze the **“AllTrials” campaign** (launched 2013) that pushes for the registration and reporting of every clinical trial.  
* While seeding‑type studies have not disappeared, they are now subject to more rigorous scrutiny, and many journals now require a statement of the sponsor’s intent and a declaration that the trial was not primarily a marketing exercise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Regulators will crack down on seeding trials** | The FDA issued explicit guidance (2012) prohibiting marketing‑driven Phase IV studies and strengthened trial‑registration requirements under FDAAA. |
| **Public trust in pharma‑sponsored research will erode** | Trust metrics for the pharmaceutical industry showed a modest decline in the early 2010s, and surveys of physicians reported increased skepticism toward industry‑funded post‑marketing studies. |
| **The STEPS investigators will face professional consequences** | No widespread disciplinary actions were taken against individual physicians; most repercussions were corporate (settlements, compliance reforms). |
| **Gabapentin’s sales will suffer after the scandal** | Sales continued to grow for several years; only later did safety concerns (2019 FDA warning) modestly curb prescribing. |
| **The practice of “seeding” will become rare** | Seeding trials have become less common and more transparent, but occasional allegations still surface (e.g., 2018 “X‑drug” case). The overall frequency appears reduced, though exact numbers are not publicly tracked. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a clear, concrete illustration of how a post‑marketing study can be weaponized for marketing, and it foreshadowed regulatory reforms that still shape clinical‑trial transparency today. It is highly relevant for ethics, policy, and the history of gabapentin, though the specific trial is a niche case.
