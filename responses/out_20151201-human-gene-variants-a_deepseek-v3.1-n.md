# Human Gene Variants Are More Variable Than We Thought (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on the gap between the early hype around the Human Genome Project and the more complex reality that emerged by 2015. While access to human sequence data proved valuable, initial expectations of rapid disease breakthroughs were premature—the number of genes was lower than predicted, early drug target searches had limited success, and most major diseases turned out to be polygenic and environmentally influenced rather than single-gene disorders.

The piece highlights "human knockouts" (people with natural loss-of-function mutations) as an important discovery tool, citing the PCSK9-LDL connection as a success story. However, a new study from Bradford, England, showed unexpected findings: some genes previously thought essential (including those linked to hearing loss) could be completely lost without the predicted phenotypic effects. This complexity meant loss-of-function predictions were going to be trickier than anticipated.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2015, several key developments have built on these observations:

**Large-scale knockout discovery accelerated**: The UK Biobank's expansion and similar population sequencing initiatives (including gnomAD database updates) systematically cataloged human loss-of-function variants, confirming extensive redundancy and resilience in human gene networks. By 2021, gnomAD identified ~130 genes where loss-of-function variants showed no apparent phenotype in healthy adults, supporting the Bradford study's findings.

**PCSK9 inhibition succeeded commercially**: Evolocumab (Repatha) and alirocumab (Praluent) gained FDA approval (2015-2017) and demonstrated significant cardiovascular risk reduction in long-term trials. However, high costs initially limited uptake; pricing reforms and outcomes data expanded their adoption after 2018. This validated the "human knockout" discovery approach while highlighting market access challenges.

**Clinical interpretation challenges persisted**: Studies revealed that individuals can carry large genomic deletions without apparent disease (e.g., ~1 in 300 people carry pathogenic variants yet remain healthy), underscoring genetic buffering and incomplete penetrance. This forced revisions in genetic counseling and diagnostic testing—many previously declared "pathogenic" variants were downgraded to "uncertain significance."

**Drug target identification remained complex**: Whole-genome sequencing failed to rapidly translate into new drug targets. Most successes emerged from candidate gene approaches or functional studies rather than pure genomic mining. By 2020, fewer than 10% of genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits had been successfully developed into drug targets, partly due to the polygenic nature of most diseases noted in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in the article. The author's cautious stance ("So we're going to have to be a bit more careful in jumping to conclusions - loss of function leading to an interesting phenotype will probably turn out to be real, but predicting an interesting phenotype through loss of function is going to be tricky") aligns well with subsequent research showing widespread genetic redundancy and the unreliability of reverse-prediction from genotype to phenotype.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7**

This article captured a crucial transition point in genomics—recognizing system complexity before it became conventional wisdom. The core insight (variance in gene essentiality) preceded systematic population genetics efforts that later confirmed extensive human gene redundancy.
