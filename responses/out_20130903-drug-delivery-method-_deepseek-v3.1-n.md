# A Drug Delivery Method You Haven't Thought Of (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Google Ventures' investment in Rani Therapeutics (referred to as "Rani Biotechnology"), a startup developing an oral delivery system for large protein drugs—a significant challenge in pharmaceuticals. The proposed technology, as suggested by a referenced patent, involves a capsule containing spring-loaded needles that deploy in the small intestine to inject the protein payload through the intestinal wall, effectively creating an "I.V. that you swallow." Beyond the mechanical delivery mechanism, the author notes the even greater challenge of ensuring proteins survive the harsh gastrointestinal environment. The piece maintains a cautiously optimistic tone about this long-shot approach while acknowledging the many potential failure points that would need clinical validation.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Rani Therapeutics has persisted in developing its oral biologics platform and has made measurable progress. The company raised additional funding rounds beyond the initial Google Ventures investment, including a **$69 million Series D in 2020** and subsequent rounds that brought total funding to several hundred million dollars. Rani conducted multiple clinical trials across various therapeutic areas, including trials for osteoporosis (oral calcitonin), entering Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. While the technology has advanced significantly, the path to widespread clinical adoption and regulatory approval has proven challenging.

Despite more than a decade of development and substantial investment, Rani has not yet achieved full FDA approval for its oral biologics platform. However, the company's continued operation and progression through clinical trials suggests the technology demonstrated sufficient promise to attract sustained funding. In recent years, Rani has expanded partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and continued clinical development for multiple indications.

The broader field of oral biologics has seen increasing interest, with numerous approaches competing with injectable formulations. However, the mechanical needle-based delivery concept explored by Rani remains relatively niche compared to other oral delivery technologies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction about large-scale impact**: The article suggests this technology could solve the "small problem" of oral protein delivery. *Outcome*: While Rani has advanced clinically, broad adoption remains limited and FDA approval has not yet been achieved—indicating the technical challenges were indeed substantial.
- **Investment timeline expectations**: Google Ventures' backing suggests longer-term commitment. *Outcome*: The company sustained operations for 10+ years with multiple funding rounds, validating long-term investor interest but also demonstrating slower-than-hoped clinical progress.
- **Clinical proof concept**: "The proof will be in the clinic" prediction. *Outcome*: Rani has conducted multiple clinical trials and advanced through Phase 2/3, proving the concept has some clinical viability, though not yet achieving widespread adoption or regulatory approval.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article correctly identified an important technical challenge in biopharmaceuticals and reported on a genuinely novel approach. While the needle-capsule technology remains less transformative than initially hoped (partly due to the editorial's own appropriately skeptical tone), the broader problem of oral biologics delivery continues to be highly relevant. The sustained investment and clinical progression support the case for modest long-term importance, though not paradigm-shifting impact.
