# The Deadly Stupidities Around Ebola (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary responds to Ebola-related conspiracy theories circulating during the West African outbreak. The author targets Cyril Broderick, a Liberian-born professor who claimed in a Liberian newspaper that Ebola was a manufactured bioweapon created by pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. Department of Defense, with the WHO, Doctors Without Borders, and CDC allegedly complicit in the plot.

The article expresses outrage that such misinformation was being spread in a region where medical workers were already facing violent attacks from suspicious local populations. The author warns that these conspiracy theories could undermine vaccination campaigns and other public health interventions, potentially getting both patients and healthcare workers killed. The piece draws parallels between Broderick and Matthias Rath, who had previously urged HIV patients to abandon antiretroviral drugs.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic was the largest in history, with over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The outbreak prompted unprecedented international response and accelerated Ebola vaccine development.

**Vaccine Development and Deployment:**
- **rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo)**: The GSK vaccine mentioned in the article was eventually developed and proved highly effective. Clinical trials during the outbreak showed approximately 97.5% efficacy. The vaccine received FDA approval in December 2019 and has been used in subsequent outbreaks, including the 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
- **Vaccine acceptance challenges**: Vaccine hesitancy and conspiracy theories did indeed complicate public health responses, particularly in conflict-affected regions where distrust of foreign medical teams persisted.

**Epidemiological Impact:**
- The outbreak spurred major improvements in Ebola surveillance, treatment protocols, and international coordination mechanisms.
- Subsequent smaller outbreaks (2018-2020 in DRC, 2021-2022 in Guinea) demonstrated these improved capabilities, though community resistance remained a significant challenge.
- The development of monoclonal antibody treatments (e.g., Inmazeb, Ebanga) also emerged from this period's research surge.

**Misinformation and Public Health Response:**
- The type of misinformation described in the article persisted throughout the outbreak and complicated response efforts, particularly in rural and remote areas.
- Public health organizations eventually developed more sophisticated community engagement strategies to counter misinformation and build trust.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in Article:**

• **"If GSK's Ebola vaccine actually proves effective... stuff like what Professor Broderick is spewing will make it that much harder to accomplish anything with it. People will hide rather than get vaccinated and attack the people coming in to save their lives."**

- **Outcome**: This prediction proved unfortunately accurate. Multiple studies documented vaccine hesitancy and refusal during Ebola outbreaks, fueled by conspiracy theories and distrust of foreign medical personnel. Attackers killed several Ebola response workers in subsequent outbreaks, including an incident in the DRC where an epidemiologist was murdered in 2019.

• **Implicit prediction that pharmaceutical companies would develop effective Ebola interventions**

- **Outcome**: Successfully realized. Beyond GSK's vaccine, multiple Ebola treatments and vaccines emerged, including Regeneron's Inmazeb and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics' Ebanga (both approved 2020), validating the pharmaceutical industry's ability to respond to emerging infectious diseases when properly incentivized and resourced.

• **Implicit prediction that misinformation would cause preventable deaths**

- **Outcome**: Documented in multiple outbreak analyses. Studies showed that communities with higher levels of distrust and misinformation exposure had lower healthcare utilization and higher Ebola mortality rates during the West African epidemic and subsequent outbreaks.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a prescient moment in the intersection of global health emergencies and medical misinformation. Its warnings about how conspiracy theories can undermine life-saving public health interventions proved tragically accurate, making it relevant not just to Ebola but to subsequent health crises including COVID-19. The piece identified a pattern of anti-science sentiment that has only grown more consequential in the decade since publication.
