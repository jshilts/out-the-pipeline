# PD-1 Charted (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article references a chart from the AACR meeting (shared via AndyBiotech on Twitter) showing which tumor types respond best to PD-1 antibodies. The data highlights both the transformative potential of these immune checkpoint inhibitors in certain cancers (the parts of oncology being "transformed") and the continued need for small molecule drugs in tumor types showing poor response to PD-1 therapy. The accompanying Forbes article by Matthew Herper describes these immune system drugs as "melting tumors" and leading a "cancer revolution," indicating significant excitement about PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in 2015.

## 2. HISTORY
The period following April 2015 saw dramatic real-world validation of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors:

**Regulatory Approvals & Indications:** By 2015, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo) had already received their first approvals, but the subsequent years brought explosive expansion. Pembrolizumab received FDA approval for melanoma in September 2014, while nivolumab was approved for melanoma in December 2014 and for lung cancer in March 2015, just before this article. Between 2015-2020, these drugs accumulated dozens of additional indications across multiple tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, and mismatch repair-deficient solid tumors.

**Clinical Outcomes:** The AACR data referenced in the chart proved prescient. Melanoma and lung cancer (particularly NSCLC) did indeed show robust responses and became cornerstones of immune checkpoint therapy. Head and neck cancers also demonstrated meaningful response rates. Conversely, tumor types like pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma largely maintained their resistance, confirming the continued need for alternative approaches.

**Market Impact:** PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors became blockbuster drugs, with pembrolizumab becoming one of the world's best-selling pharmaceuticals and achieving multi-billion dollar annual revenues by 2019-2020. Combination strategies emerged as crucial, particularly the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with CTLA-4 inhibitors (ipilimumab + nivolumab), which showed superior responses in melanoma and kidney cancer but with increased toxicity.

**Scientific Adoption:** PD-1 checkpoint inhibition became a standard pillar of cancer therapy across multiple tumor types, fundamentally altering treatment paradigms. Biomarker-driven approaches using PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden became standard practice. The field also revealed important limitations: significant percentages of patients remain non-responders across tumor types, and immune-related adverse events emerged as clinically significant toxicities requiring specialized management.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's framing implicitly contained several predictions:

• **Prediction: Parts of oncology practice will be transformed**
  - **Outcome: Correct.** Melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and several other tumor types experienced genuine transformation in treatment paradigms
  - **Evidence:** First-line immunotherapy became standard in NSCLC (both pembrolizumab-based combinations and nivolumab + ipilimumab in high TMB patients); melanoma survival curves showed unprecedented long-term tails; PD-1 inhibitors now feature in numerous standard-of-care protocols

• **Prediction: Small molecules still needed where solid tumors don't respond well**
  - **Outcome: Correct.** Pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, and several other tumor types largely failed to respond to PD-1 monotherapy
  - **Evidence:** These tumor types remain challenging; combination approaches incorporating chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and novel immunotherapeutic strategies dominate current research and clinical practice

• **Implicit prediction: Focus on tumor-type-specific responses will guide field**
  - **Outcome: Mixed.** While the chart correctly identified better-responding tumor types, the field quickly discovered that tumor type alone is insufficient for selecting patients. Response depends heavily on molecular features (PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability) and tumor microenvironment factors.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This brief snapshot from AACR 2015 captured immune checkpoint therapy at a pivotal moment - after initial approvals but before the full therapeutic revolution became evident. The article correctly identified both the transformative potential and the remaining gaps, demonstrating clear foresight about which parts of oncology would and would not be transformed.
