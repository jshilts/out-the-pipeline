# Don't Try to Leave (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses the proposed $160 billion merger between Pfizer (U.S.) and Allergan (then an Irish‑registered company after Actavis’s 2015 acquisition). The author explains that Pfizer had been looking for a “tax inversion” – moving its legal domicile to a low‑tax jurisdiction – to lower its U.S. corporate tax bill. The U.S. Treasury, reacting to political pressure, announced new rules that would deny the tax benefits of inversions completed within the previous three years. Because Allergan’s Irish domicile was only a year old, the Treasury’s proposal would effectively block the Pfizer‑Allergan deal. The piece also argues that the problem lies in the U.S. tax code rather than corporate greed, and it mentions other examples of companies (e.g., Amazon in Luxembourg) and politicians (Sen. Elizabeth Warren) who benefit from the same tax structures.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Deal collapse (July 2016).** After the Treasury’s “anti‑inversion” guidance was released, Pfizer announced it was abandoning the merger. The deal never closed, and Pfizer’s stock fell modestly while Allergan’s dropped sharply on the news, exactly as the article described.

**Regulatory changes.** The Treasury’s proposal was codified in the 2016 “anti‑inversion” regulations (Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code) and later reinforced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, which lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % and introduced the Global Intangible Low‑Taxed Income (GILTI) regime. These changes reduced the financial incentive for U.S. companies to pursue inversions, and the number of announced inversions fell dramatically after 2016.

**Allergan’s fate.** In May 2020, AbbVie announced a $63 billion acquisition of Allergan, which closed in May 2020. The deal was unrelated to any tax inversion strategy; it was driven by AbbVie’s desire to add Allergan’s dermatology and aesthetics portfolio (e.g., Botox) to its pipeline.

**Pfizer’s subsequent strategy.** With the inversion route closed, Pfizer focused on other growth avenues:  
- 2019: acquisition of oncology‑focused Array BioPharma for $11.4 billion.  
- 2020: acquisition of a 20 % stake in biotech firm Seagen (later completed in 2023 for $43 billion).  
- 2020: spin‑off of its off‑patent drug business and merger with Mylan to form Viatris, a move partly aimed at simplifying the balance sheet after the failed inversion.

**Industry‑wide impact.** The Treasury’s rules, together with the TCJA, effectively ended the wave of large‑scale inversions that had been common in the early 2010s (e.g., Medtronic‑Covidien, Valeant‑Bausch). Companies shifted focus to domestic R&D investment and strategic acquisitions rather than domicile changes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *The Treasury’s new tax treatment would block the Pfizer‑Allergan inversion.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. Pfizer withdrew the offer in July 2016; the merger never occurred.  

- **Prediction:** *Companies will continue to seek tax‑driven inversions despite the Treasury’s stance.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely false. After 2016, the number of announced inversions dropped from dozens to virtually none, as the regulatory and legislative environment became hostile.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *If the inversion succeeded, Pfizer would enjoy substantial tax savings and possibly shift more operations to Ireland.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized, because the deal was aborted. Pfizer instead benefited later from the 2017 corporate‑tax cut, which reduced the marginal advantage of an inversion.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Political pressure (e.g., from Senator Warren) would influence the outcome.*  
  **Outcome:** Political pressure contributed to the Treasury’s rapid response, but the decisive factor was the regulatory change; the deal’s collapse was primarily a compliance decision rather than a direct legislative veto.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when U.S. tax policy directly altered the strategic direction of the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, and the subsequent regulatory shift reshaped the entire industry’s M&A landscape.
