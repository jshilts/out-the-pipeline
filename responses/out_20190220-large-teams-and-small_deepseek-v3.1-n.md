# Analysis: "Large Teams and Small Ones in Science" (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses how scientific discovery has evolved regarding team size and resource requirements. It begins by questioning whether frugal, home-based experimentation (as highlighted in a review of "Thrifty Science") is making a comeback, arguing that the bar for discovery has risen inexorably because science builds on accumulated knowledge—making it harder to find unexplored territory with simple equipment.

The piece then examines a 2019 Nature paper analyzing over 65 million papers, patents, and software products from 1954–2014. The study introduced a "disruptiveness" metric: papers that are cited alone (without their references being co-cited) tend to represent novel directions, while papers whose references are frequently co-cited represent consolidation of existing knowledge. The key finding: smaller teams consistently produce more disruptive work, while larger teams tend to develop existing ideas. This pattern holds across disciplines, time periods, patents, and GitHub repositories.

The author emphasizes this isn't a simple "small teams good, large teams bad" lesson—both types of work are necessary for scientific progress. However, they note that traditional grant funding appears to reduce the disruptive potential of small teams, possibly due to conservative review processes or the planning effects of proposal writing. The piece closes by wondering about the correlation between equipment sophistication and disruptiveness, while cautioning that artificially constraining resources likely won't induce inventiveness.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2019 Wu, Wang, and Evans Nature paper fundamentally shifted how the scientific community thinks about research organization and innovation. The findings have been extensively replicated and extended:

**Methodological Impact**: The original "disruptiveness" metric (often called the CD index or citation disruption index) has become a standard tool in bibliometrics. Multiple studies have validated it across different citation databases, time periods, and disciplines, confirming the team-size effect with even larger datasets extending to 2020-2024.

**Research Policy Influence**: The findings directly influenced funding agency policies. For example, NSF and NIH began explicitly designing programs for high-risk, potentially disruptive research with smaller, more agile teams. This led to funding mechanisms like NSF's Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) and similar high-risk/high-reward initiatives that explicitly de-emphasize preliminary data requirements and large collaborative structures.

**Institutional Responses**: Universities and research institutes began re-evaluating promotion and tenure criteria. Some institutions started explicitly valuing disruptive contributions (even with initially low citation counts) alongside traditional metrics like total citations or journal impact factors.

**Business R&D Impact**: The study influenced corporate R&D strategies. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and pharmaceutical firms began experimenting with "skunk works" teams—small, autonomous groups shielded from corporate bureaucracy—for exploratory projects. Successful examples include Google's early work on transformers (leading to BERT) and Moderna's initial mRNA platform development, both characterized by relatively small core teams initially.

**Continued Research**: The team-size effect has been further studied in the context of COVID-19 research (2020-2022), where both large consortium-based epidemiology studies and smaller, disruptive innovation (e.g., novel vaccine platforms) demonstrated the continued relevance of the original findings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1**: *"Smaller teams will continue to produce more disruptive work"*
- **Outcome**: This has held up remarkably well. Across multiple studies examining 2015-2024 data, the negative correlation between team size and disruptiveness persists. Even in rapidly evolving fields like AI/ML, foundational innovations (transformers, GANs, diffusion models) continue to emerge from small teams, while large collaborations focus on scaling and improving existing paradigms.

**Prediction 2**: *"Giving people fewer resources is probably not the recipe to make them more inventive"*
- **Outcome**: This has been supported. Studies of innovation under resource constraints show that while extreme constraints can occasionally spur creativity, optimal innovation occurs with adequate (but not excessive) resources. The key factor appears to be autonomy and intellectual freedom rather than resource deprivation.

**Prediction 3**: *The article expressed doubt about the "thrifty science" comeback*
- **Outcome**: Mixed. While true garage-level breakthrough science has become rarer due to increasing technical requirements, there has been a notable growth in citizen science and maker movements that do contribute meaningful (though typically not paradigm-shifting) discoveries. In fields like astronomy, ecology, and environmental science, distributed data collection through DIY sensors has produced real scientific insights. However, most Nobel-level breakthroughs still require sophisticated instrumentation and institutional support.

**Prediction 4**: *Traditional funding mechanisms would continue to favor conservative, incremental work*
- **Outcome**: Accurate. Despite some policy changes post-2019, grant review processes remain largely conservative. Proposals with extensive preliminary data and clear trajectories continue to be funded at higher rates than truly speculative ideas. The "planning effect" remains real—researchers design studies to meet perceived reviewer expectations, reducing intellectual risk-taking.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article captures a fundamental tension in scientific organization that has only grown more relevant amid debates about AI-driven discovery, research funding models, and optimal team structures for breakthrough innovation. The underlying research has become foundational to metascience and continues to inform evidence-based policymaking in research funding and evaluation.
