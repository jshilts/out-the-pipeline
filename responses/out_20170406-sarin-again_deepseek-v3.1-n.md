# Sarin. Again. (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 commentary responds to the reported use of sarin nerve gas in Syria, linking the author's earlier technical explanations of how nerve agents work and the chemistry behind them. The article expresses that sarin's deployment against unarmed civilians is an "affront to civilization" with no legitimate military purpose beyond terror and demonstrating utter disregard for limits. The author argues that efforts in 2013 to remove the Syrian government's chemical stockpiles appear, in hindsight, to have been ineffective—at best a delay—and states it is highly likely the Syrian government carried out the attack, possibly with Russian assistance by keeping Syria's air force operational. The piece frames this event as a grim return to a world where such weapons are deliberately used against civilian populations without warning.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in April 2017, the most significant sarin-related developments occurred within the ongoing Syrian conflict and international response, not in biotechnology or drug development. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) investigated multiple chemical weapons attacks in Syria between 2017 and 2018, confirming sarin use in several instances, leading to renewed but limited international sanctions. No new medical countermeasures specifically for sarin were developed or widely adopted in the years immediately following this article. Existing treatments such as atropine, pralidoxime, and benzodiazepines remained the standard of care, and there were no FDA approvals of new nerve-agent antidotes during this period fueled by these events.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific testable predictions about biotechnology, drug development, medical countermeasures, or business outcomes. The author's comments about the 2013 disarmament efforts being "at best merely postponed their use a bit" were more of a retrospective judgment than a forward-looking prediction, and subsequent chemical attacks did confirm continued possession and willingness to use such agents. There were no predictions about therapeutic targets, clinical trials, drug approvals, or commercial biotech growth tied to this topic.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article concerns chemical warfare policy and conflict rather than biotechnology, offering minimal relevance to the biotech industry, drug development, or scientific research directions. It references but does not expand upon the earlier technical posts on nerve-agent chemistry, and therefore provides little value for assessing biotech trends, failures, or successes.
