# Going Hollywood, For Our Own Good? (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2007 piece from *The Scientist* titled "Why Pharma Must Go Hollywood," which identifies two fundamental causes of pharmaceutical industry productivity problems. The first is the exhaustion of "low-lying fruit" - the easier drug targets that had been exploited in prior decades. The second, more critical cause identified by former R&D director Pedro Cuatrecasas, is the "pervasive mismanagement" of R&D processes that began in the early 1970s when business managers without scientific backgrounds began implementing industrial management techniques like "management by objectives" and "six sigma" methodologies. The article critiques Pfizer's merger-driven strategy (acquiring Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia) as short-term fixes that stifle innovation rather than addressing root causes. The "Hollywood" solution proposed involves learning from movie studios about managing creativity and development processes, acknowledging that drug discovery shares similarities with movie production in terms of uncertainty and the challenge of predicting hits. The article was notable for being published anonymously in *The Scientist*.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated the article's concerns about pharmaceutical R&D productivity, though the "Hollywood" analogy did not notably gain traction as an industry solution. Throughout the late 2000s and 2010s, pharmaceutical companies faced continued R&D productivity challenges, with several factors emerging:

The industry experienced further major mergers, including Pfizer's acquisition of Wyeth in 2009 and attempted acquisition of AstraZeneca in 2014, continuing the consolidation trend criticized in the original article. Many of these mergers resulted in significant R&D workforce reductions and pipeline rationalization rather than enhanced innovation output.

The "six sigma" and process management approaches in pharma R&D continued to be debated. While manufacturing operations benefited from standardization, applying these methods to discovery research remained controversial. Many companies later moved toward more flexible approaches, including open innovation models, academic partnerships, and external venture funding for early-stage research.

R&D productivity metrics showed persistent challenges. Industry-wide R&D spending continued to increase dramatically through the 2010s, but drug approvals faced headwinds. The industry gradually shifted toward more targeted therapies, biologics, and orphan drugs as traditional small-molecule blockbuster models became less viable.

Biotechnology companies and smaller, more agile firms increasingly became the source of innovation, with large pharma companies relying more heavily on licensing and acquisition of late-stage assets from these smaller players. This trend accelerated through the 2010s and beyond.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Management culture change needed**: The article predicted that business-school approaches to R&D management were fundamentally flawed for pharmaceutical innovation. This largely held true, as the industry continued struggling with R&D productivity throughout the subsequent decade, though it remained unclear whether management approaches evolved substantially in response to these critiques.

• **Mergers as short-term solutions**: The critique of Pfizer's merger strategy as ego-driven short-term thinking that stifles innovation proved highly accurate. Subsequent major pharma mergers in the late 2000s and 2010s often resulted in reduced R&D productivity, pipeline cuts, and continued innovation challenges rather than breakthroughs.

• **Hollywood model adoption**: The central proposal that pharma should adopt Hollywood studio models for managing creativity and development did not materialize in any substantial way. While some companies experimented with different organizational structures, the movie production analogy did not become a significant framework for pharmaceutical R&D transformation.

• **External benchmarking value**: The suggestion that pharma had learned all it could from benchmarking other pharma companies and needed to look outside the industry had mixed results. While cross-industry learning occurred in areas like digital transformation and patient engagement, fundamental R&D management approaches remained largely industry-specific.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article highlighted important systemic issues in pharmaceutical R&D management that remained relevant for years afterward, making it prescient in identifying persistent industry challenges. However, the proposed Hollywood solution lacked practical implementation and industry uptake, limiting its broader impact.
