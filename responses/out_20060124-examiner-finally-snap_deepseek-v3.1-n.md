# The Examiner Finally Snaps (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques the practice in pharmaceutical patent applications of filing claims with extremely broad, overlapping scope—starting with a maximal generic structure, followed by dozens of incremental narrowings, and culminating in hundreds or thousands of specific compounds. The author points to examples such as U.S. Patent 6,214,850 and PCT application WO 2002/42272, which allegedly contained 139 pages of claims and hundreds of variables (R‑groups) to illustrate how the complexity appears designed to obscure rather than clarify what is truly claimed. The article's central evidence is an exasperated quote from an International Search Report stating that the voluminous variables and permutations made a meaningful search impossible.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2006 article saw major shifts in how patent offices and courts handle complex pharmaceutical claims:

- **USPTO and EPO procedural reforms**: By the late 2000s and early 2010s, patent offices began imposing stricter requirements on claim clarity and support in the specification. The USPTO's 2011 changes to continuation and claim practice limited the number of claims and prioritized examination tracks. The EPO moved toward requiring "convergent" claim sets rather than long cascades of dependent claims.

- **Key court decisions on enablement**: In the U.S., *Wyeth v. Abbott* (2010) and cases involving antibody claims tightened enablement standards, requiring applicants to show they possessed the full scope of broadly claimed classes. The Federal Circuit's *Idenix v. Gilead* (2019) further emphasized that genus claims must be enabled across their entire scope.

- **Written description impact**: The 2010 *Ariad v. Eli Lilly* decision reaffirmed that written description is a separate requirement from enablement, making it harder to claim vast families of compounds based on narrow disclosure.

- **Rise of biologics and new complexity**: As antibody and recombinant protein patents became more prominent, they presented novel enablement and claim‑drafting challenges that differed from small‑molecule cascades.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions and critiques, evaluated against actual outcomes:

- **Prediction**: Broad pharmaceutical claims lacking enablement would prove unenforceable or be invalidated in litigation due to inadequate support.
  - **Outcome**: **Mixed/Largely validated.** Courts did tighten enablement standards, but many broad claims were upheld where applicants provided adequate genus support and representative examples. The real impact came from heightened scrutiny rather than wholesale invalidation.

- **Critique**: The "mutant fungus" expansion of claims was meant to confuse and irritate, making it harder for others to identify the real scope.
  - **Outcome**: **Partially validated.** Patent offices responded with procedural changes limiting excessive claim numbers, though strategic drafting to obscure boundaries remained a common challenge.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures a real pain point in pharmaceutical patent practice, and its central critique—overly broad, inadequately enabled claims—aligns with subsequent judicial and administrative reforms. However, the topic is a niche aspect of patent law rather than a core issue affecting biotechnology's scientific trajectory or clinical translation.
