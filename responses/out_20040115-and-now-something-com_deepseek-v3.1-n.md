# And Now for Something Completely Different (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses the challenges with patent quality in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly patent applications that are "overstated" or "under-enabled." The author describes a satirical example of a patent application titled "Process of Reincarnation" (US application 200400055535), which claims to combine Einstein's Theory of Relativity and Newton's Second Law to achieve immortality through rebirth. The application is portrayed as absurd, lacking proper prior art references to Buddhist and Hindu traditions, and serves as an extreme example of the low-quality patents that the author claims plague the system. The article suggests that poor patent quality results from applicants filing weak applications and patent examiners granting too many of them.

## 2. HISTORY
In subsequent years, patent quality concerns continued to be a major issue in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. The USPTO faced ongoing criticism for granting patents on questionable inventions, while the industry grappled with "patent thickets" and litigation costs. Notable developments included increased scrutiny of gene patents following the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, which invalidated patents on isolated human genes. The America Invents Act of 2011 attempted to address some patent quality issues through post-grant review procedures. However, concerns about patent quality persisted, with high-profile cases like the "patent troll" phenomenon affecting the technology sector broadly. The specific application mentioned (200400055535) was ultimately abandoned or rejected, as expected given its implausible claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **That the patent application "Process of Reincarnation" would not be approved**: This prediction was correct. The application was never granted and remained an abandoned application, reflecting the USPTO's standards for patentability regarding utility, novelty, and non-obviousness, even though examination standards for other types of patents remained contentious.
- **That the applicant was an "intellectual-property amateur"**: Presumably correct, given the application's lack of proper prior art references to religious texts or philosophical traditions, though this was a facetious commentary point rather than a serious prediction.
- **Implicit prediction that poor patent quality would continue**: This was accurate, as patent quality remained a significant issue in subsequent decades, with legislative and judicial efforts to address the problem having only partial success.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
This article serves mainly as light entertainment rather than serious analysis, focusing on an absurd patent application as a humorous example of broader problems with patent quality. It lacks substantive discussion of policy solutions or empirical evidence, making it of limited long-term importance despite its topic's relevance.
