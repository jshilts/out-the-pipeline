# Cheap, Diverse, Accessible, and Novel: Not All at the Same Time (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post addresses a common challenge faced by academic labs: obtaining chemical matter for screening that hasn't already been heavily explored. The author notes that commercial screening collections suffer from two main biases: they've been seen by everyone else, and they're biased toward synthetically accessible compounds, particularly compounds built from easy-to-make scaffolds with easy-to-make derivatives.

The article suggests that researchers seeking novel hits should explore recent literature for new reactions—such as late-stage functionalization reactions that install fluorine, hydroxy, or amine groups—that create compounds not yet available commercially. However, the author highlights the "philosophical problem" of chemical space being overwhelmingly vast, making it impossible to achieve meaningful coverage. Even hundreds of thousands of compounds barely scratch the surface, especially outside fragment-based approaches where smaller sets can be sufficient.

The recommendation is to prioritize size and structural diversity in screening collections, suggesting that scattered structural diversity may be more valuable than having many analogs of each chemotype. The smaller the compound collection, the more important it becomes to focus on diverse chemical matter rather than clustered series.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2015, several key developments have shaped the field of drug screening and chemical library design:

**DNA-Encoded Library (DEL) Technology Maturation**: Between 2015-2024, DEL platforms became increasingly sophisticated, enabling screening of billions to trillions of compounds against targets—addressing the very diversity gap the article identified. Companies like X-Chem (acquired by Charles River in 2020), Nuevolution, and BergenBio developed robust DEL platforms that generate enormous chemical diversity far exceeding traditional screening collections. This technology has become an industry standard for hit discovery.

**Fragment-Based Drug Discovery Growth**: Fragment-based approaches, which the author noted could work with smaller compound sets (~10,000 fragments), became more widely adopted. The NIH launched fragment libraries, and academic institutions increasingly used fragment screening. By 2024, multiple fragment-derived drugs had reached late-stage clinical development or approval, including inhibitors like AZD5991 and ABBV-744.

**Late-Stage Functionalization Commercialization**: The late-stage functionalization reactions the author highlighted indeed became more accessible. Companies like Enamine, WuXi, and ChemDiv began offering libraries specifically built using C-H activation and other late-stage modifications. The academic developments in photoredox catalysis, electrochemical synthesis, and transition metal catalysis enabled previously impossible functionalizations.

**AI and Virtual Screening Acceleration**: Post-2015 saw the rise of AI-driven virtual screening and generative chemistry. Companies like Exscientia, Atomwise, and Insilico Medicine used machine learning to virtually screen vast chemical spaces efficiently. This partly addresses the challenge that physical libraries, however large, barely cover chemical space.

**Combination Screening Strategies**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted hybrid approaches, combining traditional high-throughput screening, fragment screening, and DNA-encoded libraries to maximize diversity. The goal shifted from simple library size to strategic diversity, somewhat echoing the article's emphasis on structural scattering rather than analog clustering.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about chemical library trends:

• **"These things [new reactions] may well appear in the catalogs at some point, but they're not there yet"** - **PARTIALLY CORRECT**: Late-stage functionalization products did eventually appear in commercial catalogs, but the timeline was longer than implied. Companies like Enamine now offer functionalization-focused libraries, but widespread adoption in standard catalogs remains limited as of 2024.

• **Implicitly suggested that academic labs had limited access to diverse compound sets** - **ACCURATE**: DNA-encoded libraries became a solution to this, but many academic labs still face access limitations due to cost and infrastructure requirements.

• **Emphasis on the vastness of chemical space overwhelming any screening effort** - **STILL ACCURATE**: Despite DEL technology screening trillions of compounds, the fundamental challenge remains. As of 2024, even the largest DEL platforms still represent a tiny fraction of estimated chemical space (10^60-10^100 possible small molecules).

• **"Ten thousand really diverse compounds...is only going to get you a decent hit by sheer blind luck"** - **CONTEXTUALLY ACCURATE**: While true for some targets, fragment libraries with 5,000-10,000 compounds have successfully identified hits for many systems. The statement holds better for traditional high-throughput screening with larger molecular weight compounds.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8/9**

This article identified core challenges in drug discovery that remain highly relevant in 2024. The insights about chemical space diversity, commercial collection limitations, and the tension between novel matter affordability and accessibility proved prescient, particularly in the context of DEL technology development and AI-driven approaches that emerged post-2015.
