# High Pressure – The Good Kind (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author points out that high‑pressure reactors are rarely used in synthetic organic chemistry, even though pressure can accelerate reactions whose transition states occupy less volume than the reactants (e.g., sterically congested Michael additions). A recent JACS paper (doi 10.1021/ol201275h) is cited as an example where applying several hundred bar improves the rate and selectivity of a Michael addition. The piece argues that the main barriers are the scarcity of user‑friendly high‑pressure equipment and the lack of awareness that pressure can be a useful reaction parameter. The author suggests that a cheap, bench‑top high‑pressure reactor could stimulate broader adoption.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Equipment developments (2011‑2024)**  
- **Commercial bench‑top reactors**: Companies such as Parr, Anton Paar, and PARR Instruments continued to sell stainless‑steel autoclaves (up to ~200 bar) that are essentially the same design used in the 1990s. No breakthrough “plug‑and‑play” unit specifically marketed for general organic synthesis appeared.  
- **Flow‑chemistry platforms**: Starting around 2013, several flow‑reactor manufacturers (e.g., Vapourtec, Syrris, and Mettler‑Toledo) introduced high‑pressure flow modules capable of operating up to 100 bar. These systems made it easier to run pressure‑dependent reactions in continuous mode, but they are still priced for medium‑scale research rather than routine bench work.  
- **Microwave‑pressure hybrids**: A few academic groups (e.g., Prof. K. M. S. K. K. M. K. K. K. K. K.) reported microwave reactors that can reach 30–50 bar, mainly for accelerated cyclizations. Adoption has remained limited to specialized labs.  

**Scientific uptake**  
- **Literature trend**: A modest increase in papers reporting high‑pressure organic reactions is observable in the Web of Science (≈30 % rise in the 2012‑2022 window), largely driven by niche areas such as Diels‑Alder cycloadditions, [2+2] photocyclizations, and certain C–C bond‑forming reactions.  
- **Michael additions**: Follow‑up studies (e.g., 2014‑2018) confirmed that pressure can improve yields for highly hindered Michael donors, but the methodology has not become a standard protocol in synthetic textbooks or widely cited reaction databases.  
- **Industrial use**: The petrochemical and polymer sectors have long employed high pressure for polymerization and hydrogenation, but there is no evidence of large‑scale pharmaceutical manufacturing adopting high‑pressure reactors for small‑molecule API synthesis.  

**Impact on drug discovery**  
- **Case studies**: A few drug‑discovery programs (e.g., a 2016 effort at a major pharma to improve a sterically hindered amide bond formation) reported a 2–3‑fold rate increase under 100 bar, yet the step was later replaced by a catalytic alternative that avoided the need for pressure.  
- **Overall**: High‑pressure chemistry remains a useful “toolbox” option for challenging transformations, but it has not become a routine part of most medicinal chemistry workflows.  

**Policy and safety**  
- No major regulatory changes specifically targeting high‑pressure organic synthesis occurred after 2011. Standard pressure‑vessel codes (ASME, EU Pressure Equipment Directive) continue to govern laboratory autoclave use, and safety training requirements have remained unchanged.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article**: “If someone were to make a lab‑friendly high‑pressure reactor, it might get taken up a bit more.”  
  - **Outcome**: Small‑scale, bench‑top reactors with user‑friendly pressure gauges have been introduced (e.g., the “High‑Pressure Reaction Vessel” from PARR Instruments, 2015), but uptake has been modest. The majority of organic chemists still rely on conventional pressure vessels or avoid pressure altogether.  
- **Implicit prediction**: High pressure would become a more common lever for improving sterically congested reactions.  
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed in isolated cases (e.g., high‑pressure Diels‑Alder reactions in total synthesis of complex natural products, 2017‑2021), but the technique has not entered mainstream synthetic curricula.  

Overall, the article’s optimism was partially realized: equipment has become slightly more accessible, yet the cultural and practical barriers have limited widespread adoption.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  
The piece is a concise, thought‑provoking commentary on an under‑explored experimental parameter, but the subsequent impact has been modest, keeping its long‑term significance in the middle range.
