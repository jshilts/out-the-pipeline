# When Placebos Were All There Were (December 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the historical reality that for millennia, medical treatment consisted almost entirely of placebos. It cites Lewis Thomas's memoir recounting how his physician father in the 1920s prescribed complex, mysterious formulations written in Latin—intentionally opaque preparations containing multiple vegetable ingredients that served primarily to reassure patients rather than providing genuine therapeutic benefit.

The piece describes the profound transformation that occurred with the introduction of sulfanilamide, when Thomas witnessed as an intern how patients previously given up for dead recovered dramatically. This marked the moment medicine began transitioning from placebo-based practice to evidence-based therapeutics. The author concludes by emphasizing that current medicine, despite being vastly more effective than historical placebos, should eventually inspire the same "pity and alarm" from future generations, urging continued advancement toward truly curative therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2008 article has seen significant developments, though the fundamental challenges of drug development remain. Major advancements include:

**Drug Development Trends**: Between 2008-2023, the FDA approved approximately 500-600 new drugs, with notable successes in oncology, rare diseases, and immunotherapy. Breakthrough therapies like CAR-T cell therapy (first approved in 2017) and gene therapies (Luxturna approved 2017 for inherited retinal disease) represent paradigm shifts toward more curative approaches.

**R&D Productivity Challenges**: Despite increased R&D spending (global pharmaceutical R&D reached approximately $240+ billion annually by the 2020s), the fundamental problem of high costs and long development timelines persists. The average cost to develop a new drug remains controversial, with estimates ranging from hundreds of millions to billions, and development timelines averaging 10-15 years.

**Evidence-Based Medicine Evolution**: The push for more rigorous evidence has strengthened, with increased emphasis on real-world evidence, comparative effectiveness research, and patient-centered outcomes. Regulatory pathways like breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval have attempted to speed access while maintaining standards.

**Reproducibility Crisis**: The late 2000s-2010s revealed significant reproducibility problems in preclinical research, leading to greater scrutiny of research practices and increased emphasis on rigorous experimental design.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several forward-looking statements that can be evaluated:

• **"Make our children look back on today's medicines with the same mixture of pity and alarm"** - This prediction about future perspective has partially materialized. While today's therapies are dramatically more effective than 1920s medicine, we now view many 2008-era treatments as relatively crude compared to current precision medicine, immunotherapies, and gene therapies. However, the gap between 1920s placebos and 2008 medicine was much larger than between 2008 and today.

• **"These are all very hard things to do, and the amount of time and money needed to do them is nearly unbearable"** - This concern about R&D challenges has proven accurate and arguably worsened. Drug development costs have continued rising, with some analyses suggesting development costs have increased significantly since 2008.

• **The implicit prediction that medicine would continue advancing toward more curative therapies** - This has been validated in specific domains. Gene therapies offer potential cures for previously untreatable genetic diseases, CAR-T therapies can achieve durable remissions in certain cancers, and some antiviral drugs effectively cure conditions like Hepatitis C. However, many therapeutic areas still rely on chronic management rather than cures.

• **Implicit assumption that the placebo era was definitively past** - Interestingly, this has become more complex. While deliberate prescription of inactive placebos has largely disappeared, the 2010s-2020s have seen increased recognition that placebo effects remain important in clinical trials and that patient expectations and context significantly influence treatment outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article provides valuable historical context about medicine's transition from placebo-based practice to evidence-based therapeutics, offering a useful cautionary perspective on modern therapeutic limitations. However, it lacks specific predictions or detailed analysis that would make it highly distinctive among medical commentary.
