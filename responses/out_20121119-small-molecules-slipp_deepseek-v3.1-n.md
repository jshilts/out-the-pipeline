# Small Molecules Slipping Off the List (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article from November 2012 observed a significant shift in the pharmaceutical market, noting that only three small molecule drugs (Advair, Crestor, and Lipitor) remained in the top ten best-selling medications. The author attributed this trend to two main factors: (1) patent expirations that were eroding the market position of blockbuster small molecule drugs, and (2) the relative protection from competition that biologics enjoyed at the time. The piece highlighted how monoclonal antibodies were becoming increasingly dominant in the top revenue positions and suggested this trend would continue.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in 2012 accelerated significantly over the subsequent decade. By 2022, the transformation was stark: biologics dominated the top-selling drug lists even more completely. Humira (adalimumab), Eliquis (apixaban), Keytruda (pembrolizumab), and other biologics regularly occupied the top revenue positions, often generating $10-20+ billion annually.

Specific developments included:
- **Lipitor (atorvastatin)**: Lost patent protection in 2011, leading to dramatic revenue decline from over $13 billion annually to less than $2 billion by 2018
- **Crestor (rosuvastatin)**: Face patent expiration in 2016, with similar revenue erosion following generic competition
- **Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol)**: Encountered increased competition from newer respiratory biologics like Xolair and Nucala, along with generic versions of combination therapies

The biologics market expanded rapidly, driven by monoclonal antibodies for oncology, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions. By 2021-2022, many of the top-selling drugs were biologics treating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (Humira, Enbrel), cancer (Keytruda, Opdivo), and diabetes (Trulicity, Ozempic). 

However, the article's timing preceded the introduction of biosimilar competition, which began gaining FDA approval around 2015 and slowly increased market pressure on biologics. By 2022, biosimilars had captured meaningful market share for some biologics, though penetration remained lower than generic small molecule adoption due to greater complexity and regulatory hurdles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Small molecules would continue to decline in the top-selling lists** - **Mostly accurate**. This prediction largely held true through 2022, though some notable exceptions emerged (see below)

• **Antibodies would maintain dominance in upper rankings** - **Accurate**. Biologics, particularly monoclonal antibodies, continued to dominate top revenue positions throughout the decade

• **Patent expirations would spare biologics (at least for the near future)** - **Partially accurate**. The prediction was correct for 2012-2015 period, but underestimated how quickly biosimilar competition would emerge and intensify. By 2018-2020, major biologics like Remicade and Humira faced meaningful biosimilar competition, though market dynamics differed significantly from small molecule generics

• **It would remain "hard to dislodge those antibodies from the upper reaches"** - **Mostly accurate**. While biosimilars did eventually pressure biologics, therapeutic antibodies maintained strong market positions, often supported by new indications and formulation improvements

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 8/9**

This article demonstrates strong prescience in identifying a fundamental market shift that continued to play out over the subsequent decade. It correctly anticipated the structural changes in pharmaceutical markets driven by patent dynamics and the differentiation between small molecule and biologic competitive landscapes, making it highly relevant for understanding pharmaceutical market evolution.
