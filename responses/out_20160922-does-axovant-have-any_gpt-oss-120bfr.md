# Does Axovant Have Any Hope in Alzheimer’s? (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary warned that Axovant Sciences (AXGT) was a high‑risk play. The company had gone public in mid‑2015 after buying GSK’s shelved 5‑HT₆ antagonist intepirdine (AX‑101) and was trading far above its IPO price. The author noted that other 5‑HT₆ antagonists—Lundbeck’s idalopirdine and Pfizer’s discontinued compound—had just failed Phase III trials, casting serious doubt on whether Axovant’s own trial would succeed. The piece asked why investors should hold the stock given the “flaming incinerator” reputation of Alzheimer’s drug development.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Phase III failure (2017).**  Axovant’s pivotal “MINDSET” trial of intepirdine in mild‑to‑moderate Alzheimer’s disease reported in March 2017 that the drug missed its primary cognitive endpoint and showed no meaningful benefit on secondary measures. The result confirmed the pessimism expressed in the 2016 article.

**Strategic pivot (2018‑2020).**  After the failure, Axovant halted development of intepirdine and began looking for new opportunities. In 2018 the company announced a shift toward gene‑therapy platforms, acquiring a small‑molecule program (AX‑001) that also failed to progress. By 2020 Axovant completed a merger with Sio Gene Therapies, a privately held gene‑therapy company focused on rare neuro‑genetic disorders.

**Rebranding and current focus (2021‑present).**  Following the merger, the combined entity renamed itself **Sio Gene Therapies, Inc.** (ticker SIO). Its pipeline now centers on adeno‑associated virus (AAV) vectors for diseases such as Batten disease (CLN2) and spinal muscular atrophy, with several IND‑enabling studies underway. The original Alzheimer’s program has been completely abandoned; no 5‑HT₆ antagonist has reached market approval to date.

**Financial outcome.**  Axovant’s share price collapsed after the 2017 failure (trading below $1 by late 2017) and never recovered. The later merger gave shareholders a modest cash‑plus‑stock consideration, but the company’s market capitalization is now a fraction of the $315 million raised in the 2015 IPO.

**Industry impact.**  The failure of intepirdine, together with idalopirdine and other 5‑HT₆ antagonists, reinforced the view that this mechanism is unlikely to yield an effective Alzheimer’s therapy. The broader Alzheimer’s field has since shifted toward amyloid‑targeting antibodies (e.g., aducanumab, lecanemab) and tau‑focused approaches, while 5‑HT₆ antagonists have largely disappeared from late‑stage pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** “Why, you have to wonder, would anyone hold Axovant’s stock in anticipation of their 5‑HT₆ results after two similar efforts have both failed?”  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. The Phase III trial failed in 2017, and the stock price collapsed. No subsequent 5‑HT₆ drug from Axovant ever succeeded.

- **Implicit prediction (by the author):** The company’s business model was unsustainable and the Alzheimer’s focus was a “flaming incinerator.”  
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed. Axovant abandoned Alzheimer’s entirely, pivoted to gene therapy, and ultimately rebranded, indicating the original model did not survive.

- **Industry‑wide implication:** The article suggested that 5‑HT₆ antagonists were unlikely to become approved therapies.  
  - **Outcome:** True. As of 2025, no 5‑HT₆ antagonist has received regulatory approval for Alzheimer’s or any other indication.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The piece is a useful snapshot of the hype‑and‑risk cycle in Alzheimer’s biotech at the time, but its content is largely superseded by later events and the company’s complete strategic shift.
