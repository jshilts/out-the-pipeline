# Size Doesn't Matter. Does Anything? (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a Boston Consulting Group study published in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* that examined factors influencing pharmaceutical R&D productivity across 842 molecules from 419 companies between 2002-2011. The study found no correlation between company size and R&D success rates, challenging the common assumption that smaller biotech companies are inherently more productive than large pharmaceutical companies.

The analysis identified several factors that did correlate with success, including publications/patents per R&D dollar, experience of R&D leadership, and higher termination rates in early phases. However, a critical finding was that poor "kill decision" practices plague the industry, with an estimated 90% of R&D expenditures going toward molecules that ultimately fail. The article highlights "progression-seeking behavior" as a major problem, where organizational incentives prioritize project advancement over objective viability assessment. Researchers at Pfizer had found that two-thirds of their Phase I assets that progressed could have been predicted to fail based on available data.

## 2. HISTORY

The fundamental challenges identified in this 2013 article have persisted in the decade-plus since publication. While specific metrics have evolved, the core issues of R&D productivity and decision-making inefficiencies remain central concerns in drug development.

**Industry-Wide Trends**: Between 2013-2023, drug development costs continued to rise, with estimates of bringing a drug to market reaching \$2-3 billion per approved compound. However, success rates have shown modest improvement in some areas, particularly oncology. The emergence of platform technologies (gene therapy, cell therapy, RNA-based therapeutics) created new pathways but also introduced novel complexity in manufacturing and regulatory pathways.

**Clinical Success Rates**: Industry-wide Phase I-to-approval success rates have remained in the 10-15% range, largely consistent with historical patterns. Oncology drugs showed improved success rates (from ~5% to ~9%), while CNS drugs remained challenging with success rates below 8%. Infectious disease development saw significant activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, with accelerated timelines demonstrating that rapid development is possible under certain circumstances.

**Organizational Changes**: Large pharmaceutical companies continued strategic shifts toward external innovation and partnerships with smaller companies. The trend of pharma acquiring successful biotech companies accelerated, particularly for companies with late-stage assets. However, the fundamental tension between early kill decisions and portfolio management remained unresolved across most organizations.

**Notable Developments**: The biotech boom of 2020-2021 led to record funding levels, followed by a downturn in 2022-2023. This cycle illustrated how access to capital affects R&D decision-making and progression-seeking behavior identified in the original article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations about industry trajectory:

• **Company size irrelevance**: The finding that size doesn't correlate with success has largely held true. The biotech landscape continued to feature successful small companies alongside productive large ones, with successful small companies often being acquired when their assets reach late-stage development. However, large companies maintained advantages in commercialization, regulatory expertise, and global reach.

• **Persistence of progression-seeking behavior**: This behavioral challenge has remained entrenched in the industry. Organizational incentives and cultural factors continue to favor project advancement over early termination, contributing to continued high failure costs despite better understanding of the problem. Many companies implemented "portfolio management" strategies, but cultural change has been slower than structural change.

• **Continued 90% failure rates**: Drug development success rates have remained broadly similar, with overall Phase I-to-approval rates staying in the 10-15% range. While predictive biomarkers and better target validation have improved certain therapeutic areas, the fundamental challenges described in the original article continue to drive high attrition rates.

• **Importance of quality decision-making**: The emphasis on better early-stage decision making has grown, with many companies investing in predictive analytics, biomarkers, and portfolio optimization tools. However, implementation has been inconsistent, and many organizations still struggle with the cultural and behavioral aspects identified in the original article.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a persistent, structural challenge in drug development—poor R&D decision-making and its organizational drivers—that remains highly relevant today. While not reporting breakthrough findings, it gave clear voice to problems that have proven stubbornly resistant to improvement despite the intervening decade of technological and scientific progress.
