# Science Magazine Article Analysis: "Jobs, He Says" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critically examines the "STEM skills gap" narrative being promoted by John Lechleiter, then-CEO of Eli Lilly, who argued in Forbes that despite 600,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs, American companies couldn't find qualified STEM workers. Lechleiter claimed this skills gap required better STEM education to maintain US innovation leadership.

The author sharply contrasts this public messaging with Lilly's actual employment practices. Between 2004-2014, Lilly had eliminated around 12,000 jobs through offshoring, outsourcing, and layoffs, with the company's workforce shrinking from 45,835 to roughly 37,000 employees. The author suggests Lechleiter's STEM advocacy serves as a smokescreen for his real message (implied to be about tax and immigration policy) while ignoring the apparent contradiction of a company shedding thousands of jobs claiming it can't find enough qualified workers.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade revealed several critical developments that contextualized this 2014 debate:

**The True Nature of the "STEM Crisis":** Subsequent research, including studies by the Economic Policy Institute and analyses by IEEE and National Science Foundation, showed that the "STEM skills gap" narrative was largely a myth. By 2016-2017, studies demonstrated that STEM graduate supply actually exceeded demand, particularly for domestic workers, with many graduates taking non-STEM jobs or experiencing significant underemployment.

**Lilly's Continued Restructuring:** Eli Lilly continued its aggressive restructuring throughout the 2010s, with additional layoffs announced in 2017 (around 3,500 employees worldwide) and continued shifts of operations to lower-cost locations. The company did increase its workforce by 2019-2020 to approximately 35,000 employees globally, though with significant geographic redistribution toward international markets.

**Industry-Wide Patterns:** The pharmaceutical industry broadly replicated Lilly's pattern—extensive outsourcing (especially to India and China), contract research organizations absorbing much of the workforce, and significant cost reductions in traditional R&D centers. Data from 2016-2020 showed contract research organizations growing 30-50% faster than traditional pharma employment, suggesting companies were paying less for similar labor rather than facing a shortage.

**Covid-19 Impact:** The pandemic ironically validated some STEM worker importance while exacerbating contradictions. Emergency needs created surging demand for biotech/pharma workers, yet companies continued aggressive cost-cutting measures during 2020-2024, showing that perceived labor scarcity didn't translate into employment security or improved conditions for many domestic STEM workers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Wrong Predictions:**

1. **Perpetuation of the STEM skills gap narrative:** The article implied this narrative would continue and extended scrutiny might continue exposing its contradictions. In reality, by 2017-2018, many industry groups, policy analysts, and academics widely acknowledged that the STEM shortage was largely fabricated, with even presidential advisory reports disputing the claim.

2. **Continued job destruction at Lilly:** While restructuring continued, Lilly's employment has shown some stabilization and even modest growth in recent years (though still below 2004 levels). Some geographic diversification occurred, but predictions of major biotech employment collapse proved overly pessimistic.

3. **Expansion of CRO business models:** The author identified early trends towards CRO expansion, but the scale and speed of this growth—with companies like IQVIA, Labcorp, and Parexel absorbing huge percentages of pharma work—exceeded most 2014 projections, indicating even more profound industry transformation than recognized.

**Correct Predictions:**

1. **Contradiction between corporate layoffs and STEM shortage claims:** This proved correct in spades. Subsequent analyses repeatedly documented companies promoting skills shortages while simultaneously laying off experienced workers or hiring cheaper contingent labor, validating the author's central thesis, including specific verification in Lilly's case.

2. **Tax/immigration agenda driving corporate messaging:** This was prescient, as subsequent policy debates around corporate tax cuts often leveraged STEM shortage claims, and H1-B visa reform discussions often revealed preferences for lower-cost foreign labor—exactly the points raised by critics in 2014.

3. **Advocacy for improved STEM education serving corporate interests:** This remained consistently relevant as corporate STEM education initiatives often supplemented rather than countered restructuring strategies, confirming that such advocacy rarely translated into jobs for domestic STEM graduates.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article ranks in the 70th-79th percentile of interest and importance. It accurately identified a major economic fallacy being promoted by powerful corporate interests, demonstrating the importance of journalistic scrutiny in the face of seemingly consensus views. The piece went beyond simple debunking by connecting corporate messaging to underlying economic transformations and restructuring strategies that proved enduringly significant.

However, it falls short of the highest deciles (8-9) because its focused scope primarily addressed the intersection of corporate messaging and labor economics rather than broader transformative technological changes or founding principles affecting biotechnology. The contradictions it identified were important but remain within a comparative contemporary framework of labor markets rather than benchmark foundational lessons applicable across longer-term contexts.
