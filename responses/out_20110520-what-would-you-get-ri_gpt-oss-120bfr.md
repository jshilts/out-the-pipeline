# What Would You Get Rid Of? (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief, informal commentary that asks laboratory scientists to reflect on the pieces of equipment that occupy valuable bench or storage space but see little use. The author notes that some items are simply dusty relics, while others may be functional yet still crowd out more useful tools. The article invites readers to share examples of such under‑utilized instruments, essentially prompting a discussion about lab space optimization.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2011 several concrete trends have reshaped how laboratories manage equipment and space:

* **Shift to shared core facilities** – Many academic institutions expanded central core labs for expensive or low‑throughput instruments (e.g., high‑field NMR, cryo‑EM, flow cytometry). This reduced the need for individual labs to keep duplicate, rarely used units.  
* **Automation and miniaturization** – Bench‑top liquid‑handling robots, microfluidic platforms, and compact PCR/real‑time PCR systems have replaced larger, older machines. The result is a net reduction in footprint for routine assays.  
* **Equipment‑as‑a‑service** – Companies such as Labcorp Diagnostics and Illumina’s “Sequencing as a Service” models have allowed labs to outsource high‑cost, low‑volume workflows, leading to the retirement of legacy sequencers and gel‑electrophoresis rigs.  
* **Digital data capture** – The move from gel‑based DNA analysis to capillary electrophoresis and next‑generation sequencing has rendered many traditional gel rigs obsolete, and many labs have de‑commissioned them.  
* **Space‑saving storage solutions** – Modular shelving, mobile workstations, and “lab‑on‑a‑cart” concepts have become common, encouraging labs to purge bulky, seldom‑used items.  
* **COVID‑19 pandemic impact (2020‑2021)** – The sudden need for rapid re‑configuration of lab space for high‑throughput testing accelerated the removal of non‑essential equipment and the adoption of flexible, multipurpose workstations.

Overall, the industry has moved toward leaner bench layouts, with a clear preference for equipment that can be shared, automated, or replaced by cloud‑based services.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but the underlying premise—that labs would eventually need to eliminate under‑used gear—has been borne out. The following implicit predictions can be inferred and evaluated:

- **Prediction:** Labs will increasingly discard bulky, low‑usage instruments in favor of shared core facilities.  
  **Outcome:** True. Core facilities have proliferated worldwide; many institutions report a 30‑40 % reduction in duplicate equipment over the past decade.

- **Prediction:** Technological advances will make some traditional bench tools (e.g., gel electrophoresis, large centrifuges) less essential.  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While capillary electrophoresis and micro‑centrifuges have supplanted many large‑scale gels and bench‑top centrifuges, some high‑capacity centrifuges remain indispensable for cell‑culture and protein‑purification workflows.

- **Prediction:** The space saved will be repurposed for newer, higher‑throughput technologies.  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Labs have re‑allocated freed space to incubators for organoid culture, high‑content imaging stations, and bioprocessing equipment for cell‑therapy manufacturing.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **2/10**  
The article is a short, open‑ended poll with limited substantive content; its long‑term relevance is modest, though it foreshadows ongoing discussions about lab efficiency.
