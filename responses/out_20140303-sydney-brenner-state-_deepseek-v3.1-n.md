# Sydney Brenner on the State of Science (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article summarizes Sydney Brenner's critical views on the contemporary scientific research culture, drawn from a Retraction Watch interview. Brenner argued that American graduate education had become a culture of "slavery" where graduate students and postdocs function as "indentured labourers" performing under pressure rather than developing independent ideas. He criticized the risk-aversion of funding bodies, stating that bureaucratic science supporters only fund projects guaranteed to work from the start, forcing researchers into safe, predictable paths.

Brenner contended that truly original science requires the freedom to pursue "deviant studies" - radically different approaches - but the current system prevents this. Using Fred Sanger as an example, he argued that today's continuous reporting and appraisal culture would have labeled Sanger unproductive due to long gaps between major breakthroughs (insulin in 1952, RNA sequencing in 1967, DNA sequencing in 1977). Brenner also condemned peer review as "completely corrupt," arguing it represents regression to the mean and has handed scientific judgment to journal editors and commercial publishers more interested in commerce than science.

## 2. HISTORY

Brenner's 2014 critique proved remarkably prescient about ongoing trends in scientific culture. The issues he identified have persisted and in some cases intensified:

**Academic Labor Conditions**: Graduate student and postdoc working conditions remain contentious. Unionization efforts have increased at multiple universities, with strikes and protests over stipends, benefits, and working conditions becoming more common. The "postdoc crisis" - referring to long training periods, poor job prospects, and unsustainable workloads - became widely discussed, though substantive reforms have been limited.

**Funding Risk-Aversion**: Funding agencies have made some attempts to address risk aversion, such as the NIH's "High-Risk, High-Reward" program, though these remain small components of overall funding. The general trend toward conservative, incremental research proposals has continued, with success rates at major agencies remaining low and pressure for preliminary data increasing.

**Publication Culture**: The focus on high-impact journals has persisted, with Nature, Science, and Cell continuing to dominate academic prestige hierarchies. However, alternative models have gained traction. Preprint servers (bioRxiv, arXiv) have expanded significantly, allowing faster dissemination without traditional peer review. Open access mandates have increased, with funders like the Gates Foundation and governments requiring publicly funded research to be freely available.

**Metrification**: Journal impact factors remain deeply embedded in hiring and promotion decisions despite growing recognition of their limitations. Some institutions have begun de-emphasizing them, and alternative metrics (Altmetrics, preprint citations) are gaining acceptance, but impact factor culture remains dominant.

**Scientific Publishing**: Commercial publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) have maintained strong profit margins and market control. However, institutional pushback has grown through negotiations over subscription costs (e.g., University of California system's Elsevier contract dispute) and support for open access alternatives.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Brenner's predictions about scientific culture trends were largely accurate in direction, though the timeline and extent varied:

• **Implicit Prediction: Research culture would continue deteriorating without intervention**
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. Conditions have not dramatically worsened, but the underlying issues persist. Unionization and advocacy efforts have increased, but fundamental power imbalances and incentive structures remain largely unchanged.

• **Implicit Prediction: Risk-averse funding would increasingly inhibit breakthrough science**
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. Conservative funding patterns continue, and breakthrough research often faces barriers. However, some major discoveries have still emerged (CRISPR, mRNA vaccines), suggesting alternative pathways exist despite systemic constraints. The system does select against certain types of long-term, high-risk projects.

• **Implicit Prediction: Peerreview's flaws would become more problematic**
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Oversaturation of the review system, inadequate reviewer incentives, bias problems, and reproducibility crises have become more acute. Preprints and post-publication review have emerged as partial alternatives, but traditional peer review remains central to scientific communication.

• **Implicit Prediction: Commercial publishers' influence would grow**
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Large publishers have consolidated power through acquisitions and new service offerings. Profit margins remain extremely high, and open access has often benefited publishers through article processing charges rather than reducing their central role.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses enduring structural problems in scientific research culture that remain highly relevant. Brenner identified core dysfunctions (funding risk-aversion, publication incentives, labor conditions) that continue to shape scientific progress and researcher experiences.
