# Five Minutes With Any Journal Article You Want? (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses DeepDyve's announcement of a new service offering free five-minute access to full-text scientific journal articles for non-subscribers. The author notes that while five minutes isn't enough to fully read an article, it's sufficient to evaluate whether paying for full access would be worthwhile, and for chemists and biologists, it's adequate time to check experimental procedures. The service covered major publishers including Elsevier, Wiley, and Royal Society of Chemistry journals, plus Nature, but notably excluded Science, Journal of Biological Chemistry, American Chemical Society journals, and several specialized chemistry publications. The author positions this as potentially "the best of a number of not-so-good options" for researchers without institutional journal access.

## 2. HISTORY

DeepDyve's five-minute access model represented an early attempt to address the scientific paywall problem, but it failed to gain significant traction. Major developments in scientific publishing after 2013 took very different directions:

**The Rise of Preprint Servers**: bioRxiv launched in November 2013 (just months after this article), followed by chemRxiv in 2017. These platforms fundamentally changed scientific communication by making research freely available before peer review, reducing reliance on paywalled journals for early access to new findings.

**Open Access Momentum**: The period saw substantial growth in legitimate Open Access publishing. PLOS ONE became massively successful, publishing over 30,000 articles annually during 2013-2015. Scientific Reports (Nature's OA journal) and numerous other OA journals proliferated, along with institutional repositories and mandates from funding agencies requiring public access to research outputs.

**Sci-Hub's Disruption**: Sci-Hub emerged around 2011-2012 in Kazakhstan and gained widespread notoriety by 2015, providing free illegal access to virtually all paywalled scientific articles. Love it or hate it, this forced a real conversation about the sustainability of traditional paywalls and prompted publishers to evolve some of their practices.

The five-minute access model became largely irrelevant as researchers found better alternatives—both legal (preprints, OA journals, institutional repositories) and illegal (Sci-Hub). DeepDyve continued operating but never achieved dominant market position in scientific publishing access.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't include explicit predictions about the future of scientific publishing. Instead, it focused on evaluating DeepDyve's then-current offering. The implicit assumption was that incremental solutions like five-minute access might provide practical value for researchers stuck behind paywalls.

This contrasts sharply with what actually happened: rather than incremental improvements to paywall access, the scientific community moved toward fundamentally different models (preprints, OA mandates, legal/illegal bypass solutions).

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

This article captures a snapshot of scientific publishing's awkward transition period but describes a solution that quickly became obsolete. It represents one of many failed attempts to patch rather than replace the traditional paywall model.
