# Work and home have left me little time for blogging today (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief blog post from September 29, 2017, where the author apologizes for not having time to blog due to work and home commitments. The author previews upcoming topics including working with larger-than-normal drug molecules, insights on covalent compounds in living systems, and "chemistry in Flatland." The post serves primarily as a placeholder announcing that regular content will resume on Monday.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a blog announcement from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which covers pharmaceutical chemistry and drug discovery. The blog has continued publishing regularly since 2017 and remains an influential voice in medicinal chemistry. The topics previewed in this post align with themes that have remained relevant in drug discovery, including interest in covalent inhibitors and exploration of molecular size constraints. However, this specific post contains no substantive scientific content to track subsequent developments against.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The post made no meaningful predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical development. The reference to "upcoming" topics were simply blog post topics, not forecasts about the industry. Given the post's nature as a brief hiatus announcement, there are no predictions to evaluate against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This is a brief administrative blog post with no scientific content or analysis, serving only to announce a temporary pause in regular posting.
