# More Vaccine Fearmongering (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Katie Couric's talk show for what the author characterizes as irresponsible fearmongering about the HPV vaccine. The piece references Seth Mnookin's book "The Panic Virus," which documented the vaccine/autism controversy, and notes that despite initial assurances from Couric's producers that they understood the dangers of declining vaccination rates and would not present the HPV vaccine as an "on the one hand, on the other hand" issue, the show ultimately embraced sensationalistic, anecdote-driven coverage that prioritized ratings over scientific evidence. The author argues this represents another round of the same harmful pattern where emotional stories override large-scale clinical data.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the December 2013 controversy, several key developments occurred:

**About Katie Couric's show:** The HPV vaccine segment aired and drew significant criticism from the scientific and medical communities. Couric later acknowledged the criticism and published an explanatory post, though many critics felt it didn't adequately address the harm done.

**HPV vaccine evidence and adoption:** Subsequent years have strengthened the evidence base for HPV vaccines. Large-scale epidemiological studies have continued to demonstrate their safety and efficacy. The CDC reports that HPV vaccination has led to significant reductions in HPV infections and precancerous cervical lesions. As of 2024, HPV vaccines remain part of routine immunization schedules in many countries.

**Vaccine hesitancy impact:** The controversy occurred during a period when vaccine hesitancy was becoming more prominent. While HPV vaccine uptake has generally increased over time, it has faced ongoing challenges from misinformation campaigns. Some studies have shown correlations between media coverage of vaccine controversies and temporary declines in vaccination rates, though linking specific coverage to specific outcomes is methodologically challenging.

**Regulatory developments:** The FDA maintained approval of HPV vaccines throughout this period, and the vaccines continued to be recommended by major public health organizations including the CDC, WHO, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not include explicit forward-looking predictions about measurable outcomes or timelines that could be empirically evaluated against later developments. The piece was primarily focused on criticism of media practices rather than forecasting specific future events.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/9**

The article addresses the important intersection of media responsibility, scientific communication, and public health, which has become increasingly relevant as vaccine hesitancy has grown. The specific controversy documented here connects to broader challenges faced by scientific communities in maintaining public trust and combating misinformation.
