# Making Cells Do Your Work (Also, The Revenge of the Yeast) (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post discusses how biotechnology leverages cells and their enzymatic machinery to perform chemical transformations that are difficult to achieve through synthetic chemistry. While protein production via recombinant cell culture is well-established, small molecule manufacturing using cellular pathways remains more limited—primarily restricted to specific natural products like antibiotics and taxol starting materials where existing cellular machinery is already optimized.

The article highlights yeast as a particularly useful system for chiral reductions, a technique that has been employed for decades in synthetic chemistry. Researchers can screen different yeast strains or isolated enzymes to find suitable biocatalysts for specific transformations. The post also covers a research paper describing microfluidic technology to screen enzyme activity at the several-hundred-cell level using engineered E. coli, suggesting this could eventually lead to rapid screening of large mutant libraries at single-cell resolution.

The article concludes with an anecdote about baking yeast's vigorous fermentation, humorously emphasizing both the power and unruliness of these biological systems.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following this 2016 article saw significant advancement in the engineering of cellular systems for small molecule production and the miniaturization technologies discussed.

**Microfluidic Screening and Single-Cell Analysis:** The microfluidic approach mentioned in the 2016 ACS paper (JACS 2015) represented the beginning of a broader trend. By 2016-2020, single-cell screening technologies advanced substantially with commercial platforms like the 10x Genomics Chromium system (launched ~2017) and Drop-seq method gaining widespread adoption. These technologies enabled high-throughput screening of single cells, achieving what the article hoped for—though primarily focused on genomics and transcriptomics rather than enzymatic screening.

**Metabolic Engineering and Synthetic Biology:** Between 2016-2024, the field of metabolic engineering for small molecule production expanded considerably. The article's mention of cells making "unnatural products" from different substrates became increasingly sophisticated. For example:
- Amyris successfully scaled production of artemisinic acid (antimalarial precursor) using engineered yeast
- Companies like Ginkgo Bioworks (founded 2009, went public 2021) specialized in high-throughput screening and engineering of cellular systems for industrial applications
- The synthetic biology market grew to over $10 billion by 2022, with companies like Zymergen (founded 2013, acquired 2022 by Ginkgo) focusing on strain engineering for chemical production
- Anti-obesity drugs like semaglutide (approved 2017, massive uptake in 2021-2024) are produced using recombinant E. coli fermentation—validating the protein production approach mentioned in the article

**Automation and High-Throughput Screening:** The "speed the day" wish for rapid screening of mutant libraries became reality through automated systems. By 2020, robotic liquid handlers, automated plate readers, and machine learning-guided experiment design significantly accelerated the development cycle for engineered enzymes and pathways.

**Continued Yeast Bioreduction:** The article's friendly yeast reduction anecdote remained relevant—throughout 2016-2024, both industrial and academic labs continued using yeast and other whole-cell biocatalysts for chiral synthesis. The technique retained its niche, but was largely superseded by directed evolution of isolated enzymes with greater control and predictability.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions, mostly implicit:

- **Would lead to single-cell screening of enzymes:** ✓ **Partial Match**  
  Single-cell analysis technologies exploded after 2016, but primarily for genomics/transcriptomics, not functional enzyme screening. Functional screening remained mostly at higher cell numbers, though some flow cytometry-based methods approached single-cell resolution.

- **Screening huge numbers of individual cells would quickly yield good enzymatic starting points:** ✓ **Match**  
  High-throughput screening became routine in both academic and commercial labs. Companies like Ginkgo Bioworks employed massive automation, screening thousands of variants daily, broadly achieving this prediction.

- **Engineered cells would become useful for broader small molecule production:** ✓ **Match**  
  Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology grew substantially. Companies successfully scaled engineered cellular systems for producing everything from biofuels to fragrances to pharmaceuticals, beyond the antibiotics and taxol precursors mentioned in 2016.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides valuable perspective from the synthetic chemistry viewpoint and its modest predictions were largely validated by subsequent technological advancement and market growth in synthetic biology. The yeast anecdote makes it memorable, although the content itself is more technically narrow and personal than a comprehensive overview of the field.
