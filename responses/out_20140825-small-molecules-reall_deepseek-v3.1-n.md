# Small Molecules - Really, Really Small (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a short commentary reflecting on the smallest compounds used as drugs, prompted by mention of pirfenidone. The author presents a graphic showing the smallest commonly used drugs and notes that some very small molecules have proven highly effective and commercially successful. The piece emphasizes that medicinal chemists should maintain an open mind about small molecules regardless of size, as even tiny compounds can be "very good indeed at what they do, and have been wildly successful." The author explicitly excludes cocaine (used as a nasal anesthetic) from the "commonly used" list. The article acknowledges the list is incomplete and invites reader nominations for additions, noting that updates would follow.

## 2. HISTORY

The central example of pirfenidone has a notable post-2014 trajectory. **Pirfenidone (Esbriet)** was already FDA-approved in 2013 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), prior to this article. After 2014, it maintained its position as one of only two approved drugs for IPF (alongside nintedanib). The drug demonstrated sustained clinical use and market presence, though with well-documented side effects including photosensitivity, gastrointestinal issues, and liver enzyme elevations. No major new indications were approved for pirfenidone post-2014, but it remained a standard-of-care therapy for IPF.

Regarding the broader context of small molecules in drug development, the period after 2014 saw continued importance of small molecules alongside the rise of biologics. Small molecules maintained advantages in oral bioavailability and manufacturing, and the industry continued exploring both small molecules and larger biologics. However, the "size" focus in this short article is more a curiosity than a major trend, and the field continued its usual mix of small and large molecule development without dramatic shifts specific to molecular size.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction that small molecules would remain important**: The article essentially argued that small molecular weight shouldn't disqualify compounds from drug development consideration. **Outcome**: Small molecules indeed remained important. The industry did not move away from small molecules, and numerous small-molecule drugs continued to be developed and approved post-2014. This basic prediction held true, though it was already an established principle.

- **Suggestion that the list would be updated**: The author planned to keep the list current and invited nominations. **Outcome**: The article itself notes a "follow-up post" existed, but the extent of ongoing updates or community participation cannot be determined from the present text.

The article made no specific predictions about individual drugs, mechanisms, regulatory policies, or broader industry trends beyond the general value of small molecules. The piece was more observational than predictive.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article is a minor blog-style observation with limited depth or broader implications. While it touches on legitimate concepts in medicinal chemistry, it lacks the substance, data, or forward-looking analysis needed for significant long-term interest. It's essentially a brief musing on molecular size with some drug examples, rather than serious analysis of the biotechnology industry.
