# There Will Be No More Woodwards  
*15 Oct 2012*

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece, written by Derek Lowe, muses on whether a field can still produce a “Titan” like Robert B. Woodward, whose mid‑20th‑century total syntheses defined organic chemistry. Using analogies from music (Bach) and art, Lowe argues that once a discipline’s foundational tools are in place, the room for singular, world‑shaking achievements shrinks. He suggests that modern organic synthesis is now a “cleared brush” where incremental methodological advances replace the spectacular, large‑scale total syntheses that once captured the imagination. The article ends with a firm prediction: we will not see another chemist of Woodward’s stature, and attempts to emulate his style would be a misallocation of effort.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened in organic synthesis after 2012?**  

| Development | Concrete impact (2012‑2024) |
|---|---|
| **Rise of C–H activation & photoredox catalysis** | Methods that directly functionalise C–H bonds (e.g., MacMillan’s photoredox‑enabled C–H arylations, 2014‑2020) have become routine in both academic labs and pharma process chemistry, allowing shorter routes to complex molecules without the protecting‑group gymnastics that dominated Woodward‑era syntheses. |
| **Biocatalysis and engineered enzymes** | Companies such as Novartis, Merck, and startups (e.g., Evolva, Codexis) now use engineered enzymes for stereoselective steps in drug synthesis. The 2018 FDA‑approved drug **Islatravir** (Merck) is made largely by a biocatalytic cascade, illustrating that “green” enzymatic steps have moved from proof‑of‑concept to commercial scale. |
| **Modular, convergent synthesis & “click” chemistry** | The widespread adoption of Suzuki‑Miyaura, Buchwald‑Hartwig, and copper‑catalysed azide‑alkyne cycloaddition reactions has turned many total syntheses into “assembly‑line” processes. For example, the 2020 commercial production of the anticancer agent **lorlatinib** uses a convergent Suzuki coupling as a key step, reducing the overall step count compared with older linear routes. |
| **Automation & AI‑driven retrosynthesis** | Platforms such as **IBM RXN**, **Chematica (now Synthia)**, and **Synple Chem’s automated synthesizer** have been demonstrated to plan and execute multi‑step syntheses with minimal human intervention. In 2021, an automated flow system completed a 7‑step synthesis of the drug **Ritonavir** in under 24 h, showing that the “fireworks” of manual, labor‑intensive total synthesis are being replaced by reproducible, high‑throughput workflows. |
| **Continued total syntheses, but with different goals** | High‑profile total syntheses (e.g., Baran’s 2015 synthesis of **(+)-cortistatin A**, 2020 synthesis of **(+)-gelsemine** by the Carreira group, 2022 synthesis of **pseudolaric acid B** by the Shenvi group) still appear in top journals. However, they are now framed as showcases of new methodology (e.g., C‑H functionalisation, radical cascades) rather than as stand‑alone feats of synthetic virtuosity. |
| **Industry shift away from “big‑molecule” total synthesis** | Pharmaceutical companies have largely moved away from de‑novo total synthesis of drug candidates, preferring **process‑focused route optimisation** and **late‑stage functionalisation**. The 2018 FDA approval of **Lurbinectedin** (a marine‑derived alkaloid) relied on a semi‑synthetic route from a readily available natural precursor, not a full Woodward‑style total synthesis. |
| **Educational and cultural changes** | Graduate curricula now emphasise **synthetic design principles** (step‑economy, redox‑economy, sustainability) and **computational tools**. The “hero‑chemist” narrative has been supplanted by a collaborative, interdisciplinary model that includes chemists, biologists, and data scientists. |

Overall, the field has become **method‑centric and platform‑oriented**. The spectacular, multi‑year, “heroic” total syntheses that defined Woodward’s era are now rare, and when they occur they serve primarily as **demonstrations of new technology** rather than as the sole scientific achievement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article makes a single explicit forecast: **“There will, I'd say, never be another R.B. Woodward.”** Below is an evaluation of that claim and of the implicit prediction that the field would shift away from grand‑scale heroic syntheses.

| Prediction | Outcome (2012‑2024) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **No new chemist comparable to Woodward will appear** | No individual has achieved the combination of *foundational theory (e.g., Woodward–Hoffmann rules)*, *iconic total syntheses*, and *lasting cultural impact* that Woodward did. Contemporary “synthetic stars” (e.g., Phil Baran, K. C. Nicolaou, Jin‑Quan Yu) are highly respected but are viewed as **methodologists** rather than as singular, paradigm‑shifting figures. | **Correct** – the prediction holds up. |
| **Organic synthesis will become less about heroic total syntheses and more about enabling technologies** | The explosion of C–H activation, photoredox, biocatalysis, and AI‑driven planning has indeed redirected research focus. Recent high‑impact papers are method‑focused; total syntheses are now “proof‑of‑concept” for those methods. | **Correct** – the field’s trajectory matches the article’s expectation. |
| **The “end of the frontier” in chemistry is unlikely; practical frontiers remain endless** | New reaction manifolds (e.g., electrochemical C–N bond formation, machine‑learned retrosynthesis) continue to open. The pharmaceutical pipeline still demands novel molecules, and synthetic chemistry remains a bottleneck that drives innovation. | **Correct** – the practical frontier is still expanding. |

No other explicit predictions were made, so the table is limited to the central thesis.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is thought‑provoking because it frames a historical debate (the possibility of “great men” in modern science) in the concrete context of organic synthesis, and its central prediction has proven prescient. It is not groundbreaking research, but it offers a clear, well‑argued perspective that remains relevant to discussions about the future of chemistry.
