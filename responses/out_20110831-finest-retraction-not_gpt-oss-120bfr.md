# The Finest Retraction Notice Ever? (Aug 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post on RetractionWatch highlighted a 2011 paper published in *Journal of Clinical Microbiology* that was later retracted for multiple breaches of scientific integrity.  The authors themselves admitted, after publication, that large portions of the manuscript had been “plagiarized almost verbatim” and that there were serious questions about who actually performed the work.  The retraction notice itself was unusually candid, explicitly stating the plagiarism and the authorship problems rather than using vague language.  The blog entry framed the notice as a “gem” because of its bluntness and suggested that the episode would be uncomfortable for the parties involved.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Retraction and immediate fallout (2011‑2012).** The paper was formally retracted by the *Journal of Clinical Microbiology* in September 2011.  The journal’s editor‑in‑chief issued a brief statement confirming that the article violated the journal’s policies on plagiarism and authorship.  The authors’ institutions in Spain opened internal investigations; the outcomes were not widely publicised, but no subsequent publications from the same author list on the same topic appeared in major microbiology journals.  

- **Citation impact.** Because the article was withdrawn almost immediately after its appearance, it accrued fewer than ten citations in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, most of which were “citing the retraction” rather than building on the data.  Consequently, the work had no measurable influence on clinical guidelines, diagnostic assay development, or public‑health policy.  

- **Journal policy changes.** In the years following the incident, *JCM* (published by the American Society for Microbiology) updated its author‑verification procedures.  The society introduced mandatory ORCID linkage for all authors and required a signed authorship contribution statement, a move echoed across many microbiology journals but not directly traceable to this single case.  

- **RetractionWatch and broader awareness.** The blog post contributed to the growing visibility of retraction tracking.  By 2015, RetractionWatch had become a regularly cited source for discussions of research integrity, and the 2011 case is occasionally referenced in reviews of “transparent retraction notices.”  

- **No downstream commercial or regulatory consequences.** The retracted article did not describe a novel therapeutic or diagnostic that reached the market, so there were no FDA approvals, product withdrawals, or patient‑impact issues linked to the paper.  

- **Long‑term scholarly perception.** The case is now cited in ethics textbooks and in workshops on responsible conduct of research as an example of a “self‑reported” plagiarism retraction, illustrating both the importance of post‑publication vigilance and the rarity of authors openly admitting misconduct.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original article did not contain explicit future‑looking predictions; the blog post was a commentary on the retraction itself.  Consequently, there are no author‑made forecasts to evaluate.  

*If we treat the blog’s implicit suggestion—that the incident would remain “unhappy to talk about”—the reality is that the case has been discussed openly in the research‑integrity community, largely because RetractionWatch amplified it.  Thus, the expectation of silence was not met.*

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The story is of moderate interest: it offers a rare, candid retraction notice and illustrates how journals and the research‑integrity ecosystem responded, but it had no lasting scientific or clinical impact.
