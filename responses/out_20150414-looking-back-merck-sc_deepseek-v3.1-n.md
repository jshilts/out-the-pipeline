# Where Are the Five Stars? Looking Back At Merck/Schering-Plough (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The April 2015 article reviews the aftermath of Merck's 2009 acquisition of Schering-Plough, focusing on the failure of CEO Fred Hassan's promised "five stars"—blockbuster drugs that were supposed to drive post-merger success. The five highlighted compounds were: golimumab (rheumatoid arthritis, with J&J), Saphris (antipsychotic), Bridion (reversal agent), vorapaxar (anticlotting), and boceprevir (hepatitis C).

The article notes that while all five drugs reached the market (Bridion outside the US), none delivered significant revenue impact for Merck. The company's annual sales declined from 2011 through 2014, falling to $42.2 billion by 2014, partly due to patent expirations on older drugs. The ironic twist highlighted is that Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which came through Schering-Plough's 2007 acquisition of Organon, emerged as the most valuable asset—yet it was barely mentioned in merger announcements and considered insignificant at the time of the deal. The piece critiques the overconfident salesmanship typical of pharmaceutical mergers.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent development of these assets since 2015 reveals a mixed but largely disappointing trajectory:

**Golimumab (Simponi)**: Remained on the market but faced intense competition in the crowded TNF-inhibitor space (alongside Humira, Enbrel, Remicade). While generating moderate revenue, it never achieved true blockbuster status compared to market leaders. Merck and J&J continued marketing it through their partnership.

**Saphris (asenapine)**: The atypical antipsychotic struggled significantly due to tolerability issues and sublingual administration requirements. It faced generic competition after losing patent protection and never achieved major market penetration compared to other second-generation antipsychotics like aripiprazole or quetiapine.

**Bridion (sugammadex)**: This neuromuscular blockade reversal agent finally gained FDA approval in the US in 2015—the article's timing was prescient. Since approval, Bridion has become widely adopted in anesthesia practice due to its unique mechanism and faster, more predictable reversal compared to traditional anticholinesterase agents. It generated over $1 billion annually for Merck in subsequent years and is generally considered a clinical success, though it arrived later than Hassan's 2008 predictions.

**Vorapaxar (Zontivity)**: FDA-approved in 2014, this PAR-1 antiplatelet agent faced significant challenges. Bleeding risk concerns limited its use, and it found only niche applications rather than broad adoption in cardiovascular disease. Market uptake was disappointing compared to initial expectations.

**Boceprevir (Victrelis)**: This hepatitis C protease inhibitor was rapidly eclipsed by superior direct-acting antivirals. Gilead's sofosbuvir (Sovaldi, 2013) and subsequent combinations (Harvoni, 2014) offered oral, interferon-free regimens with higher cure rates and better tolerability. Boceprevir became largely obsolete by 2015-2016 as the hepatitis C treatment paradigm shifted completely. It's now discontinued.

**Keytruda (pembrolizumab)**: The article's prediction proved remarkably accurate. Keytruda became Merck's top-selling drug and one of the most important cancer therapies ever developed. By 2024, it generated over $25 billion annually and gained numerous FDA approvals across multiple cancer types including melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, and others. It transformed cancer immunotherapy and became the foundation of Merck's oncology portfolio. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors including Keytruda became one of the most successful drug classes in history, with widespread clinical adoption and continuous label expansion into new indications and combinations.

**Merck's performance**: After the article's publication, Merck's oncology portfolio—dominated by Keytruda—fueled substantial growth. By 2024, Merck's total revenues approached $60 billion annually, partially overcoming the patent cliff pressures that drove the 2011-2014 declines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions, both explicit and implicit:

• **Fred Hassan's 2008 "five stars" predictions (explicit, made in quoted material)**: He predicted these drugs would have "big sales potential." 
  - **What actually happened**: These predictions largely failed. Only Bridion eventually found success, and that took years longer than anticipated. Boceprevir was rapidly outcompeted by better hepatitis C treatments. Saphris failed commercially. Vorapaxar had limited adoption. Golimumab never achieved breakout success.

• **Article's implicit prediction about Keytruda's future importance**: 
  - **What actually happened**: This proved remarkably prescient. Keytruda became Merck's most valuable asset and one of the world's best-selling drugs, fundamentally validating the article's assessment that peripherally acquired, underappreciated assets can surpass highly-touted "stars."

• **Article's critique about M&A salesmanship predicting business outcomes**: The piece suggested that merger hubris often fails to match reality.
  - **What actually happened**: The prediction proved accurate for most of the "five stars," but ironically the broader Merck/Schering-Plough deal succeeded due to an overlooked asset (Keytruda), validating skepticism about linear predictions while showing that unexpected payloads can overperform.

• **Implicit prediction about drug development uncertainty**: The article emphasized that drug development is unpredictable.
  - **What actually happened**: This was validated multiple ways—"sure bets" failed, while an overlooked program became transformative. This accurately reflected broader pharmaceutical industry patterns.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important pattern in pharmaceutical M&A where underhyped assets outperform touted "stars," exemplified by Keytruda's subsequent blockbuster success versus Hassan's failed five-star prediction. It offers lasting relevance about how drug development risk and serendipity continue to defy merger-era exuberance.
