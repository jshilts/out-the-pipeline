# Coronavirus Vaccines and Cancer (19 Nov 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes a Swedish research paper examining how SARS-CoV-2's full-length Spike protein affects DNA damage repair mechanisms in human cells. The author first explains the five major DNA repair pathways (BER, NER, MMR, HR, and NHEJ), essential cellular machinery for maintaining genomic integrity. The paper in question found that full-length Spike protein expression in engineered cells appeared to inhibit key DNA repair pathways, particularly affecting BRCA1 and 53BP1 proteins that recruit repair machinery to chromatin checkpoints. Both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways were reportedly affected. The study also observed a ~50% reduction in V(D)J recombination, suggesting potential impairment of antibody production mechanisms.

The author notes that the paper's conclusions, if correct, raised theoretical concerns about whether vaccines producing full-length Spike protein might similarly inhibit DNA repair temporarily. However, the article emphasizes that no cancer risk was claimed by the original researchers, and extensive gaps would need to be addressed to establish any real-world health implications. Key limitations include unknown Spike protein concentrations in vaccinated individuals versus engineered cells, specialized locations of antibody-producing cells that may not be similarly affected, and the temporary nature of vaccine-induced Spike expression. The T-cell response would eliminate Spike-producing cells within days, and there's no evidence circulating Spike protein enters cell nuclei in sufficient quantities to affect DNA repair mechanisms.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this article's publication in November 2021, extensive real-world data and follow-up research has accumulated regarding both COVID-19 vaccines and cancer outcomes. Several developments are particularly relevant to the concerns addressed in this article:

**Observed Cancer Outcomes**: Large-scale epidemiological studies and ongoing surveillance have not detected increased cancer rates among vaccinated populations. Cancer is typically slow-developing, so early signals might not appear immediately, but the lack of concerning signals in major surveillance systems (VAERS, national health databases, and international monitoring) after billions of doses administered remains notable. If Spike protein was significantly impairing DNA repair systemically and persistently, one might expect early signals in rapidly-dividing tissues.

**Addressing the Underlying Paper's Scientific Issues**: The specific MDPI paper this article discussed (Liu et al., 2021, Viruses) faced substantial criticism in the scientific community. Concerns included the in vitro experimental design using massive overexpression systems far exceeding any physiological Spike protein concentrations, questions about proper controls, and whether the observed effects represented artifacts of the experimental system rather than biologically relevant phenomena. The Spike protein levels used were orders of magnitude higher than transient expression from mRNA vaccines.

**Practical Experience with Antibody Responses**: Between 2021-2024, extensive data showed robust antibody responses to vaccination and natural infection. If V(D)J recombination or DNA repair mechanisms were significantly impaired in antibody-producing cells, this would likely manifest as poor or delayed immune responses, particularly problematic for individuals requiring repeated vaccinations or those with immunodeficiencies. The observed effectiveness across populations with varying numbers of vaccine doses argues against sustained impairment of primary immune mechanisms.

**Continued Vaccine Monitoring and Research**: Post-authorization surveillance continued with hundreds of millions of individuals receiving multiple vaccine doses. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses examined various adverse events, with cancer specifically tracked through registries. No consistent pattern emerged suggesting elevated cancer risk attributable to vaccination. The safety profile remained broadly consistent with other vaccines.

**Understanding Spike Protein Pharmacokinetics**: Subsequent research improved understanding of vaccine-encoded Spike protein expression duration and tissue distribution. Studies indicated transient expression lasting days rather than weeks, and primarily local rather than systemic distribution from intramuscular injection. The idea that sufficient quantities of Spike protein persistently enter cell nuclei to affect DNA repair machinery remains unsupported by clinical evidence or established protein trafficking mechanisms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not explicitly make firm predictions, but discussed several hypothetical scenarios based on the paper's findings:

• **Potential V(D)J Recombination Impairment**: The article suggested that *if* vaccination temporarily affected DNA repair mechanisms, there *might* be implications for antibody diversity. In practice, extensive immunological monitoring showed robust and diverse antibody responses, including effective responses against variants. Real-world vaccine effectiveness data demonstrated sustained capacity for immune adaptation.

• **Truncated Spike Protein Vaccines**: The article raised the possibility that vaccines not using full-length Spike might avoid theoretical DNA repair concerns. Subsequent to 2021, numerous vaccines entered development and use (including updated boosters and variant-specific vaccines), but the focus remained on immunogenicity and effectiveness rather than concerns about DNA repair pathway interactions, suggesting this was not a priority concern in vaccine design.

• **Cancer Risk Concerns**: While the article strongly argued against cancer risk, it acknowledged that some people would worry about this possibility. In actuality, accumulated evidence through 2024 showed no elevated cancer rates attributable to COVID-19 vaccination.

• **Duration of Spike Protein Expression**: The article noted that vaccine-produced Spike would be transient. Subsequent research confirmed this, with most studies showing peak protein expression within days of vaccination and rapid decline, consistent with mRNA degradation and immune clearance of transfected cells.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an important scientific dialog about vaccine safety assessment and critique of scientific papers, but the underlying concern it examines turned out to be largely unsupported empirically and the discussion remained speculative rather than leading to actionable findings.
