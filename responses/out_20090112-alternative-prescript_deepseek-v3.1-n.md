# An Alternative Prescription From Chopra, Roy, and Weil (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Deepak Chopra, Rustum Roy, and Andrew Weil titled "Alternative Medicine is Mainstream." The original op-ed argued that "integrative medicine" (including plant-based diets, yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and herbal therapies) should receive mainstream healthcare funding and integration because these approaches can address chronic lifestyle-related diseases more cost-effectively than conventional medical procedures.

The Pipeline commentary author Derek Lowe acknowledges that lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) could indeed reduce chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes, but criticizes the lack of rigorous evidence for many integrative medicine claims. He particularly questions assertions about Qi Gong's effectiveness for chronic pain and challenges the claim that herbs have fewer side effects than pharmaceuticals, citing examples like St. John's Wort and Echinacea that showed minimal effects in well-controlled trials. The article employs sarcasm to critique what it views as pseudoscientific claims and calls for better quality evidence before mainstream adoption and funding.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2009 article, several concrete developments occurred in integrative/complementary medicine:

**Research Evidence Evolution**: The evidence base for integrative medicine approaches expanded through major trials. The NIH's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) continued funding research, with some approaches showing modest benefits in certain conditions while others failed to demonstrate efficacy in rigorous trials.

**Clinical Integration**: By the 2010s and beyond, certain evidence-based integrative approaches became more mainstream in clinical settings. Mindfulness-based stress reduction showed benefits for chronic pain and mental health conditions. Acupuncture gained some acceptance for specific indications like chemotherapy-induced nausea and certain pain conditions, though evidence remained mixed for many applications.

**Healthcare Policy**: The Affordable Care Act and subsequent healthcare discussions increasingly included preventive medicine and lifestyle interventions as cost-reduction strategies, though without wholesale adoption of the broad integrative medicine agenda proposed in the 2009 op-ed.

**Industry Growth**: The supplement and wellness industry continued to grow substantially, reaching hundreds of billions of dollars annually, despite ongoing concerns about regulation and evidence quality. The FDA increased enforcement actions against companies making unsubstantiated health claims.

**Scientific Community Response**: The scientific and medical communities generally maintained skepticism toward approaches lacking rigorous evidence, while becoming more open to lifestyle interventions and stress reduction techniques when backed by solid clinical data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2009 article did not make specific testable predictions about future developments. It was primarily a critique of existing claims rather than a forward-looking analysis. The original op-ed by Chopra, Roy, and Weil made predictions/implications about integrative medicine's potential role in healthcare, but the Pipeline commentary focused on evaluating those claims based on evidence available at the time rather than making independent predictions about what would happen.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article represents a fairly standard scientific critique of integrative medicine claims that was timely in 2009. It addresses ongoing debates about evidence standards and healthcare funding priorities, but covers well-trodden ground in the science-versus-alternative-medicine discourse without introducing new concepts or predictions that would make it highly significant in retrospect.
