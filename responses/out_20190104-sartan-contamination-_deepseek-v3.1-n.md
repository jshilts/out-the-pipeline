# The Sartan Contamination Story (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes an ongoing contamination crisis in the generic drug industry involving angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), known as "sartans." The problem began in summer 2018 when valsartan products were recalled due to detection of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a genotoxic contaminant. The contamination was traced to multiple manufacturers, including Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals (ZHP) in China, and later spread to include other sartans (irbesartan, losartan) and additional facilities in India.

The root cause was identified as a process chemistry issue: manufacturers had switched to using dimethylformamide (DMF) or diethylformamide as solvents during the synthesis of the tetrazole ring common to all sartans. The new route involved sodium azide and zinc chloride, with excess azide consumed using sodium nitrite. Under acidic conditions, nitrous acid formed and reacted with secondary amines (from solvent breakdown) to produce N-nitroso compounds. ZHP had apparently introduced this cheaper, higher-yielding synthesis around 2012, and other manufacturers adopted similar variations.

The contamination went undetected for years despite the known genotoxicity of N-nitroso compounds at high levels. The FDA's acceptable limit was set at exposure levels expected to cause 1 additional cancer case per 100,000 patients taking the drug for 70 years, but ZHP's material reportedly exceeded this threshold significantly.

## 2. HISTORY

The sartan contamination crisis became one of the most significant drug safety scandals in recent pharmaceutical history, with far-reaching regulatory and industry impacts:

**Regulatory Response and Expanded Recalls:**
- The FDA and EMA established stringent testing requirements for nitrosamine impurities in ARBs and later expanded these to other drug classes
- Additional nitrosamine contaminants beyond NDMA and NDEA were identified, including N-nitrosomethylphenylamine (NMPA) and N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA)
- Recalls expanded globally, affecting millions of patients and causing widespread drug shortages

**Manufacturing and Quality Control Changes:**
- Multiple manufacturing sites faced import alerts and FDA warning letters
- Companies invested hundreds of millions of dollars in process validation, analytical method development, and facility upgrades
- The crisis exposed weaknesses in generic drug supply chain oversight, leading to enhanced regulatory scrutiny of API manufacturers, particularly in China and India

**Drug Development Impact:**
- No new ARB drugs were approved as a direct result of this crisis
- However, the incident did not fundamentally alter the therapeutic value of sartans, which remained first-line treatments for hypertension and heart failure
- Drug shortages led to treatment disruptions and increased costs for alternative medications

**Business Consequences:**
- Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical faced significant financial losses and reputational damage
- Multiple generic manufacturers experienced stock price declines and increased compliance costs
- Some companies exited the ARB market due to the complexity and cost of meeting new requirements

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Original Article Predictions:**

• **"People seem to have missed that changing the chemistry for the sartans could lead to this problem, so what else are we missing?"** - **BECAME TRUE**: Regulatory agencies subsequently discovered nitrosamine contamination in numerous other drug classes including ranitidine (2019-2020), metformin (2020), and various other medications, leading to widespread recalls and new regulatory frameworks.

• **"We're going to have to think about the way that synthetic routes in the generic API business are monitored"** - **BECAME TRUE BUT MORE COMPREHENSIVE**: The crisis led to fundamental changes in pharmaceutical regulation, including:
  - FDA's "Control of Nitrosamine Impurities in Human Drugs" guidance (2021)
  - EMA's requirements for systematic nitrosamine risk assessments
  - Enhanced supply chain transparency requirements
  - Mandatory risk evaluation for all drug products

• **Implicit prediction about continued problems with the sartan supply chain** - **BECAME TRUE**: Drug shortages persisted for years, with some ARB products remaining unavailable or limited through 2020-2021, forcing patients to switch medications or pay higher prices for available alternatives.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article was prescient in identifying a major pharmaceutical quality crisis that had far-reaching regulatory and public health consequences. While the technical analysis was sound, the article underestimated the scale and duration of the problem, which affected multiple drug classes beyond sartans and revealed systemic issues in pharmaceutical manufacturing oversight that persist today.
