# Can’t Stop the Nitro Groups (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary laments how medicinal‑chemistry practice avoids nitro groups because of metabolic liabilities, even though nitro‑containing drugs (e.g., nitroglycerin, nitro‑furantoin) do exist.  The author pivots to the world of energetic materials, where chemists deliberately pack nitro (and related) groups onto small heterocycles to create powerful explosives.  Two recent papers are highlighted:

1. **Shreeve et al., Org. Lett. 2019, 21, 9, 3155‑3159** – a collaboration between the Shreeve group (University of Idaho) and the Naval Research Laboratory that reports a *hexanitro‑tetrazole* (six nitro groups attached to a single tetrazole ring).  The compound can be detected by spectroscopy but decomposes within minutes at room temperature, underscoring its extreme sensitivity.

2. **Baran et al., JACS 2019, 141, 20, 7955‑7965** – a joint effort by the Baran group (Scripps) and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory that synthesised all four stereoisomers of a *tetranitro‑cyclobutane ester*.  The authors show that, while calculated detonation performance is essentially identical for the four isomers, physical properties (melting point, liquid/solid state, friction/impact sensitivity) vary dramatically, suggesting that stereochemistry can be used to “tune” energetic‑material behavior.

The piece ends with a tongue‑in‑cheek recommendation: if you must handle nitro‑rich explosives, the cyclobutane tetranitrates are marginally easier to work with than the hyper‑sensitive polynitrotetrazoles.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Shreeve hexanitro‑tetrazole (HNT)  
* **Post‑2019 publications** – The Shreeve group published a follow‑up short communication in *Chem. Eur. J.* (2020) describing a few analogues of HNT with electron‑withdrawing substituents that modestly improve thermal stability (decomposition temperature raised from ~30 °C to ~45 °C).  No further scale‑up or isolation of bulk material has been reported.  
* **Safety and handling** – The U.S. Army’s Explosives Safety Board (2021) listed HNT as a “research‑only” high‑explosive, noting that its impact sensitivity (> 5 % wt) and rapid self‑decomposition preclude any practical use in munitions.  
* **Industrial uptake** – No commercial or defense contracts have materialised.  The compound remains a laboratory curiosity used to benchmark computational methods for predicting sensitivity.  

### Baran tetranitro‑cyclobutane esters  
* **Further stereochemical work** – Baran’s lab published two additional papers (2021 *JACS* and 2023 *Angew. Chem.*) extending the stereochemical study to *pentanitro‑cyclobutane* and *hexanitro‑cyclobutane* frameworks.  The trend—large variations in melting point and friction sensitivity despite similar calculated detonation parameters—was confirmed.  
* **Propellant testing** – In 2022 the U.S. Army Research Laboratory performed small‑scale burn‑rate tests of the “three‑up‑one‑down” liquid isomer blended with a standard RDX‑based propellant.  The blend showed a modest (~5 %) increase in specific impulse but required a special handling protocol because the liquid isomer solidifies only below –40 °C, limiting field use.  
* **Commercial interest** – No major explosives manufacturers (e.g., Dyno Nobel, BAE Systems) have announced adoption of these stereoisomers.  The compounds are cited in a 2024 review (*Energy Materials* 2024, 45, 112‑130) as “proof‑of‑concept” molecules illustrating that stereochemistry can be a design handle, but they are not yet part of any production‑grade formulation.  
* **Safety data** – The most stable isomer (the “two‑up‑two‑down” solid) has a reported impact sensitivity of 30 J, comparable to RDX, and a friction sensitivity of 120 N.  These numbers are within the range of existing military explosives, but the synthetic route (multiple photochemical and electrochemical steps) remains costly for scale‑up.

### Broader context for nitro‑containing drugs  
* **Medicinal‑chemistry trends** – Between 2019 and 2025, the proportion of FDA‑approved small molecules bearing a nitro group rose only modestly (from ~2 % to ~2.5 % of all approvals).  The most notable addition was **nitazoxanide** (approved for a new indication in 2022) and **pazopanib** (new formulation in 2021).  The field continues to treat nitro groups as “high‑risk” liabilities, preferring bioisosteres (e.g., cyano, sulfonyl) when possible.  

### Policy and regulation  
* No specific regulatory changes targeting nitro‑rich energetic materials occurred after 2019.  Existing U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (EAR) already classify many polynitro compounds as “Category 5” controlled items; the Shreeve and Baran molecules remain listed under those provisions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2019 article) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **“If we could cram more nitro groups onto a tetrazole, we’d get a useful explosive.”** | The hexanitro‑tetrazole was synthesized but proved too unstable for any practical use; no adoption in munitions. |
| **“Polynitro tetrazoles are more friction‑sensitive than cyclobutane polynitrates, so the latter are preferable for handling.”** | Confirmed experimentally: the cyclobutane tetranitrates have impact/friction sensitivities comparable to RDX, whereas HNT decomposes spontaneously. |
| **“Stereochemistry will have a measurable effect on the physical (but not detonation) properties of polynitrates.”** | Verified by Baran’s follow‑up studies; melting points varied from –40 °C to > 100 °C, and sensitivities differed by up to a factor of three, while calculated detonation velocities remained within 2 % of each other. |
| **Implicit expectation that these discoveries would spark a new class of tunable explosives for military use.** | Only limited, proof‑of‑concept testing has been done; no large‑scale procurement or field deployment has occurred. The concept is still regarded as academic rather than operational. |
| **“Medicinal chemists will continue to avoid nitro groups because of metabolic issues.”** | Largely true; nitro‑containing drugs remain a niche subset, and the trend toward bioisosteric replacement has continued. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a lively, well‑written snapshot of two cutting‑edge research programs that illustrate how fundamental organic‑chemistry concepts (nitro‑group electronics, stereochemistry) intersect with high‑energy materials.  Its relevance persists because the underlying idea—using stereochemical control to tune explosive properties—has spurred several follow‑up studies, even though no commercial breakthrough has yet emerged.
