# Retrospective Analysis: "Catalyst Pharmaceuticals and Their Disgusting Business Strategy"

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine article by Derek Lowe describes a pattern of pharmaceutical companies exploiting orphan drug regulations to dramatically increase prices on existing medications for rare diseases. The article focuses specifically on Catalyst Pharmaceuticals' plan to charge $80,000 per year for Firdapse (3,4-diaminopyridine), a drug used for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) that was previously available at low cost or free. 

The author argues this represents a business model where companies take existing, established drugs and use regulatory loopholes—specifically orphan drug exclusivity—to obtain market monopolies and charge exorbitant prices without conducting meaningful research, development, or innovation. The article connects this to similar practices by Retrophin (Thiola/topironin), Biomarin, and mentions the same pattern with colchicine and hydroxyprogesterone. The author concludes this represents regulatory failure and exploitation that damages the reputation of both the FDA and the broader pharmaceutical industry.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) revealed that this business model was not an isolated phenomenon but rather the beginning of a broader trend in pharmaceutical pricing strategies:

**Catalyst's Firdapse** went on to receive FDA approval in 2018 with an annual cost of approximately $375,000 per year—far exceeding the $80,000 initially discussed in the article. The company successfully obtained orphan drug exclusivity, preventing competition for seven years.

**The Retrophin/Shkreli case** became even more infamous when Martin Shkreli later acquired Daraprim in 2015 and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill, making him a symbol of pharmaceutical greed. Shkreli was eventually convicted of securities fraud in 2017 and sentenced to seven years in prison, though not directly for the price hikes.

**Industry-wide trend**: This practice became widespread, with numerous companies acquiring old, off-patent drugs and repurposing them as expensive orphan medications. Examples include Marathon Pharmaceuticals (later PTC Therapeutics) charging $89,000 annually for deflazacort (a decades-old steroid) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Questcor's Acthar Gel increasing from $40 per vial in 2000 to over $40,000 per vial by 2018.

**Policy responses**: The growing backlash led to congressional hearings on drug pricing and eventually some state-level transparency laws, though federal legislative responses remained limited due to industry lobbying and political divisions.

**Clinical impact**: Many patients continued to access these drugs through patient assistance programs, insurance, or by obtaining the medications from compounding pharmacies when legally possible, though the financial burden on healthcare systems increased substantially.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Correct predictions:**
- **"We can expect this to be done over and over"**: The article accurately predicted that this business model would proliferate, and numerous companies did indeed follow this pattern throughout the 2010s and beyond.
- **Price inflation severity**: The article's concern about $80,000 pricing was conservative—actual prices often exceeded even those figures.
- **Regulatory failure continuation**: FDA's orphan drug program indeed continued to be exploited as predicted.
- **Public backlash and reputational damage**: Exactly as predicted, these practices generated widespread public anger and damaged pharmaceutical industry reputation.

**Incorrect predictions:**
- **Regulatory reform**: The article suggested regulatory or legislative scrutiny would result, but meaningful federal reform remained elusive, with only modest transparency requirements implemented.
- **Industry self-correction**: The expectation that this would pressure companies to avoid such practices proved overly optimistic; instead, it became an established business strategy for many firms.

**Mixed accuracy:**
- **"Supply of people who think this is a good idea is apparently endless"**: Proven correct for executives and investors, though the Shkreli case showed there could be personal consequences unrelated to the pricing practices themselves.

## 4. INTEREST SCORE: 8/10

This article merits a decile ranking of **8** (80th-89th percentile). 

**High interest factors:**
- **Predictive accuracy**: The article correctly identified a major emerging trend in pharmaceutical business models that would dominate headlines and policy discussions for years.
- **Systemic insight**: It revealed fundamental weaknesses in orphan drug legislation that persist today.
- **Real-world impact**: The practices described affected patient care, healthcare costs, and created ongoing policy debates.
- **Broader relevance**: The same regulatory loopholes and business tactics continued to be exploited, making this analysis perennially relevant.

**Limitations preventing the highest score:**
- The article focuses primarily on moral outrage rather than deep structural analysis of healthcare economics or regulatory capture.
- It provides limited discussion of potential solutions or alternative policy frameworks.

The article's enduring value lies in its prescient identification of what became a defining controversial business strategy in 21st-century healthcare, with implications that continue to shape pharmaceutical regulation, pricing policy, and public trust in the healthcare system.
