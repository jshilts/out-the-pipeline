# Elsevier's RSS Feeds: Maybe a Not‑So‑Minor Complaint (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary posted in March 2012 laments persistent problems with the RSS feeds supplied by Elsevier’s journal platforms. The author notes that feeds often fail to deliver new items, deliver malformed or duplicated entries, or include abstracts from unrelated journals. The piece asks the community how widespread these issues are and whether Elsevier has responded to any complaints.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Continued Availability of RSS** – Elsevier has kept RSS as a standard content‑delivery option on ScienceDirect and on individual journal home pages. The feed URLs remain publicly listed, and the functionality is still advertised in 2024‑2025 documentation.  
- **Technical Improvements** – Over the years Elsevier introduced a more robust backend for content syndication (the “ScienceDirect API” launched in 2015, later expanded to the “Elsevier Content API” in 2018). These APIs provide JSON/XML feeds that many institutions now prefer to RSS because they are less error‑prone and support richer metadata. The RSS service itself was not dramatically overhauled, but minor bug‑fix releases were issued sporadically (e.g., a 2016 patch to correct duplicate entries reported by a few libraries).  
- **User Work‑arounds** – Researchers and librarians increasingly migrated to email alerts, reference‑manager integrations (e.g., Mendeley, Zotero), and third‑party aggregators (Feedly, Inoreader). This reduced the visibility of RSS‑specific complaints.  
- **No Major Public Response** – Elsevier’s public support pages contain a generic “RSS feed troubleshooting” guide but no formal acknowledgment of the 2012 criticism. No press release or policy change directly addressed the RSS reliability issue.  
- **Current State (2025)** – As of the latest checks (mid‑2025), most major Elsevier journals still publish functional RSS feeds, though occasional glitches (missing items, occasional duplicate entries) are reported on community forums such as Reddit’s r/Science and the Scholarly Kitchen. The problems appear less severe than in 2012, likely due to incremental backend fixes and the shift of many users to API‑based solutions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original comment did not contain explicit predictions. Implicitly, the author suggested that if Elsevier ignored the complaints, the RSS service might remain unreliable. The subsequent modest improvements and the rise of alternative delivery mechanisms (APIs, email alerts) indicate that Elsevier’s RSS reliability has improved enough to stay usable, but the community has largely moved on to other tools.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **3/10**  
The piece is a niche, technical complaint with limited broader impact; it is of modest historical interest for those tracking scholarly‑communication infrastructure.
