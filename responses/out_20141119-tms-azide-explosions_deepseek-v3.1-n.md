# TMS Azide Explosions (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses an azide explosion that injured a graduate student at the University of Minnesota in June 2014. The student was working with a 200-gram batch of trimethylsilyl azide (TMS azide) when the explosion occurred while he was adjusting a thermometer with no protective gear. The author argues that this incident represented a "failure-to-realize" rather than a "failure-to-warn," emphasizing that the hazards of working with such large quantities of azides should have been obvious to anyone in a graduate chemistry lab. The piece criticizes inadequate safety protocols in academic labs, including the lack of blast shields, proper PPE, and sufficient hazard recognition, despite routine performance of dangerous reactions.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following the 2014 incident, significant developments occurred in laboratory safety culture and specifically azide safety protocols:

**Immediate University Response**: The University of Minnesota's Department of Chemistry underwent a comprehensive safety review, implementing stricter protocols for hazardous reactions and improved training programs.

**Safety Communication**: The incident became a case study in safety discussions across chemical communities. ACS (American Chemical Society) and other organizations intensified efforts to highlight azide hazards in educational materials and safety guidelines.

**Industry and Academic Impact**: Academic labs increasingly adopted policies limiting large-scale azide preparations, with many institutions requiring special approval for reactions involving more than specific threshold quantities. The practice of purchasing commercially available TMS azide rather than synthesizing it became more widespread, particularly for larger-scale work.

**Regulatory Changes**: While no new federal regulations emerged specifically from this incident, many university EH&S departments strengthened internal protocols for azide handling and high-risk reactions.

**Literature Updates**: Over the subsequent years, safety protocols and warnings in chemical literature, including Organic Syntheses procedures, generally became more explicit about hazards and appropriate protective measures for azide chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain specific predictions about future developments, but rather focused on immediate safety concerns and critiques of existing practices. The implied concern was that similar incidents would continue unless academic culture improved regarding hazard recognition and safety protocols.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6/9**

This article addresses critical laboratory safety issues that remain highly relevant to chemical education, institutional liability, and best practices in hazardous chemistry. While focused on a specific incident, it represents a broader conversation about safety culture that has persisted and evolved in the decade since publication, making it of moderate to high interest for the chemical community and safety professionals.
