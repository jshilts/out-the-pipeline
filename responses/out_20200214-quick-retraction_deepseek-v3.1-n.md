# A Quick Retraction (February 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

The author describes discovering through the Zotero reference manager that a high-profile paper from Craig Crews's lab at Yale had been retracted. The retracted paper reported a novel protein degradation technique called ENDTAC (Extracellular Neosubstrate-Dependent Targeted Degradation), which purportedly extended proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) from intracellular targets to extracellular and cell-surface proteins by hijacking the endosome/lysosome pathway, with demonstration using a GFP-fused target protein.

The retraction notice stated the authors could not reproduce their findings and therefore withdrew the paper. The author uses this case to discuss broader issues in scientific literature quality: the abundance of non-reproducible papers (many never retracted), the speed of this retraction (roughly nine months), and the likely internal discovery of irreproducibility rather than external challenge. The piece emphasizes the value of honest retraction and speculates on possible causes—honest mistakes, sloppiness, or fraud—while assuming preventive measures have been implemented.

## 2. HISTORY

The ENDTAC paper retraction from the Crews lab highlighted broader challenges in the targeted protein degradation field. While this specific approach appears not to have advanced, the PROTAC field generally progressed robustly after 2020:

- **Clinical Progress**: Several PROTAC-based therapeutics advanced to clinical trials. Arvinas's ARV-110 (for prostate cancer) and ARV-471 (for breast cancer) reached Phase 2 trials, though with mixed efficacy results that prompted strategic re-evaluations. In 2023, Arvinas announced that ARV-471 would not advance alone but would be studied in combination therapies.

- **FDA Approvals**: No PROTAC drug received full FDA approval as of early 2024, reflecting the scientific and clinical challenges in translating bifunctional degraders to approved medicines, despite significant investment and promise.

- **Industry Impact**: The field saw continued heavy investment from pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Roche, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, and AstraZeneca), with numerous partnerships for PROTAC development. However, clinical success remained challenging, with some programs reporting modest efficacy or dose-limiting toxicities.

- **Research Expansion**: Scientific research on PROTACs expanded significantly, addressing intracellular targets for cancer and other diseases. The challenge of degrading extracellular or cell-surface proteins remained largely unsolved, making the ENDTAC concept particularly notable—and its retraction disappointing.

- **Reproducibility Awareness**: The timing coincided with growing institutional focus on reproducibility in life sciences, with funding agencies and journals implementing stricter protocols, though systemic change remained gradual.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article included several observations that played out as described:

- **Retraction transparency**: The piece noted this retraction was "a good thing, and exactly what should happen." This perspective aligned with broader scientific norms valuing integrity over reputation, although cultural and institutional barriers to retraction persist.

- **Systemic reproducibility issues**: The author's comment that "there are any number of un-retracted papers out there" reflected an ongoing problem. Research from 2020–2024 continued to document substantial irreproducibility issues in life sciences, validating this observation without offering simple solutions.

- **PROTAC field trajectory**: While not a direct prediction, the author's framing suggested excitement about "a lot of circulating proteins that one could imagine being therapeutically cleared." The subsequent years showed continued scientific enthusiasm but tempered clinical translation, especially for complex extracellular targeting.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article primarily documents a specific retraction without broader new insights into biology, clinical impact, or technological breakthroughs. While it touches on important issues of scientific reproducibility, the piece is retrospective rather than forward-looking and lacks the depth needed for significant long-term importance to biotechnology development.
