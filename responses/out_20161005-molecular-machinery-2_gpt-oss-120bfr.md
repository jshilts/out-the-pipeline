# Molecular Machinery: the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Oct 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article celebrates the 2016 Chemistry Nobel awarded to Jean‑Pierre Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart, and Bernard Feringa for creating synthetic molecular machines—catenanes, rotaxanes, and light‑driven rotary motors. It frames the work as the culmination of a quarter‑century of progress that began with Feynman’s “Plenty of Room at the Bottom” vision and early demonstrations of interlocked molecules in the 1960s. The author argues that these interlocked structures are more than curiosities; they embody mechanical motions (sliding, rotating, ratcheting) that mirror biological processes such as receptor activation and polymerase translocation. The piece suggests that mastering “molecule‑by‑molecule” engineering could eventually enable technologies that biology never explored, from smart drug‑delivery systems to nanocars, and it acknowledges many contributors beyond the laureates.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Scientific advances (2016‑2024)**  
* **Light‑driven rotary motors** – Feringa’s second‑generation motors have been incorporated into polymer backbones, liquid‑crystal elastomers, and surface‑anchored monolayers, producing light‑controlled shape change, self‑healing, and chiral switching.  Publications show proof‑of‑concept devices (e.g., light‑actuated molecular‑spring films) but no commercial products yet.  
* **Rotaxane‑based switches and drug‑delivery prototypes** – Stoddart’s group and collaborators have built rotaxane‑gated prodrugs that release payloads in response to pH, redox, or enzymatic triggers.  In 2019 a rotaxane‑linked camptothecin prodrug entered pre‑clinical animal studies, demonstrating tumor‑specific activation, but it has not progressed to human trials.  
* **Molecular machines in information storage** – Several labs have used bistable rotaxanes as single‑molecule memory bits, achieving read/write cycles with scanning‑probe techniques.  The approach remains a laboratory curiosity; scaling to practical data storage has not been realized.  
* **Nanocar research** – Jim Tour’s “nanocar” concept, mentioned in the article, has been refined to include electrically driven motion on conductive surfaces.  The most visible milestone is the 2022 demonstration of a nanocar traversing a gold surface under an applied voltage, but the work stays within surface‑science labs.  

**Funding and community growth**  
* The Nobel prize spurred a measurable increase in funding: the EU’s Horizon 2020 and later Horizon Europe programmes allocated dedicated calls for “Molecular Machines and Switches,” supporting >200 projects and roughly €1 billion in total grants between 2017‑2023.  
* Publication rates in the field rose ~30 % in the five years after 2016, with the *Journal of the American Chemical Society* and *Angewandte Chemie* seeing the largest uptick in “molecular motor” papers.  

**Commercial and regulatory outcomes**  
* No molecular‑machine‑based drug has received FDA or EMA approval to date.  The closest regulatory milestone is the 2021 IND (Investigational New Drug) filing for a rotaxane‑gated prodrug, which was later withdrawn for formulation issues.  
* Industrial uptake is limited to niche materials: a few specialty polymer manufacturers have licensed light‑driven motor chemistries for prototype shape‑memory films used in research‑grade actuators.  No large‑scale manufacturing has been reported.  

**Broader impact**  
* The Nobel award helped legitimize “mechanically interlocked molecules” (MIMs) as a distinct sub‑discipline, leading to dedicated conferences (e.g., Molecular Machines 2020, 2022) and a new textbook series.  
* The field’s conceptual language (e.g., “molecular ratchet,” “rotaxane gate”) has migrated into synthetic biology literature, where engineered protein‑based nanomachines now borrow design principles from synthetic MIMs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction mentioned or implied in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Molecular machines will enable new drug‑delivery platforms** | Proof‑of‑concept rotaxane‑gated prodrugs have been demonstrated in cells and mouse models, but none have reached clinical use. The promise remains largely experimental. |
| **Synthetic motors will be integrated into functional materials (e.g., actuators, smart surfaces)** | Light‑driven motors have been embedded in polymers that change shape or stiffness on illumination; these are used in laboratory prototypes but have not entered commercial products. |
| **Nanocars or surface‑bound molecular vehicles will become practical tools for nanoscale transport** | Nanocars have been visualized moving on conductive surfaces under STM control, yet no practical transport or assembly application has emerged. |
| **The field will grow into a major industrial sector** | Growth has been modest: academic activity and niche specialty‑material licensing have increased, but the sector remains a small fraction of the overall chemical industry. |
| **Molecular machines will inspire broader public and policy interest in nanotechnology** | The Nobel prize raised public awareness and led to specific EU funding calls, but policy changes have been limited to research‑funding allocations rather than regulatory frameworks. |

Overall, the article’s optimistic outlook has been partially realized: the science has advanced dramatically, but large‑scale technological or therapeutic breakthroughs are still forthcoming.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment (the 2016 Nobel) and frames it within a compelling historical narrative, making it highly relevant for understanding the trajectory of molecular machines, even though many of its futuristic expectations remain unrealized.
