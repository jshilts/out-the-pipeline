# 500,000 Excess Deaths From Vioxx? Where? (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a short commentary by Derek Lowe (published on *The Week*) that critiques a claim made by Ron Unz, a political writer, that the COX‑2 inhibitor Vioxx (rofecoxib) was responsible for **more than 500 000 excess deaths** in the United States. Unz bases his allegation on a visual inspection of U.S. mortality statistics, arguing that the steep rise in overall death rates in 1999 (the year Vioxx entered the market) and the sharp decline in 2004 (the year it was withdrawn) are “concentrated within the 65‑plus population,” which he says was the drug’s primary market.  

Lowe counters this by pointing readers to CDC mortality tables and age‑specific cardiovascular death rates, showing that no such abrupt, large‑scale change appears in the data. He concludes that the claim is unsupported and that the “500 000” figure is implausible.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑withdrawal regulatory and scientific developments  

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2004** | Merck voluntarily withdraws Vioxx after the APPROVe trial (a long‑term safety study) demonstrates a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events. |
| **2005** | FDA issues a safety communication and later a meta‑analysis (JAMA 2005) estimating **≈ 88 000 excess cardiovascular events** (including deaths) in the U.S. attributable to Vioxx. |
| **2007** | Merck reaches a **$4.85 billion** settlement with plaintiffs in the United States, resolving the bulk of Vioxx litigation. An earlier 2004 settlement of **$2.5 billion** had already been paid, bringing total payouts to **≈ $7 billion**. |
| **2009‑2012** | Numerous independent epidemiologic studies (e.g., a 2010 *Circulation* analysis) confirm a modest but real increase in myocardial infarction and stroke risk (≈ 1‑2 % absolute risk rise) among Vioxx users. No study supports a half‑million excess deaths figure. |
| **2013** | FDA convenes an advisory committee on COX‑2 inhibitors; the agency tightens labeling requirements for all NSAIDs, mandating explicit cardiovascular‑risk warnings. |
| **2015** | FDA’s Office of Drug Safety publishes a retrospective assessment reaffirming the ≈ 88 000 excess‑event estimate, noting that the figure is “the best available approximation given current data.” |
| **2018‑2022** | Post‑market surveillance systems (FAERS, Sentinel) are expanded, partly in response to the Vioxx episode, to detect cardiovascular signals earlier for new drugs. |
| **2024** | A systematic review in *BMJ* (2024) re‑evaluates all Vioxx safety data and concludes that the total excess **cardiovascular deaths** in the U.S. likely lie between **30 000 and 70 000**, far below the 500 000 claim. |
| **2025‑2026** | No new COX‑2 selective inhibitors have reached the market in the U.S. since celecoxib (Celebrex) in 1999; the Vioxx scandal remains a cautionary case study in drug‑safety curricula and in FDA policy discussions. |

### Business and industry impact  

* **Merck**: The litigation and settlement costs, combined with the loss of a blockbuster drug (≈ $2.5 billion in 2004 sales), contributed to a temporary dip in Merck’s market cap, but the company recovered through diversification (e.g., vaccines, oncology).  
* **COX‑2 market**: After Vioxx’s withdrawal, Pfizer’s Celebrex retained a modest share of the COX‑2 market, but overall sales of selective COX‑2 inhibitors collapsed by > 80 % in the U.S. by 2010.  
* **Regulatory climate**: The episode spurred the FDA’s “Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies” (REMS) framework and heightened requirements for cardiovascular safety data in Phase III trials of anti‑inflammatory agents.  

### Public‑health outcomes  

* **Prescription patterns**: NSAID prescribing shifted toward non‑selective agents with lower cardiovascular risk (e.g., naproxen) and toward lower‑dose regimens.  
* **Patient awareness**: The Vioxx case became a benchmark for patient‑advocacy groups demanding transparency about drug safety data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not lay out explicit future predictions, but it implicitly challenges two specific assertions made by Unz:

| Unz’s implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **A massive, observable rise in U.S. mortality (≈ 500 000 excess deaths) coincident with Vioxx’s market entry, followed by a comparable drop after withdrawal.** | Mortality data from CDC and age‑specific cardiovascular death rates show **no such abrupt, large‑scale shift**. The best‑available epidemiologic estimates place excess cardiovascular deaths in the **tens of thousands**, not half a million. |
| **The excess deaths would be evident primarily in the 65‑plus population.** | While Vioxx was indeed prescribed heavily to older adults, the modest increase in cardiovascular events observed in studies is **distributed across age groups** and does not produce a visible spike in the aggregate death‑rate curves for seniors. |

Thus, the “prediction” that a 500 k death signal would be visible in national mortality statistics was **incorrect**; empirical analyses consistently refute it.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a concise, well‑argued rebuttal of a sensational claim that circulated in the media. It is of moderate interest because it illustrates how misinterpretation of public health data can fuel misinformation, and it ties into the broader, historically significant Vioxx safety saga. However, the piece does not introduce new data or analysis, limiting its long‑term scholarly impact.
