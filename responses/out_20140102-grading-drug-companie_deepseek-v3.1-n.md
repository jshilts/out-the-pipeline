# Grading the Drug Companies (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article references Forbes reporter Matthew Herper's 2013 year-end report card grading major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The piece serves as a brief commentary rather than an independent analysis, noting that Herper's rankings included some predictable bottom performers as well as a surprising top-ranked company that would have been unexpected a few years prior. The original Forbes article provided letter grades (A through F) evaluating how these 16 major drug companies performed during 2013 across various business and development metrics.

## 2. HISTORY
The pharmaceutical landscape has undergone significant transformation since 2013. Many of the companies Herper graded have experienced major changes:

**Significant strategic shifts occurred across the industry** - Companies like Pfizer (which likely ranked mid-tier in 2013) went on to make major acquisitions including Hospira (2015), Medivation (2016), and eventually Seagen (2023). Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Celgene in 2019 for $74 billion, dramatically expanding its oncology portfolio. AbbVie acquired Allergan in 2020 and Pharmacyclics in 2015, showing continued consolidation trends.

**Biotech transformed into established players** - Companies like Biogen, which was already prominent in 2013, faced major successes (Spinraza approval in 2016) and stunning failures (Aduhelm's controversial approval in 2021 followed by severe commercial disappointment). Vertex Pharmaceuticals, likely one of Herper's stronger performers, continued its cystic fibrosis franchise dominance and expanded into new therapeutic areas.

**The bottom performers faced continued challenges** - Companies that struggled in 2013 generally continued facing pipeline problems, though some recovered through restructuring or strategic pivots. The industry has seen increased focus on rare diseases and specialty drugs rather than broad primary care blockbusters.

**Regulatory environment evolved** - The FDA's approval pathways became more flexible with breakthrough therapy designations (established 2012) gaining broader use, accelerated approvals, and increased orphan drug designations changing commercialization dynamics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
I cannot evaluate the specific predictions implied in this article because it only references (without detailing) Matthew Herper's rankings and includes no concrete predictions in this particular blog post excerpt. The commentary suggests surprise at the top-ranked company, but does not specify which predictions failed or succeeded. Without access to Herper's original analysis and methodology, I cannot assess how his 2013 assessments compared to subsequent outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This brief blog commentary lacks sufficient substance to serve as a standalone historical article for retrospective analysis. While the pharmaceutical industry rankings and company performance are inherently interesting topics, this particular piece is too cursory to provide meaningful insights for a historical retrospective. Its primary value was contemporaneous commentary on a Forbes article, making it of limited utility for understanding 2013 pharmaceutical trends in hindsight.
