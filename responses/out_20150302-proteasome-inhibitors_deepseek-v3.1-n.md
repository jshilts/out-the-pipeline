# Of Proteasome Inhibitors and PAINs (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes Amgen's multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis (carfilzomib) following positive head-to-head trial results against Takeda/Millennium's Velcade. The ENDEAVOR study showed Kyprolis patients experienced 18.7 months before disease progression versus 9.4 months for Velcade patients, with a 47% reduction in risk of disease worsening or death.

The author uses these two drugs to argue for loosening structural biases in drug discovery. Velcade contains boronic acid (historically dismissed as "moronic") while Kyprolis is a modified tetrapeptide with an epoxide—both structures that would typically be rejected based on conventional wisdom about pharmacokinetics. However, the key distinction made is between these "odd-looking" but legitimate structures versus PAINs (Pan Assay Interference Compounds). PAINs cause problems at the screening stage through false positives, while boronic acids and peptides may face PK/tox challenges but can be evaluated through proper assays. The article advocates for data-driven decision-making rather than structural prejudice.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated both the specific drug outcomes and the broader methodological arguments:

**Carfilzomib (Kyprolis):**
- Received FDA approval for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies
- Approved in combination with dexamethasone or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone
- Became established as a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, with continued clinical use
- Faced patent expiration considerations like Velcade, driving ongoing formulation improvements

**Bortezomib (Velcade):**
- Went off patent protection as anticipated
- Generics became available, significantly reducing costs
- Remains clinically used despite the competition
- Both drugs solidified the proteasome inhibitor class as a cornerstone of multiple myeloma treatment

**Structural Acceptance in Drug Discovery:**
- Boronic acid-containing drugs gained broader acceptance following Velcade's success
- Several additional boronic acid drugs entered development across different therapeutic areas
- The mechanistic understanding of proteasome inhibitors expanded to include immunoproteasome selectivity
- The "PAINs" concept became widely adopted in medicinal chemistry screening practices
- Academic and pharmaceutical screening programs systematically implemented PAIN filters and counter-screening assays

**Clinical Landscape:**
- Proteasome inhibitors became standard-of-care in multiple myeloma treatment regimens
- Combination therapies incorporating these drugs improved overall response rates
- The field moved toward earlier line treatments and maintenance therapy approaches
- Development continued on next-generation proteasome inhibitors with improved selectivity profiles

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Kyprolis needing strong data against generic competition**: Accurate. Velcade lost patent protection, and Kyprolis maintained market position based on demonstrated clinical benefits, particularly in specific patient populations and combination regimens. The differentiation strategy proved necessary and effective.

• **Boronic acids facing continued skepticism but working if properly developed**: Validated. The class gained acceptance but required rigorous PK/tox assessment. Subsequent boronic acid drugs succeeded where proper development pathways were followed, while others failed when these issues weren't adequately addressed.

• **PAINs concepts becoming standard screening practice**: Strongly validated. The PAINs framework was widely adopted across pharmaceutical and academic screening programs. Counter-screening assays became routine, and the medicinal chemistry community developed systematic approaches to identify and deprioritize problematic chemotypes early in discovery.

• **Epoxides being less problematic than their reputation**: Partially validated. While some epoxide-containing drugs succeeded with careful development, concerns about off-target reactivity persisted, leading to continued cautious evaluation rather than wholesale acceptance of the structural class.

• **Proteasome targeting requiring different risk tolerance than chronic treatments**: Confirmed. The risk-benefit calculations for multiple myeloma treatments remained distinct from chronic disease indications, allowing structural classes with higher inherent risks to achieve approval and clinical adoption.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article successfully identified important trends in drug discovery methodology and predicted key developments in multiple myeloma treatment. It bridged specific drug outcomes with broader principles about structural bias and screening practices, with lasting relevance for medicinal chemistry decision-making.
