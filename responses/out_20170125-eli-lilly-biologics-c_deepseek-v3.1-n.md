# Eli Lilly Is a Biologics Company (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 commentary by Derek Lowe analyzes Eli Lilly's strategic shift away from small molecule drugs toward biologics, prompted by the company's recent Alzheimer's disease clinical failures. The article opens with news of 485 layoffs at Lilly, primarily in sales and marketing, following the failure of solanezumab. The author notes that Lilly had heavily staffed up in anticipation of selling the Alzheimer's drug, but had to reverse course after the clinical trial failure.

The central thesis examines Lilly's drug approval track record from 2013-2016, revealing that all five approvals during this period were biologics (antibodies): dulaglutide, ramucirumab, necitumumab, ixekizumab, and olaratumab. This contrasted sharply with the company's historical identity as a traditional small molecule pharmaceutical company. The article notes that Lilly's last new small molecule approval was prasugrel in 2009, with earlier small molecule drugs like raloxifene (2007) and duloxetine (2004) already facing patent expiration. By the end of 2017, baricitinib would be Lilly's only patent-protected small molecule drug.

The piece contextualizes this shift within broader industry trends, noting that 7 of the top 8 pharmaceutical products by sales in 2015 were biologics, suggesting this transformation was industry-wide rather than unique to Lilly.

## 2. HISTORY

**Alzheimer's Program Developments:**
- The AZD3293 (lanabecestat) BACE inhibitor collaboration with AstraZeneca mentioned in the article **failed in Phase III trials**. Both companies announced in June 2018 that the Phase II/III AMARANTH trial and Phase III DAYBREAK-ALZ trial were being discontinued due to futility. This represented another major setback in Lilly's Alzheimer's pipeline.
- Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's antibody programs faced **further disappointments**. Solanezumab, which prompted the 2017 layoffs, had already failed in multiple trials. Subsequent antibody candidates also struggled, though Lilly did eventually see some progress with donanemab in later years.

**Small Molecule vs. Biologics Performance:**
- **Baricitinib** (Olumiant), the small molecule mentioned as Lilly's only patent-protected small molecule, **achieved significant success**. It received FDA approval for rheumatoid arthritis in 2018 and subsequently gained approvals for atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, and other indications. It became a blockbuster drug with multi-billion dollar annual sales.
- The biologics portfolio described in the article showed **mixed long-term results**. Dulaglutide (Trulicity) became a major commercial success and remains one of Lilly's top-selling drugs. Ramucirumab and ixekizumab achieved solid market performance. However, **olaratumab** was **withdrawn from the market** in 2019 after failing to confirm clinical benefit in confirmatory trials, representing a significant setback. Necitumumab had limited commercial success.

**Business Impact:**
- The strategic shift toward biologics **ultimately proved financially successful** for Eli Lilly. The company's focus on biologics and later GLP-1 drugs (like dulaglutide) positioned them well for substantial growth in the late 2010s and 2020s.
- Lilly's **market capitalization grew substantially** from approximately $80 billion in early 2017 to over $500 billion by 2024, outperforming many pharmaceutical peers.
- The company **continued to face Alzheimer's challenges** but found success in other therapeutic areas, particularly diabetes (GLP-1 agonists), immunology, and oncology.

**Industry Context:**
- The trend toward biologics **accelerated** as predicted. By 2023, biologics represented approximately 40% of global pharmaceutical spending and included many of the top-selling drugs worldwide.
- **Small molecule drug discovery** faced ongoing challenges with target diversity and druggability, though advances in chemical biology and targeted protein degradation created new opportunities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Biologics would be "paying most of the bills" at Eli Lilly**
- **Outcome: LARGELY ACCURATE**. Biologics became central to Lilly's portfolio and financial success. Dulaglutide became a multi-billion dollar blockbuster, and Lilly's biologics portfolio drove significant revenue growth. However, the success of small molecule baricitinib exceeded expectations and contributed meaningfully to revenue, suggesting some diversification remained valuable.

**Prediction: Baricitinib would be Lilly's only patent-protected small molecule by end of 2017**
- **Outcome: ACCURATE**. Baricitinib remained a key small molecule asset and the primary patent-protected small molecule in Lilly's portfolio during this period.

**Implicit Prediction: Lilly's Alzheimer's pipeline (including AZD3293) had uncertain prospects**
- **Outcome: ACCURATE BUT UNDERSTATED THE FAILURE**. The Alzheimer's programs largely failed. AZD3293 was discontinued for futility, and Lilly's Alzheimer's antibody programs continued to face challenges, though donanemab later showed some promise.

**Implicit Prediction: The biologics trend was industry-wide and would continue**
- **Outcome: ACCURATE**. Biologics continued to dominate pharmaceutical innovation and sales. The proportion of biologics among top-selling drugs remained high, though small molecules retained importance in certain therapeutic areas and new modalities emerged.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provided prescient analysis of pharmaceutical industry transformation at a specific moment when Eli Lilly's strategic pivot became undeniable. While the piece was relatively short and observational, it captured an important inflection point that proved economically significant for Lilly and reflected broader industry dynamics. The article's insights about the shift from small molecules to biologics proved accurate and important, though the specific drug outcomes were mixed.
