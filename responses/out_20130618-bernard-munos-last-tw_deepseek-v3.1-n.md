# Bernard Munos on The Last Twelve Years of Pharma (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
Bernard Munos reviewed FDA drug approvals from 2000-2012, finding an average of 27 approvals per year with half concentrated in cancer, infectious disease, and CNS. The analysis revealed significant mechanism diversity—190 different mechanisms, with 85% used by only one or two drugs, creating a "long tail." Half of these mechanisms were novel compared to pre-2000 drugs. Fast-follower strategies appeared ineffective, with an average gap of just three years between first-in-class and follow-on drugs—too short to substantially de-risk new mechanisms.

Munos argued that pharmaceutical innovation emerges from exploration rather than targeted, programmatic approaches. The top 12 pharma companies captured only 37% of 68 NMEs during the recent approval surge, insufficient to secure their futures. The paper challenged directive management models, suggesting innovation cannot be "ordained" and requires adaptive business models that allow researchers freedom to discover.

## 2. HISTORY

**Drug Approvals Trajectory**: The 2013 concern about low approval rates proved somewhat prescient. FDA approvals remained volatile but generally increased post-2013, with peaks in 2018 (59 novel drugs) and 2021 (50 approvals). The concern about "big pharma's" declining share of approvals proved accurate—mid-sized and smaller companies increasingly drove innovation.

**R&D Productivity Crisis Deepened**: Major pharmaceutical companies continued struggling with productivity. AstraZeneca faced patent cliffs and pipeline gaps, eventually restructuring significantly. Lilly's situation improved partially through successes in diabetes (GLP-1 agonists) and later Alzheimer's drugs, but not before major pipeline challenges. Several companies merged or underwent substantial reorganizations.

**Cancer Drug Dominance Continued**: Munos's observation about cancer drugs proved correct—oncology became the dominant therapeutic area, with immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors) emerging as a major new modality. The "crowded" tyrosine kinase inhibitor space grew even more competitive with approvals like osimertinib (2015), alectinib (2015), and others.

**Business Models Evolved**: The prediction about needing adaptive rather than directive models played out through increased partnerships, acquisitions of smaller biotechs, and some companies adopting more decentralized R&D structures. However, many companies struggled to make this transition effectively.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The upturn in drug approvals... not enough to keep things going"** — **Mixed accuracy**. Approval rates did increase overall from the 2000-2012 baseline of 27/year, reaching 59 in 2018, but volatility and high R&D costs remained problematic. Many major pharma companies still struggled despite higher approval numbers.

• **"Fast-follower approach doesn't seem very effective"** — **Accurate**. The "long tail" phenomenon persisted. Me-too drugs faced increasing payer pressure and competition, leading to lower commercial returns, though some exceptions existed in major therapeutic areas.

• **"Top 12 pharma companies garnering only 37% of NMEs is not enough to secure their future"** — **Accurate**. Major companies continued losing market share to biotechs and mid-sized firms. Many relied heavily on acquisitions rather than internal R&D for growth.

• **"Innovation cannot be ordained... needs adaptive business model"** — **Forward-looking prediction**. Over the subsequent decade, successful companies increasingly partnered with biotechs, acquired external innovation, and some experimented with more decentralized R&D. However, structural transformation proved difficult and slow across the industry.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article provided a data-grounded framework that explained the structural challenges facing big pharma, accurately identifying trends that continued shaping the industry for the subsequent decade while challenging conventional management wisdom about directing innovation.
