# Diversity-Oriented Synthesis (DOS) and Broad Institute Screening (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
Stuart Schreiber presented on diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) as an approach to systematically explore biochemical space, with a collection of ~100,000 DOS compounds deposited in PubChem and 15mg archived per compound. He described ongoing antimalarial work with the Gates Foundation, narrowing 468 compounds with potential for novel mechanisms based on resistant-strain assays. He also highlighted the Broad Institute's Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP), which profiles small-molecule behavior across hundreds of tumor cell lines using an "informer set" of selective probes targeting diverse cellular pathways. The work emphasized gene expression profiles over mutations for target identification, citing examples like CYP2J2 activation of austocystin.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2013 presentation, DOS continued as a research approach but did not translate into widespread drug discovery adoption or major pharmaceutical pipeline dominance. The Broad Institute's CTRP evolved into a significant public resource that has enabled systematic drug repurposing and mechanistic studies, with numerous publications leveraging the platform. However, DOS as a primary discovery strategy has not produced multiple approved drugs or become a standard industry practice comparable to traditional medicinal chemistry or fragment-based approaches. While some DOS compounds entered academic investigations, clinical success remained limited, and the pharmaceutical industry largely continued established screening paradigms. The Gates Foundation antimalarial collaboration proceeded but did not yield breakthrough antimalarial drugs that achieved widespread clinical deployment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **DOS as a transformative discovery paradigm**: Predicted to revolutionize small-molecule screening. **Outcome**: DOS remained a niche academic approach without broad pharmaceutical adoption.
• **CTRP enabling systematic oncology drug discovery**: Expected to accelerate cancer drug development through comprehensive cell-line profiling. **Outcome**: CTRP became a valuable public research tool but did not fundamentally reshape oncology drug approval timelines or clinical practice.
• **Gene expression over mutations for target identification**: Anticipated shift in prioritization approach. **Outcome**: Both expression and mutational analysis continue as complementary strategies; no wholesale paradigm shift occurred.
• **Novel antimalarial mechanisms from DOS compounds**: Predicted discovery of new antimalarial targets. **Outcome**: No breakthrough antimalarials from this specific collection achieved widespread clinical or regulatory success.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**
Moderate historical interest as documentation of early-2010s chemical biology approaches, but limited long-term impact given DOS's niche trajectory and CTRP's research-tool rather than transformative-clinical role.
