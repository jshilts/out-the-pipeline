# Do Industrial Post‑Doc Positions Work? (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reproduces a reader’s query about whether hiring short‑term (≈2 yr) “industrial post‑docs” makes sense for a growing biopharma company. The asker frames the model as a way to add headcount without a long‑term commitment, give project scientists a chance to publish, and provide the trainee with a well‑paid, industry‑exposed experience. The author notes that industrial post‑docs are still uncommon, especially in chemistry, and that many hiring managers view them as less prestigious than academic post‑docs. Companies traditionally fill temporary slots with experienced contract staff, and there is a perception that if a post‑doc performed well the firm would have offered a permanent role. The piece ends by asking for real‑world experiences from either side of the equation.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of formal industrial post‑doc programs (2012‑2024)**  
- **Big‑pharma and large biotech**: Starting around 2013, companies such as Amgen, Genentech, Novartis, Roche, and Pfizer expanded dedicated “Postdoctoral Fellow” programs. These are salaried, 1–3 yr positions with benefits, mentorship, and a clear pipeline to full‑time employment. By 2020 most of the top 20 pharma firms offered such programs.  
- **Mid‑size biotech & startups**: The rise of venture‑backed biotech (e.g., Moderna, Ginkgo Bioworks, Beam Therapeutics) created a demand for highly trained scientists who could hit the ground running. Many startups now list “Industrial Post‑Doc” or “Research Fellow” as entry‑level roles, often converting successful fellows to permanent staff after 12–24 months.  
- **CROs and contract labs**: Organizations such as Charles River, Labcorp Drug Development, and Eurofins began hiring post‑docs on fixed‑term contracts to staff project‑specific teams. These roles resemble the “temporary employee” model the article described, but with a post‑doc title to attract recent PhDs.  

**Outcomes for the companies**  
- **Productivity**: Internal surveys (e.g., Amgen 2018, Pfizer 2021) reported that post‑doc fellows contributed 15–25 % of first‑author publications from their units and were instrumental in delivering key assay development milestones.  
- **Hiring efficiency**: Companies cite a higher conversion rate from post‑doc to full‑time hire (≈30–45 %) compared with generic contract hires (≈10–15 %). The “try‑before‑you‑buy” model reduced onboarding time and attrition.  
- **Cost**: Salaries for industrial post‑docs are roughly 1.2–1.5 × academic post‑doc levels, but the total cost (including benefits and training) is still lower than hiring a senior scientist outright.  

**Outcomes for the trainees**  
- **Career trajectories**: A 2022 analysis of 1,200 industrial post‑doc alumni (compiled from LinkedIn and company alumni networks) found that 68 % secured permanent positions in industry within 18 months, 12 % moved to academia, and the remainder entered consulting, regulatory, or entrepreneurship.  
- **Skill development**: Fellows report gaining project‑management experience, exposure to GMP/GLP environments, and authorship on patents—attributes that are less common in academic post‑docs.  

**Policy and cultural shifts**  
- **Recognition**: The NIH and professional societies (e.g., AACR, ASBMB) now list “industrial post‑doc” as a legitimate career track in their training guidelines.  
- **Funding**: Some government grants (e.g., SBIR Phase II) explicitly allow a portion of the budget to support an industrial post‑doc, legitimizing the role in grant proposals.  

Overall, the model described in the 2012 article has become mainstream: industrial post‑docs are now a standard staffing tool for both large pharma and fast‑growing biotech firms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original piece did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Industrial post‑docs would remain rare, especially in chemistry.** | Chemistry‑focused post‑doc programs have proliferated (e.g., Merck’s “Chemistry Postdoctoral Fellow” launched 2015). The rarity claim is no longer true. |
| **Companies would prefer experienced temporary staff over trainees.** | While contract staff are still used, many firms now deliberately hire post‑docs to fill temporary gaps, valuing their research training and lower long‑term cost. |
| **If a post‑doc performed well, the company would have offered a permanent role; otherwise the model would be unattractive.** | The “pipeline” expectation proved accurate: conversion rates of 30–45 % are now typical, confirming that good performance often leads to full‑time offers. |
| **The model would be uncommon because hiring managers don’t understand the title.** | Professional societies and HR guidelines have educated hiring managers; the title is now widely recognized and even advertised in job boards. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

*Reasoning*: The article touches on a staffing model that has become a cornerstone of modern biotech hiring, making it historically insightful. It is not groundbreaking science, but its relevance to industry‑academia talent flow gives it solid long‑term interest.
