# Corrosion Using Selectfluor? (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a community inquiry posted in July 2014 by Derek Lowe on his "In the Pipeline" blog. The author received an email from someone at Sigma-Aldrich asking whether users of Selectfluor (F-TEDA-BF4, a trademarked fluorinating reagent from Air Products) have observed corrosion problems with glass or stainless steel during storage or use. The author notes limited personal experience with the reagent and solicits input from the chemistry community regarding potential material compatibility issues with this commonly used fluorinating agent.

## 2. HISTORY
The corrosion question likely reflects real industrial concerns. Selectfluor remains a widely used electrophilic fluorinating reagent in pharmaceutical and fine chemical synthesis. The material compatibility issue is significant because:
- Selectfluor contains tetrafluoroborate anions and can generate reactive fluoride species
- Stainless steel corrosion is critical for manufacturing equipment and storage vessels in chemical plants
- Glass corrosion from fluoride-containing compounds is well-documented and concerning for laboratory storage

In the years following, Selectfluor maintained its position as a commercial fluorinating agent, and equipment manufacturers and chemical suppliers likely developed better protocols for handling. However, this appears to be a practical materials science issue in pharmaceutical chemistry rather than a biotechnology breakthrough story.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article makes no predictions—it is purely an inquiry seeking practical chemical experience.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This content is a routine technical inquiry about chemical handling rather than a biotechnology analysis. While potentially important for chemists working with Selectfluor, it is not relevant to biotechnology industry developments and offers no commentary on biotech sector trends.
