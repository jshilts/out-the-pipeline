# Hearing Footsteps (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights the persistent challenge of patent expirations facing large pharmaceutical companies, using Lipitor as the prime example of a major revenue stream about to be lost. It explains that the drug industry is unique because its valuable assets have a finite lifespan, transforming into generics once patents expire, causing significant revenue loss. The author recalls a personal experience from the early 1990s where a company expanded research efforts but failed to develop replacement drugs in time, leading to financial decline and stock collapse—a pattern repeated across the industry despite various strategies including line extensions and patent maneuvers.

The author notes an important distinction for biotech companies (Amgen, Biogen, Genentech, Genzyme), which face fewer patent expiration worries due to regulatory uncertainty around biogeneric equivalency at the FDA. While this extended market exclusivity benefits biotech companies financially, the author argues it reduces competitive pressure and innovation incentives, suggesting that research organizations perform better when "kept on their toes" by the urgency of patent countdowns.

## 2. HISTORY


**Small-Molecule Patent Cliff (2008-2015):** The period following the article saw one of the most severe patent cliffs in pharmaceutical history, with approximately $150-200 billion in annual drug sales losing patent protection between 2010-2015. Lipitor (atorvastatin) lost US patent protection in November 2011, with generic versions entering the market immediately and causing Pfizer's revenue from the drug to drop from over $10 billion annually to less than $2 billion within a few years.

**FDA Generic Approval Acceleration:** The FDA significantly increased generic drug approvals during this period, approving a record number of generic applications. The Hatch-Waxman Act framework continued to work as designed, with generic market entry typically occurring within months of patent expiration.

**Biologics Regulatory Pathway:** The article's prediction about biogenerics proved prescient but overly pessimistic about the timeline. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act) was passed in March 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, finally creating a regulatory pathway for biosimilars—but implementation took years longer than expected. The FDA only approved the first biosimilar (Zarxio, referencing Neupogen) in March 2015, more than seven years after the article.

**Biosimilar Market Development:** Once the pathway was established, biosimilar adoption remained slow compared to small-molecule generics due to higher complexity, manufacturing requirements, and continued regulatory and legal challenges. By 2020, biosimilar competition had still not reached the intensity seen in small-molecule markets.

**R&D Productivity Trends:** Contrary to the article's dire warnings about research productivity, the 2010-2020 decade saw mixed but generally improving R&D productivity metrics across the industry, with increased success rates in clinical development and more targeted therapies emerging from genomic research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Patent Expiration Impact**: ✓ **Accurate** - The prediction that patent expirations would continue to devastate pharma revenues proved entirely correct. The 2010-2015 period became known as the "patent cliff," with companies like Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lilly, and AstraZeneca losing billions in annual revenue as blockbusters like Lipitor, Plavix, Seroquel, and Nexium went generic.

• **Biotech Regulatory Delays**: ✓ **Accurate** - The prediction that FDA regulatory uncertainty around biogenerics would persist proved correct. It took until 2010 for legislation (BPCI Act) to establish a pathway, and until 2015 for the first biosimilar approval—validating the "glacial pace" characterization for at least 7-8 years after the article.

• **Biotech Innovation Slowing**: ? **Mixed/Uncertain** - The hypothesis that reduced competitive pressure would make biotech companies "lazy" or less innovative is difficult to evaluate empirically. Major biotech companies did continue substantial R&D investment and product development during this period (examples include Genentech/ Roche's continued oncology innovation, Amgen's pipeline development), and the industry maintained substantial innovation output even with extended exclusivity periods.

• **Regulatory Environment for Biologics**: ✓ **Accurate** - The observation that generic biologics were "moving more slowly than they'd like" proved correct, with the regulatory pathway's complexity and implementation delays exceeding initial expectations even after legislation was passed.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates strong industry insight by correctly anticipating both the severity of the coming patent cliff and the regulatory delays in biosimilar pathways, making it historically relevant for understanding pharma industry dynamics during a critical transition period (2008-2015).
