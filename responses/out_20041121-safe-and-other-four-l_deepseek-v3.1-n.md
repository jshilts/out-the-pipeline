# Safe, And Other Four-Letter Words (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses FDA safety official David Graham's November 2004 claims that five approved drugs—Roche's Accutane, AstraZeneca's Crestor, GSK's Serevent, Pfizer's Bextra, and Abbott's Meridia—were unsafe and should be withdrawn from the market. The author challenges the binary question "Is drug X safe?" as fundamentally flawed, arguing that safety is always a risk-benefit calculation that varies by patient population and disease severity. The piece emphasizes that all drugs carry inherent risks, and that standards must be contextual—tolerating greater toxicity in oncology drugs while expecting higher safety for drugs treating non-life-threatening conditions like acne. Using Vioxx (withdrawn earlier in 2004) and the COX-2 inhibitor class as examples, the article highlights how the same drug can have different risk-benefit profiles depending on the patient population, criticizing both industry marketing practices and regulatory uncertainty at the FDA.

## 2. HISTORY

**Bextra (valdecoxib)**: Pfizer voluntarily withdrew Bextra from the U.S. market in April 2005, just five months after this article, following FDA requests citing cardiovascular risks and rare but serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). The COX-2 inhibitor class never recovered its prominence.

**Crestor (rosuvastatin)**: Despite Graham's warnings, Crestor remained on the market and became one of the most prescribed statins globally. The FDA strengthened its warning labels regarding muscle injury (rhabdomyolysis) risks but determined benefits outweighed risks for cardiovascular disease prevention. It achieved blockbuster status with peak annual sales exceeding $5 billion.

**Accutane (isotretinoin)**: Roche discontinued Accutane in 2009 citing generic competition and legal costs rather than safety issues specifically. Generic versions remained available under strict pregnancy prevention programs (iPLEDGE). The drug continued to be prescribed for severe acne despite its well-documented teratogenicity.

**Meridia (sibutramine)**: Abbott withdrew Meridia from the market in 2010 after the SCOUT trial demonstrated increased cardiovascular events. The European Medicines Agency had recommended suspension earlier that year.

**Serevent (salmeterol)**: Remained on the market with strengthened black box warnings about asthma-related death risks, particularly when used without inhaled corticosteroids. The FDA required additional safety studies but did not mandate withdrawal.

**FDA Reforms**: The 2007 FDA Amendments Act created the Sentinel Initiative for post-market surveillance, largely in response to the Vioxx crisis and the concerns raised by Graham and others.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction that a binary safety assessment is inadequate**: ✓ Confirmed. The risk-benefit framework became the standard FDA approach, though implementation remained controversial and inconsistent across drug classes.

- **Prediction that different patient populations justify different risk tolerance**: ✓ Confirmed. FDA increasingly adopted patient-focused drug development approaches, including accelerated approval pathways with restricted indications based on risk stratification.

- **Prediction about COX-2 inhibitor class uncertainty**: ✓½ Confirmed. Bextra was indeed withdrawn as suggested by parallels to Vioxx, but the class didn't completely disappear—Celebrex remained on the market with warnings and restricted use.

- **Implicit prediction that "almost never a perfect answer"**: ✓ Confirmed. Subsequent controversies over drugs like Avandia, Ketek, and various cancer drugs demonstrated persistent FDA struggles with risk-benefit balancing.

- **Prediction about antidepressant suicide risks in young patients**: (Not directly addressed, but relevant to the broader theme) Subsequent research confirmed increased suicidality in adolescents, leading to black box warnings in 2004-2005.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in drug safety regulation during the immediate aftermath of the Vioxx withdrawal. While some of Graham's specific warnings proved prescient (Bextra, Meridia), others did not (Crestor), validating the article's nuanced argument about context-dependent risk-benefit assessments.
