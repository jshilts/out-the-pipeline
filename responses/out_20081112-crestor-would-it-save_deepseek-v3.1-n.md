# Crestor: Would It Save Any Lives? (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2008 commentary critically examines the JUPITER trial results for Crestor (rosuvastatin), which studied whether the statin could prevent cardiovascular events in apparently healthy people with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels but normal LDL cholesterol. The author highlights several concerns: the absolute benefit is modest with a low baseline event rate; the "deaths from all causes" endpoint appears weak; and the study showed an unexpected reduction in cancer deaths (35 vs 58) that may be spurious and could skew overall mortality results. The article questions the cost-effectiveness calculations when balancing drug costs, screening expenses, and potential side effects like rhabdomyolysis and possible increased diabetes risk. The author concludes that widespread Crestor use based on this data represents a genuine policy dilemma with uncertain benefits.

## 2. HISTORY

The JUPITER trial (published November 2008 in NEJM) evaluated Crestor in 17,802 participants with CRP ≥2.0 mg/L and LDL <130 mg/dL. The trial was stopped early after median 1.9 years follow-up, showing a 44% reduction in major cardiovascular events. However, subsequent developments revealed both successes and limitations.

**FDA Actions and Approvals:**
- In November 2008, shortly after JUPITER's publication, AstraZeneca submitted data to the FDA for a new indication.
- In February 2010, the FDA approved Crestor for reducing cardiovascular risk in people with normal cholesterol but elevated CRP.

**Post-Marketing Concerns Validated:**
- **Diabetes Risk:** The JUPITER trial showed increased physician-reported diabetes with Crestor. Meta-analyses confirmed this: statins increase type 2 diabetes risk by approximately 9-13%.
- **Cancer Concern Debunked:** The unexpected cancer mortality reduction mentioned in the article proved to be spurious. Long-term follow-up showed no cancer benefit.
- **ACP Guidelines:** In 2013, the American College of Physicians recommended against screening asymptomatic adults for coronary heart disease using CRP testing due to limited evidence of improved outcomes.

**Crestor's Commercial Success:**
- Crestor became one of the world's best-selling statins, with peak annual sales exceeding $5 billion in 2014-2015.
- Generic rosuvastatin became available in the US in 2016, dramatically reducing costs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions from the article:**
- **"Would putting high-CRP patients on Crestor save lives at all?"** - The article questioned whether mortality benefit was statistically robust.
- **Cautious tone on widespread adoption** - Suggested the case was "actually a hard call to make."
- **AstraZeneca's sales expectations** - Noted the company was being "cautious about what all this means for sales of Crestor."
- **Need for cost-benefit analysis** - Emphasized balancing drug costs, screening costs, and side effects.

**What Actually Happened:**
- **FDA approved the CRP indication** despite questions about mortality benefit. However, medical guidelines remained mixed on screening the general population for CRP.
- **Mortality benefit remained uncertain.** Subsequent meta-analyses showed statins reduce cardiovascular mortality but effects on all-cause mortality remain debated for primary prevention.
- **AstraZeneca achieved massive commercial success.** Crestor became one of the top-selling statins globally.
- **Diabetes risk was real and significant.** The cardiovascular benefit vs. diabetes risk became an important clinical consideration for younger patients and those with lower baseline risk.
- **CRP screening recommendations** - Most guidelines did not broadly adopt routine CRP screening due to insufficient evidence that it improves clinical outcomes beyond traditional risk factors.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article accurately anticipated several key controversies in cardiovascular prevention that remained relevant for over a decade. Its measured skepticism toward pharmaceutical trial results and focus on practical public health trade-offs has aged well compared to the broader enthusiasm for expanded statin use.
