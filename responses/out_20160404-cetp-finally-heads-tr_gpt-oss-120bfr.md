# CETP Finally Heads to the Trash Heap? (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary lamented the repeated failures of cholesteryl‑ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors as cardiovascular drugs. It recounted a string of high‑profile setbacks—Pfizer’s torcetrapib (2006), Roche’s dalcetrapib, Bayer’s failed dalcetrapib program, and most recently Eli Lilly’s evacetrapib, which in the ACCELERATE Phase III trial raised HDL by ~130 % and lowered LDL by ~35 % but showed no difference in major cardiovascular events versus placebo. The author argued that these outcomes called into question the validity of HDL/LDL as surrogate markers, suggested possible off‑target harms (e.g., modest blood‑pressure rises), and speculated that the CETP approach might be fundamentally flawed. The piece ended with a bleak outlook for the field, noting that even Merck, which still had a CETP program, seemed “in the wasteland.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2016 clinical results**  
* **Evacetrapib (Lilly)** – The ACCELERATE trial was halted in 2015 (results published 2016) for futility; no reduction in myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death despite dramatic HDL elevation. Lilly discontinued the program.  
* **Anacetrapib (Merck)** – The REVEAL trial (large‑scale, 30 000 participants) completed in 2017 and showed a modest 9 % relative risk reduction in major coronary events. The drug lowered LDL by ~17 % and raised HDL by ~40 %. However, the absolute benefit was small, and the compound accumulated in adipose tissue, raising long‑term safety concerns. Merck decided not to pursue regulatory approval and shelved the program in 2018.  
* **Other CETP inhibitors** – No new CETP inhibitors have entered late‑stage development since anacetrapib’s abandonment. The pipeline is essentially empty.

**Impact on the field**  
* **Shift away from CETP** – Pharmaceutical R&D redirected resources toward other lipid‑modifying strategies (PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, inclisiran) and toward anti‑inflammatory approaches (e.g., colchicine, canakinumab).  
* **Re‑evaluation of HDL as a therapeutic target** – The failures reinforced the view that simply raising HDL does not guarantee cardiovascular benefit. Research now focuses on HDL functionality (cholesterol efflux capacity) rather than quantity.  
* **Regulatory and clinical practice** – No CETP inhibitor has received FDA or EMA approval. Guidelines continue to emphasize LDL‑lowering (statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) and lifestyle measures; HDL‑raising drugs are not recommended.  
* **Business outcomes** – Lilly wrote off the evacetrapib program (estimated > $1 billion). Merck’s anacetrapib effort cost several hundred million dollars and was written off after REVEAL. The broader “CETP saga” is often cited as a cautionary tale of surrogate‑endpoint reliance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *CETP inhibitors are “heading to the trash heap” and will likely be abandoned.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely correct. By 2024 no CETP inhibitor is on the market; the two most advanced programs (evacetrapib, anacetrapib) were terminated.  

- **Prediction:** *Merck’s CETP program will not survive much longer.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Merck halted anacetrapib development in 2018 despite a modest positive trial result.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Raising HDL alone will not translate into clinical benefit.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Both torcetrapib and evacetrapib dramatically increased HDL without improving outcomes; later mechanistic work showed HDL functionality, not concentration, matters.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Blood‑pressure elevation may offset lipid benefits.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially supported. Torcetrapib’s hypertension contributed to excess mortality; evacetrapib showed a small BP rise but it was insufficient to explain the null efficacy, suggesting other mechanisms (e.g., off‑target effects, HDL quality) were at play.  

Overall, the article’s pessimistic forecast proved prescient; the CETP target has been effectively retired from mainstream drug development.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece captures a pivotal moment in cardiovascular drug discovery, illustrating how reliance on surrogate biomarkers can mislead large‑scale R&D. Its retrospective relevance and the clear lesson for future therapeutic strategies make it notably interesting, though the technical discussion is fairly specialized.
