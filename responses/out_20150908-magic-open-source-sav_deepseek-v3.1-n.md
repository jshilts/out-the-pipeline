# Magic Open Source Savings Await (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the "open source pharma" movement, arguing that advocates misunderstand the realities of drug development. The author challenges claims that universities produce hundreds of abandoned discoveries that Big Pharma ignores, pointing out the extensive venture capital ecosystem and existing drug repurposing efforts. The piece takes particular issue with the idea that multiple companies researching the same targets represents wasteful duplication, arguing this parallel research is actually beneficial given high failure rates.

The article examines a proposal for an open IT platform to coordinate all stages of drug development with "dramatically lower costs." The author questions where these cost savings would actually come from, noting that drug discovery is fundamentally different from open-source software development due to physical infrastructure requirements, regulatory burdens, and the difficulty of scaling donated scientific labor compared to code contributions.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade since this article, open-source approaches have found specific niches in drug discovery but have not fundamentally disrupted the industry's core business models. Several developments emerged:

**Open-source drug discovery initiatives that gained traction:**
- **Structural biology and computational tools**: Open-source platforms like AlphaFold (2020) democratized protein structure prediction, though actual drug development still requires proprietary experimental validation.
- **COVID-19 response**: The pandemic saw unprecedented collaboration, including open genomic data sharing through GISAID, but vaccine development still followed traditional proprietary pharmaceutical company pipelines with massive public funding.

**Clinical research transparency:**
- Clinicaltrials.gov expanded significantly, with over 450,000 studies registered by 2024, improving visibility into ongoing research and failures.
- Results reporting requirements reduced but didn't eliminate publication bias.

**Open-source business models remained limited in drug development:**
- No major FDA-approved drugs emerged from fully open-source development pipelines.
- Companies continued traditional IP protection despite increased academic-industry partnerships.
- The "valley of death" between academic discovery and viable drug candidates persisted, with VCs and specialized biotech ventures still essential bridging mechanisms.

**Repurposing efforts continued systematically:**
- NIH and others maintained drug repurposing programs, but identifying truly novel indications remained challenging.
- Computational approaches accelerated screening but couldn't eliminate expensive clinical validation.

The fundamental structure of drug development costs actually increased, with average R&D costs per new drug reaching $2.8 billion according to some 2020s analyses, contradicting predictions of dramatic cost reductions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "Dramatic cost savings at every stage" through open-source workflow platforms**
- **Outcome**: This did not materialize. Drug development costs continued rising, and no comprehensive open-source platform significantly replaced proprietary systems. While some tools became open-source (structural prediction, certain computational methods), they complemented rather than replaced commercial infrastructure. The complexity of regulatory compliance, manufacturing, and clinical trials proved resistant to crowdsourced solutions.

**Prediction: Multiple companies researching the same targets is inefficient and wasteful**
- **Outcome**: Continued and proved beneficial. The 2010s-2020s saw various immunotherapy targets pursued by multiple companies with different approaches. For example, different CAR-T designs, checkpoint inhibitors, and therapeutic modalities competed, with the biological complexity making multiple approaches valuable.

**Prediction: "Hundreds of promising discoveries" abandoned in universities would be unlocked by open collaboration**
- **Outcome**: Overstated. While university-industry partnerships increased, the bottleneck remained translating discoveries into viable clinical candidates. Academic research is innovative but often lacks the medicinal chemistry, ADME optimization, and regulatory expertise necessary for drug development. No wave of open-source-developed drugs emerged.

**Prediction: Crowdsourcing could provide meaningful labor for drug development**
- **Outcome**: Minimal impact at scale. While citizen science projects and some computational challenges existed, complex drug discovery requiring specialized equipment and expertise remained resistant to open-source volunteer contributions. The physical and regulatory realities limited massive collaboration compared to software.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

The article demonstrates remarkable foresight in identifying the fundamental challenges that would limit open-source approaches to drug development, showing deep understanding of why the software analogy fails and accurately predicting that costs would not dramatically decrease.
