# Martin Shkreli Has One Idea, And It's a Bad One (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This September 2015 article critiques Martin Shkreli's business model of acquiring obscure generic drugs and implementing massive price increases. The author details how Shkreli, previously founder of Retrophin, was fired after similar practices, then formed Turing Pharmaceuticals and immediately raised the price of Daraprim (pyrimethamine) fifty-fold from $13 to $750 per dose. The article explains how companies exploit FDA market exclusivity rules intended to encourage new drug development, particularly through "grandfathering" provisions that allow old generic compounds to gain protected status. Turing employed "closed distribution" tactics to prevent generic competitors from obtaining enough drug samples to prove bioequivalence. Shkreli justified the price hikes as necessary to fund research into better treatments, while dismissing critics through aggressive social media tactics. The author characterizes this as rent-seeking behavior rather than genuine pharmaceutical innovation.

## 2. HISTORY

The Daraprim price hike became a national scandal that catalyzed significant policy and industry responses:

**Immediate Aftermath (2015-2016):**
- Widespread public outrage and media coverage made Shkreli a symbol of pharmaceutical industry greed
- Turing eventually reduced Daraprim's price after intense backlash, though not to original levels
- Shkreli was arrested in December 2015 on securities fraud charges unrelated to the Daraprim controversy
- In 2017, Shkreli was convicted on multiple counts of securities fraud related to his hedge fund management
- He was sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to forfeit $7.4 million

**Drug Availability:**
- Daraprim (pyrimethamine) remained available throughout the controversy
- In 2020, the FDA approved a generic version of pyrimethamine from Cerovene, ending Turing's monopoly
- The generic was priced at approximately $750 for a bottle of 30 tablets, still expensive but representing significant improvement
- Multiple generic alternatives eventually entered the market

**Policy Changes:**
- The controversy contributed to increased scrutiny of drug pricing practices
- FDA implemented measures to address "closed distribution" strategies that blocked generic competition
- Various legislative proposals aimed at preventing similar price hikes emerged, though comprehensive federal reform remained elusive
- The episode influenced the broader national conversation about prescription drug affordability

**Turing Pharmaceuticals:**
- The company rebranded as Vyera Pharmaceuticals in 2017
- Vyera eventually faced its own legal challenges
- In 2020, Vyera and Phoenixus AG (its parent company) were sued by the FTC and multiple states for anticompetitive practices related to Daraprim
- In 2022, Vyera and Shkreli were ordered to pay $64.6 million and Shkreli was banned from the pharmaceutical industry for life

**Industry Impact:**
- The case became a cautionary tale about pharmaceutical pricing ethics
- Increased shareholder and public sensitivity to pricing strategies
- Contributing factor in later legislative discussions about drug price controls and Medicare negotiation authority

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific explicit predictions about future outcomes, but its analysis contained several implicit forecasts about the viability and consequences of Shkreli's strategy:

• **Shkreli's Social Media Approach Would Backfire**: The article described his "usual diplomatic way" of calling critics "morons" on Twitter. ✓ **Largely accurate** - Shkreli's combative social media presence did contribute to his negative public image and may have influenced both public opinion and legal scrutiny.

• **The Business Model Was Unsustainable**: The article characterized Turing's approach as "dragging us all through the mud." ✓ **Partly accurate** - While the specific companies faced legal consequences, the broader practice of acquiring and repricing older drugs continued, though with more scrutiny. The lifetime ban from the industry was more severe than implied.

• **Legal/Regulatory Vulnerability**: The article pointed out exploitation of "loopholes" in FDA exclusivity rules. ✓ **Accurate** - These practices did lead to regulatory action and lawsuits culminating in the 2022 industry ban and $64.6 million penalty.

• **Research Justification Was Pretextual**: The article dismissed Shkreli's claim that profits would fund better drug research. ✓ **Mostly accurate** - There is little evidence that Turing/Vyera produced significant pharmaceutical innovations, and the subsequent legal actions focused on anticompetitive behavior rather than research achievements.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment that exposed systemic vulnerabilities in pharmaceutical pricing and became a landmark case in pharmaceutical industry ethics and regulation. The Daraprim controversy had lasting impact on public policy discussions, regulatory enforcement, and industry practices.
