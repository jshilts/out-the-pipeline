# Incomprehensible Drug Prices? Think Again. (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a response to criticism about high cancer drug prices, specifically addressing Peter Bach's "Unpronounceable Drugs, Incomprehensible Prices" piece. The author argues that pharmaceutical companies charging "what the market will bear" is standard business practice, not unique to healthcare. The article defends the pricing of Novartis's Zykadia (ceritinib), a second-generation ALK inhibitor priced higher than Pfizer's first-to-market Xalkori (crizotinib), arguing that Zykadia legitimately differs from Xalkori by showing activity in patients who have failed or become resistant to the first drug, and that Novartis did not simply copy Pfizer's work, but had been developing it independently for years. The author acknowledges, however, that the industry's low productivity is a long-term problem, and that it is using pricing power to compensate for R&D inefficiencies, which is unsustainable. The piece states that the prices are ultimately paid by insurance companies, and argues that if these payers find the prices unsustainable, they have the power to stop reimbursing them.

## 2. HISTORY

The development and commercial history of the two highlighted drugs, crizotinib and ceritinib, provides a concrete outcome for the article's claims. Crizotinib (Xalkori), the first-in-class ALK inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in 2011 for ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ceritinib (Zykadia), the second-generation compound, was approved in 2014, the same year the article was published, specifically for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were intolerant to or had progressed on crizotinib, validating the author's point about its distinct medical value.

Subsequently, a third-generation ALK inhibitor, alectinib (Alecensa), gained FDA approval in 2015. Head-to-head clinical trials demonstrated that alectinib had superior efficacy and better central nervous system penetration than crizotinib, and it became a preferred first-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC. Brigatinib (Alunbrig) and lorlatinib (Lorbrena) were later approved as additional second- and third-generation options. This sequence of drug development illustrates the "me-too" issue at the heart of the pricing debate: the second and third entrants were not mere copies but offered genuine therapeutic advantages, such as overcoming resistance to earlier drugs and better treating brain metastases. This supports the article's core argument that sequential drugs can have unique value justifying distinct pricing.

The issue of drug pricing has intensified significantly since 2014. Public and political scrutiny of high drug prices has become a mainstay of U.S. healthcare debate, leading to numerous congressional hearings and investigations. Policy interventions, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which for the first time granted Medicare the authority to negotiate the prices of some prescription drugs, represent a tangible shift in the regulatory landscape the author worried could result from relentless price increases. Biotech and pharma companies have continued to face pressure from payers, leading to more complex managed entry agreements, outcomes-based contracts, and robust utilization management by insurance companies. Concerning the author's point on productivity, R&D spending in the biopharmaceutical industry has continued to rise, though the debate over the net rate of innovation and its relationship to final pricing remains highly contentious.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several main predictions and assertions:

*   **Prediction 1: Price controls will result if the industry keeps raising prices.**
    *   **Evaluation:** The author's concern was prescient. While direct price controls were not enacted in the way some feared, the U.S. political system did pivot toward greater intervention. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 marks a clear shift, giving Medicare legal authority to negotiate drug prices for the first time. This is a concrete policy change that came after years of escalating prices and public outcry, directly validating the author's long-term worry.

*   **Prediction 2: No payer will pay "$50 million a dose" and insurance companies could stop reimbursing high prices if they found them unsustainable.**
    *   **Evaluation:** This has proven true in a practical sense. No price has reached such an absurd level. However, payers did not "stop paying" wholesale. Instead, they developed more sophisticated and often restrictive methods to manage high-cost drugs (e.g., prior authorizations, step therapy, narrow formularies) to control their expenditures without completely denying access. The power dynamic shifted towards payers developing more tools to push back on price.

*   **Assertion about Competition and Innovation: Zykadia is a valuable, distinct drug that works on patients who fail Xalkori, not a simple "me-too" copycat. The drug development timeline is long, and sequential drugs are necessary due to mechanisms like cancer mutation.**
    *   **Evaluation:** This assertion was strongly validated by subsequent events. The introduction of third-generation ALK inhibitors like alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib, which are even more effective and better at preventing brain metastases than crizotinib, solidified the clinical and commercial value of developing "next-in-class" therapies that can overcome resistance. The treatment paradigm for ALK-positive NSCLC is now a sequential use of these different agents, confirming the author's argument that these are valuable, distinct medicines.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article remains highly relevant and interesting because it moves beyond a superficial "drugs are too expensive" argument to dissect the flawed comparisons and economic realities behind drug pricing, focusing on a specific, real-world example. Its core arguments about the value of "me-too" drugs and the inevitability of pricing scrutiny have been strongly validated by a decade of subsequent drug development and policy changes.
