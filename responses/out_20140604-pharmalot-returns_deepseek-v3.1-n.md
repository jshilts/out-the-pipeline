# Pharmalot Returns (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief announcement celebrates the revival of Ed Silverman's Pharmalot blog at the Wall Street Journal in June 2014. The author notes this represents the "third iteration" of the blog, describing it metaphorically as "unkillable" given its persistence across different platforms despite previous shutdowns. The article expresses relief and enthusiasm that Silverman's pharmaceutical industry reporting would continue under the WSJ banner.

## 2. HISTORY

Ed Silverman continued writing for the Wall Street Journal's Pharmalot column from June 2014 onward, establishing it as a prominent source of pharmaceutical industry news and analysis. The blog maintained its focus on investigative reporting about drug pricing, regulatory issues, clinical trial results, and corporate developments in the biopharmaceutical sector. The column became known for breaking news stories and in-depth coverage that often influenced broader industry discourse. WSJ's investment in continuing the Pharmalot brand reflected the growing importance of specialized healthcare and pharmaceutical reporting as the industry faced increased scrutiny over drug costs, opioid crisis accountability, and regulatory transparency issues.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Third iteration...unkillable"** - This observation proved accurate: Pharmalot under Silverman at WSJ became a sustained and influential industry publication, though it was more a recognition of existing resilience than a forward prediction.

• The implied prediction that readers would continue to value Pharmalot's coverage **came true** as the blog became a go-to source for pharma industry professionals and journalists covering healthcare.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While positive news for industry journalists and pharma professionals, this article lacks broader scientific, clinical, or policy significance, serving primarily as a brief announcement of a blog platform change with minimal detailed content to analyze in retrospect.
