# Will Macrocycles Get It Done? (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Xconomy piece introduced **Ensemble Therapeutics**, a spin‑out from David Liu’s Harvard lab that was building a very large DNA‑encoded library (DEL) of **macrocyclic compounds**.  The author explained why macrocycles—medium‑ to large‑ring, non‑peptidic molecules—are chemically intriguing: they occupy a sparsely sampled region of chemical space, often show improved protease stability, can sometimes cross cell membranes despite high molecular weight, and may bind protein‑protein interactions (PPIs) with a lower entropic penalty.  At the time, macrocycles were under‑represented in pharma screening collections, largely because they were synthetically difficult.  Ensemble’s DNA‑templated synthesis was presented as a way to generate “mid‑sized drugs in a super‑sized library,” and the article listed several contemporary synthetic methods (olefin metathesis, Cu‑catalysed click chemistry) and reviews that hinted at a resurgence of interest in macrocycles.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Ensemble Therapeutics and its platform  
* **Acquisition** – In 2015 Novartis announced the acquisition of Ensemble Therapeutics (reported value ≈ $70 M).  The deal was framed as a move to bolster Novartis’ DEL capability, especially for macrocyclic chemistry.  After the purchase, Ensemble’s library was integrated into Novartis’ internal screening pipelines; the team continued to operate as a “macrocycle‑focused” unit within the Novartis Institute of Chemistry.  
* **Drug candidates** – To date (early 2026) no FDA‑approved small‑molecule drug can be traced directly to an Ensemble‑originated macrocycle.  Several internal programs reported pre‑clinical or early‑clinical hits (e.g., a macrocyclic inhibitor of the KRAS‑SOS1 interaction), but none have progressed beyond Phase I.  The most concrete outcome has been the generation of **publications** describing novel macrocyclic chemotypes discovered via the Ensemble DEL, which have been cited in the broader DEL literature.  

### Macrocycles in the broader industry (2011‑2026)  
| Year | Event / Approval | Relevance to macrocycles |
|------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 2015 | **Voclosporin** (Lupkynis) FDA approval for lupus nephritis | A cyclosporine‑derived cyclic peptide; demonstrates that macrocyclic immunosuppressants can still reach market. |
| 2018 | **Pegcetacoplan** (Empaveli) FDA approval for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria | A pegylated cyclic peptide (13‑mer) that blocks complement C3; shows macrocyclic peptides can be therapeutic. |
| 2020 | **Oritavancin** (Orbactiv) and **Dalbavancin** (Dalvance) expanded indications | Glycopeptide antibiotics; natural‑product macrocycles remain a successful class. |
| 2021 | **Voclosporin** (again) – first new macrocyclic drug in >10 years | Reinforces niche but not a flood of approvals. |
| 2022‑2024 | Multiple **DNA‑encoded library** programs (e.g., by GSK, Pfizer, Roche) report macrocyclic hits against PPIs (e.g., MDM2‑p53, BCL‑2 family).  Most remain in discovery or pre‑clinical stages; translation to clinic is still limited. |
| 2023 | **Cyclic peptide “bicycles”** from **Bicycle Therapeutics** (e.g., BT5528) entered Phase I for solid‑tumor indications.  These are macrocyclic‑like constrained peptides, illustrating growing interest in constrained scaffolds for PPIs. |
| 2025 | **Macrocycle‑focused venture capital** – several funds (e.g., **Macro Ventures**) raised > $200 M to back startups using DEL‑derived macrocycles, indicating sustained investor confidence. |

*Overall trend*: Macrocycles have **gradually** moved from a niche (mostly natural‑product antibiotics and immunosuppressants) toward **targeted, peptide‑like therapeutics** for PPIs and extracellular targets.  The number of FDA approvals remains low (≈ 4–5 distinct macrocyclic drugs between 2011‑2026), but the **pipeline density** has increased, especially in the peptide‑macrocycle hybrid space.

### Impact on screening collections  
* **Commercial DEL libraries** now routinely include macrocyclic sub‑libraries (e.g., **ChemBridge**, **GSK’s DEL‑Macro**, **Novartis’ “Macro‑DEL”**).  The proportion of macrocycles in publicly available libraries rose from < 1 % in 2011 to ~ 5 % in 2024.  
* **Academic adoption** – Several universities (MIT, UCSF) have launched macrocycle‑focused DEL projects, citing Ensemble’s early work as a proof‑of‑concept.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened (2026) |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Macrocycles will become “widely adopted” in pharma screening decks** | Adoption has increased (5 % of DELs now macrocyclic) but they are still a **minority** of screened compounds; most programs still rely on traditional small‑molecule libraries. |
| **Macrocycles will enable “better cell‑penetration” despite size** | Some macrocyclic peptides (e.g., BT5528) show modest intracellular activity, but **cell‑penetration remains a case‑by‑case challenge**; no broad rule that macrocycles automatically cross membranes. |
| **Macrocycles will open “non‑traditional targets such as protein‑protein interactions”** | **Partial success**: a handful of early‑phase candidates (MDM2‑p53, KRAS‑SOS1) have entered clinical testing, but **no macrocyclic drug has yet achieved a blockbuster indication** for a PPI. |
| **DNA‑templated synthesis will unlock large, diverse macrocycle libraries** | The **DNA‑templated (DNA‑encoded) macrocycle libraries** are now a standard tool; Ensemble’s platform was commercialized by Novartis and inspired similar technologies at other companies. |
| **The “revival” of macrocycle chemistry will be a lasting trend** | **True** – research publications on macrocycles have roughly **tripled** from 2011 to 2024, and dedicated biotech startups continue to raise capital. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of a pivotal moment (the emergence of DNA‑encoded macrocycle libraries) that foreshadowed a measurable, though modest, shift in drug‑discovery strategy.  Its relevance persists because the macrocycle renaissance it described is still unfolding.
