# Glaxo v. Pfizer: Sales Force Stand-Down? (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2005 commentary discusses GlaxoSmithKline chairman Jean-Pierre Garnier's public criticism of the pharmaceutical industry's "arms race" in sales force size. Garnier argued that the massive marketing expenditures, particularly on sales representatives, had reached inefficient levels where physicians were becoming overwhelmed and the return on investment was diminishing. He suggested that companies were maintaining large sales forces primarily because competitors (especially Pfizer) were doing so, rather than because it made economic sense.

The article's author agrees that the sales force approach had "crossed over a threshold," with doctors being swarmed by reps who often couldn't even get appointments with physicians. The commentary notes that pharmaceutical companies had been able to earn higher returns by promoting existing drugs than by investing in R&D—a concerning trend for innovation. However, the author challenges Garnier's framing, arguing that if Pfizer was achieving higher returns through their massive sales force, then other companies simply needed to compete more effectively rather than complain about industry practices.

## 2. HISTORY

The debate over pharmaceutical sales forces in 2005 proved remarkably prescient, as the industry underwent significant transformation in the subsequent decade:

**Sales Force Reductions (2006-2012):** Both Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) dramatically reduced their sales forces. Pfizer cut approximately 20% of its US sales force in 2006-2007, and continued reductions followed. GSK also substantially downsized its sales operations during this period. By 2012, many major pharmaceutical companies had reduced their sales forces by 25-40% compared to 2005 levels.

**Shift to Digital and Targeted Marketing:** The industry moved away from mass sales force deployment toward more sophisticated, data-driven approaches. Companies invested heavily in digital marketing, customer relationship management systems, and targeted detailing to high-prescribing physicians. Key opinion leader (KOL) engagement became more strategic rather than broad-based.

**FDA Regulations and Sunshine Act:** The 2010 Physician Payments Sunshine Act (part of the Affordable Care Act) increased transparency around pharmaceutical company payments to physicians, changing the dynamics of sales rep relationships with healthcare providers. This reduced some of the excess that Garnier had criticized.

**Economic Pressures:** The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent healthcare cost containment efforts put additional pressure on pharmaceutical companies to optimize their cost structures, accelerating the shift away from expensive sales forces.

**Industry Consolidation:** The period saw significant mergers and acquisitions (including Pfizer's acquisitions of Wyeth and later attempts at AstraZeneca), which often led to sales force consolidation and optimization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"We do not need those large sales forces to do the job. We need them because the competition is planning to increase their noise level"** - Garnier's prediction that sales force size was economically inefficient proved largely accurate. Pharmaceutical companies did significantly downsize their sales forces in the subsequent decade, recognizing declining returns. However, this wasn't due to coordinated industry action but rather individual company decisions based on economic realities.

• **"Doctors have been getting swarmed by sales reps, many of whom don't even get close to seeing an M.D. any more"** - This trend of physician accessibility barriers accelerated. Physician resistance to traditional sales rep visits increased, leading to lower access rates and forcing companies to adopt alternative marketing strategies.

• **"Further expenditures on more salespeople bring a smaller and smaller return, to the point where it stops making economic sense"** - The prediction of diminishing returns was validated. Pharmaceutical companies found that digital marketing, specialty sales forces, and targeted approaches delivered better ROI than mass sales force deployment.

• **Implicit prediction that R&D investment would become more attractive relative to marketing** - While marketing budgets did shift toward more efficient channels, pharmaceutical R&D productivity remained challenging throughout this period. The fundamental issue of high R&D costs with uncertain returns persisted.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a critical inflection point in pharmaceutical industry strategy, accurately identifying the unsustainable nature of sales force escalation while highlighting the broader tension between marketing investment and R&D productivity. The discussion proved remarkably relevant to the major industry transformations that followed.
