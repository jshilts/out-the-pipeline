# An Alzheimer's Cure? Not So Fast (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary critiques media coverage of a Science Translational Medicine paper that showed a small-molecule PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414) could slow neurodegeneration in a mouse prion disease model. The author explains that the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway—specifically PERK-mediated translation shutdown—showed promise for treating protein misfolding diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. However, the article emphasizes that the specific compound had severe side effects (elevated blood glucose, weight loss) that made it unsuitable for human development. The author distinguishes between scientifically interesting results and actual clinical breakthroughs, noting that prion disease in mice is not equivalent to human Alzheimer's disease.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this article revealed the wisdom of the author's cautious tone. The specific PERK inhibitor pathway did **not** translate into approved therapies for Alzheimer's or other neurodegenerative diseases. GSK2606414 remained a tool compound, and efforts to develop safe, effective PERK inhibitors for neurodegeneration largely stalled due to the toxicity and pancreatic effects highlighted in the article.

The broader Alzheimer's drug development landscape during 2013-2023 was dominated by the amyloid hypothesis, culminating in the controversial FDA approval of **aducanumab (Aduhelm)** in 2021 and **lecanemab (Leqembi)** in 2023. These antibodies showed modest cognitive benefits but significant safety concerns (ARIA side effects), and uptake has been slower than anticipated due to cost, access, and modest efficacy.

Clinical trial outcomes generally validated the article's caution: translating from animal models to human neurodegeneration proved enormously difficult. Many promising preclinical candidates (including various UPR, tau, and inflammation-targeting approaches) failed in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. As of 2024, no UPR modulator has reached FDA approval for any neurodegenerative indication, and the prion-to-Alzheimer's extrapolation the article questioned has not borne therapeutic fruit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article's explicit and implicit predictions:**

• **Prediction:** "Getting a PERK inhibitor to perform in humans will not be easy" due to side effects and insulin secretion interference
  - **Outcome:** **Accurate.** No PERK inhibitor advanced to clinical use for neurodegeneration, validating the author's concerns about GSK2606414's toxicity profile and mechanistic challenges.

• **Prediction:** PERK inhibition might paradoxically help treat insulin resistance if pancreas exposure could be avoided, but "I can't imagine how you'd do it"
  - **Outcome:** **Accurate.** No tissue-selective PERK inhibitor reached clinical practice, confirming the delivery challenge.

• **Prediction:** Research would "swing next" to other targets in PERK-driven pathways that might be "better arranged" for drug development
  - **Outcome:** **Partially accurate.** The broader UPR pathway did receive continued research attention, but alternative targets within the pathway did not yield breakthrough drugs either—suggesting the entire pathway was more challenging than hoped.

• **Prediction:** "Many years of work" would be needed before translatable drugs emerged from this mechanism
  - **Outcome:** **Accurate with emphasis.** More than a decade later, the pathway has not delivered clinical therapies, indicating even more time and fundamental rethinking is needed.

• **Implicit prediction:** Media hype about "breakthroughs" based on mouse prion studies would prove premature
  - **Outcome:** **Highly accurate.** The subsequent decade saw numerous similar premature announcements, with 2013-2023 showing repeated failures to translate promising preclinical neurodegeneration findings into human therapies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates exceptional scientific literacy and predictive accuracy, correctly identifying both the promise and pitfalls of the UPR pathway while pushing back against media sensationalism in ways that still resonate today. It serves as a durable case study in the difficulty of neurodegeneration drug development.
