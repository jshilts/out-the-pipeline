# A Short Rise Out of Depression (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the emerging evidence that NMDA receptor antagonists show rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant major depression. It focuses on AZD6765 (lanicemine), an NMDA channel blocker originally developed by AstraZeneca for stroke but shelved after phase 2 trials failed.

The key finding was that a single intravenous infusion of AZD6765 produced rapid antidepressant effects within minutes in patients who had failed an average of seven previous antidepressant trials and 45% of whom had failed electroconvulsive therapy. Unlike ketamine (which has longer-lasting effects but severe dissociative side effects), AZD6765 did not produce psychotomimetic effects. However, the antidepressant effects were transitory, lasting only about two hours by some measures, or at most a couple of days.

The article raises the possibility that the therapeutic window for NMDA antagonism may be narrow - the same properties that produce robust antidepressant effects might also cause side effects. It suggests that AZD6765 itself may not have a future as an antidepressant due to its short duration, but it could help elucidate the mechanism of rapid antidepressant action.

## 2. HISTORY
**Lanicemine's subsequent clinical development:**
Phase 2 trials for treatment-resistant depression were indeed conducted, but the drug ultimately failed to demonstrate efficacy in larger, longer-term studies. The initial promise of rapid antidepressant effects did not translate into sustained clinical benefit.

**Ketamine's path to approval:**
- In March 2019, the FDA approved esketamine (Spravato), the S-enantiomer of ketamine, as a nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression, used in combination with an oral antidepressant.
- Esketamine was specifically approved for adults with treatment-resistant depression who had failed at least two prior antidepressant treatments.
- Importantly, esketamine requires administration at certified medical offices due to risks of sedation, dissociation, and abuse potential.
- Real-world uptake has occurred but remains limited due to the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) requirements, cost, and the need for in-office administration.

**Continuing research directions:**
The ketamine research did help validate NMDA receptor antagonism as a viable mechanism, leading to continued investigation of:
- Other NMDA receptor modulators
- The role of downstream effects, particularly mTOR pathway activation
- Metabolites like hydroxynorketamine that may contribute to sustained effects

**Clinical practice evolution:**
While ketamine and esketamine found a place in treatment-resistant depression protocols, the field continued to struggle with balancing rapid onset against duration of effect and managing tolerability concerns. The initial hope for a "clean" rapid-acting antidepressant without dissociative effects has remained elusive.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"I doubt if AZD6765 itself has a future as an antidepressant"** - This prediction was accurate. Lanicemine did not advance to become an approved antidepressant.

• **"If it can help to understand that mode of action...it could lead to something very valuable indeed"** - This was partially correct. While lanicemine itself failed, the broader exploration of NMDA antagonism did lead to esketamine's approval, though arguably the "very valuable" breakthrough remains somewhat limited given the restricted use and ongoing safety concerns.

• **The article's implicit prediction that the short duration would be a major limitation** - This proved prescient for lanicemine and remains a challenge even for approved esketamine, which requires repeated dosing and careful monitoring.

• **Implication that understanding downstream effects could unlock more targeted therapies** - This continues to be an active area of research but has not yet produced dramatic breakthroughs beyond ketamine/esketamine.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important moment in psychiatry - the emergence of rapid-acting antidepressants - but focused on a compound that ultimately failed while the related compound ketamine/esketamine succeeded. It highlights the unpredictability of drug development and the challenges of translating promising mechanisms into clinically useful therapies.
