# Another Germ Theory Victory - Back Pain? (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The May 2013 article discusses a Danish research team's finding that many cases of chronic low back pain may be caused by low-grade bacterial infections from *Propionibacterium acnes*. The team reportedly isolated these bacteria from tissue samples and demonstrated successful treatment using lengthy antibiotic courses. The author frames this within a "New Germ Theory" context, referencing Paul Ewald's ideas about infectious causes for diseases and drawing parallels to the earlier discovery that stomach ulcers were bacterial in origin (H. pylori) rather than stress-related. The article speculates about other conditions that might have undiscovered infectious origins, mentioning obesity as another possibility.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 reports, the bacterial theory of chronic low back pain generated significant interest but has not been conclusively validated or widely adopted in clinical practice. The initial Danish studies showed that **about 40-50% of patients with Modic type 1 changes** (specific vertebral endplate changes visible on MRI) improved with extended antibiotic treatment.

However, subsequent research produced mixed results. While some smaller studies reproduced the findings, **larger and more rigorous trials** have been less conclusive. The MAIN study in the UK and other European trials found **no significant difference** between antibiotic treatment and placebo groups for chronic low back pain.

The most important development is that **routine antibiotic treatment for chronic back pain has not been adopted** by mainstream medical guidelines. Instead, the current understanding is that if bacterial infection plays a role in back pain, it's likely limited to specific subsets of patients—particularly those with Type 1 Modic changes and clear inflammatory markers. Even in this subgroup, the benefit-risk ratio of long-term antibiotic use remains questionable.

No FDA-approved treatments specifically targeting bacterial causes of chronic back pain have emerged, and the approach has not become standard clinical practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: That bacterial infection would prove to be a major cause of chronic back pain, similar to how H. pylori revolutionized ulcer treatment.
  **Reality**: While initially promising, subsequent research has been mixed. The theory applies at most to subsets of patients, not broadly across chronic back pain cases.

• **Prediction**: That this finding would revolutionize back pain treatment and lead to widespread antibiotic use.
  **Reality**: Antibiotic treatment has not become standard practice. Medical guidelines do not recommend routine antibiotics for chronic back pain due to lack of consistent evidence and concerns about antibiotic resistance.

• **Prediction** (implicit): That bacterial infection theories would expand to other conditions like obesity.
  **Reality**: While microbiota research has expanded dramatically, the direct infectious disease model has not been validated for obesity. The relationship between gut bacteria and metabolism is more complex than simple infection models suggested.

• **Prediction**: That this would represent another major "Germ Theory" victory expanding our understanding of disease origins.
  **Reality**: The hypothesis remains contested and niche rather than representing a paradigm shift. Its impact has been limited to research settings rather than transforming clinical practice.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article highlights an important research direction that initially seemed promising, but subsequent evidence has been mixed. While the bacterial hypothesis generated research interest and continues in niche applications, it hasn't revolutionized back pain treatment as originally hoped.
