# [A Year-End Review at Xconomy (December 2013)]

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from December 2013 references Luke Timmerman's year-end review of the biotech industry using the "hype cycle" framework to evaluate various therapeutic areas and companies based on their stage: Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment, or Plateau of Productivity. The author notes that immunotherapies were the hottest area in 2013, with dramatic clinical results emerging, but expresses skepticism that they would "march through the rest of the oncology field" in similar fashion. The article also highlights Moderna and messenger RNA-based therapies as being on the hype list, referencing AstraZeneca's significant deal with Moderna in March 2013, while noting that things had gone quiet afterward, which the author viewed as appropriate given the substantial work needed. The author acknowledges their own wariness about "this-changes-everything platforms" while recognizing that sometimes such platforms do indeed change everything.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immunotherapy Development (2013-2024):** The article's recognition of immunotherapies in 2013 came at a pivotal moment. PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors were still emerging, with Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab (Opdivo) gaining its first FDA approval in December 2014 for melanoma, followed by Merck's pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in September 2014. These drugs became transformative, with Keytruda now approved for over 30 cancer types and becoming one of the world's best-selling drugs (approximately \$25 billion in 2023 sales). CAR-T cell therapies also advanced dramatically: Kymriah (Novartis) and Yescarta (Gilead/Kite) gained FDA approval in 2017, with several others following, treating various blood cancers with remarkable efficacy.

However, immunotherapy did not "march through the rest of the oncology field" as feared/hoped. Immunotherapies proved highly effective for certain cancers (melanoma, lung, kidney, some blood cancers) but showed limited efficacy in many solid tumors due to "cold" tumor microenvironments, leading to active research in combination therapies and overcoming resistance mechanisms.

**mRNA Therapeutics (2013-2024):** The article captured Moderna when it was still relatively unknown outside biotech circles, following its \$240 million AstraZeneca deal in March 2013. Things remained "pretty quiet" publicly for several more years. Moderna continued platform development and smaller partnerships before filing for IPO in 2018 (valued at \$7.5 billion). The company had no approved products until December 2020 when its COVID-19 vaccine became the second FDA-approved mRNA vaccine. The pandemic transformed mRNA technology from promising-but-unproven to globally validated platform. Moderna's market cap peaked at over \$200 billion in 2021, though it has since stabilized lower. BioNTech, Moderna's main mRNA competitor, saw similar trajectory with Pfizer-partnered vaccine.

Other mRNA applications have advanced: several mRNA vaccines for other diseases are in development or trials (influenza, Zika, cancer vaccines, personalized neoantigen therapies), but widespread adoption beyond COVID-19 has been slower than some early 2020s predictions suggested.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"things have been pretty quiet (as they probably should be - those guys have a lot of work to do)"** — This was accurate. Moderna remained largely under the radar publicly from 2013-2019, focusing on platform development, raising private funding, and small partnerships. The first major public visibility came with their 2018 IPO.

• **"We'll see, but I'll bet we won't see in 2014"** — Correct. No mRNA therapeutics reached market in 2014, and none succeeded until the COVID-19 vaccines in 2020, though early clinical trials began appearing in subsequent years.

• **"I don't think that they're [immunotherapies] going to be able to march through the rest of the oncology field in similar fashion"** — Partially validated. Immunotherapies proved revolutionary for specific cancer types but did not universally succeed across all cancers. The author's caution against universal application was appropriate given the heterogeneity of immunotherapy responses across tumor types that became apparent through extensive clinical experience.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article successfully identified two of the most transformative biotechnologies of the subsequent decade (immunotherapy and mRNA therapeutics) at a crucial inflection point, demonstrating sharp analysis of emerging trends. The author's balanced skepticism about universal claims while recognizing transformative potential provides a useful model for evaluating emerging technologies. The juxtaposition of these two fields at their respective early stages makes this article valuable to revisit.
