# AstraZeneca, As Expected, Pulls the Plug (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that AstraZeneca terminated its partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals on fostamatinib, an investigational rheumatoid arthritis drug, after Phase III trials showed no benefit compared to AbbVie's Humira. The author notes this as another in a series of late-stage clinical failures for AstraZeneca, questioning whether these reflect inherent difficulties in drug discovery, random misfortune, or fundamental problems in target/compound selection. The piece suggests that new CEO Pascal Soriot faces significant challenges, and while statistical probability might lead to future successes through random chance, that alone may prove insufficient for the company's turnaround.

## 2. HISTORY

**Fostamatinib's journey after 2013:** Rigel regained rights and continued development. The drug was ultimately **FDA-approved in 2018 under the brand name Tavalisse (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate)** for treating chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults who had insufficient response to previous treatment. This represented a pivot from rheumatoid arthritis to a different autoimmune indication where SYK inhibition proved clinically meaningful.

**Post-2013 clinical outcomes:** The drug demonstrated efficacy in ITP through inhibition of splenic tyrosine kinase (SYK), reducing platelet destruction. However, uptake has been **modest** - it serves as a second- or third-line option rather than transforming the treatment paradigm. Annual sales reached approximately $200-300 million by the early 2020s, representing a commercial success but not a blockbuster.

**AstraZeneca's trajectory:** The company's fortunes indeed improved under Pascal Soriot's leadership, though through strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and internal R&D restructuring rather than random chance. Key oncology drugs like Tagrisso, Lynparza, and Imfinzi eventually drove growth. The period 2012-2016 remained challenging, but by 2017-2020 AZN had stabilized and returned to growth.

**SYK inhibitor field:** Fostamatinib remains the **only approved SYK inhibitor** as of 2024. While other candidates entered development for various indications, none achieved FDA approval, suggesting the target proved more challenging than initially anticipated across multiple disease areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about AZ's failure rate:** The author questioned whether AZ's struggles represented random chance versus systematic issues. **Outcome**: A mix of both. The high failure rate partly reflected industry-wide challenges, but AZ's subsequent recovery required deliberate strategic changes under Soriot - redeploying resources to oncology/immunology, acquiring synergistic assets, and reforming R&D processes. Success did not arrive purely through regression to the mean.

• **Stated concern that "odds are, that may not be enough":** The worry that random improvement wouldn't suffice proved **prescient**. AZ needed fundamental restructuring beyond statistical probability, which Soriot's team implemented over several years. The company's recovery was slower and more deliberate than simple probability would suggest.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **5/10**

The article captures an important moment in pharmaceutical development, featuring both a notable clinical failure and broader questions about predictability in drug development. The fostamatinib case proved more interesting long-term than initially apparent - the drug eventually reached market through indication-switching, a common but underexamined pathway in drug development. The broader questions about distinguishing signal from noise in clinical trial failures remain highly relevant. However, much of the piece focuses on immediate disappointment rather than exploring deeper structural issues, limiting its lasting analytical value.
