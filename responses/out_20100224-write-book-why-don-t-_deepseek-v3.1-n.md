# Write A Book, Why Don't You (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog (hosted on Science magazine's website) is a brief, 58-word call to action following reader responses to his "Things I Won't Work With" series. The author expresses willingness to compile his blog content into a book but lacks connections in the publishing industry. He asks his readership for referrals to literary agents or publishing contacts who could help facilitate this project.

## 2. HISTORY

Derek Lowe did indeed turn his popular chemistry blog content into a book. In **2013, his book "The Chemistry Book: From Gunpowder to Graphene, 250 Milestones in the History of Chemistry" was published by Sterling**. Rather than being a collection of his "Things I Won't Work With" posts (which feature dangerous and exotic chemicals), this volume took a different approach, presenting 250 chronological milestones in chemical discovery with accessible explanations for general readers.

The book received positive reception and was reviewed in major publications including Chemical & Engineering News and Nature Chemistry. The "Things I Won't Work With" series continued on his blog for years afterward, eventually gaining even wider recognition in the chemistry community and becoming one of the most popular recurring features on chemistry blogs.

In terms of concrete impact, Lowe's blog itself became increasingly influential in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery circles, with his "In the Pipeline" blog remaining active and widely read in the biopharma industry for over two decades. The blog has covered major developments in pharmaceutical research, clinical trials, and industry trends, making it a significant resource for scientists and industry professionals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original post contained no explicit predictions about future events, scientific developments, or industry trends. It was purely a meta-post about the author's potential publishing plans.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a very brief administrative post concerning the author's personal publishing logistics rather than substantive commentary about the biotechnology industry. While it serves as historical documentation of how Lowe's influential chemistry writing evolved into book form, the post itself contains no analytical content about science or biotechnology developments.
