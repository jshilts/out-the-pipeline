# A Vioxx Bomb Drops. Or Does It? (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a December 2005 "Expression of Concern" published by the New England Journal of Medicine regarding the VIGOR trial data for Merck's painkiller Vioxx (rofecoxib), originally published in 2000. The journal editors discovered an earlier manuscript version on a submission disk that contained a blank table for cardiovascular events, suggesting Merck may have deleted adverse cardiovascular data days before final publication. This revelation emerged during litigation over Vioxx's cardiovascular risks, with the first federal trial jury already deliberating. The author analyzes that while Merck appeared to have removed three additional heart attacks from the final publication, these data had already been submitted to the FDA during approval and appeared on Vioxx's package insert, meaning the information wasn't hidden from regulators despite potentially being omitted from the journal article. The piece concludes that Merck may have been negligent in their publication practices but hadn't concealed the safety data from authorities.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this article, the Vioxx saga continued with significant real-world consequences. Merck ultimately withdrew Vioxx worldwide in September 2004 after the APPROVe trial showed doubled cardiovascular risk after 18 months of use. The company faced approximately 27,000 lawsuits and settled for $4.85 billion in 2007, though they maintained the drug didn't cause heart attacks when used as directed. Most of their losses came in state court trials rather than federal cases. The 2005 VIGOR trial revelations the article discusses contributed to Merck's legal challenges, though the company eventually won more federal cases than it lost by arguing dosing and duration mattered. The controversy led to major changes: the FDA implemented mandatory registration of all clinical trials in 2007, increased scrutiny of drug safety data throughout a drug's lifecycle, and established more rigorous post-market surveillance requirements. The COX-2 inhibitor class suffered, with Bextra withdrawn in 2005, though Celebrex remained on the market with enhanced warnings. Merck restructured significantly, cutting thousands of jobs and shifting R&D focus, never fully recovering its previous industry dominance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Mistrial Prediction**: The article speculated about potential mistrial motions following the NEJM revelations. This proved largely correct as evidence manipulation became a recurring theme in Vioxx litigation, though Merck's overall legal strategy focused on arguing causation and proper use succeeded in many cases.
• **Merck Legal Vulnerability**: The article suggested Merck "looks like gang of idiots" but noted the data wasn't hidden from FDA. The prediction underestimated the systematic nature of the issue—further investigations revealed Merck had minimized cardiovascular risks across multiple communications, not just one paper, which contributed to massive litigation costs and reputation damage.
• **Journalistic Impact**: The prediction about "Merck Hides Data" headlines proved accurate in tone, with extensive media coverage of manipulated trial data becoming central to the Vioxx narrative, significantly shaping public perception and regulatory response.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical industry accountability, documenting early evidence of clinical trial data manipulation that presaged major regulatory reforms and demonstrated the need for clinical trial transparency.
