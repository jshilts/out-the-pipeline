# In-Sourcing Chemistry: Lilly and AMRI (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary discusses an arrangement where Eli Lilly contracted Albany Molecular (AMRI) to hire over 40 chemists to work on-site at Lilly's Indianapolis facilities. The article notes that these chemists were likely being hired from the same talent pool that Lilly had previously laid off, effectively allowing Lilly to access chemistry expertise through AMRI's employment structure rather than direct hires. 

The author identifies this as a form of outsourcing that keeps jobs in the US while achieving cost savings through lower compensation structures than typical pharmaceutical company employment packages. The arrangement is characterized as potentially representing a broader trend toward "on-shoring" chemical jobs at reduced pay levels, while questioning whether this primarily reflects strategic workforce management or a response to Lilly's approaching patent cliff challenges.

## 2. HISTORY

**The broader CRO/pharma partnership trend:** Following the 2011 article, the contract research organization (CRO) industry continued its substantial growth. Major CROs like Covance (acquired by LabCorp in 2015), Quintiles (merged with IMS Health to become IQVIA in 2016), and Charles River Laboratories expanded significantly. However, the specific model described in the article - on-site CRO chemistry teams working within pharmaceutical facilities - did not become as widespread as the article speculated.

**Eli Lilly's patent cliff and R&D restructuring:** Lilly did face significant patent cliff challenges after 2011, particularly with the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa ($5 billion annual sales) and Cymbalta ($4.7 billion). However, the company's response involved broader strategic restructuring beyond just the AMRI partnership. Lilly's R&D workforce experienced substantial changes, including layoffs across multiple sites between 2009-2019, but the specific Indianapolis on-site CRO arrangement did not forestall broader research challenges or become a blueprint for industry practices.

**Clinical and business outcomes:** The partnership did not fundamentally alter either company's long-term trajectory. Lilly successfully navigated its patent cliff through new product launches including Trulicity (2014), Jardiance (2014), and Verzenio (2017), with varying success levels in adoption and market penetration. AMRI continued to grow as a CRO but also diversified its business model beyond the on-site chemistry services model, eventually being acquired by Aptuit in 2017 (though the combined entity continued operating under AMRI initially).

**Employment patterns:** The article's speculation about establishing a precedent for lower-paid chemistry jobs staying in the US did partially materialize in some contexts, as pharmaceutical companies continued to use CRO partnerships for cost efficiencies. However, the specific model of CRO employees working on-site in pharma facilities remained somewhat uncommon compared to traditional off-site CRO collaboration models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1 (subtle):** That this arrangement might represent "the beginning of the on-shoring of chemical jobs - albeit at a lower level of compensation"
- **Outcome:** Partially accurate. While the CRO industry did enable retention of some US-based chemistry jobs that might otherwise have moved overseas, the on-site CRO model specifically did not become widespread. CRO employment continued to grow in response to pharma outsourcing needs.
- **Evidence:** IQVIA reported CRO market growth from ~$23 billion in 2012 to nearly $35 billion by 2017, with continued expansion through 2024, indicating that various forms of outsourcing continued expanding.

**Prediction 2:** That this was a response to Lilly's "hideous, hair-pulling patent cliff"
- **Outcome:** Accurate. Lilly's patent cliff challenges were real and substantial.
- **Evidence:** Lilly's revenue declined from $24.3 billion in 2011 to $19.6 billion in 2014 due to patent losses, demonstrating the patent cliff's significant financial impact.
- **Note:** However, the specific on-site AMRI arrangement was just one element in a broader set of strategic responses that included pipeline development, layoffs, R&D restructuring, and continued outsourcing to international partners.

**Prediction 3 (implied):** That such arrangements might become common practice
- **Outcome:** Limited realization. While pharma-CRO partnerships expanded dramatically, the on-site CRO employee model treated here as potentially innovative received mixed adoption.
- **Evidence:** Reviews of popular CRO service models show traditional off-site project management remained predominant. 

## 4. INTEREST

**3/9**

This article captures a transitional moment in pharmaceutical R&D outsourcing approaching 2012-2015 patent cliffs but the specific on-site CRO chemistry model did not become a major disruptive force. It's therefore more of a historical anecdote than a pivotal development.
