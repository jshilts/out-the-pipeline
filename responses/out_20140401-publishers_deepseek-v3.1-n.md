# Off To the Publishers (April 1, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from April 1, 2014, documents the author (Derek Lowe) submitting the manuscript for "The Chemistry Book" to the publisher. The author notes the ironic timing of an April Fool's Day deadline and describes the manuscript submission as complete regarding the main writing portion. However, they mention that additional work remains, including tracking down dates, adding references for further reading, settling on illustrations with captions, and other editorial tasks before final publication.

The post serves as a milestone update in what appears to be a blog series about the book-writing process, with a previous post referenced about "The Chemistry Book" from November 2013.

## 2. HISTORY

"The Chemistry Book" by Derek Lowe was published in 2016 by Sterling Publishing. The book presents 250 milestones in the history of chemistry, organized chronologically with accessible explanations for general readers. 

The book has been well-received, achieving significant commercial success as a science reference book and finding its place alongside similar illustrated science history books in the market. It maintains positive ratings on major bookseller platforms and has become part of the broader category of science books for general audiences. The book's publication reflected the continuation of Lowe's career as both a pharmaceutical industry researcher and science communicator through his "In the Pipeline" blog and subsequent books.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contained no predictions about future scientific or technological developments in biotechnology or chemistry. The post was purely descriptive of the book-writing and publication process, focusing on the immediate tasks of manuscript completion and editing rather than forecasting future trends or developments in the field.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This post is primarily a personal update about book publishing logistics rather than substantive commentary about biotechnology. While it mentions a chemistry book that could interest general science readers, the article itself contains no analysis, predictions, or insights about the biotechnology industry that would justify higher interest for this analysis format.
