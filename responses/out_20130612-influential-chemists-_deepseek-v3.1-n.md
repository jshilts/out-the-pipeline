# Influential Chemists, Anyone? (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from June 2013 discusses a question posed by the chemistry blog ChemBark: who is the most respected and influential chemist among chemists themselves? The author notes that Roald Hoffmann was selected as the top choice, with other notable contenders including Daniel Nocera, E.J. Corey, George Whitesides, K. Barry Sharpless, Harold Kroto, Robert Grubbs, Harry Gray, Dudley Herschbach, Richard Zare, and Fraser Stoddart. The piece emphasizes that this ranking focuses on recognition within the chemistry community rather than public fame, acknowledging that most distinguished chemists remain unknown to the general public.

## 2. HISTORY

The chemists mentioned in this 2013 article were already established leaders in their fields, and several went on to receive additional recognition:

**Nobel Prize Developments:**
- Three of the chemists mentioned—Sharpless, Grubbs, and Stoddart—would go on to win Nobel Prizes after this article was published (though all were already Nobel laureates by 2013 except Stoddart, who won in 2016 for molecular machines).

**Continued Influence:**
- The listed chemists maintained their influential positions in chemistry research and education throughout the 2010s
- Their foundational contributions (organometallic chemistry, click chemistry, molecular machines, bioinorganic chemistry) remained central to chemical research
- Many continued to publish significant work and mentor the next generation of chemists

**Status:** This was essentially a snapshot of established chemistry leadership rather than a prediction of emerging trends, with figures who had already achieved major recognition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article's Position:** The article did not make explicit predictions about future developments in chemistry or about these chemists' future trajectories.

**Evaluation:** Since no predictions were offered, there's nothing to compare against subsequent developments. The piece was retrospective rather than forward-looking.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

This article has limited long-term importance as it primarily captures a moment-in-time opinion poll about chemistry reputation within an insular community discussion, with minimal broader scientific or societal implications.
