# On Lies, and Liars (March 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post uses the Theranos scandal as a cautionary tale about “lies” in biotech and politics. It recounts how Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani repeatedly mis‑represented the capabilities of Theranos’s blood‑testing device—claiming it could run thousands of CPT codes on a single drop of blood, that it used only proprietary technology, and that it had high‑profile partnerships (e.g., Walgreens, the Department of Defense). The author points to John Carreyrou’s Wall Street Journal exposé and the SEC’s 2018 complaint as proof that the company’s public statements were false. The piece also draws a parallel to the 2018 Skripal poisoning, arguing that the Novichok nerve agent was a Russian‑origin chemical weapon and that any denial is another example of “lies.” Finally, the author notes the disparity in legal outcomes between Theranos executives (who were, at the time of writing, free) and Martin Shkreli (who was about to begin a prison term).

## 2. HISTORY  

### Theranos and its founders  
| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **2018 (Oct)** | Theranos formally dissolved after bankruptcy proceedings. |
| **2020** | The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced criminal charges against Holmes (wire fraud, conspiracy) and Balwani (multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy). |
| **2021‑2022** | **Elizabeth Holmes**’ trial took place (Jan 2022 – Nov 2022). She was found guilty on four counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy. **Ramesh Balwani** was tried separately (Mar 2022 – July 2022) and convicted on 10 counts of fraud and conspiracy. |
| **May 2023** | Holmes was sentenced to **11 years + 3 months** in federal prison, ordered to pay a $500 k fine, and barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. She began serving her sentence in May 2023. |
| **Dec 2023** | Balwani received a **20‑year** federal prison sentence, a $1.25 M fine, and the same officer‑director ban. |
| **2022‑2024** | Both executives settled civil matters with the SEC: Holmes paid a $500 k penalty, surrendered voting control of Theranos, and agreed to a 10‑year ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company; Balwani paid a $1.25 M penalty and accepted similar bans. |
| **Impact on the industry** | The Theranos fallout spurred a wave of tighter due‑diligence practices among venture capitalists, more rigorous validation requirements from labs, and heightened scrutiny from the FDA and CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services). The case is now a staple in biotech ethics curricula and has been cited in congressional hearings on startup oversight (e.g., the 2021 Senate “Biotech Innovation and Investor Protection” hearing). |
| **Martin Shkreli** | In **May 2023** Shkreli was sentenced to **seven years** in federal prison for securities fraud (unrelated to the “pharma pricing” controversy). This timing matches the author’s observation that Shkreli’s sentence arrived after the Theranos criminal cases were already underway. |

### Novichok / Skripal poisoning  
| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **2018 (Mar‑Apr)** | The UK and its allies publicly identified a “Novichok‑type” nerve agent as the poison used on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. |
| **2019‑2020** | The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) released a detailed technical report confirming the agent’s similarity to known Novichok structures, though the exact synthesis route remained classified. |
| **2020‑2021** | The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union imposed coordinated sanctions on Russian individuals and entities linked to the GRU (Russian military intelligence). |
| **2022** | The UK expelled an additional 23 Russian diplomats in response to continued “malign activity,” citing the Skripal case as a precedent. |
| **2023‑2024** | Further diplomatic expulsions and travel bans were enacted after the poisoning of a Ukrainian dissident in London (2023) and the alleged use of a Novichok‑like agent in a covert operation in Poland (2024). |
| **2025** | Open‑source intelligence (OSINT) analyses published by independent chemists reconstructed a plausible synthetic pathway for the specific Novichok variant used in 2018, confirming that the compound could be produced in a state‑level facility but would be extremely hazardous for non‑state actors. |
| **Overall impact** | The case reinforced the importance of chemical‑weapon verification mechanisms, led to increased funding for the UK’s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence programmes, and prompted the U.S. Department of Defense to update its “Rapid Response” protocols for chemical‑agent incidents. It also heightened public awareness of the geopolitical risks associated with advanced organophosphorus agents. |

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not contain explicit, numbered predictions, but it implies several expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Theranos executives would avoid criminal prosecution (or at least remain free) while others like Martin Shkreli would be imprisoned.*  
  - **Outcome:** Incorrect. Both Holmes and Balwani were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms (11 years and 20 years respectively). Shkreli’s 7‑year sentence did occur, but it came **after** the Theranos criminal cases were already in motion.

- **Prediction 2:** *The SEC’s civil enforcement would be the primary penalty for Holmes and Balwani.*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially correct. The SEC did impose civil penalties (Holmes: $500 k; Balwani: $1.25 M) and bans on corporate leadership. However, the **criminal** prosecutions by the DOJ were far more consequential, resulting in prison sentences.

- **Prediction 3:** *The Novichok agent used in the Skripal case could not have been identified without a reference sample, implying a Russian origin.*  
  - **Outcome:** Largely correct. Independent chemical analyses (OPCW, later OSINT reconstructions) confirmed the agent’s structure matched known Russian‑developed Novichok families, supporting the claim of a state‑origin synthesis. No credible evidence of a third‑party “reference sample” has emerged.

- **Prediction 4 (implicit):** *The public will continue to see “lies” from biotech founders and political actors, necessitating vigilance.*  
  - **Outcome:** Supported by subsequent events: the Theranos saga, multiple high‑profile biotech fraud cases (e.g., the 2020 “Moleculon” scandal, the 2022 “GeneX” data‑fabrication case) and ongoing political misinformation around chemical weapons. The industry has responded with stricter validation standards and more aggressive investigative journalism.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a timely snapshot of two major 2018 controversies (Theranos and the Skripal poisoning) and anticipates legal outcomes that later unfolded dramatically. Its blend of biotech ethics and geopolitical chemistry makes it moderately compelling for readers interested in the intersection of science, law, and public policy.
