# The State of Biohacking (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines the "biohacking" community—citizen scientists and DIY biologists working outside traditional academic and industrial labs—and identifies significant gaps between their ambitions and mainstream biotechnology. It highlights fundamental challenges facing biohackers: financial constraints, lack of experimental expertise and design skills, inadequate equipment, and what the author calls the "Andy Grove fallacy"—the mistaken belief that biology can be manipulated as predictably as computer code. The piece cites specific examples like attempts to develop "night-vision eyedrops" and notes that major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer view any investment in community biohacker labs as philanthropy rather than serious business opportunities. The author references his own 2010 coverage of "garage biotech" and notes that in the intervening six years, little of practical significance had emerged from these efforts, though he acknowledges that increasingly powerful tools could eventually enable meaningful breakthroughs from shoestring operations.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article, the biohacking/DIY biology movement continued growing but largely confirmed the author's skepticism about near-term commercial or therapeutic breakthroughs:

**Community Growth**: DIY bio community labs expanded globally, with organizations like Genspace (New York), BioCurious (Silicon Valley), and similar spaces in Europe and Asia providing legal, safer alternatives to underground biohacking. These spaces focused primarily on education, outreach, and democratizing access to biotechnology tools.

**Regulatory Enforcement**: High-profile incidents brought increased scrutiny to unregulated biohacking. Most notably, the 2017 case of Josiah Zayner—a prominent biohacker who self-injected CRISPR—prompted FDA warnings and calls for regulation of self-experimentation and DIY gene therapies.

**Commercial Failures & Shifts**: No major pharmaceutical or therapeutic products emerged from DIY bio labs between 2016-2024. Instead, the movement's successes tended toward educational initiatives, low-cost diagnostic tools, and bio-art projects rather than medical breakthroughs. Several biohacker attempts at creating "garage biotech" companies either failed or pivoted to less ambitious goals.

**Convergence with Traditional Biotech**: Rather than replacing traditional biotech, biohacking found niches as an entry pathway for citizen scientists into professional careers, and some established biotech companies began offering community lab access for educational purposes—validating the "philanthropy" assessment. Meanwhile, established biotech companies made real therapeutic advances through traditional R&D channels: 51 new drugs were FDA-approved in 2020 alone (compared to zero DIY bio-originated approvals). The substantial progress seen in areas like CAR-T cell therapies, CRISPR-based treatments, and mRNA vaccines all emerged from institutional research, not garage labs.

**Skill Barrier Persistence**: The expertise gap identified in the article remained significant. While more citizen scientists gained basic laboratory skills, the complexity required for drug development, proper experimental design, and regulatory compliance continued to far exceed what most DIY practitioners could achieve with limited resources.

**Synthetic Biology's Parallel Track**: Commercial synthetic biology companies like Ginkgo Bioworks (founded 2009) and Zymergen (founded 2013) achieved multi-billion dollar valuations—but these were well-funded, professional operations far removed from garage biohacking. These companies demonstrated that biological engineering could become scalable and systematic, but required substantial institutional resources rather than DIY approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: *"The odds of something actionable coming out of this stuff any time soon are small (although not zero)."*
- **Outcome**: Confirmed. Through 2024, no clinically approved drugs, FDA-cleared therapies, or commercially successful pharmaceutical products emerged from the DIY biohacking community.

**Prediction**: *"The tools available to 'garage biotech' outfits are getting more powerful all the time, and it's possible that things will get to the point that even shoestring operations can come up with something."*
- **Outcome**: Partially correct directionally but not substantively realized. Tools did become cheaper ($300 PCR machines vs. $30,000+ professional equipment), and the biohacking community demonstrated novel applications of existing technologies. However, "shoestring operations" produced educational outcomes and art projects rather than therapeutically or commercially significant breakthroughs. Professional labs continued to dramatically outpace DIY efforts in meaningful innovation.

**Prediction**: *Pfizer's characterization of community lab investment as "philanthropy, not because they expect to see any exciting deal prospects"*
- **Outcome**: Confirmed by subsequent evidence. No major pharmaceutical company acquired a DIY bio startup or made substantial equity investments in biohacker-originated projects through 2024. Community labs continued to rely on grants, donations, and membership fees rather than commercial partnerships with pharma.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article accurately identified structural barriers that remained relevant throughout the subsequent eight years, though it covered a niche topic with limited direct impact on mainstream biotechnology or medicine.
