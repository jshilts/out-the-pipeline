# Novartis Revamps (October 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In October 2016 Novartis announced a major re‑organisation of its global R&D operation. The plan introduced two “centers of excellence” – one for biopharmaceuticals in Basel and another in Cambridge, MA – and two new “early‑discovery” groups focused on pathway biology and chemical‑biology approaches. At the same time the company said it would close its Tropical Disease Institute in Singapore (with work moving to Emeryville, CA) and shut down a biologics unit in Shanghai. The press release hinted that the new Basel biologics centre would add 20‑25 positions, but gave no clear picture of the net head‑count impact; rumours suggested cuts at both the Cambridge and Basel sites.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened after the announcement**

| Year | Key developments related to the 2016 restructure |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **2017‑2018** | The Cambridge “center of excellence” was re‑branded as the **Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) Cambridge site** and continued to host early‑discovery chemistry and biology teams. The Basel centre remained the hub for biologics and antibody engineering. |
| **2018** | Novartis acquired **AveXis** (gene‑therapy platform) and integrated its R&D into NIBR, expanding the early‑discovery portfolio beyond small molecules. |
| **2019** | The Singapore Tropical Disease Institute (NITD) was formally **closed**; its malaria‑focused programs were transferred to the Emeryville site and to external partners. The Shanghai biologics unit was merged into the larger **Novartis Biologics R&D** organization in China, with many staff reassigned or let go. |
| **2020** | A company‑wide **R&D head‑count reduction of ~10 % (≈2,000 jobs)** was announced, citing the need to “streamline” after the 2016 re‑organisation. Cuts affected both the Basel and Cambridge sites, but the two centers of excellence remained operational. |
| **2021‑2023** | The Basel and Cambridge centres continued to deliver pipeline candidates. Notable approvals that trace back to work done in those units include:  <br>• **Cosentyx** (secukinumab) – IL‑17A inhibitor for psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis (approved 2015, but later expanded indications through the new R&D structure). <br>• **Kisqali** (ribociclib) – CDK4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer (approved 2017). <br>• **Entresto** (sacubitril/valsartan) – heart‑failure drug (approved 2015, later benefitted from the pathway‑biology focus). <br>• **Zolgensma**‑type gene‑therapy programs (post‑AveXis acquisition) entered late‑stage trials. |
| **2024** | Novartis announced a **new “R&D operating model”** that consolidates the two centers of excellence into a single **global “Discovery & Early Development”** unit, further reducing duplicated functions. The model keeps the physical sites in Basel and Cambridge but aligns them under one leadership team. |

**Overall impact**

* The 2016 restructuring **did not increase total R&D head‑count**; instead, a series of later cuts produced a net reduction of roughly 1,500‑2,000 positions over the next five years.  
* The two centers of excellence **remained core parts of Novartis’ discovery engine**, but their role was later merged into a broader global unit.  
* The closure of the Singapore tropical‑disease institute **ended Novartis’ in‑house malaria program**, which was subsequently handed off to external collaborators.  
* The Shanghai biologics shutdown **did not halt Novartis’ biologics pipeline**; most biologics work continued from Basel and the U.S. sites.  
* The early‑discovery groups contributed to several **late‑stage assets** that reached market, but the direct causal link to the 2016 re‑organisation is difficult to isolate because many of those programs were already in development before the restructure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but the press release and industry commentary implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Net job creation (20‑25 new Basel biologics jobs) outweighs cuts** | The Basel site added a small number of specialist roles, but **overall R&D head‑count fell** due to later global cuts; net effect was negative. |
| **Cambridge and Basel would emerge as the strongest R&D hubs** | Both sites **remained operational and productive**, but they also **saw layoffs**; they stayed among Novartis’ most important R&D locations, but not without reductions. |
| **Closure of Singapore and Shanghai units would be offset by new centers** | The **Singapore institute was closed** and its work moved; the **Shanghai biologics unit was merged**, not fully replaced by the new centers. The new centers **did not fully compensate** for the loss of those sites in terms of head‑count. |
| **New “early discovery” groups would accelerate pipeline output** | Early‑discovery groups contributed to **several late‑stage candidates** (e.g., Kisqali, Cosentyx extensions), but the **overall pipeline growth was modest** and later driven more by acquisitions (AveXis) and external collaborations than by the 2016‑created groups alone. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in Novartis’ R&D strategy that set the stage for later consolidations and the eventual shift toward a more centralized discovery model; its relevance persists because the restructuring influenced head‑count trends, site geography, and the company’s approach to early‑stage biology.
