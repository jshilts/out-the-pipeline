# How to Buy, Buy, Buy (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article critiques the cult-like behavior of retail investors in small biopharma stocks. The author highlights several problematic patterns: investors seeking echo chambers on internet message boards where only positive commentary is welcomed, the tendency to attribute stock price declines to coordinated short attacks rather than fundamental issues, and the dangerous reflex to "buy the dip" without proper due diligence. The piece uses satirical framing to warn how unrealistic expectations and confirmation bias lead investors to ignore risks, ultimately getting "blown up" by their favorite stocks when reality fails to match the hype.

## 2. HISTORY

The behavioral patterns described in this 2014 article proved remarkably prescient and durable. Between 2014-2021, the biotech sector experienced a dramatic boom-bust cycle: 

**2014-2015**: The biotech bubble peaked, with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index rising over 300% from 2011-2015, fueled by retail investor enthusiasm, low interest rates, and excitement over breakthrough therapies like immunotherapies and gene therapies.

**2016-2019**: Contraction phase. The biotech index declined significantly, and many small-cap biotechs faced clinical trial failures, regulatory setbacks, and financing challenges.

**2020-2021**: COVID-19 drove an unprecedented biotech surge. Vaccine and therapeutic developers saw massive retail investor interest, with message boards (particularly Reddit's r/wallstreetbets) amplifying hype around companies like Moderna, Novavax, and various pre-revenue biotechs.

**2022-2024**: Sharp correction. Rising interest rates, clinical trial disappointments, and regulatory scrutiny led to widespread biotech stock declines of 30-80%. Companies with no approved products faced financing crises, illustrating the exact "blown up" scenario the author described.

**Specific examples**: Companies like Moderna soared from $20 (2020) to $449 (2021) then fell to ~$80-$120 range (2024); Novavax saw similar volatility; numerous gene therapy and rare disease companies experienced both dramatic rises and devastating crashes based on single clinical trial results. The retail investor dynamics described in 2014 remained fully intact throughout this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained implicit rather than explicit predictions:

• **Continued cult-like investor behavior**: ✓**Accurate**. The gamification of trading (Robinhood, social media investing) amplified the exact behaviors described. Reddit's WallStreetBets became the modern equivalent of the "Internet message boards" mentioned, with coordinated buying campaigns and hostility toward critical analysis.

• **Investors getting "blown up" by favorite stocks**: ✓**Accurate**. The 2022-2024 biotech crash saw numerous companies lose 80%+ of their value, with retail investors experiencing massive losses. Most biotechs never achieve profitability, and even promising clinical data often doesn't translate to commercial success or sustainable stock valuations.

• **Attribution of losses to shorts rather than fundamentals**: ✓**Accurate**. The "short attack" narrative persisted strongly through the meme stock phenomenon, with retail investors often blaming market manipulation rather than addressing companies' underlying financial or clinical weaknesses.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article has moderate-to-high interest because it identified durable behavioral finance patterns that proved relevant across multiple market cycles, though it lacked specific analytical depth beyond observation of investor psychology.
