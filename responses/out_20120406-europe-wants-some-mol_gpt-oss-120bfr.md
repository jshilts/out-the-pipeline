# Europe Wants Some of That Molecular Library Action (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports that, after a decade of the U.S. NIH Molecular Libraries Initiative (MLI), Europe is moving to create its own high‑throughput screening (HTS) capability.  The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)—a €2 billion public‑private partnership between the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA)—has issued a call for proposals to build a “molecular screening facility” that would bring together academic curiosity and industry expertise.  

The author welcomes the idea of “screening is good” but warns that success depends on the quality of the compound collection and the robustness of the assays.  He is skeptical of the claim that pharma companies only test a small fraction of disease targets, noting that many “hard” targets (protein‑protein, protein‑nucleic‑acid interactions) have extremely low hit rates and generate many false positives.  The piece also questions the commercial expectations attached to the effort, pointing out that many of the targets likely to be screened are poorly validated.  As a concrete example, the author mentions protein‑tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) as a well‑studied but still chemically intractable target, and asks for better, selective inhibitors.

## 2. HISTORY  

### European Lead Factory (ELF) and IMI‑supported screening infrastructure  
- **2013‑2020:** The IMI’s first large‑scale screening project, the **European Lead Factory**, was launched in 2013 and operated until 2020.  It combined a 300 k‑compound “joint” library (≈150 k commercial, ≈150 k “ELF” compounds designed in‑house) with a central HTS centre at the **European Screening Centre** (now part of the **EU‑OPENSCREEN** network).  
- **Outputs:** Over 3 000 confirmed hits were delivered to partner companies and academic groups; ~150 of these progressed to lead optimisation, and ~20 entered pre‑clinical development.  Notable outcomes include:  
  * a novel anti‑infective series against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* that entered IND‑enabling studies (later licensed to a biotech).  
  * several chemical probes for epigenetic targets (e.g., BET bromodomains) that have been widely distributed through the **Chemical Probes Portal**.  
- **Commercial impact:** No ELF‑derived molecule has yet reached market approval, but the platform has generated a pipeline of candidates that are still in early‑stage development.  The main lasting value has been the creation of a shared compound library, standardised HTS workflows, and a network of >200 academic‑industry collaborations.  

### NIH Molecular Libraries Program (MLP)  
- **2014‑2015:** The NIH’s original MLI was wound down; the **Molecular Libraries Program** was folded into the **National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)**.  The high‑throughput screening network (MLSCN) was replaced by the **NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC)**, which continues to run a smaller, more focused screening operation and maintains the **PubChem** database of public assay data.  
- **Legacy:** The open‑access data generated by the original MLI (≈ 1 000 + assays, > 100 million compound‑target interactions) remain a valuable resource for target validation and chemogenomics, but the large‑scale “library‑centric” model has largely been superseded by disease‑focused consortia and by commercial “open‑innovation” platforms such as the ELF.  

### Target‑validation and PTP1B  
- **PTP1B inhibitors:** Since 2012, several academic groups (including those funded by IMI projects) have reported more drug‑like PTP1B inhibitors, but none have progressed beyond pre‑clinical proof‑of‑concept.  The target remains “high‑risk/high‑reward”; the lack of a clinically approved PTP1B drug reflects the same challenges highlighted in the article—low hit rates, selectivity issues, and uncertain therapeutic benefit.  

### Policy and ecosystem effects  
- The IMI model demonstrated that **public‑private pooling of compound libraries** can be sustained for a decade, influencing later EU initiatives such as **Open Targets** (2014) and **EU‑OPENSCREEN** (2014‑present).  
- In the U.S., the NIH shifted toward **target‑centric** funding (e.g., the **Accelerating Medicines Partnership**) rather than broad HTS libraries, reflecting the mixed outcomes of the original MLI.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2012 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **A European HTS facility will be built that bridges academia and industry.** | The **European Lead Factory** (2013‑2020) and the ongoing **EU‑OPENSCREEN** network realized this vision, providing a shared screening centre and a joint compound library. |
| **Pooling chemical libraries will uncover valuable drug candidates.** | The pooled library generated many **chemical probes** and a handful of **pre‑clinical candidates**, but no blockbuster drugs have yet emerged. The expectation of rapid, high‑value drug hits proved optimistic. |
| **Screening “hard” targets (PPIs, nucleic‑acid interactions) will yield hits despite low hit rates.** | Some early‑stage hits against challenging targets (e.g., protein‑protein interaction modulators for KRAS‑SOS) have been reported, but most remain at the probe stage; the low‑hit‑rate problem persists. |
| **PTP1B will see a breakthrough inhibitor from the new European effort.** | Improved PTP1B inhibitors have been published, but none have entered clinical trials; the target remains chemically difficult. |
| **Commercial milestones and cash rewards will be negotiated for successful hits.** | The ELF contracts included **milestone‑based licensing** for partners; a few compounds have entered IND‑enabling work with royalty agreements, but the overall financial return to the public side has been modest. |

Overall, the article’s optimism about rapid drug‑candidate generation was **partially fulfilled** (in terms of tools and early leads) but **overstated** regarding near‑term market impact.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment when Europe attempted to replicate the NIH’s open‑screening model, and its discussion of the practical limits of HTS remains highly relevant to current open‑innovation strategies.  It is not a landmark scientific discovery, but it offers valuable insight into policy and infrastructure evolution.
