# Another Recipe: Cornbread (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a recipe article for cornbread adapted from Cook's Illustrated, published on Derek Lowe's science blog. The author describes making traditional Southern-style cornbread using an all-cornmeal recipe (no wheat flour) baked in a hot cast-iron skillet. The recipe calls for basic ingredients: cornmeal, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, boiling water, buttermilk, and egg, with bacon grease preferred for greasing the pan. The key technique emphasized is preheating the pan with oil in a 450°F oven before adding the batter, which creates a thin brown crust. The author contrasts this with "Northern corn muffins" which they describe as sweet corn-colored cake. Various suggested additions include creamed corn, whole-kernel corn, jalapeños, diced red onion, shredded cheese, crumbled bacon, or pork cracklings.

## 2. HISTORY

This is a cooking recipe, not a biotechnology article, so there are no subsequent biotech developments, FDA approvals, clinical trials, or policy changes to analyze. The recipe represents traditional Southern cooking methods that have existed for decades, not scientific or medical research. There are no biotechnology companies, drugs, therapies, or scientific innovations discussed in this article that would warrant tracking of industrial or clinical outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about future scientific developments, biotech industry trends, or clinical outcomes. It is exclusively focused on sharing a cooking recipe with personal commentary about regional food variations.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 0/10**

This article appears to be misclassified as it is a cooking recipe with no connection to the biotechnology industry. It is completely off-topic for the requested analysis framework of biotech industry commentary.
