# Back For More, 2019 Edition (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on late 2018's sudden downturn in biopharma stock markets after a prolonged bull run, while noting that 2018 still set IPO records for the sector. The author mentions getting out of the market entirely in early June 2018 due to economic and political uncertainties, despite this looking questionable for several months before the late-year drop seemed to validate the cautious stance. On the positive side, 2018 saw a record number of FDA drug approvals, building on 2017's strong performance, with genuine innovation including first-time drug developers and novel therapeutic approaches entering the market. The author expresses optimism about scientific progress in drug discovery—new mechanisms of action and research tools—while acknowledging not everything will succeed. The piece closes looking toward 2019 as likely eventful scientifically, economically, and politically, rather than quiet.

## 2. HISTORY

**Market Developments**: The biotech sector did indeed experience significant volatility in late 2018 and into 2019. The XBI biotech ETF declined sharply in Q4 2018 but then staged a substantial recovery during 2019-2021. The sector faced another downturn in 2022 as broader market conditions deteriorated and biotech valuations contracted, reflecting the boom-bust cycle mentioned in the article.

**FDA Approvals**: The trend of high FDA approvals continued beyond 2018. 2019 maintained strong approval numbers (around 48 novel drugs), and subsequent years also remained robust, validating the article's observation about sustained innovation and regulatory throughput. This period saw continued emergence of new companies and therapeutic modalities reaching market approval.

**Scientific Progress**: The 2019-2024 period did see significant scientific advances mentioned in the article. Gene therapies, cell therapies, and RNA-based therapeutics all experienced notable clinical and commercial developments. Crispr-based treatments progressed, and new modalities like mRNA vaccines achieved historic success during the COVID-19 pandemic (though this was not foreseeable in January 2019).

**Industry Investment**: Biotech IPOs remained active in 2019, though the market showed more volatility than the preceding years. The broader uncertainty the author mentioned did persist through 2019-2020 with trade tensions and political changes, followed by the unexpected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in early 2020.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"2019 is not going to be a quiet year. Not scientifically, not economically, not politically"**
  - **Outcome**: This was largely accurate. Scientifically, 2019 saw continued drug approvals and clinical progress across multiple areas. Economically, markets remained volatile. Politically, trade tensions and other uncertainties continued. However, the author had no way of anticipating that 2020 would bring the unprecedented disruption of COVID-19.
  
• **"[N]ot all of this stuff is going to work out, but enough of it will to keep a lot of people very busy indeed"**
  - **Outcome**: This proved prescient. The period 2019-2024 saw both notable clinical failures and significant successes across the industry. Many companies and therapeutic approaches succeeded, while others failed, maintaining the high-activity environment the author described.
  
• **Implicit prediction about market uncertainty persisting**
  - **Outcome**: Uncertainties the author cited (economic and political) did continue, though the nature and source of some major disruptions (pandemic, inflation, geopolitical changes) were different than what might have been anticipated in January 2019.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

The article represents a standard year-start reflection primarily about market timing and regulatory trends, with reasonable but not remarkable insights about broader uncertainty facing the sector—neither highly insightful about specific science nor prescient about coming disruptions.
