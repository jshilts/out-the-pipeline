# Isotopes, Get Your Revivifying Isotopes (Oct 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary warned that a small Florida firm, **Vector Vitale**, was marketing “health‑boosting” potassium‑39 and zinc‑64 supplements on the premise that natural isotopic ratios shift with age and disease. The author reminded readers that isotopic fractionation is a well‑studied phenomenon (e.g., deuterium kinetic isotope effects, carbon‑13 tracing of testosterone, zinc‑64/‑66 organ‑specific signatures) and that the claim “isotopic selectivity has never been studied in biology” is plainly false. The piece concluded that any therapeutic benefit from altering the relative abundances of heavy isotopes such as ⁴⁰K or ⁶⁴Zn is highly unlikely without a breakthrough that has not been demonstrated.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Deuterium‑based drugs  
* **FDA approvals** – The first deuterated small‑molecule drug to reach the market was **deutetrabenazine (Austedo)**, approved in 2017 for Huntington’s disease chorea. Its deuterium atoms slow CYP‑mediated oxidation, giving a longer half‑life and reduced dosing frequency. A generic version (deutetrabenazine) entered the market in 2022.  
* **Pipeline** – Since 2016, several companies (e.g., Amide, C4 Therapeutics, Alkermes) have advanced deuterated candidates for psychiatric, oncology, and antiviral indications. As of late 2024, none besides deutetrabenazine have obtained FDA approval, though a handful (e.g., deuterated **sitagliptin**, **pimodivir‑d2**) have completed Phase II trials with mixed results. The overall commercial impact is modest: deuterated drugs account for <0.5 % of new‑molecule approvals in the last eight years.

### Heavy‑element isotopic supplements (K, Zn)  
* **Scientific literature** – Post‑2016 studies continued to document subtle organ‑specific variations in zinc and potassium isotopes, but none linked these variations to causal disease mechanisms. No peer‑reviewed clinical trial has demonstrated that ingesting enriched ⁴⁰K or ⁶⁴Zn alters health outcomes.  
* **Regulatory status** – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not evaluated any potassium‑39 or zinc‑64 dietary supplement for safety or efficacy. The products marketed by Vector Vitale (or any successor) remain classified as “dietary supplements” and are not subject to the pre‑market approval required for drugs. No adverse‑event reports or efficacy claims have been substantiated in the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) database.  
* **Commercial fate** – The Vector Vitale website went offline in early 2020; the company’s Florida business registration lapsed in 2021. No peer‑reviewed publications, clinical trial registrations, or FDA filings trace back to the firm after 2016, indicating that the venture did not progress beyond early marketing hype.

### Broader impact on the field  
* **Isotope tracing** – The article’s discussion of carbon‑13, deuterium, and zinc isotopes correctly anticipated continued growth of stable‑isotope tracing in metabolomics and nutrition research. From 2016 to 2024, large‑scale human‑subject studies (e.g., the NIH Metabolomics Consortium) have employed ^13C‑labeled substrates to map metabolic fluxes, but these remain research tools, not therapeutic interventions.  
* **Public perception** – The piece helped expose a class of “wellness” claims that misuse isotope science. Consumer‑protection groups (e.g., the FTC) issued warnings in 2018–2019 about “isotope‑balance” supplements, citing the lack of evidence and potential for misleading advertising.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Isotopic enrichment (e.g., ⁴⁰K, ⁶⁴Zn) could be used to “balance” health and treat disease.” | No credible evidence emerged; no clinical trials, no FDA‑approved products, and the company promoting such supplements disappeared. |
| **Deuterium substitution would become a mainstream strategy for improving drug pharmacokinetics.** | Partially true: deuterium substitution is now an accepted medicinal‑chemistry tactic, but only one deuterated drug (deutetrabenazine) has been approved, and the approach remains niche rather than mainstream. |
| **Scientists would discover that isotopic ratios vary with age and disease, opening a diagnostic market.** | While isotopic signatures (e.g., ^13C in breath, ^2H in body water) are used in research and some clinical contexts (e.g., ^13C‑urea breath test for H. pylori), no commercial diagnostic based on heavy‑element (K, Zn) isotopic ratios has been launched. |
| **The public would be flooded with “isotope‑balance” supplements.** | A brief wave of marketing (2016‑2018) occurred, but consumer‑protection actions and lack of data curtailed widespread adoption. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The article is a useful case study of how legitimate isotope science can be misappropriated for wellness hype, but the specific claims have not led to lasting scientific or commercial developments. It is moderately interesting for historians of biotech hype cycles, less so for current biotechnology practice.
