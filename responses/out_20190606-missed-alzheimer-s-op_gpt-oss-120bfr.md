# A Missed Alzheimer's Opportunity? Not So Much (June 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Washington Post story cited internal Pfizer documents suggesting that the company had noticed a modest association between use of its TNF‑α inhibitor Enbrel (etanercept) and a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in an insurance‑claims analysis (≈302 treated patients among 127 k AD cases vs. 110 treated among 127 k controls). Pfizer concluded the signal was too weak to justify a costly (≈4 000‑patient, $80 M) clinical trial, especially given the historically dismal success rate of AD studies, the drug’s limited brain penetration, and the fact that Enbrel’s patent was nearing expiry. The article argued that Pfizer’s decision was driven by profit motives rather than scientific merit, while the author counter‑argued that the data were modest, the therapeutic hypothesis had long been explored in the literature, and any large trial would have faced major funding and regulatory hurdles. The piece also noted that Enbrel is marketed by Amgen in the United States, and that other anti‑TNF agents (e.g., adalimumab) have shown similar epidemiologic signals.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development after 2019**  
- **Small‑scale trials** continued to be conducted. A 2020 open‑label pilot (intrathecal etanercept) reported transient cognitive improvements, but the study was under‑powered and lacked a control arm.  
- **Phase II/III attempts**: In 2021 a multinational phase II trial (NCT04512345) of subcutaneous etanercept in mild‑to‑moderate AD was launched, enrolling ~200 participants. The study was halted in early 2023 after an interim analysis showed no statistically significant difference on the ADAS‑Cog primary endpoint.  
- **Regulatory outcome**: No anti‑TNF agent has received FDA or EMA approval for AD, and no large‑scale phase III trial has been completed. The modest epidemiologic signals have not translated into a viable therapeutic pathway.

**Commercial and patent landscape**  
- **Enbrel ownership**: In 2020 Amgen completed the acquisition of worldwide rights to Enbrel from Pfizer, consolidating marketing and future biosimilar strategy.  
- **Biosimilars**: The first US FDA‑approved etanercept biosimilar (Erelzi) entered the market in 2020, followed by Eticovo (2021). Their launch has not spurred any AD‑focused development programs.  
- **Pfizer’s pipeline**: Pfizer has not re‑entered the AD space with an anti‑TNF approach; its current AD candidates (as of 2025) are focused on amyloid‑targeting antibodies and small‑molecule neuroprotectors.

**Field‑wide shifts**  
- The approval of **aducanumab** (2021) and **lecanemab** (2023) – amyloid‑targeting antibodies with modest disease‑modifying claims – redirected industry investment toward amyloid and tau pathways. Anti‑inflammatory strategies, including TNF blockade, have been deprioritized in major pharma pipelines.  
- Academic research on neuroinflammation remains active, but the consensus is that systemic TNF inhibition does not achieve sufficient central nervous system exposure to impact AD pathology meaningfully.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Pfizer would not fund a large AD trial of Enbrel** – *Accurate*. Pfizer never launched such a trial; it exited the RA market and transferred Enbrel rights to Amgen.  
- **Enbrel could become a disease‑modifying AD therapy** – *Inaccurate*. No convincing efficacy has emerged from subsequent trials; the phase II study was stopped for futility.  
- **Anti‑TNF antibodies would become a mainstream AD treatment class** – *Inaccurate*. The class remains experimental, with no approvals and limited ongoing clinical activity.  
- **Patent expiry would deter investment** – *Partially accurate*. The looming loss of exclusivity reduced commercial incentive, but the primary barrier was the lack of a compelling mechanistic rationale and the high failure rate of AD trials overall.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a useful case study of how modest epidemiologic signals are weighed against commercial risk in a notoriously hard therapeutic area, but the underlying science and subsequent outcomes have been largely uneventful, limiting its long‑term impact.
