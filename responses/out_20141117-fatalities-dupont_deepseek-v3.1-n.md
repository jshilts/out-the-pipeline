# Fatalities at DuPont (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a fatal accident at a DuPont chemical plant in La Porte, Texas (near Houston) where four workers were killed by exposure to methyl mercaptan (methanethiol). The incident involved an initial leak that killed workers, followed by additional fatalities when other employees rushed in to help without adequate protective equipment. The author notes that while methyl mercaptan is toxic, its powerful smell normally provides warning, but in high concentrations near a major leak, almost any gas can be deadly. The article questions whether the deaths could have been prevented and whether proper safety protocols were followed, particularly regarding protective equipment. The author uses the incident as a cautionary reminder for laboratory workers to maintain awareness of safety equipment locations and to plan for potential hazards before conducting experiments.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the November 2014 incident, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) conducted an extensive investigation that revealed systemic safety failures at the DuPont facility. The CSB's 2016 report found that the accident occurred when a drain line became blocked, causing methyl mercaptan to back up and release into the building where workers were present. The investigation determined that 24,000 pounds of methyl mercaptan were released, and critical safety equipment including a critical valve was broken and had been non-functional for weeks prior to the incident.

The CSB identified multiple safety violations and found that DuPont had inadequate safety procedures, insufficient training, and failed to follow their own internal safety standards. Significantly, the investigation revealed this was not an isolated incident but part of a pattern - DuPont had experienced at least eight other methyl mercaptan releases at various facilities between 2006-2014.

In 2015, OSHA cited DuPont for 11 safety violations and proposed a $273,000 fine. The company ultimately settled with OSHA. The incident prompted broader industry reflection on chemical process safety, particularly around highly toxic chemicals like methyl mercaptan. The La Porte facility was eventually sold to Dow Chemical in 2017 as part of the Dow-DuPont merger activities, and later became part of Corteva when that company was spun off.

The wider impact included increased scrutiny of process safety management systems across the chemical industry, though no major federal regulatory changes specifically resulted from this single incident.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain any explicit predictions about future events or outcomes. It focused primarily on reporting the incident and providing safety reminders rather than forecasting future developments in chemical safety or regulation.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

This article represents a tragic but relatively contained industrial accident. While it exposed significant safety failures at a major chemical company, it did not lead to fundamental changes in industry regulation or practice. The incident had important lessons for chemical process safety, but had limited broader societal or technological impact compared to other safety-related articles.
