# Retractions: Why The Secrecy?

## 1. SUMMARY

This January 2011 commentary highlights the lack of transparency when scientific papers are retracted from journals. The author, Derek Lowe, references Ben Goldacre's critique of this opacity, particularly the case where the editor of *Annals of Thoracic Surgery* responded to inquiries about a retraction by saying "it's none of your damn business." 

The article argues that retraction notices should provide specific reasons for why papers are withdrawn, since retractions can range from honest errors to serious misconduct. Lowe contrasts the opaque approach with a counterexample where a *JACS* paper's lead author voluntarily provided detailed explanations to Retraction Watch about what went wrong—information more complete than what the journal itself published. The piece calls for greater transparency in retraction notices and praises the investigative work of Retraction Watch in exposing these issues.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2011 article saw significant changes in how scientific journals and the research community handle retractions and research integrity:

**Retraction Watch Growth and Impact (2011-Present):**
- Retraction Watch, founded in 2010 by Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus, became the primary public database and investigative source for retractions, growing from a small blog to an internationally recognized resource
- In 2018, Retraction Watch launched a comprehensive, searchable database containing over 30,000 retractions—far exceeding previous attempts at centralized tracking
- The site became instrumental in uncovering major research misconduct cases, including the fraudulent COVID-19 papers from Surgisphere (retracted from *The Lancet* and *NEJM* in 2020)

**Increased Transparency in Retraction Notices:**
- Many major journals began adopting more detailed retraction notices following sustained pressure from Retraction Watch and researchers
- Organizations like COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) updated guidelines to encourage clearer retraction categories
- The Center for Scientific Integrity, parent organization of Retraction Watch, influenced policy discussions at major publishers

**Continued Challenges:**
- Despite improvements, many retractions still lack detailed explanations of underlying causes
- A 2023 study found that approximately 60% of retraction notices still provide insufficient detail about misconduct
- The number of retractions continues to rise annually, reaching over 5,000 in 2023

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't explicitly make predictions but revealed clear trends and concerns that bore out:

- **Implicit Prediction: Need for transparency would drive change** ✅ *Accurate*: The emergence of Retraction Watch as a major force and subsequent pressure did lead to improved, though incomplete, transparency in retractions.

- **Implicit Concern: Opacity in retractions harms science** ✅ *Accurate*: Subsequent research confirmed that poorly documented retractions slow scientific progress and can mislead other researchers.

- **Implicit Hope: Journals would become more transparent** ⚠️ *Partially accurate*: While improved, many retractions still lack detailed explanations, indicating incomplete progress.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified a crucial issue just as it was gaining attention, correctly anticipating that retraction transparency would become a significant problem. The discussion only grew more important as retractions increased, and the piece demonstrated clear foresight about systemic issues in scientific publishing.
