# Fun With Priority Review Vouchers (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article explains the mechanism of Priority Review Vouchers (PRVs), a regulatory incentive created by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 to encourage drug development for neglected tropical diseases. The author describes how these vouchers work: when a company gets a drug approved for a neglected disease, they receive a voucher entitling them to a six-month priority review (instead of the standard ten months) for any future drug application. The key feature is that these vouchers are transferable and can be sold on the open market.

The article notes that the program expanded to include rare pediatric diseases in 2012, with differences between the two voucher types eliminated in 2014. The author presents the voucher system as an innovative market-based solution that uses capitalism to address market failure in drug development for neglected diseases. The piece also acknowledges complications, particularly the challenge of determining which diseases qualify for voucher eligibility and how many incentives each disease should receive. The article mentions the case of Sanofi/Regeneron using a voucher to beat Amgen to market in the PCSK9 inhibitor space, and references a controversial attempt by Martin Shkreli's KaloBios to obtain a voucher for a Chagas disease drug.

## 2. HISTORY
After the article's publication in December 2015, the PRV program continued operating with several significant developments. The vouchers maintained their high market value, with sales continuing into the hundreds of millions of dollars range, though prices fluctuated based on market conditions and FDA policy changes.

In 2016, Congress reauthorized the rare pediatric disease PRV program through 2020, and again extended it multiple times, ultimately making it permanent in 2020. The program has faced criticism for potentially incentivizing companies to seek vouchers for diseases with existing treatments or for drugs that provide minimal innovation. Several reports emerged showing that some companies obtained vouchers without necessarily bringing transformative new treatments to patients.

The FDA continued to face challenges in determining disease eligibility criteria. Between 2015 and 2020, numerous pharmaceutical companies obtained and sold PRVs, with the secondary market remaining active. The voucher program also expanded internationally, with other countries considering similar mechanisms.

In terms of concrete market impact, the vouchers remained a significant consideration in corporate strategy, particularly for timing drug launches in competitive markets. However, evidence also emerged that some companies were gaming the system, seeking vouchers for drugs that offered limited clinical advancement or for rare diseases that weren't truly neglected. This led to ongoing debates about reforming the program's criteria and ensuring it truly incentivizes innovation for genuinely underserved patient populations.

The Chagas disease case mentioned in the article, involving Martin Shkreli and KaloBios, ultimately did not result in KaloBios obtaining the voucher as the company went bankrupt in 2015 amid the broader Shkreli controversy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Voucher values would continue to climb**: The article noted that voucher prices had been "doing nothing but climb." This was directionally correct in the near term after 2015, though prices became more volatile and plateaued at times rather than continuously rising.

• **The voucher system would be an effective incentive for neglected disease R&D**: Subsequent developments were mixed. While some genuinely new treatments emerged from the incentive, evidence also showed companies pursuing vouchers for marginal innovations or existing drugs.

• **The market mechanism would prove efficient**: The market for voucher trading did remain active and functional, demonstrating that the transferability feature worked as intended.

• **Companies would continue paying substantial amounts for quicker drug approval**: This prediction held true; major pharmaceutical companies did continue purchasing vouchers for hundreds of millions when launching drugs in competitive markets.

• **The question of which diseases should qualify would remain a challenge**: This prediction proved accurate, as the FDA and Congress continued grappling with disease eligibility criteria and program modifications for years after 2015.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

The article explores an important but niche regulatory mechanism that illustrates broader themes about market-based approaches to healthcare policy. While the topic is specialized, the underlying principle of using market incentives to solve public health problems has broader relevance beyond just PRVs, making it moderately interesting for understanding innovative policy design despite its narrow focus.
