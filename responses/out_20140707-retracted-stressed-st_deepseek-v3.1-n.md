# That Retracted Stressed Stem Cell Work (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary by Derek Lowe analyzes a Nature News article by David Cyranoski about the "STAP" (Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency) stem cell research scandal. The STAP papers, published in Nature by Haruko Obokata and colleagues, claimed that mature cells could be converted into pluripotent stem cells simply by exposing them to stress like acid or physical pressure, representing what appeared to be a revolutionary breakthrough in regenerative medicine.

The article examines the subsequent investigation revealing extensive misconduct, including manipulated and duplicated images. Obokata was found to have spliced together gel lanes from different experiments, used the same teratoma image in multiple contexts with different captions, and committed other image manipulation. The committee determined these actions constituted research misconduct. The commentary discusses whether journal editors could have caught these problems during peer review, noting that Nature conducted only random spot-checks of images due to resource limitations, and these particular papers were not checked. The piece also explores the broader challenges of image manipulation in scientific publishing and the evolutionary "arms race" aspect of detecting increasingly sophisticated manipulations.

## 2. HISTORY

The STAP stem cell saga unfolded as a major scientific scandal that had lasting impacts:

**Immediate Aftermath (2014):**
- Both Nature papers were fully retracted in July 2014 after the RIKEN investigation concluded the research was fundamentally flawed
- Haruko Obokata was found guilty of research misconduct by the RIKEN investigation committee
- Senior co-author Yoshiki Sasai, deputy director of RIKEN, died by suicide in August 2014
- Teruhiko Wakayama, another co-author, was cleared of misconduct but criticized for poor supervision

**Institutional and Scientific Impact:**
- No STAP cells were ever successfully reproduced by independent labs worldwide
- The STAP cell phenomenon was ultimately determined to be non-existent, likely resulting from contamination with existing embryonic stem cell lines
- RIKEN underwent major institutional reforms in response to the scandal
- Obokata's PhD degree was later revoked by Waseda University in 2015 for plagiarism

**Policy and Publishing Changes:**
- Scientific journals, including Nature and others, enhanced their image manipulation detection practices
- Many journals implemented more systematic screening for image duplication and manipulation
- The scandal influenced global discussions about research integrity and the need for better verification systems
- Japan's science funding and oversight systems faced scrutiny

**Long-term Scientific Impact:**
- The field of cellular reprogramming continued to advance through established methods like iPS cells, but STAP cells had no lasting scientific influence
- Limited new research avenues in stress-induced pluripotency emerged – the approach proved fundamentally unsound
- No therapies or clinical applications resulted from STAP research (given it was fraudulent)

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article and commentary made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Prediction about publishing practices**: Will journals increase image checking?  
**Outcome**: ✅ **Accurate** - Many journals, including Nature family journals, did enhance their image manipulation screening. Systematic checks became more common in the post-STAP era.

• **Prediction about scientific caution**: "Neither of those [eagerness to publish groundbreaking results and eagerness to publish them] are going to change any time soon"  
**Outcome**: ✅ **Accurate** - Scientific publishing continues to face similar pressures. High-profile retractions continue to occur, though the STAP case remains among the most dramatic.

• **Prediction about verification**: Implicit suggestion that upfront admission of figure modifications might become standard  
**Outcome**: ⚠️ **Mixed** - Some improvements occurred in transparency (more journals require original images in supplementary), but major scandals still recur.

• **Prediction about broader implications**: Would this fundamentally change how scientists approach verification?  
**Outcome**: ⚠️ **Partial** - The case enhanced awareness of research integrity issues, but similar problems recur (e.g., other stem cell retractions, CRISPR baby controversy).

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article represents a landmark case study in research integrity and its aftermath, with enduring relevance for understanding institutional failures and improving scientific oversight mechanisms.
