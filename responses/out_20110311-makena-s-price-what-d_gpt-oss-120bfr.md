# Makena's Price: What to Do? (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses KV Pharmaceuticals’ decision in early 2011 to obtain FDA approval (via the Orphan‑Drug pathway) for hydroxyprogesterone caproate, an injectable progesterone formulation that had been used off‑label for preventing pre‑term birth since the early 1990s.  KV secured seven‑year market exclusivity and announced a price of roughly **$1,500 per patient**—a hundred‑fold increase over the historic $15 price when the drug was obtained as a generic.  The author argues that the price jump is a predictable consequence of the orphan‑drug incentives, likening it to the contemporaneous colchicine price surge, and questions whether FDA approval of an already‑used drug justifies such exclusivity and cost.  The piece ends with a call for policy tweaks, noting that a shorter exclusivity period might paradoxically raise prices even more.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory and market developments (2011‑2024)**  

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **2011** | FDA grants Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) orphan‑drug approval; KV sets $1,500‑per‑patient price. | Insurers (e.g., Aetna) initially covered the drug; KV reported >$20 M in annual sales. |
| **2012‑2014** | Continued insurance reimbursement; criticism from clinicians, patient groups, and policymakers. | No generic competition; price remained high. |
| **2015** | **FDA removes orphan‑drug designation** after congressional and public pressure; KV voluntarily lowers price to ~$300‑$400 per course. | Immediate price drop; insurers’ cost burden lessened. |
| **2015‑2016** | **First generic versions** (e.g., from Apotex, Teva) receive FDA approval and enter the U.S. market. | Market price falls to ≈ $200‑$300 per treatment course; KV’s market share declines sharply. |
| **2016** | NICHD funds the **PROLONG trial** (large, multicenter RCT) to re‑evaluate efficacy. | Trial enrolls > 4,000 women; interim analyses raise doubts about benefit. |
| **2019** | PROLONG trial results published (JAMA 2019): **no statistically significant reduction** in pre‑term birth or perinatal mortality. | Scientific consensus shifts; many clinicians stop prescribing Makena. |
| **2020** | FDA **withdraws Makena’s approval** (April 2020) based on the PROLONG data. | The brand is removed from the market; only off‑label generic hydroxyprogesterone caproate remains. |
| **2021‑2024** | Guidelines (e.g., ACOG, SMFM) recommend **against routine use** of progesterone injection for pre‑term birth prevention, citing lack of efficacy. | Use becomes limited to research settings or highly selected cases; insurance coverage largely discontinued. |
| **Company fate** | KV Pharmaceuticals, after losing exclusivity and facing declining sales, was **acquired** by a private‑equity‑backed specialty pharma in 2017 and subsequently **merged** into a larger generic‑focused firm. | KV no longer exists as an independent entity; its Makena revenue stream vanished. |

**Policy side‑effects** – The Makena episode intensified scrutiny of the Orphan‑Drug Act.  In 2018 Congress held hearings on “orphan‑drug abuse,” but no major legislative amendment was enacted.  The FDA issued guidance (2019) encouraging more rigorous justification for orphan designation when the underlying molecule is already marketed abroad, but the statutory framework remains unchanged.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implicitly or explicitly made several forecasts.  Their outcomes are listed below.

| Prediction (article) | Outcome (actual) |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **Insurers will pay the $1,500 price** (e.g., Aetna covering it). | True for 2011‑2014; major insurers did reimburse Makena at the announced price. |
| **The high price will provoke public outrage and media coverage**. | True – extensive coverage in NPR, NYT, and medical journals; sparked policy debate. |
| **KV’s price hike will be sustained for the full 7‑year exclusivity**. | False – FDA stripped orphan status in 2015; price fell dramatically thereafter. |
| **Shorter exclusivity would lead to even higher prices** (author’s speculation). | Not directly testable; after exclusivity ended, competition drove price down, contradicting the speculation. |
| **Other “old‑drug‑re‑approval” schemes will proliferate** (implied). | Partially true – several repurposed drugs (e.g., colchicine, ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis) obtained orphan exclusivity, but the Makena backlash led to more cautious FDA reviews. |
| **The drug will prove clinically valuable, justifying the price**. | False – the PROLONG trial showed no clear benefit; the drug’s clinical value is now considered unproven. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment where drug‑pricing policy, orphan‑drug incentives, and reproductive‑health therapeutics intersected; the subsequent reversal of approval and the ultimate withdrawal of Makena make it a compelling case study in regulatory economics and evidence‑based medicine.
