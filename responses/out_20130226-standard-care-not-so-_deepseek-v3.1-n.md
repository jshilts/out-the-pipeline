# Standard of Care? Not So Fast, Not in the United Kingdom (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary highlights a seemingly counterintuitive UK patent rule that categorized using a competitor’s drug as a comparison in a clinical trial as an act of patent infringement. The author expresses surprise at this regulation, noting that it was far stricter than rules in most other countries. The article states that the UK government recognized this legal barrier was harming the country's ability to attract and retain clinical research and was, therefore, moving to "scrap" or reform these specific patent laws. The goal of the proposed change was explicitly to make the UK a more competitive location for drug trials.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the article's publication, the UK government did indeed reform its patent laws to address this issue. The key change was enacted through **Section 70A and Schedule 4 of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013**, which amended the UK Patents Act 1977.

The new law provides a clear, statutory defense against patent infringement for activities related to conducting studies, tests, and trials that are necessary to obtain regulatory approval for a medicinal product. This defense, often called the **"Bolar" provision or the regulatory review exception**, legalizes the use of a patented compound to:
- secure regulatory approval for a generic or biosimilar medicine (e.g., generating data for submission to the MHRA or EMA).
- conduct purely experimental purposes, including "head-to-head" clinical trials that compare a new drug to an existing patented one.

This change had a concrete, practical impact. It brought UK patent law into closer alignment with other major research hubs like the United States (which has a similar Bolar exemption under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1)) and across the EU. By removing the legal ambiguity and risk of litigation, the reform aimed to and likely succeeded in removing a significant deterrent for pharmaceutical companies wanting to run clinical trials in the UK. It supported the growth of the UK's life sciences sector, including contract research organizations (CROs), and ensured that researchers could freely design trials using the most relevant standard-of-care treatments as comparators without fear of patent infringement lawsuits.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article is not primarily a forward-looking prediction piece but rather a report on a proposed policy change. However, the underlying implication was that the UK would successfully reform its laws.

- **Prediction (Implied):** The UK government will successfully "scrap" the restrictive patent laws, loosening them to be more in line with other countries.
  - **Outcome:** **Correct.** As detailed in the History section, Parliament passed the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, which included the specific amendments to create a Bolar-style exemption.

- **Prediction (Stated Goal):** The change will be a "bid to keep more clinical research in the country."
  - **Outcome:** **Largely Correct, but difficult to isolate.** While the UK remained a significant hub for clinical trials post-2013, other factors like funding, NHS collaboration, and the impact of Brexit also heavily influence R&D location choices. The legal change successfully removed a known barrier, but it was one of many factors affecting the research landscape.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article pointed out a significant but niche legal impediment to clinical research in the UK. Its long-term importance is moderate, as it accurately identified and explained an important policy correction that did get implemented, though it is not a landmark scientific discovery.
