Of course. Here is a thoughtful analysis of the 2014 *Science Magazine* blog post, "Sulfates, And What They Can Make," using the benefit of hindsight.

### 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a breakthrough in organic chemistry from the labs of K. Barry Sharpless and Valery Fokin: a new sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction that allows for the rapid and clean creation of sulfate-based polymers (polysulfates). The author, Derek Lowe, frames this as the opening of an entirely new and underexplored area of polymer chemistry. These polysulfates appeared to be more chemically resistant versions of common polycarbonates, suggesting immediate practical applications.

Lowe highlights a broader, more philosophical point from the researchers: sulfates are a dramatically underutilized functional group in synthetic chemistry, likely because they are difficult to work with. He contrasts this with their central role in biology (e.g., as sulfate esters on the edges of molecules) and ruminates on "why nature chose phosphates" for its core energetic and structural roles instead of sulfates. The core argument is that this new synthetic toolkit removes the historical barrier, making a "whole new area appear like this" and inviting chemists to discover the potential properties and uses of these novel sulfate-based materials.

### 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade saw the predictions in the article prove to be remarkably prescient, though the impact was perhaps quieter and more fundamental than the "whole new area" hype might have suggested.

*   **SuFEx Becomes a Star "Click" Reaction:** The SuFEx chemistry introduced in this paper was rapidly adopted and celebrated as a new member of the elite "click chemistry" family. It met the stringent criteria for click reactions: high yield, broad scope, simple reaction conditions, and the ability to proceed in the presence of water and oxygen. It joined the ranks of the famous copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as an invaluable tool for bioconjugation, materials science, and drug discovery.
*   **Validation and Expansion in Academia:** A deluge of academic research followed. Chemists used SuFEx to create a vast library of sulfate-containing small molecules, link biomolecules, build new polymers, and develop functional surfaces. The fundamental promise—that SuFEx provides reliable and robust access to S(VI)-F and S(VI)-O linkages—was proven correct across thousands of contexts.
*   **Truth in Materials Properties:** The initial speculation that polysulfates would be robust, chemically resistant materials has been largely borne out. Research has shown that SuFEx-derived polysulfates exhibit excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance, surpassing traditional engineering plastics like polycarbonates in some respects. Their properties are tunable based on the chemical building blocks used, confirming Lowe's assertion that the only way to discover new properties is to "make them and see what you get."
*   **Integration and Broadening:** The concept expanded beyond just sulfates to other S(VI) compounds, including sulfonimidoyl fluorides, further increasing its utility. The Sharpless group themselves continued to pioneer this area, demonstrating the breadth of SuFEx-enabled transformations.

In contrast to revolutions that promise immediate industrial products, the story of SuFEx has been one of deep, foundational impact. It didn't create a conspicuous market of "sulfate-based products" on consumer shelves, but it gave chemists in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and materials science an exceptionally powerful and trustworthy tool. The recent development of automated SuFEx-based oligomer synthesizers, akin to peptide synthesizers, signals its maturation into a core technology.

### 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's predictions were largely correct, though it slightly overestimated the immediate industrial "wow" factor and underestimated the more profound, enabling impact it would have.

**Predictions that Matched History:**

*   **Correctness of Core Promise:** The central prediction that SuFEx would unlock a "whole new area" of accessible sulfate chemistry was overwhelmingly correct. It did just that.
*   **Verification of Material Properties:** The prediction that polysulfates would be "more chemically resistant forms of polycarbonates" and that a wide range of properties existed to be discovered was accurate. The subsequent scientific literature is filled with reports characterizing these very attributes.

**Predictions that Were Misleading or Wrong:**

*   **Pace and Nature of Adoption:** While the chemistry was immediately impactful in academic labs, the idea of a "whole new area appear like this" suggested a rapid, visible explosion. The reality was a more sustained and steady integration into the chemical toolkit. The "finding out what you get" phase has been a decade-long process of careful, iterative research, not a sudden revelation of a miracle material. This is a common pattern where the initial hype of a breakthrough is focused on immediate potential, while the true, lasting impact is as a foundational enabling technology.

### 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article ranks in the top 30% of historical interest. It scores highly not because it heralded a world-changing consumer product, but because it exemplifies a crucial type of scientific progress: the invention of a fundamental tool.

On the surface, it's a short, speculative blog post about a specific chemical reaction. However, its prescience in identifying a transformative breakthrough is undeniable. It correctly flagged the birth of a second-generation click reaction, a development of immense long-term importance to chemistry and biology. Its "interest score" comes from its value as a historical marker—a snapshot of the moment a new, powerful capability was added to the scientific arsenal. It showcases the very process of scientific discovery: a clever workaround removes a long-standing limitation, immediately rendering a vast, unexplored chemical space accessible. For anyone interested in the history of chemistry or how true, impactful innovation occurs, this article is a quiet but powerful case study.
