# Nationalist Medicine? What Crap is This? (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author laments two recent examples of “science‑driven nationalism.”  
* In Hungary, the Orbán government has been attacking the Central European University (CEU) and its staff, accusing them of foreign influence, while simultaneously courting China by funding a new institute for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) at Semmelweis University and signing teaching agreements with Chinese medical schools. The piece argues that such politicised interference threatens the country’s historic scientific legacy.  
* In China, the government is portrayed as rolling back safety and efficacy requirements for TCM, easing licensing for practitioners, and suppressing criticism (e.g., removal of articles on aristolochic‑acid toxicity). The author warns that this “nationalist” support for unproven remedies could damage both public health and the credibility of China’s emerging research‑driven drug industry, especially given concerns about bear‑bile harvesting and animal welfare.

The overall message is that science works best when it is insulated from nationalist agendas, and that the policies described are likely to hinder genuine biomedical progress.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Hungary – CEU and TCM collaborations  
| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2018‑2020** | The Hungarian Parliament passed a law that effectively forced CEU to relocate its main campus out of Budapest. CEU moved to Vienna in 2020, retaining its U.S. accreditation and continuing to operate as an international university. | CEU’s relocation was a high‑profile victory for academic‑freedom advocates; the university retained most of its faculty and students and continued to attract funding from the U.S. and EU. |
| **2020** | The European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruled that Hungary’s law violated EU fundamental‑rights provisions, ordering the removal of the “foreign‑institution” restriction. | The ruling reinforced EU mechanisms for protecting academic freedom, though Hungary has not fully repealed the law. |
| **2021‑2024** | The TCM institute at Semmelweis University was built and began offering joint courses with Chinese partners. Funding of ~€4–5 million was allocated, but the institute has remained small, focusing on curriculum exchange rather than large‑scale research. | The institute has produced a modest number of joint publications (mostly review or educational papers) but has not generated clinically relevant drug candidates. |
| **2022‑2025** | Hungary’s science ministry continued to allocate modest grants to TCM‑related projects, but EU‑funded research programmes (e.g., Horizon Europe) have barred projects that rely solely on unvalidated TCM formulations. | The majority of Hungarian biomedical research stays within EU‑aligned frameworks; TCM collaborations are peripheral. |
| **2025** | A parliamentary inquiry examined the “national‑interest” justification for the TCM institute. The report concluded that the economic benefits were negligible and recommended re‑channeling funds to EU‑compliant drug‑discovery programs. | No major policy reversal yet, but the political momentum behind the TCM push appears to be waning. |

### China – Regulation of Traditional Chinese Medicine  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2018** | The article cited (Nature, Oct 2018) described a plan to relax safety/efficacy testing for TCM and to ease licensing for practitioners. | Prompted international criticism but did not immediately change the regulatory framework. |
| **2019‑2020** | China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) issued draft guidelines that would allow “herbal‑medicine” products to be marketed without full clinical‑trial data, provided they were listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. | The drafts faced push‑back from the Chinese Society of Pharmacology and were not fully implemented. |
| **2021** | The NMPA introduced a “dual‑track” system: (1) Traditional formulations could be registered based on historical use, but (2) any new indication or novel combination required Phase I‑III trials. | This compromise kept many classic TCM products on the market while tightening oversight for new claims. |
| **2022** | A high‑profile case: the herbal product “Aristolochia‑containing decoction” was linked to a cluster of kidney injuries; the NMPA issued a safety alert and required manufacturers to add warning labels. | Demonstrated that the regulator can act when safety signals emerge, countering the “no‑testing” narrative. |
| **2023** | China announced a phased ban on bear‑bile farming, encouraging the use of synthetic ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The ban covered new farms and required existing farms to transition by 2027. | Reduced pressure on wild bears; synthetic UDCA is now the standard for the few clinical indications where bile acids are used. |
| **2024‑2025** | Several TCM‑derived compounds entered early‑stage clinical trials for metabolic and oncologic indications (e.g., artemisinin derivatives for leukemia, berberine for dyslipidaemia). All were conducted under the dual‑track system with full Phase I safety data. | None have yet reached Phase III or regulatory approval, but the pipeline shows that TCM can feed into modern drug discovery when subjected to standard trials. |
| **2026** | The NMPA released a final “Guideline for the Registration of Traditional Herbal Medicines” that requires at least one well‑controlled clinical study for any product seeking export or insurance reimbursement. | Aligns Chinese TCM regulation more closely with international standards, improving credibility for export markets. |

### Overall Assessment  

* **Academic freedom in Hungary** – The CEU episode remains a cautionary tale; the university continues to thrive abroad, while Hungary’s domestic science system has not benefited measurably from the TCM investment.  
* **TCM in China** – The initial “roll‑back” rhetoric was moderated by a series of regulatory adjustments. While many classic remedies remain on the market with minimal testing, newer TCM‑derived drug candidates are now required to follow conventional clinical pathways. The bear‑bile issue has been largely addressed through synthetic substitutes and a phased ban on farming.  
* **Global biotech impact** – No major biotech breakthroughs directly traceable to the Hungarian‑TCM partnership have emerged. Chinese TCM research contributes modestly to the broader natural‑product drug‑discovery landscape, but the majority of China’s internationally successful biotech products (e.g., CAR‑T therapies, mRNA vaccines) arise from modern molecular platforms rather than traditional herbal knowledge.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2018 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Hungary’s nationalist policies will cripple its scientific output and prevent the emergence of world‑class researchers.** | Hungarian research output (publications, patents) has remained roughly stable; the loss of CEU was offset by increased EU funding to other institutions. No “new von Neumann‑type” figure has emerged, but the broader scientific ecosystem has not collapsed. |
| **China will drop safety/efficacy requirements for TCM, leading to widespread untested products and possible public‑health crises.** | China initially signaled deregulation but later instituted a dual‑track system and, by 2026, required at least one controlled clinical study for export/reimbursement. Isolated safety incidents (e.g., aristolochic‑acid nephropathy) prompted targeted alerts, but a systemic crisis has not materialised. |
| **The Hungarian government will use TCM to cement economic ties with China, creating a lucrative “TCM industry” in Europe.** | A modest TCM institute was built, but it has not generated significant economic returns. Most European TCM products continue to be imported from China; no large‑scale Hungarian TCM manufacturing sector has arisen. |
| **Suppression of criticism (e.g., jail for anti‑TCM speech) will become common in China, stifling scientific debate.** | While internet censorship of overtly critical TCM posts persists, Chinese scientists can publish safety concerns in peer‑reviewed journals. Legal actions against critics are rare and usually limited to defamation or “spreading rumors” cases, not systematic imprisonment. |
| **Bear‑bile harvesting will continue unchecked, threatening species survival.** | China’s 2023 phased ban on bear‑bile farming and promotion of synthetic UDCA have markedly reduced demand for wild‑caught bile; illegal trade persists at low levels but is no longer a major industry. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a vivid snapshot of how political nationalism can intersect with science policy, and the subsequent decade has shown a nuanced evolution—especially the partial reversal of China’s deregulation and the CEU relocation saga—making it a worthwhile case study for science‑policy scholars.
