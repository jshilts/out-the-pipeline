# Where The Hot Drugs Come From: Somewhere Else (March 2014)

## 1. Summary

The article highlights a LifeSciVC analysis showing that around 75% of the drugs on a Goldman Sachs list of "ten drugs that could transform the industry" originated outside the large pharmaceutical companies that currently own them. These assets came via in-licensing deals or corporate acquisitions rather than through internal R&D programs. The author speculates that while these externally sourced compounds likely still face high failure rates (consistent with the industry's ~90% clinical failure rate overall), they might fail at a slightly lower rate because they've been vetted by multiple sets of eyes and attracted investment.

The piece also references earlier analyses suggesting that smaller companies and university-derived research produce more innovative drugs than big pharma's internal programs. While acknowledging this isn't a universal rule (there are counterexamples), the article suggests that on average, smaller companies may be better at drug innovation, with larger companies excelling at development, commercialization, and business development.

## 2. History

**Continued External Innovation Model:** The trend identified in 2014 has largely persisted and even strengthened. Major pharmaceutical companies continue to rely heavily on external innovation through acquisitions and licensing deals, with many companies now explicitly structuring their R&D around this "externalization" strategy.

**M&A Activity:** The subsequent years saw significant pharmaceutical M&A activity focused on acquiring innovative pipeline assets. Notable examples include:
- Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition of Celgene (2019) for $74 billion, largely driven by pipeline assets
- AbbVie's acquisition of Allergan (2019) for $63 billion
- Numerous smaller acquisitions targeting specific therapeutic areas or platform technologies

**Shift in R&D Strategy:** Many large pharma companies have continued to trim internal discovery research while expanding business development and venture investing arms. Companies like Novartis, Pfizer, and Merck have increasingly positioned themselves as development and commercialization engines rather than primary discovery organizations.

**Biotech Ecosystem Growth:** The biotech sector has continued to grow as the primary source of innovative drug candidates, with venture funding supporting early-stage innovation that eventually gets acquired or partnered with larger companies for late-stage development and commercialization.

**Platform Technology Acquisitions:** The trend extended beyond individual drugs to platform technologies, with major acquisitions of companies with innovative discovery platforms (gene therapy, cell therapy, RNA-based therapies, etc.).

## 3. Predictions

**Prediction: External sourcing would maintain its imbalanced ratio (75% external to internal)**

- **Outcome**: This prediction proved largely accurate. External innovation has remained a dominant strategy for large pharmaceutical companies throughout the 2010-2020 period and beyond. The ratio has stayed high, though exact percentages vary by company and therapeutic area.

**Prediction: Inlicensed compounds would have high but perhaps slightly lower failure rates than internal programs**

- **Outcome**: There's evidence supporting this. Later analyses have shown that externally sourced drugs tend to have higher success rates than internally developed ones, likely due to the additional vetting and validation process mentioned in the article.

**Implicit prediction: Small companies would continue to be major sources of innovation**

- **Outcome**: This has proven correct. Smaller biotech companies and startups have remained the primary engine of therapeutic innovation, particularly for breakthrough modalities like gene therapy, cell therapy, and novel mechanisms of action.

**Implicit prediction: Big pharma would continue excelling at development and commercialization**

- **Outcome**: Accurate. Large pharmaceutical companies have maintained their strengths in late-stage clinical development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, and global commercialization, with smaller companies often licensing or selling rights to larger partners for these stages.

## 4. Interest

**Rating: 8/10**

This article identified a fundamental structural shift in pharmaceutical R&D that has had lasting impact on the industry's innovation ecosystem. It correctly foresaw the continued reliance on external innovation and the specialization of roles between small innovative companies and large development/commercialization organizations.
