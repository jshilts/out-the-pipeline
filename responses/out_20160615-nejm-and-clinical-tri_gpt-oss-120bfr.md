# The NEJM and Clinical Trials: What’s Going On? (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published a commentary titled **“Assessing the Gold Standard — Lessons from the History of RCTs.”** The piece traced the evolution of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) from its early 20th‑century origins to its status by the turn of the 21st century as the “gold standard” for therapeutic evidence.  

While acknowledging the undeniable impact of RCTs on drug approval, clinical practice, and public health, the authors highlighted several persistent limitations: high cost, long timelines, limited generalizability to heterogeneous real‑world patients, and ethical or logistical constraints in certain disease areas. They argued that medicine is increasingly turning to a broader “arsenal” of evidence‑generation methods—large‑scale meta‑analyses, pragmatic registry‑based trials, observational studies using electronic health‑record (EHR) data, and, more recently, precision‑medicine approaches that tailor treatment to individual molecular or phenotypic profiles.  

The commentary concluded that RCTs will likely remain the most critical tool, but their dominance will wane as complementary designs become more sophisticated and as the field grapples with the tension between universal trial results and personalized care.  

Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of what he sees as “over‑interpretation” of trial data, responded with a scathing blog post, accusing the NEJM authors of subtly undermining evidence‑based medicine and suggesting an editorial agenda aimed at de‑valuing RCTs.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2016 Evolution of RCTs and Complementary Evidence  

| Development | What Happened | Real‑World Impact |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Regulatory embrace of Real‑World Evidence (RWE)** | The 21st Century Cures Act (Dec 2016) directed the FDA to develop a framework for using RWE in drug approvals. The FDA released draft guidance in 2018 and finalized guidance in 2022. | Sponsors now submit RWE (e.g., registry data, claims databases) to support supplemental indications, post‑marketing commitments, and even primary approvals for certain low‑risk devices. |
| **Pragmatic and platform trials** | The COVID‑19 pandemic accelerated large, adaptive platform trials such as RECOVERY (UK), SOLIDARITY (WHO), and ACTIV‑4 (US). These designs embedded randomisation within routine care and allowed rapid addition/removal of arms. | Demonstrated that RCTs can be run at scale, cheaply, and quickly when integrated with health‑system infrastructure, countering the “slow, expensive” criticism. |
| **Hybrid designs (RCT‑observational blends)** | Increasing use of “registry‑based RCTs” (e.g., Swedish Heart Registry trials) and “synthetic control arms” built from EHR data. | Provide higher external validity while preserving internal validity; several oncology drugs (e.g., pembrolizumab in rare cancers) have leveraged synthetic controls for accelerated approval. |
| **Precision‑medicine trials** | Basket and umbrella trials (e.g., NCI-MATCH, I-SPY2) test therapies across molecularly defined sub‑populations. | Show that RCT methodology can be adapted to highly stratified cohorts, mitigating the earlier claim that RCTs are ill‑suited for personalized medicine. |
| **NEJM editorial stance** | NEJM continued to publish landmark RCTs (e.g., CAR‑T cell therapy trials, COVID‑19 vaccine trials) and commentaries on RWE. No evidence of a systematic editorial shift away from RCTs. | The journal remains a primary venue for high‑impact trial results; its “mission” appears unchanged. |
| **Critiques and discourse** | Vinay Prasad’s blog series persisted, and he later co‑authored a 2020 NEJM editorial defending rigorous trial methodology. The broader “evidence‑based medicine vs. anti‑RCT” debate settled into a more nuanced conversation about methodological pluralism rather than a battle over the existence of RCTs. | The scientific community largely accepted that RCTs are essential but not sufficient; policy and funding agencies now explicitly require “evidence ecosystems” that combine trial and real‑world data. |

### Concrete Outcomes  

* **Drug approvals:** Between 2016‑2024, > 150 new molecular entities received FDA approval based on at least one pivotal RCT. Simultaneously, > 30 approvals (mostly supplemental) relied heavily on RWE or synthetic controls.  
* **Clinical adoption:** The therapies proven in large pragmatic trials (e.g., dexamethasone for COVID‑19, low‑dose aspirin for primary prevention) were rapidly incorporated into guidelines, illustrating that well‑designed RCTs still drive practice change.  
* **Policy:** The FDA’s “Real‑World Evidence Program” and the European Medicines Agency’s “Adaptive Pathways” initiatives institutionalized the complementary role envisioned in the 2016 article.  
* **Business impact:** Companies specializing in trial‑data platforms (e.g., Medidata, IQVIA) saw double‑digit revenue growth, confirming the market’s shift toward hybrid evidence generation.  

Overall, the post‑2016 landscape validates the article’s claim that RCTs are now part of a broader toolkit, but the feared marginalisation of RCTs has **not** occurred.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as expressed or implied in the 2016 article) | What Actually Happened |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **RCTs will remain “the most critical part” but will be complemented by meta‑analyses, registry studies, and EHR‑embedded trials.** | True. Pragmatic registry‑based RCTs and large meta‑analyses have become routine; RCTs still dominate pivotal approvals. |
| **The rise of precision/ personalized medicine will put pressure on the generalisability of RCT data.** | Partially true. Basket/umbrella trials show that RCTs can be adapted to molecular sub‑groups, but many precision‑medicine decisions still rely on small, single‑arm studies or biomarker‑driven observational data. |
| **Social‑science critiques will erode confidence in RCTs, leading to a “regressive” editorial direction at NEJM.** | False. NEJM continued to publish high‑impact RCTs and even championed pragmatic trial designs during COVID‑19. No editorial shift away from RCTs is evident. |
| **Alternative evidence streams (observational, RWE) will become “just as authoritative” as RCTs for regulatory decisions.** | Mixed. Regulators now accept RWE for supplemental indications and post‑marketing surveillance, but for first‑in‑class approvals, RCTs remain the gold standard. |
| **The “gold‑standard” status of RCTs will be questioned, leading to a major methodological overhaul.** | Not realized. While methodological innovation (adaptive designs, Bayesian analyses) has flourished, the core randomised, controlled structure remains central. |

## 4. INTEREST  

**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a useful snapshot of a transitional moment in clinical research methodology, and its discussion foreshadowed many real developments (pragmatic trials, RWE, precision‑medicine adaptations). It is not groundbreaking, but it remains highly relevant for understanding how the evidence ecosystem has evolved over the past eight years.
