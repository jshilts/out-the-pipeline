# Chemistry Geekery (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal blog post by a chemist reflecting on their career and listing classic organic chemistry reactions they have never performed despite being a practicing chemist. The author mentions never having done ozonolysis, aldol reactions (only retro-aldol accidentally), diazotization (Sandmeyer), selenium chemistry, diazomethane preparation, Fischer indole synthesis, Skraup reaction, Nazarov cyclization, olefin metathesis, samarium iodide reactions, Hell-Vollhardt-Zhelinsky reaction, Oppenauer oxidation, or Wacker oxidation. The tone is humorous and self-deprecating, noting that these "famous" reactions have "waited this long; they can wait some more." The author contrasts this with having performed other name reactions like the Shapiro reaction, positioning the post as light-hearted chemistry career introspection.

## 2. HISTORY

This article is a personal chemistry blog post from 2004, not a commentary about the biotechnology industry. The post has no subsequent industrial, clinical, or policy developments to track because it contains no claims, technologies, or business propositions—it is purely anecdotal reflection by an individual chemist about their laboratory experience. There were no drugs, companies, or scientific breakthroughs mentioned that could be followed up. The post is part of the early chemistry blogging community (circa 2004), but does not discuss biotechnology industry developments, approved drugs, clinical trials, FDA approvals, or policy changes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No predictions were made in this article. The author made no claims about future technologies, drug approvals, business outcomes, or scientific developments. The post exclusively discusses past personal laboratory experiences and contains no forward-looking statements to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article is a personal blog post about an individual chemist's experience with named organic reactions, not a commentary about the biotechnology industry. It contains no analysis, predictions, or discussion relevant to biotechnology industry developments, approved drugs, clinical outcomes, or policy changes. The post is off-topic relative to the intended subject matter of biotechnology industry commentary.
