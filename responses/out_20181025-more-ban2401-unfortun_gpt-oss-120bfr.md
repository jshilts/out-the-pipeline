# More on BAN2401, Unfortunately (October 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary warned that the interim results from Biotech / Eisai’s anti‑amyloid antibody BAN2401 (later named lecanemab) were unreliable. The author highlighted three problems:  

1. **Dose‑response confusion** – the 10 mg/kg dose appeared to improve cognition, while lower doses performed worse than placebo.  
2. **APOE4 imbalance** – more APOE4‑positive participants were in the placebo arm, a known risk factor that could make the treatment look better than it truly was.  
3. **Sub‑group analysis with tiny numbers** – the companies’ attempt to “fix” the APOE4 issue compared only ten treated patients with 113 controls, a sample size the author argued was far too small to draw any conclusions.  

The piece concluded that the data did not restore confidence in BAN2401 and suggested that investors and patients who had been hopeful should be disappointed.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Phase 2 (2018‑2019).** After the July 2018 data, Biogen and Eisai completed the Phase 2 “BAN2401‑201” trial, confirming a dose‑response trend but still showing modest efficacy and a safety profile dominated by amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).  

**Phase 3 – CLARITY‑AD (2020‑2022).** A pivotal, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled Phase 3 trial (≈1,800 participants with early Alzheimer’s disease) was launched in 2020. In January 2022 the company announced that lecanemab slowed cognitive decline by ~27 % on the Clinical Dementia Rating‑Sum of Boxes (CDR‑SB) and reduced amyloid plaque burden. The trial enrolled a balanced APOE4 distribution, eliminating the subgroup‑size issue that plagued the earlier analysis.  

**Regulatory outcome.**  
* **January 2023:** FDA granted accelerated approval for lecanemab (brand name Leqembi) for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, contingent on a confirmatory trial.  
* **July 2023:** Full approval was granted after the confirmatory data from CLARITY‑AD satisfied the FDA’s efficacy and safety requirements.  

**Commercial launch.** Leqembi entered the U.S. market in July 2023, priced at roughly $26,500 per patient per year. By early 2024, Medicare and several private insurers began covering the drug, though utilization was limited by infusion‑center capacity and the need for MRI monitoring for ARIA. Sales in the first full year were modest (≈ $200 M) but expected to grow as infrastructure and payer policies mature.  

**Safety and real‑world data.** Post‑approval surveillance confirmed ARIA rates of ~12 % (mostly asymptomatic), comparable to other anti‑amyloid antibodies (aducanumab, donanemab). No unexpected safety signals have emerged.  

**Impact on the field.** The positive Phase 3 data revived confidence in the amyloid‑clearance hypothesis, prompting increased investment in similar antibodies and in combination‑therapy strategies. The success of lecanemab also contrasted sharply with the controversy surrounding aducanumab, which had been approved on weaker evidence.  

**Company performance.** Biogen’s share price, which had dipped after the 2018 disappointment, rebounded after the 2022 Phase 3 announcement and again after the 2023 FDA approvals, moving from ~ $150 / share in early 2022 to > $250 by late 2023.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the 2018 article:** *“The data do nothing to put anyone’s mind at ease about the prospects for the drug… If you bought Biogen stock back then… you regret it.”*  
  - **Outcome:** The drug ultimately succeeded in Phase 3, received FDA approval, and contributed to a rebound in Biogen’s stock. The short‑term disappointment was real, but the long‑term trajectory proved positive.  

- **Implicit prediction (by the author):** *“The subgroup analysis is too small to be meaningful; the drug’s future looks bleak.”*  
  - **Outcome:** Subsequent large‑scale trials (CLARITY‑AD) provided robust, adequately powered data that overcame the earlier subgroup limitation. The drug’s efficacy was demonstrated convincingly, disproving the bleak outlook.  

- **Industry‑wide implication hinted at:** *“If the hype was unfounded, the Alzheimer’s field may suffer a setback.”*  
  - **Outcome:** While the 2018 episode highlighted the risk of over‑interpreting early data, the later success of lecanemab actually reinforced the amyloid‑targeting approach, encouraging further development of similar agents.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment of skepticism that preceded a major therapeutic breakthrough; its critique of flawed subgroup analysis is a useful case study in clinical‑trial interpretation, and the eventual reversal of fortunes makes it historically and scientifically significant.
