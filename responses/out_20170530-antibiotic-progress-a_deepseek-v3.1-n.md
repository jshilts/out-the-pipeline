# Antibiotic Progress - And Not a Moment Too Soon (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses two promising research approaches for addressing antibiotic resistance, published in May 2017. The first is work by the Hergenrother group at University of Illinois, published in Nature, which identified structural principles enabling compounds to accumulate in E. coli. Their key findings were that effective compounds contain unhindered primary amines, non-polar functionality, rigidity, and low globularity. Most importantly, they demonstrated that attaching a simple methylamine group to a gram-positive-only antibiotic (deoxynybomycin) could convert it into a compound active against gram-negative bacteria, potentially opening a pathway to modify existing gram-positive drugs.

The second research discussed is from the Boger group at Scripps, modifying vancomycin (the "antibiotic of last resort"). Their PNAS paper described vancomycin analogs with dramatically improved potency (up to 1000x over native vancomycin) and three separate mechanisms of action, making resistance evolution much more difficult. The modification included an unhindered quaternary ammonium group that improved membrane permeability. The article acknowledged that these advances would still require extensive animal testing and clinical development, and noted the significant synthetic chemistry challenges in scaling production.

## 2. HISTORY

The research trajectories since 2017 have followed somewhat predictable but challenging paths typical of antibiotic drug development:

**Hergenrother group's accumulation principles:** The structural insights about compound accumulation in gram-negative bacteria represented real scientific progress and have influenced antibiotic discovery approaches. However, the specific "gram-positive conversion" strategy did not lead to any FDA-approved drugs by 2024. The deoxynybomycin modification remained an academic proof-of-concept rather than a clinical candidate. The underlying challenge is that antibiotic development timelines are extremely long (often 10-15 years), and many promising early-stage candidates fail during development due to toxicity, insufficient efficacy, or other issues.

**Boger group's vancomycin analogs:** The modified vancomycin compounds faced the expected hurdles of drug development. No vancomycin analog based on this specific three-mechanism approach has reached FDA approval as of 2024. This reflects both the difficulty of antibiotic development and the particularly challenging economics of the antibiotic market, where new drugs are often reserved as last-resort treatments, limiting commercial incentives.

**Broader antibiotic landscape:** The period 2017-2024 saw continued growth in antibiotic resistance globally, validating the article's concerns. Several new antibiotics did receive FDA approval during this period, including combinations and novel mechanisms, but the pipeline remained inadequate to address the full scope of resistance. Policy responses included continued funding through initiatives like CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) and modifications to FDA approval pathways for antibiotics.

**Academic vs. commercial translation:** Both research programs remained primarily academic achievements rather than leading to commercial drug development partnerships or clinical candidates. This reflects the well-known "valley of death" in antibiotic development, where promising academic research struggles to attract pharmaceutical investment due to challenging market economics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"We will see the fruits of those [gram-positive conversion] efforts pretty soon"** - This did not materialize as hoped. No drugs based on this specific conversion strategy reached clinical use or even late-stage trials by 2024. Academic proof-of-concept to clinical translation in antibiotics typically requires a decade or more, so "pretty soon" was unrealistic.

• **"This trick works across a number of pathogens"** - The underlying principle of adding primary amines to improve gram-negative accumulation did show broader applicability in laboratory studies, but practical drug development applications remained limited.

• **Vancomycin analog progressing to "whole-animal models of efficacy and toxicity" and potentially "heading into humans"** - While initial cell-based toxicity results were indeed promising, transition to robust animal models and human clinical trials did not occur at the pace implied, with no FDA-approved product emerging from this specific research by 2024.

• **The modified vancomycin making it "very hard indeed for bacteria to evolve resistance" due to three mechanisms of action** - While mechanistically sound and validated in laboratory studies, the real-world test against clinical isolates over extended periods would require actual patient use, which never occurred since the drug didn't reach clinical practice.

• **Challenges with scaling synthesis** - This prediction proved accurate. The complex synthetic chemistry required for elaborate vancomycin modifications remained a significant barrier, typical of natural product-derived antibiotics.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article addresses a critical public health issue (antibiotic resistance) and discusses legitimate scientific advances with clear clinical implications. However, it exhibits typical overly optimistic timeline expectations for drug development and doesn't fully acknowledge the structural barriers in antibiotic commercialization. The scientific content remains valid and the research directions important, but the practical impact has been more limited than hoped.
