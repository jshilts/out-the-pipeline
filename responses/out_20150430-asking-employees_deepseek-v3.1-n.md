# Asking the Employees (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses whether companies genuinely solicit and implement employee suggestions, using BASF's "idea management" program as a positive example from the chemical industry. BASF reported implementing over 23,000 employee proposals in 2014, saving €53 million (£38 million), with a 65-year history of such programs and active topic-based campaigns around energy savings and occupational safety. The author notes the absence of pharmaceutical industry examples and poses the question to readers about their own workplace experiences with formal vs. informal suggestion processes, or companies that only gave "lip service" to employee input.

## 2. HISTORY

I do not have access to specific historical developments related to employee suggestion programs in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries following this 2015 article. Therefore, I cannot provide concrete details about whether drug companies adopted similar "idea management" approaches, whether specific programs led to measurable outcomes, or how workplace innovation culture evolved in biotech firms after this publication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There are no explicit predictions in this article about future developments. It primarily poses questions to readers about their workplace experiences rather than forecasting trends or outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses organizational culture rather than biotechnology science or medical breakthroughs, with limited direct relevance to biotech innovation despite appearing in a biotech-focused publication.
