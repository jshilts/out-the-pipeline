# Lilly's R&D Outsourcing (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Eli Lilly's strategy of outsourcing substantial portions of their drug development work to contract research organizations (CROs), particularly through their R&D unit named Chorus, following a major deal with Covance in 2008. The Wall Street Journal piece cited in the commentary quoted consultants suggesting that externalizing R&D helped overcome emotional attachment that internal researchers might have to their own compounds, allowing for more objective decision-making about when to terminate unpromising drug candidates.

However, the article's author expresses skepticism about this reasoning, arguing that the primary motivation is cost reduction rather than improved decision-making. The author contends that clinical trial data should speak for itself regardless of who conducts the trials, and that the real challenge lies in trial design rather than researcher attachment. The commentary also highlights critics' concerns that while outsourcing may produce negative results faster and cheaper, it doesn't address big pharma's fundamental problem: the lack of sufficient positive results stemming from deep biological and disease insight.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2010 article, Eli Lilly's outsourcing strategy through their Chorus unit proved to be a mixed success that reflected both sides of the argument presented. On the positive side, Lily's approach did achieve its cost efficiency goals - by 2015, Chorus had advanced multiple compounds into clinical development at significantly lower costs than traditional internal R&D, with some estimates suggesting 30-50% cost savings per program. However, this did not fundamentally solve Lilly's productivity challenges.

In terms of drug approvals, Lilly continued to face significant patent cliffs, particularly the loss of exclusivity for their blockbuster antipsychotic Zyprexa in 2011, which cost billions in annual revenue. Their outsourcing strategy did not prevent a period of relatively modest pipeline productivity through the early 2010s. Notably, Lilly's most significant subsequent success - the diabetes drug Trulicity (dulaglutide), approved in 2014 - was largely developed internally rather than through outsourced partnerships.

The broader pharmaceutical industry did not universally adopt Lilly's extensive outsourcing model. While strategic partnerships with CROs for specific trial phases became standard practice, most major pharmaceutical companies maintained substantial internal discovery and early clinical development capabilities, recognizing that external partners could not replace the deep institutional knowledge and biological insight needed for breakthrough innovations.

By the late 2010s and early 2020s, Lilly's R&D strategy had evolved to focus more on strategic therapeutic areas where they had strong internal expertise, particularly in diabetes, oncology, and neuroscience, while maintaining selective partnerships for specific capabilities or geographic expansion. Their later successes, including Alimta, Verzenio, and Jardiance, reflected this more balanced approach combining internal R&D strength with targeted external partnerships.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Outsourcing would not address big pharma's main problem of finding new therapies that pan out**
- **Outcome: Largely accurate.** While cost savings were achieved, outsourcing alone did not solve pharmaceutical R&D productivity challenges. Many companies, including Lilly, continued to struggle with high failure rates in clinical development throughout the 2010s.

**Prediction: Cost cutting and structural changes alone would not improve R&D productivity**
- **Outcome: Largely accurate.** Studies throughout the 2010s continued to show that despite increased R&D spending across the industry and various structural reforms including outsourcing, the fundamental productivity challenge in drug development remained unresolved.

**Prediction: CROs might lack the knowledge and insight about biology and disease for breakthrough innovations**
- **Outcome: Mixed.** While CROs excelled at executing well-defined clinical studies, breakthrough therapies continued to emerge primarily from companies with deep internal scientific expertise and novel biological insights, supporting the premise that external execution capabilities alone cannot replace discovery expertise.

**Prediction: Lilly might need to make acquisitions to replenish its pipeline**
- **Outcome: Accurate.** Lilly did pursue strategic acquisitions in subsequent years, including the $6.5 billion acquisition of ImClone Systems in 2008 for their oncology pipeline, and smaller acquisitions targeting specific therapeutic areas like pain and diabetes throughout the 2010s.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important strategic shift in pharmaceutical R&D during a critical period of patent expirations and productivity challenges, but the outsourcing debate it describes was already well underway by 2010. The author's skeptical analysis proved prescient regarding the limitations of cost-focused solutions to fundamental R&D productivity problems.
