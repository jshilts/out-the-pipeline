# The Latest on China (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines China's evolving role in the biopharmaceutical industry as of late 2017, covering three main narratives: China as a source of cheap scientific labor, Western pharmaceutical companies establishing divisions in China, and the development of China's own research-driven drug industry. The piece notes that Western companies were beginning to scale back their Chinese operations as optimistic projections failed to materialize. Data from 2015 showed China contributing only 4% of global pharmaceutical R&D compared to the US's 50%, and just 2.5% of new molecules discovered from 2007-2015 came from China.

The analysis suggests that while China had talented scientists, much of the local R&D activity remained "copycat" rather than innovative. The author highlights that China's internal drug market—particularly late-stage development, regulatory affairs, and market access—represented the more significant opportunity compared to basic R&D. At the time, the Chinese government was implementing major reforms to overhaul drug approval processes. The article also notes quality control challenges including problematic scientific literature and issues with cell lines and reagents, creating uncertainty about China's biopharma development trajectory.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2017 marked a dramatic transformation of China's biopharmaceutical sector that largely exceeded the article's cautious assessment:

**Regulatory and Policy Reforms**: China's 2017-2018 regulatory overhaul accelerated dramatically. The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) streamlined approval processes, with the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) approving over 50 new molecular entities in 2020 alone, compared to single digits annually before 2017. The "Healthy China 2030" initiative significantly increased government investment in biotechnology.

**Innovation Ecosystem Growth**: Contrary to the article's skepticism about innovative R&D, China saw substantial growth in original drug development. By 2021-2023, Chinese companies were developing innovative therapies across multiple modalities including cell therapy, gene therapy, and antibody-drug conjugates. Companies like BeiGene, Zai Lab, and Legend Biotech gained international recognition, with Legend's CAR-T therapy Carvykti approved in multiple markets.

**Clinical Development Acceleration**: The article's focus on development over basic R&D proved prescient, as China became a major hub for clinical trials. By 2022, China was conducting numerous global multi-center trials and serving as a critical site for patient recruitment, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Market Expansion**: China's domestic biopharma market grew from approximately $100 billion in 2017 to over $180 billion by 2022-2023. International companies increasingly viewed China not just as a market but as a development partner.

**Capital Investment**: The 2018-2021 period saw massive capital inflows into Chinese biotech, with Hong Kong's Biotech Chapter 18A listings raising billions for pre-revenue companies. Though this cooled somewhat in 2022-2023 due to global Biotech Market corrections, the infrastructure and talent pipeline remained established.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions and assessments about China's biopharma trajectory:

• **"China's endogenous biopharma industry is already well behind some of the earlier predictions"** - This proved largely incorrect. By 2020-2023, China had developed a robust domestic biopharma industry with multiple companies achieving international partnerships and approvals.

• **"It's not going to be possible to make meaningful guesses about [China's drug approval process] for a while yet"** - The regulatory reforms actually progressed rapidly, and by 2019-2020 the NMPA had established transparent approval pathways that made China's regulatory environment increasingly predictable.

• **Focus on development over basic R&D as "the main story"** - This was accurate initially, but China developed strength in both basic research and development. By 2020-2023, Chinese scientists were publishing high-impact papers and contributing to fundamental discoveries alongside their clinical development achievements.

• **Western companies scaling back operations** - This proved temporary. While some companies restructured in 2017-2018, most major pharma companies expanded their China presence significantly by 2020-2023, attracted by the reformed regulatory environment and market access opportunities.

• **Quality control challenges with cell lines and reagents** - These issues persisted but improved with increased investment in GMP facilities and adherence to international quality standards. However, some quality concerns continued to surface periodically through 2023.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a crucial transition moment in China's pharmaceutical development, though it underestimated the speed and scope of the transformation that followed. The piece provides valuable context about the skepticism and challenges facing China's biopharma sector in 2017, making it a useful historical benchmark for understanding how rapidly the landscape changed post-2018.
