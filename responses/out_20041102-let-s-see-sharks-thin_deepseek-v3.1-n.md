# Let's See What the Sharks Think of These Steaks! (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses leaked internal Merck documents published by the Wall Street Journal regarding the company's handling of Vioxx's cardiovascular risks. The author describes how Merck appears to have known about Vioxx's heart attack risks early on but created marketing materials—including a document titled "Dodge Ball Vioxx"—that trained sales representatives to evade or deflect doctors' concerns about cardiovascular side effects. When physicians raised safety concerns, the materials instructed salespeople to give non-responsive answers rather than directly address the issues. The author expresses disappointment in Merck, a company he previously respected, and predicts that the revelations will result in massive legal liability far exceeding Vioxx's revenues, potentially causing severe damage to both the company and its employees.

## 2. HISTORY

The Vioxx scandal that broke in 2004 eventually became one of the largest pharmaceutical safety crises in history. Vioxx (rofecoxib), a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was voluntarily withdrawn by Merck in September 2004 after a clinical trial showed increased cardiovascular risks. In the subsequent years, Merck faced approximately 50,000 lawsuits from patients who claimed Vioxx caused heart attacks and strokes.

By 2007, Merck had agreed to a $4.85 billion settlement to resolve most of these claims, though this figure was significantly less than initial investor fears of potential liabilities exceeding $25 billion. The settlement covered approximately 50,000 claims and was structured as a claims-made process with specific medical criteria. Individual cases continued beyond the main settlement, with some resulting in substantial jury awards—both for plaintiffs and in Merck's favor.

The FDA's treatment of drug safety and post-market surveillance underwent significant scrutiny and reform following the Vioxx recall. Congressional hearings examined both Merck's conduct and the FDA's oversight capabilities, with questions about whether safety signals had been adequately recognized. The scandal led to increased public awareness about pharmaceutical industry marketing practices and the importance of independent clinical data review.

The COX-2 inhibitor class as a whole suffered from Vioxx's withdrawal. Pfizer's Celebrex, the other major COX-2 inhibitor, remained on the market but with added FDA warnings and heightened safety monitoring. Bextra, another COX-2 inhibitor from Pfizer, was withdrawn in 2005 due to its own safety concerns, further diminishing the drug class's prominence.

Merck's stock price and overall business suffered significant impact in the immediate aftermath, with billions in market capitalization lost. The company was also fined $950 million in 2011 for off-label marketing of Vioxx prior to its withdrawal. The scandal substantially damaged Merck's reputation and contributed to increased regulatory scrutiny across the pharmaceutical industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

### Predictions Made:
• **Enormous financial liability**: "Merck is going to be out many, many billions of dollars, far more than they ever made from Vioxx itself."
• **Massive litigation surge**: "Blood in the water for the lawyers, who will now go even more beserk than usual."
• **Severe company damage**: "going to be one for the record books" with "terrible damage" and the possibility that "Merck was in major trouble."
• **Unsparing impact**: The crisis "is going to lay waste to the good and the bad, the innocent and the guilty" without sparing many.

### How They Compared to Reality:
• **Liability magnitude**: The author's prediction of massive financial exposure was accurate—$4.85 billion in settlements plus additional court judgments and regulatory fines. While not the catastrophic $25+ billion some feared, it still represented enormous cost far exceeding Vioxx profits.
• **Litigation volume**: The prediction of aggressive legal action proved correct, with tens of thousands of lawsuits filed and years of ongoing litigation.
• **Company impact**: Merck did suffer significant, lasting damage to its reputation and business, with stock decline, regulatory restrictions, and permanent changes to its marketing practices. However, the company survived and continued operations, suggesting the "terrible damage" prediction was correct in impact but not fatal.
• **Industry and regulatory consequences**: The prediction didn't address wider impacts, but in reality the scandal reshaped FDA oversight, pharmaceutical marketing norms, and post-market drug safety monitoring across the entire industry.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article presciently identified one of pharmaceutical history's most significant safety scandals just as it was breaking. The analysis correctly anticipated both the magnitude of consequences for Merck and the broader implications about pharmaceutical industry ethics and accountability. The Vioxx case fundamentally altered drug regulation and post-market surveillance practices for years to come.
