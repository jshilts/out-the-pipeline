# More on Getting a Science PhD (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Slate piece “Is a Science PhD a Waste of Time?” (August 2012) argued that the alarm over “scientific unemployment” was overblown.  Its author, Daniel Lametti, claimed that most science PhDs find jobs quickly, that the degree remains a solid investment, and that the notion of a large pool of idle, under‑employed scientists was largely a myth.  The article sparked a backlash, most notably from the chemistry‑focused blog Chemjobber, which pointed to hard data (salary surveys, employment statistics) and warned that the optimism in Lametti’s essay ignored structural issues such as post‑doctoral bottlenecks, outsourcing, and the long‑term career prospects of scientists beyond the early‑career stage.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Employment trends (2012‑2026).**  
- **Post‑doc oversupply:**  The number of post‑doctoral researchers in the U.S. grew from ~55 k in 2012 to ~70 k by 2020, while tenure‑track openings rose far more slowly (≈5‑6 % per year).  This created a persistent “post‑doc bottleneck” that many surveys now label a form of underemployment rather than outright unemployment.  
- **Unemployment rates:**  National surveys (e.g., the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients, 2021‑2024) consistently show that <5 % of science PhDs are *unemployed* at any given time.  However, a sizable fraction (~15‑20 % in 2022‑2024) report being “in transition” or working in jobs that do not require a PhD.  This nuance was missing from the 2012 Slate narrative.  
- **Sector shift:**  By 2025, roughly 45 % of U.S. science PhDs were employed in industry, 25 % in academia (including post‑docs), 10 % in government labs, and the remainder in “non‑research” roles (consulting, data science, policy, etc.).  The rise of data‑intensive fields (AI/ML, bioinformatics) has broadened career options, but also increased competition for those positions.  
- **Salary evolution:**  Median early‑career salaries for PhDs in the life sciences rose from about $65 k (2012) to $85 k (2024) in industry, while academic post‑doc stipends remained near the NIH NRSA level (~$55 k in 2024), widening the pay gap.  
- **Policy responses:**  The NIH introduced the “Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training” (BEST) program (2014‑2020) to expose trainees to non‑academic careers, and expanded loan‑repayment and “K‑99/R00” transition awards.  The NSF’s “Graduate Research Fellowship” continued, but funding growth plateaued after 2015, prompting concerns about the sustainability of the PhD pipeline.  

**Public discourse:**  
- The Chemjobber critique (Sept 2012) sparked a series of data‑driven blog posts and academic papers (e.g., “The PhD Job Crisis” – Nature 2022) that highlighted the mismatch between PhD output and tenure‑track demand.  
- By 2020, major scientific societies (AAAS, ACS) issued position statements acknowledging “career diversity” and urging universities to provide broader professional development.  

**Business impact:**  
- Companies that traditionally hired large numbers of PhDs (pharma, biotech) continued to grow, but hiring became more selective, emphasizing translational skill sets.  Start‑ups in synthetic biology and AI‑driven drug discovery (e.g., Insitro, Recursion) created new, well‑paid roles for PhDs, partially offsetting the slowdown in classic pharma R&D hiring.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction from the 2012 article (or its critics) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Scientific unemployment is exaggerated; most PhDs find jobs quickly.** | True for *unemployment* (≤5 %); however, many PhDs experience prolonged “post‑doc limbo” or take jobs that do not fully use their training, a nuance not captured in the original claim. |
| **A science PhD is “pretty much totally worth it.”** | Partially true: PhDs earn higher median salaries than bachelor’s‑only peers and have strong long‑term earnings growth, but the return on investment varies widely by field (e.g., physics and chemistry PhDs still face lower industry demand than life‑science PhDs). |
| **Layoffs and outsourcing are not a major concern for PhDs.** | Incorrect.  From 2015‑2022, several large pharma mergers led to R&D staff reductions (e.g., Pfizer‑Wyeth, Merck‑Schering).  Outsourcing of assay development and data analysis to contract research organizations (CROs) grew, shifting some PhDs into contract roles or prompting career pivots. |
| **You’ll be able to find another job “in a snap.”** | Overly optimistic.  Survey data (Nature 2022) shows the average time from PhD completion to a stable, non‑post‑doc position is ~2‑3 years, with many reporting multiple short‑term contracts before securing a permanent role. |
| **No significant policy changes needed.** | Wrong.  The NIH BEST initiative, NSF career‑development grants, and university‑level “career‑pathway” offices were all created in response to the very concerns the article downplayed. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of early‑2010s optimism that sparked a data‑driven debate still relevant today; its legacy lies in how it catalyzed systematic tracking of PhD career outcomes, even though many of its claims were overly rosy.
