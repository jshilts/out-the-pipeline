# Article Title (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses eyebrow-raising comments from Clover Health CEO Vivek Garipalli, made during a Bloomberg fireside chat, about expanding from insurance into therapy development. Garipalli claimed Clover was building "one of the most longitudinal datasets in healthcare" and suggested this data might lead them to "start building our own therapeutics." The author, Derek Lowe, expressed skepticism about an insurance company crossing into drug development, viewing it as outside their core competency and potentially a "recipe to lose all your money." The article distinguishes between "digital therapeutics" (which the author views somewhat dismissively as Silicon Valley's health-care flavored software/hardware), AI/machine learning applications to health data (citing IBM Watson's medical hype and failures), and actual drug discovery. The author is more optimistic about insurance companies funding comparative effectiveness trials of existing therapies rather than discovering new drugs.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2017 article, Clover Health went public via SPAC merger in January 2021 at a $3.7 billion valuation. However, the company faced significant challenges: it struggled with profitability, experienced executive departures, and became embroiled in a Department of Justice investigation regarding its business practices (disclosed in their SEC filings). Clover Health's stock declined substantially post-merger.

Most notably, Clover Health did not meaningfully enter drug discovery or develop its own therapeutics, despite the 2017 comments. The company remained focused on Medicare Advantage plans and care coordination, using data analytics primarily for identifying high-risk patients and managing their care. There is no public record of Clover Health successfully developing or commercializing any pharmaceutical therapies or digital therapeutics platforms since these comments were made.

IBM Watson Health, mentioned in the article as "choking on its own hype," was ultimately sold by IBM to Francisco Partners in 2022 at a fraction of its investment cost, representing one of the more prominent AI-in-medicine disappointments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Clover Health would leverage longitudinal healthcare datasets to build its own therapeutics.

  **Reality**: This did not materialize. Clover Health never successfully entered drug discovery or therapeutic development. The company remained an insurance provider focused on Medicare Advantage.

• **Prediction**: Insurance companies could make real impact funding comparative clinical trials between existing therapies.

  **Reality**: While some comparative effectiveness research has continued (including PCORI initiatives mentioned in the article), insurance companies never became major direct funders or sponsors of clinical trials in the transformative way suggested.

• **Author's Skepticism**: The author predicted that jumping from insurance to drug development would be a "recipe to lose all your money unless you're just turning yourself into a source of funding."

  **Reality**: This skepticism was largely validated by Clover Health's post-IPO struggles and failure to enter therapeutic development. However, we should note that many tech companies (Alphabet's Verily, for example) have persisted with data-driven healthcare initiatives, even if success has been modest and slower than anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article captures an important moment of tech/insurance industry hubris and provides generally sound skepticism about cross-industry jumps into drug development, while correctly identifying the more realistic pathway of funding comparative trials. The specific company example (Clover Health) and the broader theme of data-driven therapeutic claims remain relevant to biotech, even if the proposal discussed never materialized.
