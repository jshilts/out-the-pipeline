# Deals of the Year in Biopharma (Bonus: Names That Can't Happen) (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post from Science's In the Pipeline highlighted InVivoBlog's "Deal of the Year" picks for 2011 and shared two humorous naming anecdotes. The article mentioned that Abbott was splitting off their pharmaceutical business and that InVivoBlog had run a poll suggesting "Costello" as the new drug company name—though the author noted this wouldn't actually happen. It also referenced Bayer's introduction of Levitra (vardenafil) as a Viagra competitor several years earlier, joking that "Bayagra" would have been an entertaining but unlikely name choice.

## 2. HISTORY
The Abbott split did occur as planned. In October 2011, Abbott announced it would separate into two publicly traded companies: Abbott would focus on diversified medical products, while the research-based pharmaceuticals business would become a new company. In January 2013, this spun-off company launched as **AbbVie** (NYSE: ABBV), not "Costello." The new name was chosen to reflect the split from Abbott while maintaining some connection to the parent company's heritage.

AbbVie became one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with major drugs including Humira (adalimumab), which became the best-selling drug globally for many years before facing biosimilar competition. By 2023, AbbVie had grown to over $50 billion in annual revenues.

Bayer's Levitra (vardenafil), mentioned as the Viagra competitor, was indeed a PDE5 inhibitor approved for erectile dysfunction. It faced stiff competition from Pfizer's Viagra (sildenafil) and later Eli Lilly's Cialis (tadalafil). Levitra achieved moderate market success but never captured market leadership. Over time, as Viagra lost patent protection and generic sildenafil became available, Levitra's market position further eroded. The erectile dysfunction market evolved significantly with the entry of generic alternatives and new delivery mechanisms.

InVivoBlog, referenced in the original article, continued covering pharmaceutical industry deals and business developments for several years before being acquired by Informa in 2012 and integrated into their Life Sciences media portfolio.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained these implicit predictions about company naming:
- That "Costello" wouldn't actually be chosen for Abbott's spun-off pharma company ✓ (Correct - the company was named AbbVie)
- That "Bayagra" would have been entertaining but wasn't seriously considered for Bayer's Viagra competitor ✓ (Correct - the product launched as Levitra)

Both predictions reflected obvious realities about corporate branding and pharmaceutical naming conventions, making them unsurprising in retrospect.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 2**

This article was primarily light industry commentary with humorous naming anecdotes, lacking substantive analysis of major biopharma deals or their long-term implications. While it captured a moment in time regarding Abbott's corporate restructuring, its enduring importance is minimal compared to deeper industry analysis pieces.
