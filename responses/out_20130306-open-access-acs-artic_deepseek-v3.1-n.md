# Open Access For ACS Articles? (Mar 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the American Chemical Society's (ACS) policy regarding article sharing by corresponding authors. The author notes Rich Apodaca's investigation revealing that ACS provides corresponding authors with special links to their published papers that allow for fifty free downloads during the first year after publication and unlimited free downloads thereafter. However, the article highlights that this feature appears poorly implemented and difficult to access in practice. The author notes that despite being a corresponding author themselves, they cannot recall ever seeing such links or knowing where to obtain them. The piece focuses on Apodaca's frustrating experience trying to locate this sharing functionality for one of his own papers in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, suggesting that ACS does not make these URLs obvious or easily accessible to authors who should be entitled to them.

## 2. HISTORY

The open access movement within scientific publishing has evolved significantly since 2013, though several issues raised in this article remained relevant for years afterward. Most major scientific publishers gradually increased their article-sharing policies in response to funder mandates and academic pressure. 

The American Chemical Society eventually improved their author services and became more transparent about sharing policies. Notably, Plan S—launched in 2018 by European funders—accelerated the push toward immediate open access, though chemistry publishers were slower to adapt than biological/biomedical publishers. Also relevant to J. Med. Chem. specifically, many pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions began implementing policies requiring authors to retain rights to share their work. However, practical barriers to implementing ideal sharing mechanisms persisted for years. The pandemic period (2020-2021) accelerated some open-access adoption as scientists urgently needed to share research, though this affected medical/biomedical literature more dramatically than chemistry specifically. By the 2020s, many chemistry journals offered clearer "green open access" policies allowing post-print sharing.

The challenge Apodaca faced—that policies existed but were difficult to discover and implement—reflected a broader issue in academic publishing where stated policies often diverged from practical user experience. This gap between policy and practice persisted in various forms across publishers throughout the subsequent decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There were no explicit predictions made in this article.

The article serves as observational commentary rather than forward-looking analysis, documenting a specific practical problem rather than forecasting industry trends.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While this article touches on important issues about scientific communication and publisher practices, it addresses a relatively narrow technical problem rather than broader biotechnology innovation or pharmaceutical development. Its interest is mainly for specialists concerned with academic publishing logistics and author rights management, rather than fundamental advances or challenges in biotechnology.
