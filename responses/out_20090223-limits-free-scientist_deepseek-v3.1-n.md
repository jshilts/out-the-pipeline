# The Limits of Free Scientist Chow?
# 23 Feb 2009

## 1. SUMMARY

This short anecdotal piece by Derek Lowe reflects on scientists' willingness to eat unattributed food left in common areas like coffee rooms. Lowe recounts John Bohannon's experiment where party guests ranked patés, including dog food (which came last but wasn't reliably identified), and then shares a workplace story where chocolate-flavored hamster treats were placed by a coffee machine and promptly disappeared. The piece uses these examples to humorously illustrate that scientists will eat almost anything when it's freely available in shared spaces.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a personal blog-style commentary rather than a formal scientific publication or industry analysis piece. Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" column is known for informal, often humorous reflections on scientific culture alongside more serious pharmaceutical industry commentary. 

The article itself doesn't actually discuss the biotechnology industry despite the user's prompt template suggesting it does. It appears to be an anecdotal piece about laboratory culture and eating habits rather than biotech industry developments. There are no biotech companies, drug candidates, clinical trials, or policy developments mentioned in the text. The reference to "a former company" is not specific and doesn't identify any particular biotech firm or research program.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about scientific developments, biotechnology industry trends, or future events. It's purely anecdotal commentary about past experiences.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This appears to be a misclassification - the article is a brief cultural anecdote about scientists eating habits, not a commentary about the biotechnology industry, making it largely irrelevant to the purported topic.
