# Retrospective Analysis: "Where The Hot Drugs Come From: Somewhere Else" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article by Derek Lowe examines a fundamental question about pharmaceutical innovation: where breakthrough drugs actually originate. The piece references analysis by Bruce Booth at LifeSciVC showing that approximately 75% of the "ten drugs that could transform the industry" (from a Goldman Sachs list) originated outside the companies that currently owned them, acquired either through licensing deals or corporate acquisitions.

The article advances the hypothesis that smaller companies and academic institutions may be more innovative than large pharmaceutical companies' internal R&D programs. While acknowledging the complexity of comparing organizational types, the piece suggests this external sourcing pattern might indicate superior innovation capacity in smaller, more agile organizations. The author notes that while the clinical failure rate for these inlicensed compounds likely remains high, it might be somewhat lower than the industry average of ~90% because external candidates have been vetted by multiple sets of eyes and required financial commitment from acquirers.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this article witnessed a remarkable acceleration of the trends it described. The pharmaceutical industry's reliance on external innovation sources intensified significantly between 2014-2024:

**Acquisition Activity Escalated**: Major acquisitions became increasingly common, with companies like AbbVie acquiring Pharmacyclics for $21 billion (2015), Pfizer acquiring Medivation for $14 billion (2016), and Bristol Myers Squibb acquiring Celgene for $74 billion (2019). These deals explicitly targeted externally developed pipelines.

**Biotech Investment Boom**: Venture capital funding for biotech surged, particularly during 2020-2021, as investors recognized that smaller companies were originating most breakthrough therapies. The success of mRNA vaccines from BioNTech and Moderna exemplified this trend perfectly—both companies leveraged external partnerships (Pfizer with BioNTech) or government collaboration (Moderna with NIH) to rapidly develop transformative medicines.

**Clinical Success Patterns**: Post-2014 data confirmed the article's core observation. A 2020 study in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* found that between 2006-2015, 63% of new molecular entities approved by the FDA originated from companies other than the marketing authorization holder, with small companies contributing disproportionately to first-in-class drugs.

**Platform Technology Emergence**: The trend extended beyond traditional drug discovery into platform technologies. Smaller companies like CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics, and Alnylam pioneered gene editing and RNA interference therapies, which larger companies later partnered to develop and commercialize.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions:**
- **External Sourcing Dominance**: The article's core thesis that external innovation would continue driving pharmaceutical pipelines proved remarkably prescient. The 75% external sourcing figure cited from 2014 became, if anything, an underestimate by 2024.
- **Small Company Innovation**: Smaller biotech companies did indeed continue to originate disproportionately more innovative therapies, particularly in emerging areas like gene therapy, cell therapy, and targeted oncology.
- **Deal-Making Importance**: The prediction that savvy business development would remain crucial was absolutely correct. The 2014-2024 period saw unprecedented M&A activity focused on acquiring external innovation.

**Incorrect or Incomplete Predictions:**
- **Failure Rate Assumptions**: The article suggested inlicensed compounds might have "a little bit better" failure rates due to multiple vetting processes. However, subsequent analysis showed this effect was modest at best. The fundamental 90% clinical failure rate remained stubbornly high across all sources.
- **"Transformational" Definition**: The definition of "transformational" evolved unpredictably. While the 2014 article focused on traditional drug categories, the truly transformational therapies of the subsequent decade—mRNA vaccines, CAR-T cell therapies, and gene therapies—represented completely different modalities than anticipated.

**Most Significant Prediction Miss**: The article didn't anticipate how platform technologies (mRNA, CRISPR, antibody-drug conjugates) would shift innovation patterns. While small companies did originate these platforms, the infrastructure requirements and specialized expertise needed meant larger companies actually played crucial roles in scaling and commercializing these breakthroughs in partnership with smaller innovators.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 7/9**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile for interest and long-term importance. It successfully identified and articulated a structural trend that would define pharmaceutical innovation for at least a decade. The piece demonstrated genuine insight into the industry's innovation ecosystem, moving beyond surface-level observations to capture an important dynamic that would only intensify.

What elevates its interest score is how the external innovation thesis became even more relevant post-2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic showcased the power of biotech-pharma partnerships. The mRNA vaccine development—arguably the most important pharmaceutical breakthrough of the century—represented the ultimate validation of this article's hypothesis: small, specialized companies (BioNTech, Moderna) originated transformative technology, while large companies (Pfizer) provided the capital, manufacturing, and distribution infrastructure.

The article's lasting relevance lies in capturing a fundamental truth about innovation economics in pharmaceuticals: the high costs, long timelines, and specialized knowledge requirements create natural advantages for smaller, focused organizations in early-stage innovation, while larger companies excel at development, manufacturing, and commercialization. This structural reality has only become more pronounced over time.

Where the article falls short of the highest interest tier is in its limited exploration of the underlying mechanisms (regulatory pathways, reimbursement systems, scientific specialization trends) that drive this dynamic. However, for a brief commentary piece, it demonstrated remarkable prescience about an important industry trend.
