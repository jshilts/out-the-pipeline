# How to Know When a New Target is Really a New Target (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary analyzes the Nature Reviews Cancer article "Common Pitfalls in Preclinical Cancer Target Validation," highlighting the alarming rate of non-reproducible or non-robust findings in cancer drug target research and providing guidelines to distinguish real targets from false positives. 

The article makes a crucial distinction between reproducibility (getting the same result when repeating the exact same experiment) and robustness (getting the same result under varied conditions). Many cancer target discovery papers fail on robustness - their findings are too sensitive to minor experimental variations to support drug development. The paper emphasizes rigorous thinking about causation versus correlation, particularly the distinction between necessity (A is required for B) and sufficiency (A guarantees B). It argues that target validation requires multiple complementary lines of evidence, including rescue experiments with drug-resistant target variants to confirm mechanism. The commentary also stresses the importance of negative controls and proper attention to off-target effects, especially when measuring "down" phenotypes like decreased proliferation that could reflect non-specific toxicity rather than target-specific effects.

## 2. HISTORY
The reproducibility and robustness problems identified in target validation have persisted and become more widely acknowledged in cancer research:

**Increased Recognition of Reproducibility Crisis**: By the late 2010s, the broader scientific community had largely acknowledged the reproducibility issues the article highlighted. Several initiatives emerged to address these concerns, including improved standards for preclinical research, better statistical practices, and calls for more rigorous validation before clinical development.

**Rescue Experiments and Orthogonal Validation Become Standard**: The rescue experiment approach described in the article - where drug-resistant target variants are shown to confer resistance to cell lines - has become a standard validation strategy. Similarly, the use of orthogonal approaches (CRISPR, RNAi, small molecules) to validate targets has become more widespread.

**Clinical Translation Challenges Remained**: The gap between preclinical target identification and successful drug development remained substantial. The article's caution that most targets wouldn't translate to effective drugs proved accurate. However, the principles outlined for rigorous validation have helped improve success rates for targets that do enter clinical development.

**Broader Adoption of Systematic Approaches**: Target validation evolved toward more systematic, multi-parameter approaches that align with the article's emphasis on robustness and multiple lines of evidence, though publication bias toward positive results remained a challenge.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's implicit predictions and recommendations aligned well with subsequent developments:

- **Prediction that most cancer targets would not translate to effective drugs**: This proved accurate - the vast majority of targets that enter preclinical development still fail to produce approved drugs, confirming the need for rigorous validation.
  
- **Prediction that rescue experiments would become important validation tools**: This became standard practice in the field, with many organizations adopting these approaches for target validation.

- **Prediction that distinguishing necessity from sufficiency would remain critical**: This framework continued to be essential for understanding tumor biology and designing effective interventions. Many targeted therapies succeeded when targeting necessary pathways but failed when targeting factors that were merely associated with disease.

- **Prediction that robustness would be more important than reproducibility alone**: This insight became widely accepted in drug discovery, leading to emphasis on validation across different conditions, cell lines, and experimental systems before committing significant resources.

Overall, the article's diagnostic framework for evaluating targets proved prescient and has been broadly validated by subsequent experience in cancer drug development.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article addresses fundamental challenges in pharmaceutical research that remain highly relevant. Its framework for distinguishing robust from non-robust findings provides practical guidance that applies beyond cancer research. While focused on methodology rather than specific therapeutic breakthroughs, it addresses issues central to improving drug development success rates.
