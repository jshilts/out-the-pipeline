# Top Chemical Publications of 2013 (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog (hosted by Science magazine) serves as a curation post highlighting notable chemistry research papers from 2013. The article references and links to an external list compiled by "Organic Solution" blog that selected the top 10 chemistry papers of that year. Lowe indicates that while some papers from this list would overlap with his own selections, he acknowledges that different researchers would have varying picks. The post functions primarily as a discovery mechanism, inviting readers to submit alternative suggestions for chemistry papers that stood out in 2013.

## 2. HISTORY
This particular post represents a snapshot of chemistry research trends from 2013, a year that saw significant developments in areas like organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and methodology development. The blog itself, "In the Pipeline," has continued as one of the most widely-read chemistry and pharmaceutical industry blogs, with Derek Lowe maintaining his position as a respected commentator on drug discovery and chemical research. 

However, this specific 2013 year-in-review post had limited long-term impact beyond its immediate time context. Year-end retrospective lists are inherently ephemeral content, and the linked "Organic Solution" blog appears to no longer be actively maintained. The post did not lead to policy changes, commercial developments, or sustained scientific discussion about those particular 2013 papers. While the broader blog continues to influence scientific communication and industry discourse, this specific curation post served its purpose primarily as timely content aggregation for that period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself contained no explicit predictions about future developments in chemistry or biotechnology. It was purely retrospective in nature, focused on cataloging and highlighting notable research papers from the year 2013. As a year-end review post, it made no claims about future research directions, breakthrough applications, or emerging trends that might develop from the highlighted work.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

This is primarily a time-limited curation post with minimal lasting significance beyond its immediate publication context. While the broader blog has long-term value, this specific entry represents routine year-end content aggregation with little enduring impact on research directions, commercial applications, or policy developments.
