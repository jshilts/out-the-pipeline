# Drugs At Home (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article critiques the burgeoning market of "designer drugs" sold online as "legal highs" from European chemical entrepreneurs. The post focuses on a Wall Street Journal profile of a businessman making psychoactive substances by making single-atom modifications to existing drug scaffolds, labeling them "Not For Human Consumption" to circumvent drug laws. The labs operate with custom equipment to avoid detection, and safety testing is conducted by the sellers themselves through informal human dosing "almost to overdose levels" to observe effects. The author expresses strong condemnation for this practice, citing the unknown neurological and health risks of untested CNS-active compounds distributed without medical oversight.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2010 article, these concerns proved prescient. The "synthetic cannabinoid" and "bath salts" crisis peaked around 2010-2015, with emergency department visits tied to synthetic drugs skyrocketing. The U.S. DEA used emergency scheduling powers to ban specific compounds, but manufacturers responded with minor structural modifications, creating an ongoing cat-and-mouse dynamic.

Several high-profile events validated the safety concerns: synthetic cannabinoids were linked to severe bleeding disorders in 2018 (contaminated with brodifacoum), and compounds like MDPV ("bath salts") were associated with violent, erratic behavior and deaths. The public health impact was significant—the CDC documented thousands of poisonings, and these substances contributed to the broader opioid crisis.

Regulatory responses evolved beyond reactive bans. The U.S. passed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act (2012), which banned entire drug classes through structural analog provisions. States implemented blanket bans on chemical classes rather than specific compounds. Similar legislation emerged in Europe under psychoactive substances controls.

Major dark web markets proliferated post-2010 until major law enforcement operations (like Silk Road takedowns). The chemical entrepreneurs described in the 2010 article essentially pioneered a model later adopted on a larger scale through online chemical suppliers catering to the research chemicals market—though many legitimate suppliers now enforce stricter verification.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Informal human safety testing would prove inadequate**: ✓ **Accurate**. Multiple deaths and severe health consequences were documented from unknown contaminants, dosing variability, and undisclosed synergistic effects in blended products.
- **"Not For Human Consumption" labeling for legal loopholes would persist**: ✓ **Accurate, but with caveats**. While the loophole remained effective temporarily, legal frameworks evolved to close this gap through analog scheduling. The cat-and-mouse game continued with new structural variants.
- **Single-atom modifications would effectively evade drug laws**: ✓ **Accurate in short term, evolved over time**. Initial enforcement focused on specific compounds, allowing rapid evasion through minor changes. However, broadened analog scheduling eventually made entire chemical families illegal, reducing the effectiveness of this strategy.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article captured a critical inflection point in drug policy and illicit chemistry, highlighting emerging public health threats from synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones that would dominate headlines for the next decade. Its concerns about unknown CNS drug risks proved highly relevant as documented poisonings and deaths validated the warnings.
