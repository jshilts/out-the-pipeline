# One Of Us Is Hallucinating (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses a misconception the author encountered during an online debate about pharmaceutical pricing. The central issue arose when another blogger (Prometheus 6) claimed that "most of the money spent was federal money" on drug development, arguing that pharmaceuticals derived from government-funded research should be in the public domain, with companies only entitled to process patents on manufacturing methods.

The author, writing from within the pharmaceutical industry, strongly disputes this narrative. He argues that while academic labs (often NIH-funded) discover biological pathways, enzymes, and fundamental mechanisms, they almost never discover actual drug compounds ready for clinical development. Industry bears the roughly $800 million cost (in 2004 dollars) and risk of discovering, developing, and bringing drugs to market—work that academic labs don't perform.

## 2. HISTORY

The debate reflected in this 2004 article touches on enduring tensions about pharmaceutical innovation, pricing, and the roles of public versus private R&D. In the two decades since publication, several concrete developments have occurred:

**Drug Development Costs Increased Dramatically:** The $800 million figure cited in 2004 has grown substantially. By the 2010s, estimates ranged from $1.3-2.8 billion per approved drug when accounting for failures and opportunity costs (DiMasi et al., various updates through 2016). This reinforced the industry argument about massive private investment requirements.

**Academic-Industry Partnerships Became More Structured:** Rather than the simple "NIH discovers, industry develops" caricature disputed in the article, the 2000s-2020s saw more formalized partnerships. Programs like NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS, established 2011) explicitly aimed to bridge the "valley of death" between academic discovery and drug development—acknowledging that academic labs typically don't produce clinical candidates.

**Bayh-Dole Act Remained Controversial but Intact:** The 1980 law allowing universities to patent federally-funded research continued to be debated, but remained the legal framework. No major legislative changes occurred to eliminate pharmaceutical patents on publicly-funded discoveries.

**Generic Drug Market Expanded:** The Hatch-Waxman framework continued allowing generic competition after patent expiration, providing some counterbalance to patent protection concerns.

However, **no fundamental policy shift occurred** toward putting government-funded discoveries into the public domain for pharmaceutical use, as Prometheus 6 advocated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article doesn't contain explicit forward-looking predictions, focusing instead on correcting what the author saw as factual misconceptions. However, the underlying debate implied competing visions:

- **Prometheus 6's implied prediction:** That pharmaceutical discoveries based on public funding should and would move toward public domain status with only process patents for companies (this did not happen at scale).

- **Author's implied prediction:** Industry would continue bearing most drug discovery costs and risks (this remained largely true through 2024).

**What actually happened:** The basic patent framework remained intact. While drug pricing debates intensified politically—with proposals like Medicare price negotiation gaining traction in the 2020s—the fundamental structure of pharmaceutical IP and the industry's role in drug discovery and development persisted largely as described by the article's author.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This 2004 piece captures a persistent misconception about pharmaceutical innovation that still surfaces in policy debates. While somewhat niche as a blog exchange, it addresses core questions about public versus private roles in drug development that remain relevant to healthcare policy discussions.
