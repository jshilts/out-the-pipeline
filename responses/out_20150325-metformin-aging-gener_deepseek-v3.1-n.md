# Metformin for Aging in General? (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses plans for a large clinical trial called TAME (Targeting/Taming Aging With Metformin) led by Dr. Barzilai to test whether metformin—a widely used, safe, and inexpensive diabetes drug—could delay or prevent chronic diseases of aging. The planned trial aimed to enroll over 1,000 elderly participants at multiple research centers over 5-7 years, with funding still being secured during the planning phase. The study sought to pioneer clinical approaches to treating aging as a condition, not just individual age-related diseases. The article also notes the FDA's perspective that aging isn't classified as a disease, though the agency indicated openness to reconsidering this stance. The broader context was growing recognition of healthy lifespan as a critical global health issue given changing population demographics.

## 2. HISTORY

The TAME trial faced significant funding challenges and delays after this 2015 article. The trial did not launch immediately as hoped and continued seeking financial support for years. Metformin research for aging continued through smaller observational studies and basic research, but the large definitive clinical trial envisioned in 2015 has not been completed as of 2024.

No drug has received FDA approval specifically for "aging" as an indication. The FDA has maintained its position that aging is not classified as a disease, though some progress occurred in recognizing aging-related biomarkers and research methodologies. Several metformin studies produced mixed results on various aging-related outcomes and mortality. The compound's broad metabolic effects remained an active area of investigation, but without a large definitive trial, clinical recommendations for metformin use in non-diabetic aging populations have not been established. The research landscape shifted toward better understanding aging mechanisms and multiple intervention pathways rather than focusing primarily on metformin.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction: TAME trial would launch successfully** - The trial did not launch as quickly as implied by the article's hopeful tone. It faced substantial delays and funding challenges.

• **Prediction: Metformin could delay/prevent chronic diseases of aging** - No definitive conclusion was reached due to lack of the large trial. Smaller studies showed inconsistent results across different aging-related outcomes.

• **Prediction: The trial could "pioneer ways of looking at aging in the clinic"** - Progress occurred in aging research methodology, though TAME itself did not become the definitive pioneering study due to lack of completion.

• **Prediction: FDA might "revisit thinking" on aging as disease** - The FDA has not fundamentally changed its position on aging as a disease indication, though aging biomarkers and research frameworks have advanced.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addressed a significant and growing health challenge with a pragmatic approach using an established drug, but the envisioned research program faced real-world barriers. The topic remains highly relevant to global health.
