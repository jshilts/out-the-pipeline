# Why This CRISPR Article, and Why Now? (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This January 2016 blog post from Science Magazine's Derek Lowe discusses the controversy surrounding Eric Lander's Cell article "The Heroes of CRISPR," published around the same time. Lander's piece attempts to recount the discovery history of CRISPR gene editing technology, but immediately drew criticism for its perceived bias toward Feng Zhang and the Broad Institute during an active patent dispute between the Broad Institute and researchers at UC Berkeley (Jennifer Doudna) and Emmanuelle Charpentier.

The article notes that Doudna publicly objected that Lander's description of her lab's research was "factually incorrect" and not verified with her before publication. Multiple scientists and commentators raised concerns about Cell publishing such a historical account without disclosing Lander's potential conflict of interest (since Zhang is at the Broad Institute where Lander worked), suggesting the article subtly downplayed Doudna and Charpentier's contributions. The piece captures the beginning of what became a significant scientific controversy about historical credit allocation during ongoing patent litigation.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments proved this controversy was just beginning:

**Patent Litigation:** The USPTO patent interference case continued until 2017, with the Broad Institute ultimately prevailing in maintaining their patents for using CRISPR in eukaryotic cells, while Berkeley retained rights for CRISPR applications in any cell type. However, in 2022, the USPTO ruled that the Broad Institute's patents were invalid due to insufficient disclosure, sending the case to appeals courts.

**Scientific Recognition:** In 2020, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for CRISPR gene editing - without Feng Zhang. This was widely seen as validation of their foundational contributions to the technology.

**Commercial Developments:** Multiple companies emerged from this technology. Doudna co-founded Caribou Biosciences (founded 2011) and Intellia Therapeutics (founded 2014), while Zhang co-founded Editas Medicine (founded 2013). All three became significant publicly-traded companies pursuing CRISPR-based therapies. The first CRISPR-based therapy, Casgevy, received FDA approval in December 2023 for treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.

**Wider Adoption:** CRISPR technology became widely adopted across academic research, with thousands of labs using it for gene editing by the late 2010s, though the commercial landscape remained complex due to overlapping patent claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit predictions, but some implicit tensions were revealed:

• **Implicit concern about conflict of interest:** The suggestion that Cell should have disclosed Lander's institutional affiliation proved prescient, as this became a major point of criticism in the scientific community
• **Patent dispute significance:** The ongoing USPTO proceedings were recognized as important, and indeed they continued for years with significant commercial implications
• **Importance of proper historical credit:** The controversy highlighted how high the stakes were - in retrospect, this was absolutely correct given the Nobel Prize and billion-dollar commercial implications

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in scientific controversy that had major implications for credit allocation, patent rights, and commercial development of a transformative technology. While discussing a historical dispute, it proved relevant to understanding how CRISPR's story unfolded over the following decade.
