# Some Sales Force (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 article examines Insys Therapeutics and its aggressive sales tactics for Subsys, a sublingual fentanyl spray. The piece highlights that Insys's sales force differed markedly from industry norms: sales reps often lacked pharmaceutical experience or college science coursework, and the company reportedly prioritized hiring attractive women. Examples include a regional sales head who previously installed aquariums and ran a ticket sales agency with regulatory issues, and a Western sales head who previously worked in adult entertainment. The article notes ongoing investigations into off-label promotion and physician kickbacks, while situating these practices within the broader context of opioid market challenges—legitimate unmet pain needs versus addiction risks and diversion.

## 2. HISTORY
The years following this article saw dramatic consequences for Insys Therapeutics. Federal investigations culminated in **widespread criminal convictions**: in 2019, founder John Kapoor and multiple executives were convicted of racketeering conspiracy for bribing doctors to prescribe Subsys inappropriately (including for non-cancer pain, which was off-label). The scheme involved sham speaker programs and direct kickbacks.

The company faced **massive legal liabilities**: Insys paid over **$225 million in settlements** with the DOJ and states, filed for **bankruptcy in June 2019**, and ultimately **ceased operations**. Subsys prescriptions plummeted as prescriber scrutiny intensified.

The Insys case became a **watershed moment in opioid litigation**, contributing to increased federal prosecution of pharmaceutical companies for illicit marketing practices and influencing the broader wave of opioid-related lawsuits that resulted in multi-billion dollar settlements across the industry (Purdue Pharma, McKinsey, distributors). The case also accelerated regulatory tightening around opioid marketing and prescribing protocols, including enhanced REMS programs and prescriber monitoring requirements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions and observations that proved prescient:

• **"The reputation of, and the prospects for, the drug industry as a whole decrease"** - This accurately foreshadowed the massive reputational and financial damage the pharmaceutical industry suffered during the opioid crisis. Major companies faced bankruptcy, multi-billion dollar settlements, and lasting public distrust that extended well beyond opioids to pharmaceutical marketing practices generally.

• **The "regulatory tangle" in pain management** - This proved correct as the FDA implemented increasingly stringent opioid regulations, REMS programs became more restrictive, and states enacted prescription monitoring laws and prescribing limits that fundamentally changed pain management practices.

• **The characterization of Insys practices as "extremely aggressive" and legally problematic** - This was validated when federal prosecutors secured racketeering convictions, confirming the systematic criminal nature of the marketing practices described in the article.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience in identifying systematic problems at Insys that would only become fully apparent through later criminal prosecutions and industry-wide opioid litigation. It captured a microcosm of broader pharmaceutical industry excesses at precisely the moment when regulatory scrutiny was about to intensify dramatically.
