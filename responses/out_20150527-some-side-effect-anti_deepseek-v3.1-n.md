# Brodalumab and the IL-17 Side Effect Surprise (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes how Amgen abruptly terminated development of brodalumab, an antibody targeting the IL-17 receptor for treating psoriasis. Despite promising clinical results announced in November 2014, Amgen dropped the program due to reports of suicidal ideation and behavior among trial participants. This was surprising because antibody drugs typically don't cause CNS-related side effects, as they generally cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The author speculates this could represent either unusual CNS penetration or some unknown peripheral-to-brain signaling mechanism, noting it was particularly unfortunate timing given AstraZeneca's recent use of this pipeline asset in their defense against Pfizer's takeover attempt.

## 2. HISTORY

After Amgen's withdrawal, the story took an interesting turn. **AstraZeneca did not abandon brodalumab entirely** - they partnered with Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2015 to continue development. The drug eventually gained **FDA approval in February 2017** under the brand name Siliq, specifically for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who failed other systemic therapies.

**The approval came with significant safety restrictions**: Siliq carries a black box warning for suicidal ideation and behavior, and its prescribing is limited through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. This means only certified healthcare providers can prescribe it, and patients must be counseled about suicide risk.

**Real-world uptake has been limited** compared to other IL-17 inhibitors. While Siliq demonstrated efficacy, the safety concerns and REMS requirements have constrained its market position. Competing IL-17 inhibitors like secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz), which did not show the same psychiatric safety signals, captured much larger market share.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The "restrictive labeling" prediction proved accurate**: The article anticipated that labeling requirements would limit the patient population. This materialized as the black box warning and REMS restrictions that significantly constrain prescribing patterns.

• **The scientific mechanism mystery remains largely unresolved**: The article questioned how an antibody could cause CNS effects. Subsequent research has explored IL-17's roles in neuroinflammation, but the precise mechanism linking IL-17 receptor blockade to suicidal ideation remains unclear - it may involve peripheral cytokine effects on the CNS, but definitive mechanistic understanding is still lacking.

• **The broader IL-17 therapeutic pathway succeeded despite brodalumab's issues**: While the article focused on this setback, the IL-17 pathway proved viable for psoriasis treatment. Other IL-17 inhibitors achieved blockbuster status, validating the target while highlighting that specific molecular characteristics matter enormously for safety profiles.

• **"Hideous bad luck" characterization was apt**: The specific safety signal in brodalumab did not generalize to the mechanistic class, suggesting molecular-specific rather than target-specific issues.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This retrospective maintains relevance because it illustrates critical lessons about drug development: unexpected toxicity can emerge even with generally safe modalities like antibodies, and the same mechanistic class can have vastly different safety profiles depending on molecular characteristics and target biology.
