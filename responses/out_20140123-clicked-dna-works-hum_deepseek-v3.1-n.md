# Clicked-DNA Works In Human Cells (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses breakthrough research from Ali Tavassoli's lab at the University of Southampton demonstrating that artificial "click" DNA analogs can function in human cells. These modified DNA strands contain non-natural chemical linkers (specifically triazole linkages from copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition) instead of the natural phosphodiester backbone, yet remain transcriptionally active. The key finding was that human RNA polymerase II could correctly transcribe genetic information from these chemically-modified DNA templates in human cells, successfully producing functional proteins like mCherry fluorescent markers. The discovery challenged long-standing assumptions that the natural phosphodiester backbone was essential for DNA biocompatibility and opened possibilities for using purely chemical reactions instead of enzymatic ligation for gene synthesis.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2014 article, research on artificial nucleic acid backbone modifications has continued, though click-linked DNA has not achieved widespread clinical adoption or commercial success:

- **Continued Academic Research**: The field of xenonucleic acids (XNAs) expanded with various backbone modifications being explored, but most therapeutic applications focused on established antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and siRNA platforms with phosphorothioate or 2'-modifications rather than click linkages.

- **No Approved Therapeutics**: No FDA-approved drugs based on click-DNA or similar artificial backbone structures have reached the market as of 2024. The therapeutic space for nucleic acid analogs remained dominated by RNA-based technologies (mRNA vaccines, ASOs, siRNA) with more conventional modifications.

- **Methodological Progress**: Chemical gene synthesis has advanced significantly since 2014, but primarily through improved phosphoramidite chemistry and enzymatic methods rather than widespread adoption of click-DNA approaches for routine gene synthesis.

- **Limited Commercial Impact**: Companies specializing in gene synthesis (Twist Bioscience, IDT, etc.) continued using established enzymatic and traditional chemical synthesis methods, suggesting click-DNA did not achieve the practical transformation initially envisioned for replacing enzymatic ligation in commercial gene synthesis pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Replacing enzymatic ligation with highly efficient chemical reactions"**: While chemical gene synthesis has certainly advanced, enzymatic methods remain dominant in commercial gene synthesis. Click-DNA specifically did not widely replace enzymatic approaches in industrial applications.

- **"Opening up possibilities for alternative chemical reactions and linkers"**: Research did explore various artificial nucleic acid backbone modifications, but practical applications remained limited, with most therapeutic nucleic acid work focusing on established modification patterns rather than radical backbone replacements.

- **Question about "functional mRNAs"**: The broader field of artificial nucleic acids has advanced significantly (especially post-COVID mRNA vaccines), but this particular breakthrough with click-DNA backbones did not translate into commercial mRNA production methods.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
The research represented genuine scientific novelty in challenging fundamental assumptions about DNA structure, but had limited practical impact and did not lead to transformative applications in the decade following publication.
