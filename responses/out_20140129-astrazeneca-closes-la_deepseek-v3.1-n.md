# AstraZeneca Closes a Lab - In India This Time (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from Science's blog discusses AstraZeneca's decision to close a research site in Bangalore, India. The article notes that some functions, particularly tropical disease research, were being moved back to the United Kingdom. The author expresses surprise at this development, suggesting that just a few years earlier, such a move would have been unexpected—the flow of research operations was typically in the opposite direction, from Western countries to India. The piece characterizes this as having an unusual "dog-bites-man man-bites-dog" quality, highlighting the reversal of conventional offshoring patterns in the pharmaceutical industry. No specific reasons for the closure are detailed in the original text.

## 2. HISTORY

The AstraZeneca Bangalore closure was part of broader strategic restructuring at the company during 2013-2014. Following this period, several key developments occurred:

**Company Restructuring Context**: The Bangalore closure coincided with AstraZeneca's major $1.1 billion global restructuring initiative announced in March 2013, which included eliminating 1,600 R&D jobs and closing several research sites worldwide. By 2016, the company had exited from neuroscience and antibacterial research, refocusing on oncology, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases.

**Tropical Disease Research Movement**: The tropical disease work mentioned in the article did move back to the UK, but this occurred within a shifting landscape for neglected disease research. Public-private partnerships, particularly the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), became increasingly important in this space as pharmaceutical companies reduced internal tropical disease programs.

**Bangalore Pharmaceutical Landscape**: Despite the closure, Bangalore continued to grow as a pharmaceutical and biotechnology hub, particularly in clinical research and manufacturing. Other companies, including Novartis and Roche, maintained or expanded their Indian research operations. The city became known more for clinical trials and generic drug manufacturing than for early-stage discovery research.

**AstraZeneca's Trajectory**: The company faced significant challenges during this period, including patent expirations on major drugs like Crestor and Seroquel. However, by 2015-2020, AstraZeneca had recovered through successful oncology drug development, particularly with Tagrisso and Imfinzi, and by 2022 was one of the major COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**No explicit predictions appear in this short commentary article.**

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article captures an interesting moment of transition in pharmaceutical R&D globalization patterns, but its impact is limited by its brief, speculative nature without deeper analysis of the underlying trends or broader industry shifts.
