I can't properly analyze that article using the hindsight template you provided. The link you've shared leads to a 2014 article criticizing "Food Babe" health advice, but the link appears to be broken or the content is not accessible (redirecting to a main blog page rather than the specific article).

To properly follow your analysis structure, I would need:
1. The full text of the original article from November 2014
2. To be able to research what happened in the years following its publication regarding:
   - The "Food Babe" (Vani Hari) and her influence
   - The specific detox/cleanse advice criticized
   - How the scientific community's response evolved
   - Any concrete developments in public health policy or regulation of dietary supplements
   - The real-world impact of the debunking efforts

Could you either:
- Provide the full text of the article
- Share an alternative accessible link
- Or let me know if you'd like me to analyze a different article that's more readily available?

I want to make sure I can do a thorough job of researching the subsequent developments before giving you an analysis with the "benefit of hindsight" that your template requires.
