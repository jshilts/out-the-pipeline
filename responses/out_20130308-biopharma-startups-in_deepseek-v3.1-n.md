# Biopharma Startups in India and China - Do They Exist? (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary examines whether meaningful biopharma startup ecosystems truly exist in China and India, distinguishing between manufacturing/service operations and genuine innovative R&D ventures. The article cites a Nature Biotechnology study revealing that while these countries receive significant biopharma investment, the venture capital specifically supporting innovative startups remains remarkably small—approximately $1.7 billion total invested since 2000, which would equate to a single strong quarterly figure in the US market. China had approximately 70 of the 116 identified innovative firms, with India accounting for most of the remainder, and Brazil/South Africa being negligible. Notably, 90% of Chinese biotech startups focused on oncology. The analysis highlights structural challenges including the absence of established startup culture, limited experienced investors, and different academic research environments compared to Western hubs like Boston/Cambridge or the San Francisco Bay Area. The author cautions against government-mandated biotech development, citing the failed "Biovalley" initiative in Malaysia, and suggests these ecosystems need organic development rather than forced acceleration.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade proved this 2013 assessment overly pessimistic regarding the growth potential of biopharma innovation in China and particularly India. China's biopharma sector experienced dramatic transformation: venture capital investment surged dramatically post-2015, with Chinese biotech companies raising billions in Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchange listings. By 2018-2020, China had become the world's second-largest biopharma market, and innovative companies like BeiGene, Zai Lab, and Innovent Biologics emerged as globally competitive players with multiple approved therapies. CAR-T and PD-1 inhibitor development became particular strengths. India likewise developed a more robust biopharma innovation ecosystem, with companies like Biocon expanding beyond generics into innovative biologics, and startups like Aurobindo Pharma and Dr. Reddy's advancing novel drug candidates. The sector benefited from returning diaspora scientists and professionals with experience in global pharma companies. Clinical trial infrastructure significantly improved in both countries, and regulatory pathways became more streamlined. By 2021-2022, both countries had multiple homegrown COVID-19 vaccines (Covaxin in India, multiple candidates in China including Sinovac and Sinopharm), demonstrating unexpected innovation capacity that contradicted the article's skeptical tone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The amount of money going into new biopharma companies in these countries is still very tiny by industry standards"** - This assessment aged poorly. Both China and India experienced exponential growth in biopharma venture capital investment after 2015, with Chinese biotech startups alone raising billions annually by 2018-2021, far exceeding the article's modest cumulative $1.7 billion figure.

• **Implication that startup culture was insufficient for meaningful innovation** - The prediction that lack of startup culture would persist proved incorrect. Both countries successfully developed vibrant startup ecosystems, with China particularly excelling in areas like CAR-T therapy, gene editing, and biologics development.

• **Skepticism about organic ecosystem development** - Contrary to pessimistic expectations, both countries did organically develop sophisticated biotech ecosystems combining academic research, corporate partnerships, and entrepreneurial ventures without requiring the forced development approaches that failed in Malaysia's Biovalley.

• **Focus on oncology (90% in China)** - While oncology remained a major focus, subsequent developments showed broader therapeutic diversification, including immunology, rare diseases, and notably (though not biopharma in the traditional sense) rapid vaccine development during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article warrants moderate interest because, while it accurately captured the state of biopharma startups in emerging markets circa 2013, it significantly underestimated the transformation potential of these ecosystems. The piece serves as an important historical benchmark, but its predictions proved largely inaccurate regarding both the scale and speed of development in these regions over the subsequent decade.
