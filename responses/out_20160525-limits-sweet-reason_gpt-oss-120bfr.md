# The Limits of Sweet Reason (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The essay reflects on how scientific arguments often fail to change the minds of people whose positions are rooted in emotion, ideology, or misinformation. The author cites several recent flash‑points in biotechnology and public health to illustrate the point:

* **Jamison’s “pill‑spitting” machine** – a continuous‑flow synthesiser that can make small batches of a drug on demand. A media interview mis‑characterised it as a “patent‑busting” device that will let anyone print cheap medicines, prompting a wave of optimistic (but inaccurate) commentary on social media.  
* **Martin Shkreli’s congressional hearing** – the author notes that many lawmakers appeared clueless about patents, exclusivity, and the economics of drug pricing.  
* **Glyphosate controversy** – the author describes the entrenched, almost conspiratorial belief among some groups that glyphosate is the root of all health problems, and contrasts it with the scientific consensus that the issue is far more nuanced.  
* **Anti‑GMO sentiment** – citing a paper that shows opposition to genetically‑modified crops is driven by moral disgust rather than evidence, the author argues that reason alone will not sway this audience, though institutions like the Royal Society and major newspapers are trying to shift the narrative.

Overall, the piece argues that while a minority of influential voices can be persuaded by data, the majority of “anti‑science” camps are largely impervious to rational argument, and progress will be slow but inevitable.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Jamison flow‑chemistry platform  
* **Commercialisation** – The MIT Jamison group spun out a company called **Molecule** (originally “Molecule Therapeutics”) in 2017. By 2020 it had raised ~US$30 M and began offering on‑demand synthesis services to pharma and biotech firms. The service is used for rapid prototyping of drug candidates, not for mass‑producing cheap consumer pills.  
* **Patent landscape** – No evidence has emerged that the platform has “busted” patents. The chemistry is still subject to the same IP rules as any other synthetic route; the platform merely shortens the time to obtain a small batch for testing.  
* **Adoption** – Continuous‑flow chemistry has become a standard tool in medicinal chemistry labs worldwide, but adoption is limited to early‑stage research and small‑scale GMP manufacturing. Large‑scale commercial drug production still relies on traditional batch processes.  

### Martin Shkreli  
* **Legal outcome** – In August 2017 Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud and sentenced to seven years in federal prison. He was released in May 2022 after serving about five years.  
* **Post‑release activities** – After release he briefly worked as a consultant for a biotech venture capital firm and, in 2023, co‑founded **Maverick Therapeutics**, a startup focused on rare‑disease drug development. He has not returned to the public policy arena, and his earlier congressional testimony remains a footnote rather than a catalyst for reform.  
* **Policy impact** – The hearing did not lead to any substantive legislative change on drug pricing or exclusivity. The broader debate on drug pricing continues, with the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introducing limited Medicare price‑negotiation for certain drugs, but Shkreli’s episode is largely remembered as a media spectacle.  

### Glyphosate  
* **Regulatory status** – The U.S. EPA reaffirmed in 2020 that glyphosate “is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” The European Union renewed its approval in 2022 after a full risk assessment.  
* **Litigation** – Bayer (owner of Monsanto) settled U.S. lawsuits for up to **US$10.9 billion** (2020) and faced a **US$2.1 billion** verdict in 2023 that was upheld on appeal in 2024. The settlements have forced Bayer to invest heavily in product‑safety research and to launch a “glyphosate‑free” portfolio, but glyphosate remains widely used worldwide.  
* **Scientific consensus** – Meta‑analyses published in 2021‑2023 continue to find no convincing evidence of a causal link between glyphosate exposure and cancer in humans, though they acknowledge data gaps for long‑term low‑dose exposure. The controversy has shifted from pure scientific debate to legal and reputational battles.  

### GMO attitudes and policy  
* **Public opinion** – In the United States, Gallup polls show a gradual rise in acceptance of GMO foods from ~38 % in 2016 to ~48 % in 2024. In the EU, acceptance remains low (~20 % in 2024).  
* **Labeling law** – The **U.S. National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard** (passed in 2016) took effect in 2022, requiring QR‑code or text disclosures on GMO‑containing foods. The law has not dramatically altered consumer purchasing behaviour.  
* **Regulatory developments** – The EU’s “novel foods” framework was revised in 2021 to allow case‑by‑case assessment of gene‑edited crops, but most member states still apply precautionary restrictions. The United States, Japan, Brazil, and Canada have approved several CRISPR‑edited crops for commercial cultivation (e.g., soybean, tomato, and mushroom) as of 2023.  
* **Institutional influence** – The Royal Society’s 2016 call contributed to a modest increase in government‑funded research on gene‑editing, but the anti‑GMO lobby remains well‑organised, especially in Europe. The “quaint” anti‑GMO protests the author imagined have not disappeared, though they have become less visible in mainstream media.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 essay) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The Jamison “pill‑spitting” machine will “bust patents” and let anyone produce cheap drugs** | The technology is now a niche service for rapid prototyping; it has not undermined the pharmaceutical patent system. |
| **Anti‑GMO protests will look as quaint as Luddite water‑wheel looms** | Anti‑GMO activism persists, especially in Europe; acceptance has risen modestly in the U.S., but the movement is still influential and not a relic. |
| **Congressional hearing participants lacked basic understanding of drug‑pricing mechanisms** | The hearing was widely criticised for its lack of technical depth; no major policy changes resulted, confirming the author’s impression of limited expertise. |
| **Glyphosate controversy would remain a “conspiracy‑type” belief for a minority** | The debate has become a mix of scientific, legal, and corporate narratives; while a vocal minority still treats it as a conspiracy, large‑scale litigation and regulatory reviews have kept the issue in the mainstream. |
| **Reasonable, influential voices (Royal Society, major newspapers) can slowly shift public opinion** | The Royal Society’s statements and high‑profile editorials have contributed to incremental policy adjustments (e.g., EU gene‑editing guidelines), but public opinion change has been slow and uneven. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a thoughtful meta‑analysis of science communication challenges, anchored in concrete 2016 events that remain relevant. Its relevance is moderate because the specific examples (Jamison’s machine, Shkreli, glyphosate, GMO debates) have each followed distinct trajectories that illustrate the author’s broader point without being groundbreaking in themselves.
