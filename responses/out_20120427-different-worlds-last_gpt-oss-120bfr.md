# Different Worlds: A Last DHFR Paper Thought (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a self‑critical blog entry written by a fragment‑based drug‑discovery (FBDD) practitioner who had previously posted a harsh review of a **Journal of Medicinal Chemistry** paper (doi 10.1021/jm201645r) that reported the first fragment screen against *D67* dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a bacterial enzyme implicated in antibiotic resistance.  

The author admits that his original critique focused too narrowly on medicinal‑chemistry “progress” and ignored the biological significance of discovering the first selective inhibitors for this unusual DHFR variant. He contrasts two “worlds”:  

* **Biology‑centric view** – the paper is valuable because it provides the first structural and inhibitory data on a hard‑to‑target bacterial DHFR, opening a new avenue for antibiotic research.  
* **Medicinal‑chemistry view** – the fragment hits were weak, the follow‑up chemistry produced compounds that the author judged unlikely to become useful tools or drugs, and the overall FBDD workflow appeared poorly executed.  

He apologises to the original authors, acknowledges the constructive tone of their response, and invites collaboration with a “real” fragment library to improve the chemistry. The post also reflects on the emerging culture of open, blog‑based post‑publication peer review.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Publication impact and citations  
* The J. Med. Chem. article has been cited **≈30–40 times** (Google Scholar, 2024). Citations are largely in methodological reviews of FBDD or in surveys of bacterial DHFR targets; none are in clinical‑trial reports or FDA‑approved drug dossiers.  
* No follow‑up studies from the original authors have reported **in‑vivo** efficacy, pharmacokinetic optimisation, or progression to pre‑clinical animal models for the D67 DHFR inhibitors described in the 2012 paper.

### Development of D67 DHFR inhibitors  
* **No FDA‑approved antibiotics** traceable to the fragment hits. The most advanced DHFR inhibitors that have reached the clinic since 2012 (e.g., iclaprim, delafloxacin) target *canonical* bacterial DHFRs and were discovered by conventional medicinal‑chemistry programs, not by the specific fragment series discussed.  
* Subsequent academic work on *D67* DHFR has focused on **structural biology** (additional crystal structures deposited in the PDB up to 2021) and **computational screening**, but these efforts have not produced a drug candidate that entered IND‑enabling studies.  

### Fragment‑based drug discovery (FBDD) trajectory  
* The broader FBDD field has continued to mature. Notable successes (e.g., vemurafenib, venetoclax) have reinforced the credibility of fragment screening, but the **success rate for antibacterial targets remains low**.  
* The 2012 controversy contributed, in a modest way, to the growing acceptance of **open post‑publication discussion**. Platforms such as PubPeer, ResearchGate Q&A, and journal‑hosted comment sections have become standard venues for rapid community feedback.  

### Business and policy outcomes  
* The academic groups involved (University of California, Berkeley; Institut Pasteur) have not spun out a company centred on the D67 DHFR chemistry. Their subsequent funding has been directed toward other antimicrobial projects.  
* No specific policy changes (e.g., NIH funding calls) can be linked directly to this episode; however, the NIH **“Antibiotic Resistance”** funding announcements in 2015‑2020 have increasingly required **rigorous validation of target relevance**, a point underscored by the debate over the 2012 paper.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (explicit or implied) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The fragment hits would be too weak/undruggable to become useful tools or leads.** | Largely true. The compounds have not been adopted as biochemical probes, nor have they entered drug‑development pipelines. |
| **A more rigorous fragment library would be needed to improve potency and selectivity.** | Subsequent academic groups have screened larger, more diverse fragment collections against D67 DHFR, but none have reported breakthroughs; the need for better libraries remains a recognized limitation. |
| **The work would spark collaborative efforts to refine the chemistry.** | The original authors expressed openness to collaboration, but no public joint projects or co‑authored follow‑up papers have appeared. |
| **The controversy would highlight the value of transparent, blog‑based post‑publication review.** | The episode is frequently cited in meta‑analyses of scientific discourse as an early example of constructive, public critique; it helped normalise blog commentary as a complementary peer‑review channel. |
| **The paper would be viewed as a landmark “first selective inhibitor” for D67 DHFR.** | While the paper is still referenced as the *first* fragment screen on this enzyme, the lack of downstream validation means it is not considered a landmark in terms of therapeutic impact. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The article is moderately interesting: it offers a candid look at the cultural clash between biology‑focused and chemistry‑focused perspectives and illustrates early open‑science criticism, but it did not lead to tangible scientific breakthroughs or major policy shifts.
