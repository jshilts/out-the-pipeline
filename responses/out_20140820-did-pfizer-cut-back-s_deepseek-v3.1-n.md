# Did Pfizer Cut Back Some of Its Best Compounds? (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 commentary examines Pfizer's oncology research and development decisions through the lens of former Pfizer R&D head John LaMattina, highlighting how years of mergers and severe budget cuts forced the company to make difficult portfolio choices under uncertainty. The article focuses on three specific compounds that Pfizer divested or deprioritized: tremelimumab (outlicensed to AstraZeneca), neratinib (to Puma Biotechnology), and palbociclib (shelved internally for several years). The piece argues that these decisions appeared "retrospectively awful" given the compounds' subsequent performance, but were defensible at the time given the inherent uncertainty in oncology drug development. The core critique is that Pfizer's merger-driven strategy—particularly the acquisition of Wyeth—resulted in R&D budget reductions that hindered the company's ability to develop its full portfolio, creating a pattern where the post-merger organization was smaller than the pre-merger components.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade largely vindicated the article's concerns about Pfizer's divested compounds:

**Tremelimumab**: AstraZeneca continued development, ultimately gaining FDA approval in 2022 for hepatocellular carcinoma (in combination with durvalumab). The drug became part of AstraZeneca's immunotherapy portfolio, though its clinical adoption has been more limited compared to other checkpoint inhibitors. The compound did achieve regulatory success, but not as a blockbuster.

**Neratinib**: Puma Biotechnology successfully developed the drug, receiving FDA approval in 2017 for extended adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Despite approval, commercial uptake was modest due to toxicity concerns and competition from other HER2-targeted therapies. The drug generated revenue but fell short of initial expectations.

**Palbociclib**: Perhaps the most significant validation of the article's thesis: Pfizer eventually resumed development, and palbociclib (Ibrance) received FDA approval in 2015 for HR+/HER2- breast cancer. It became a blockbuster drug, generating billions in annual revenue and establishing the CDK4/6 inhibitor class as a standard of care. The several-year delay documented in the 2014 article represented a substantial opportunity cost.

**Pfizer's broader oncology trajectory**: In the years following 2014, Pfizer maintained a substantial oncology presence but underwent significant portfolio changes, including divesting older products and acquiring companies like Array BioPharma (2019) and Trillium Therapeutics (2021) to bolster its pipeline. The company's oncology revenue grew substantially, particularly driven by Ibrance, but the pattern of portfolio optimization and outlicensing decisions continued.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction that outlicensed compounds would succeed**: The article's framing suggested tremelimumab and neratinib were "best compounds" that Pfizer wrongly abandoned. This proved partially accurate—both achieved FDA approval, validating their scientific promise, though commercial success was more mixed than implied.
- **Concern about merger-driven R&D disruption**: The article's skepticism about ongoing consolidation's impact on research focus was prescient. The pharmaceutical industry continued its consolidation trend, and subsequent analyses confirmed that post-merger integration frequently disrupts R&D productivity and internal compound development.
- **Palbociclib's potential**: While not explicitly predicting success, the article's characterization of palbociclib as "one of their better compounds" that was unjustly shelved proved accurate. The drug's eventual blockbuster status validated the assessment that Pfizer's portfolio decisions, driven by budget constraints rather than solely scientific merit, had substantial consequences.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

The article demonstrates remarkable foresight about specific drug development outcomes and accurately diagnoses systemic issues in pharmaceutical R&D decision-making under financial pressure. Its detailed tracking of compounds that later achieved regulatory approval makes it valuable for understanding the consequences of portfolio prioritization in oncology drug development.
