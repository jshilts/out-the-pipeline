# That Same Sort of Job (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article draws a parallel between managing journalists and managing scientists/researchers, quoting Megan McArdle's commentary on the unique challenges of media management. The author suggests that the same difficulties apply to scientific research management: tension between reputation-building and monetization, difficulty getting creative work on demand, need for researcher autonomy, the fact that great scientists are often poor managers, simultaneous need for speed and accuracy, and personality traits that resist close management. The piece argues that experience managing other types of organizations provides little insight into managing either media companies or research organizations.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2014, the comparison between managing creative/knowledge work and traditional management has become more prominent in biotech and pharma. The industry has struggled with productivity challenges, often termed the "Eroom's Law" phenomenon (Moore's Law in reverse), where drug development costs have continued rising despite technological advances. 

Several developments underscore these management challenges:

- **Translational research failures**: Despite increased R&D spending, the pharmaceutical industry has faced declining productivity, with approximately 90% of drugs still failing in clinical trials between 2014-2024. This suggests that simply increasing resources doesn't solve fundamental research management challenges.

- **Management evolution in biotech**: Large pharma companies have increasingly outsourced early-stage research to smaller, more agile biotech companies, partly recognizing that different management structures work better for discovery research versus development and commercialization.

- **Cultural clashes**: Numerous high-profile biotech/pharma partnerships have failed due to cultural mismatches, where traditional corporate management approaches conflicted with research culture needs.

- **AI/automation integration**: The biotech industry has increasingly integrated AI and automation tools, but this has created new management challenges around balancing researcher autonomy with data-driven standardization.

The core tension McArdle identified—between the need for researcher autonomy and the pressure for measurable, monetizable outcomes—has remained a central challenge in biotech management.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article does not contain explicit predictions about the future. It was a commentary drawing parallels between two management domains rather than forecasting specific outcomes. The implicit suggestion that research management would continue presenting unique challenges has proven accurate, as evidenced by the ongoing productivity challenges in pharmaceutical R&D.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

The article identifies an important analogy but doesn't provide deep insights specific to biotech management, focusing more on the general comparison than actionable solutions or industry-specific analysis.
