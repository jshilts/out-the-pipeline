# Asking the Tough Questions: Doomsday in the Clinic (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post from Science magazine discusses a satirical research paper titled "The Mayan Doomsday's effect on survival outcomes in clinical trials" published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The article references the widespread speculation about the supposed Mayan "end of the world" prediction for December 2012, coinciding with the end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. The spoof paper humorously examines how an apocalyptic event would affect survival outcomes in clinical trials, complete with comparative survival curves showing results "with and without the destruction of all life factored in." The author notes the paper provides something useful for drug discovery and development professionals and speculates whether Bayesian trial designs could better handle such catastrophic scenarios.

## 2. HISTORY
The article references the broader "2012 phenomenon" - a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic events would occur around December 21, 2012, based on interpretations of the Mayan Long Count calendar. December 21, 2012 came and went without any apocalyptic events. The supposed doomsday prediction turned out to be a complete non-event, driven largely by pseudoscientific speculation and media hype rather than actual Mayan beliefs or credible astronomical predictions. The satirical paper itself served as a humorous commentary on the absurdity of the 2012 phenomenon, particularly highlighting how seriously scientific fields like clinical trial methodology were being contrasted with baseless doomsday predictions. The primary real-world consequence was the complete debunking of 2012 doomsday theories, demonstrating the importance of scientific critical thinking over popular pseudoscience.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction about December 2012**: The underlying cultural context assumed some form of cataclysmic event would occur around December 21, 2012 → **FALSE**: No apocalyptic events occurred; December 21, 2012 was an ordinary day like any other

• **Survival outcomes being affected**: The satirical paper assumed human extinction would impact clinical trial results → **N/A**: Since no doomsday occurred, this remained purely as mathematical humor

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

This article has moderate historical interest as a time capsule of the 2012 doomsday phenomenon, which was a significant cultural moment but ultimately based on pseudoscience and media sensationalism rather than actual scientific developments in biotechnology.
