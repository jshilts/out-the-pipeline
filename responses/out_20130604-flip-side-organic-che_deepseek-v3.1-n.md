# The Flip Side: Organic Chemistry That Should Be More Famous (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a short opinion piece by Derek Lowe discussing underutilized chemical reactions in organic chemistry. The author references a conversation started by Neil Withers about which chemical reactions researchers see too much of in the literature. The article flips this question to ask what underappreciated reactions deserve more attention. Lowe specifically mentions his interest in reactions that enable direct attachment of primary and secondary amines into unactivated alkyl C-H bonds, while acknowledging this might be impractical to wait for. The main focus is identifying "unsung chemistries" that have been reported but haven't received adequate follow-up research or adoption.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2013 article, the field of C-H functionalization, particularly C-H amination, experienced significant advancement and increased research attention throughout the 2010s. This area became one of the most active frontiers in organic synthesis. Methods for direct C-H to C-N bond formation have been developed using various catalytic systems including transition metal catalysts (palladium, rhodium, copper, iron), photoredox catalysis, and electrochemical approaches. While direct insertion of amines into unactivated alkyl C-H bonds remains challenging, numerous innovative strategies emerged. The pharmaceutical industry showed increased interest in these methods due to their potential to simplify synthetic routes to drug candidates by enabling late-stage functionalization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author was essentially predicting/wishing for broader development of direct C-H amination chemistry. While this prediction aligns with the general trajectory of the field, the specific challenge of direct insertion of amines into unactivated alkyl C-H bonds has proven more difficult than anticipated, with most successful methods requiring either activated substrates, directing groups, or producing different types of products than the direct insertion Lowe envisioned.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article touches on an important topic in synthetic chemistry methodology, it's a very brief blog post essentially posing a discussion question rather than providing substantive analysis or novel insights. The interest is quite specialized to synthetic organic chemists and lacks broader scientific or societal impact for a general biotechnology audience.
