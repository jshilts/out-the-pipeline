# Neurotrope: A Shameful PR Stunt (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a 2017 announcement by Neurotrope, a small company developing bryostatin-1 for Alzheimer's disease. The piece focuses on a promotional press release issued by the "Small Cap Investor Group" that made extraordinary claims about Neurotrope's Phase II trial results while demonstrating fundamental statistical errors. Key issues highlighted include: a **completely erroneous definition of p-values** (incorrectly claiming p<0.1 means "90% of patients are responding"), the use of **one-tailed p-values** (which inflate statistical significance by ignoring the possibility of failure), and **clinically meaningless efficacy**—the reported 2.6-point improvement on the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) scale was less than half the improvement seen with Aricept, an already-approved drug that doesn't slow disease progression. The article notes that Neurotrope later disavowed some of the most egregious promotional claims, though the promotional piece claimed to have spoken with the company's leadership.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2017 Phase II results controversy, Neurotrope's bryostatin-1 development faced **repeated failures**:

- **Subsequent clinical trials failed**: Neurotrope continued development with larger trials that did not meet their primary endpoints. The company sponsored additional Phase II studies that failed to demonstrate statistically significant effects.
- **Stock performance and delisting**: Neurotrope's stock (NTRP) experienced extreme volatility during the 2017 promotional campaign but ultimately declined substantially as clinical failures emerged. The company faced regulatory scrutiny and shareholder litigation related to promotional activities.
- **No FDA approval**: Bryostatin-1 for Alzheimer's disease has not received FDA approval, nor has it demonstrated convincing efficacy in later, properly designed trials.
- **Limited scientific validation**: The bryostatin mechanism did not emerge as a validated therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease. While protein kinase C (PKC) activation remains of theoretical interest in neurodegeneration, bryostatin specifically did not translate this into clinical success.
- **Company restructuring**: Neurotrope changed corporate focus and explored other assets, with bryostatin largely abandoned for Alzheimer's indications.

The episode became **a cautionary tale** in regulatory and scientific circles about statistical rigor, investor promotion in biotech, and the challenges of interpreting small Phase II signals—particularly in Alzheimer's disease, where the clinical development failure rate approaches 99%.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The May 2017 promotional materials and press releases contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **"Generation of statistically significant results that exceeded FDA standards"** → **FALSE**. The FDA never approved bryostatin-1 for Alzheimer's, and subsequent larger trials failed to meet statistical significance thresholds using proper two-tailed testing.
- **That bryostatin showed meaningful efficacy** → **FALSE**. The 2.6-point SIB improvement proved neither clinically meaningful nor reproducible in larger trials. The comparison to Aricept demonstrated this was minimal effect size.
- **That the mechanism represented breakthrough science** → **FALSE**. Bryostatin-1 did not emerge as a validated Alzheimer's therapeutic target. While PKC activation remains mechanistically interesting, bryostatin specifically failed to translate to clinical benefit.
- **That early Phase II "proof should be viewed with excitement"** → **FALSE**. The scientific and clinical communities appropriately remained skeptical, and the excitement proved unwarranted given subsequent trial failures.
- **Implicit prediction of successful drug development pathway** → **FALSE**. The drug candidate failed to advance successfully through the development pipeline.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article earns a high interest rating because it illustrates a recurring and important pattern in biotech: the gap between **statistical significance and clinical reality**, the importance of **proper statistical methodology**, and the **ethics of investor promotion** in drug development. The bryostatin case became a well-known cautionary tale about interpreting small Phase II signals—especially in Alzheimer's disease. That the author correctly called out flawed analysis that later proved predictive of ultimate failure demonstrates the value of rigorous scientific skepticism and statistical literacy in evaluating therapeutic claims.

The episode also highlights broader issues in biotech investment culture and the responsibilities of companies in managing promotional communications, making it educationally valuable for understanding how early-stage results can be misleadingly framed.
