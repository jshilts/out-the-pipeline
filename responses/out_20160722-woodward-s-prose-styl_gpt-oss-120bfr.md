# Woodward's Prose Style (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary reflects on the flamboyant writing style of Nobel‑winning organic chemist Robert B. Woodward. Using a passage from Woodward’s 1971 total synthesis of colchicine as an exemplar, the author argues that while Woodward’s prose is vivid—personifying an isothiazole protecting group—it is unnecessarily ornate for a technical journal. The piece likens the experience of reading such prose to “waiters twirling plates” rather than simply serving a well‑prepared dish, and suggests that clear, unadorned writing should be the norm for scientific reports. The author acknowledges Woodward’s scientific brilliance but treats his literary flair as a “bug, not a feature.”

## 2. HISTORY  
Since the article’s appearance, the discussion of Woodward’s writing has remained a niche topic within the chemistry community. The main developments are:

* **Continued admiration for Woodward’s science.** His landmark total syntheses (e.g., of quinine, vitamin B₁₂, and colchicine) are still taught in graduate curricula and cited in retrospectives, but the focus is on synthetic strategy rather than prose. No new “Woodward‑style” writing guidelines have emerged.  

* **Broader movement toward clearer scientific communication.** Over the past decade, major funding agencies (NIH, NSF, European Commission) and journals have issued style guides emphasizing conciseness and readability. These initiatives are driven by reproducibility concerns and the need for interdisciplinary accessibility, not by Woodward’s legacy.  

* **Limited impact on protecting‑group chemistry.** The isothiazole protecting group highlighted in the quoted passage never became a mainstream tool. Modern synthetic practice favors more robust, orthogonal groups (e.g., Boc, Fmoc, Alloc). Consequently, the specific chemical example discussed in the 2016 post has not influenced current methodology.  

* **Cultural references.** The blog post and the linked “Wavefunction” article are still occasionally shared on chemistry forums as light‑hearted commentary on scientific writing. No scholarly papers have been published that treat Woodward’s prose as a subject of systematic study.  

Overall, the article contributed to a modest, informal conversation about style but did not trigger concrete changes in publishing standards, curriculum design, or laboratory practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The 2016 piece does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Woodward’s ornate prose will be increasingly criticized and perhaps lead to stricter journal style policies.** | Journals have indeed tightened style guidelines, but the drivers are broader (reproducibility, open‑science mandates). No policy can be traced to criticism of Woodward’s writing. |
| **The isothiazole protecting group will gain wider adoption because of its “graceful” performance.** | The group remains a historical footnote; contemporary synthetic routes rarely employ isothiazoles as protecting groups. |

Both implied outcomes proved either unsubstantiated or only tangentially realized.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The article is moderately interesting as a cultural footnote about a legendary chemist’s writing style, but it has had little lasting impact on scientific practice or policy.
