I don't have access to the actual New York Times and Slate articles from December 2004 that this commentary references. The provided text is a meta-commentary that links to two specific articles about FDA user fees, but it doesn't contain the substantive content of those articles.

**Missing Information Needed:**
- The actual New York Times article content about FDA user fees
- Jack Shafer's Slate piece analyzing the FDA user fee system
- The specific claims, predictions, or analysis contained in those articles

**What I can determine:**
- Date: December 8, 2004
- Topic: FDA user fees
- Format: Commentary referencing two other articles

**Without access to the original articles' content, I cannot provide:**
- Meaningful summary of what the articles actually claimed
- Analysis of subsequent developments related to those specific claims
- Evaluation of predictions made in those articles
- Accurate assessment of their long-term importance

To properly analyze this as requested, I would need either:
1. The full text of both referenced articles, or
2. More detailed information about what specific points those articles made about FDA user fees in 2004

Would you be able to provide the content of the New York Times and Slate articles that this commentary references?
