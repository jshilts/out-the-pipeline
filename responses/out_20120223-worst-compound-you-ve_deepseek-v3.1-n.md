# The Worst Compound You've Ever Drawn? (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post discusses Stuart Cantrill's challenge regarding massive dendrimer structures—highly branched, mandala-like molecules with enormous molecular weights. Cantrill claimed that drawing such a structure in ChemDraw would take under three hours only if you were a "wonder-worker." The post serves as a call to the chemistry community to share examples of the most complex chemical structures they've ever had to draw, positioning Cantrill's dendrimer as an exceptionally difficult benchmark to beat.

## 2. HISTORY

Dendrimers, the star molecules highlighted in this 2012 post, represent a class of highly branched, tree-like polymers that were actively researched in the early 2010s. 

**Scientific Development**: Following 2012, dendrimer research continued but did not lead to major therapeutic breakthroughs. While these structures showed theoretical promise for drug delivery due to their controllable size and surface functionality, practical applications remained limited. No FDA-approved drugs based on complex dendrimers emerged as blockbuster therapies, and the field saw more modest progress than initially hoped.

**Computational Tools**: ChemDraw and similar chemical drawing software evolved significantly after 2012. The challenge of drawing complex structures diminished as software improved automated structure generation and template libraries. Modern tools can now handle complex 3D structures and large macromolecules more efficiently than in 2012.

**Industry Impact**: Companies working with dendrimers, such as Dendron (founded in 1990s), did not achieve major commercial success in drug development. While some dendritic polymers found niche applications in materials science (coatings, adhesives), they did not transform pharmaceutical manufacturing or clinical practice as some early predictions suggested.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article implicitly suggested that complex dendrimer structures would remain challenging to work with both computationally and practically.

• **Outcome**: This largely proved accurate. While computational tools advanced, the fundamental complexity of synthesizing and characterizing large dendrimers persisted. The field found moderate success in materials science applications but failed to revolutionize drug delivery as some researchers had hoped.

• **Prediction**: The competitive nature of the "worst compound" challenge implied ongoing interest in pushing chemical complexity boundaries.

• **Outcome**: Scientific interest in complex macromolecules continued, but shifted toward more practical applications. Supramolecular chemistry and polymer science evolved to focus on functionality rather than sheer complexity.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article was primarily a lighthearted chemistry community discussion rather than substantive biotech industry commentary. While dendrimers had some relevance to biotechnology, the post itself was more about the technical challenges of chemical drawing software than biomedical developments. Most subsequent biotech advances in drug delivery utilized different approaches.
