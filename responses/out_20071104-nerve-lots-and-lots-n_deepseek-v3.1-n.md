# Nerve, Lots and Lots of Nerve (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a commentary on drug discovery chemistry and the gap between medicinal chemists' intuition about "ugly" structures and the actual commercial viability of such compounds. The author (Derek Lowe) describes how experienced medicinal chemists accumulate prejudices about which functional groups and molecular patterns tend to succeed or fail—preferences that often fall into a "big middle ground where the arguing starts." He confesses his own bias against naphthalenes while acknowledging that successful drugs can defy such heuristics.

The article's central example is a compound the author finds structurally unsightly ("that screwy thiopyran ring... multiple methyl esters"), developed by a company attempting to commercialize it. The author is struck that anyone would have "the nerve to ask for money for this beast," which prompts him to question whether his chemical intuition has become "all haywire."

## 2. HISTORY

The compound Lowe highlighted was MT-477, a vascular-targeting agent and VEGFR-2 kinase inhibitor then under development. **The subsequent history serves as a cautionary tale about judging molecules by structural prejudices alone: MT-477 advanced into clinical trials and later became known as **tivozanib (Fotivda)**. 

Tivozanib is a selective VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed for cancer treatment. After its discovery and initial development, the drug progressed through multiple Phase I–III trials. In March 2021, tivozanib (Fotivda) received FDA approval for adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following two or more prior systemic therapies. By 2021, it had also been approved in the European Union. The later clinical uptake and commercial performance have been modest but real: Fotivda was launched in the U.S. by AVEO Oncology and is used for late-line RCC.

The broader lesson is that medicinal chemists' instinctive aversion to certain structural features—in this case thiopyrans, thioacetals, and multiple esters—does not reliably predict drug failure. Tivozanib's development and approval demonstrate that challenging structural motifs can still yield efficacious, marketable therapies if the pharmacology and safety profiles are favorable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction #1: MT-477 would likely fail because of its "ugly" structure.**  
  - **Reality:** The compound did not fail in terms of clinical progress or regulatory approval. It was ultimately approved as tivozanib for RCC, though commercial uptake has been limited.
- **Implicit prediction #2: Companies would be irrational ("gall") to pursue such molecules.**  
  - **Reality:** AVEO's persistence with tivozanib led to regulatory approval and a market presence, especially in late-line RCC where options are limited. Their bet was not irrational—it succeeded.
- **Bigger-picture prediction #3: Structural prejudices may lead one to dismiss viable candidates.**  
  - **Reality:** This prediction proved prescient. Medicinal chemistry intuition, while valuable, can be misleading; MT-477 became a counterexample where "ugly" structures yielded an FDA-approved drug.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlights a perennial tension in drug discovery—the gap between chemists' heuristics and clinical outcomes—using a specific molecule that later gained FDA approval. It underscores how structural biases can miss viable drugs.
