# Retrospective Analysis: "An Open-Source Cancer Pitch, Deconstructed" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Isaac Yonemoto's crowdsourced "Project Marilyn" initiative that aimed to develop 9DS, a sibiromycin-derived cancer compound, as an "open-source" pharmaceutical. Yonemoto advocated for patent-free drug development, arguing this would make cancer treatments more affordable by drawing parallels to the software industry's open-source movement and citing the polio vaccine (Salk/Sabin) as historical precedent for non-patented medical breakthroughs.

The author, Derek Lowe, systematically deconstructs this premise as fundamentally misunderstanding drug development economics and reality. He argues that unpatented compounds won't become drugs because pharmaceutical companies won't invest hundreds of millions in clinical trials for compounds they don't own, especially given oncology's 90-95% clinical failure rates. Lowe emphasizes that mouse xenograft success (the project's goal) represents less than 1% of the total drug development pathway—a "roundoff error" compared to the massive costs of human trials, toxicology, formulation, and regulatory approval.

## 2. HISTORY

**Project Marilyn itself appears to have failed to achieve its stated goals or produce any meaningful clinical advancement.** Despite the 2014 crowdfunding campaign, there is no evidence that 9DS advanced beyond preliminary studies. A search of clinical trial databases, academic publications, and patent records reveals no subsequent development of 9DS as a therapeutic agent.

**The broader "open-source pharma" movement evolved but largely validated Lowe's skepticism.** While organizations like the Open Source Pharma Foundation and Medicines for Malaria Venture have attempted collaborative drug development models, their approach differs fundamentally from Yonemoto's pitch. They focus on repurposing existing drugs, targeting neglected diseases (malaria, tuberculosis), and leveraging institutional partnerships—not crowdsourcing novel compounds for competitive therapeutic areas like oncology.

**Ironically, cancer drug costs have escalated dramatically since 2014,** with prices now regularly exceeding $100,000-$200,000 annually per patient. The most transformative cancer therapies—CAR-T cells ($475,000+ per treatment), immunotherapies like Keytruda, and precision oncology drugs—command premium prices that reinforce rather than undermine the patent-subsidized R&D model.

**Open-source approaches in drug discovery have found limited, targeted success** in areas like:
- COVID-19 research (where patent pooling occurred under extraordinary circumstances)
- Repurposing generic compounds
- Rare/orphan disease research with smaller commercial markets

However, **no major oncology drug has emerged from open-source development**, and pharmaceutical patent strategies have become more sophisticated, not less restrictive.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Lowe's predictions were largely accurate:**

$\\textbf{Correct predictions:}$
- Unpatented compounds would not spontaneously become drugs through company investment (✓ validated)
- The complexity and cost of drug development dwarf early-stage research (✓ validated—FDA approval now averages $1-2 billion per drug)
- Open-source models wouldn't translate from software to pharmaceuticals (✓ largely accurate, with limited exceptions for specific disease areas)
- 9DS specifically wouldn't revolutionize cancer treatment (✓ correct—compound disappeared without advancing to clinic)

$\\textbf{Potentially underestimated:}$
- The persistence and evolution of open-source models in targeted domains (malaria, rare diseases, COVID-19)
- The growth of patient advocacy foundations funding research (though still not replacing commercial development)

$\\textbf{Yonemoto's mispredictions:}$
- That open-source could work for cancer drugs (✗ proven wrong)
- That pharmaceutical economics would adapt to patent-free models (✗ opposite occurred—patent strategies intensified)
- That preliminary xenograft data could catalyze clinical development (✗ proven insufficient repeatedly in industry)

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9** (70th-79th percentile)

This article ranks as interesting for several reasons:

- **Prescient economic analysis** that correctly anticipated the fundamental incompatibility between crowdsourced/open-source models and pharmaceutical reality, especially in oncology
- **Clear illustration of the "hype vs. reality" gap** in biotech, where well-intentioned but naive approaches founder on complex commercial and scientific constraints
- **Demonstrates the persistence of romantic narratives** (Salk/Sabin myth) in science despite contrary evidence
- **Timeless relevance** — the tension between open science and commercial drug development continues today, with COVID-19 adding new dimensions

The article is somewhat limited by being a response to a relatively obscure crowdfunding campaign rather than a major scientific development, but it serves as a valuable case study in technology transfer economics and the structural barriers to pharmaceutical innovation. The piece has enduring value as a reality check on utopian visions of scientific collaboration.

**What makes it particularly relevant today:** The conversation around drug pricing, patent reform, and alternative R&D models remains highly current, with similar proposals continuing to emerge despite the structural obstacles Lowe identified.
