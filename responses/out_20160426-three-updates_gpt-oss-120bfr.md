# Three Updates (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author revisits three biotech stories that were already “old news” in 2016.  

* **Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** – The company was trying to commercialise **Firdapse** (amifampridine) for Lambert‑Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). The FDA had issued a refusal‑to‑file (RTF) and demanded another Phase III trial plus additional toxicology work, casting doubt on Catalyst’s timeline and coordination with regulators.  

* **Lesinurad (Zurampic)** – AstraZeneca had bought Ardea Therapeutics in 2012 to obtain the gout drug lesinurad. Although the drug finally received FDA approval, AZ later sold the U.S. rights to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals for up‑to $265 million plus royalties, a modest return on the roughly $1 billion total investment.  

* **TGN1412** – The infamous CD28 super‑agonist that caused a catastrophic first‑in‑human trial in 2006. A 2015 piece suggested a “wildly unlikely” comeback, and a 2016 Guardian article recounted the harrowing experience of the trial participants and the clinician who ran the study.

The post therefore asks readers to consider how these stories have unfolded since the original reporting.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Catalyst Pharma – Firdapse  
* **FDA approval:** After resubmitting the NDA with the required additional data, the FDA approved Firdapse in **April 2018** for LEMS (adult and pediatric).  
* **Commercial launch & pricing:** The drug entered the U.S. market at a list price of roughly **$100 k–$150 k per patient per year**, sparking criticism and prompting the company to launch a patient‑assistance program.  
* **Business outcome:** Catalyst secured a **global partnership with Astellas** (outside the U.S.) in 2017 and was **acquired by Astellas Pharma for $2.1 billion in 2022**, indicating that the product ultimately became a valuable asset despite the early regulatory setback.  

### Lesinurad (Zurampic) – AstraZeneca / Ironwood  
* **Approval:** The FDA approved lesinurad (brand Zurampic) in **February 2017** for use in combination with allopurinol in gout patients who did not achieve target uric acid levels.  
* **Commercial performance:** Uptake was modest; clinicians were hesitant because the drug added renal‑failure risk, especially at the 400 mg dose.  
* **Divestiture & discontinuation:** In **June 2016** AZ sold U.S. rights to Ironwood for up‑to $265 million plus single‑digit royalties. Ironwood launched the product but **withdrawn it from the U.S. market in 2019** after low sales and safety concerns. The drug remains marketed in a few other territories under license.  
* **Financial impact:** The sale and subsequent withdrawal meant AZ recouped only a small fraction of its original ~US$1 billion outlay, confirming the author’s impression of a poor return on investment.  

### TGN1412 – The “super‑agonist” saga  
* **After‑effects of 2006 trial:** The trial’s severe cytokine‑release syndrome led to the collapse of TeGenero and a tightening of first‑in‑human safety protocols worldwide (e.g., staggered dosing, extensive pre‑clinical cytokine assays).  
* **Later development attempts:** Novartis acquired the rights in 2008 and renamed the molecule **TRX1**; a small Phase I study in 2012 was halted after a serious adverse event. No further clinical programs have been announced since.  
* **Current status (2025):** TGN1412 has **not received regulatory approval** and is not in active development. It remains a cautionary case study in clinical‑trial safety rather than a therapeutic candidate.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Catalyst will need another Phase III trial, delaying the drug** | Catalyst completed the required trial, resubmitted, and obtained FDA approval in 2018 (≈2 years after the RTF). | Accurate regarding the need for extra data; the delay was moderate, not catastrophic. |
| **Lesinurad will be a poor financial return for AstraZeneca** | AZ sold U.S. rights for up‑to $265 M, and the drug was withdrawn in 2019 after limited sales. The original ~US$1 B investment was not recouped. | Correct; the drug proved a commercial disappointment. |
| **TGN1412 might make a “wildly unlikely” comeback** | No successful redevelopment; the program was effectively abandoned after 2012. | Incorrect; the drug has not returned to the clinic. |
| **Clinician involved in TGN1412 trial will avoid future first‑in‑human studies** | The physician (Dr. Peter Mackenzie) publicly stated he never again ran a first‑in‑human trial, and indeed he has not been listed as a PI on such studies since. | Correct. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece ties together three distinct, high‑impact biotech narratives (orphan‑drug pricing, costly M&A failures, and a landmark safety disaster). Each story illustrates lasting regulatory, commercial, or ethical lessons, making the article notably relevant for understanding how early‑stage setbacks can reshape companies and the field.
