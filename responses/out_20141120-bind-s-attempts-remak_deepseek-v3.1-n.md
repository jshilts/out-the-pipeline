# Bind's Attempts To Remake Chemotherapy (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses targeted nanoparticle drug delivery as a promising approach to improving chemotherapy, focusing on Bind Therapeutics' Phase II trial results for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The nanoparticle concept involves encapsulating chemotherapy drugs in tiny particles coated with recognition peptides that direct the payload specifically to cancer cells, potentially avoiding systemic toxicity while allowing use of more potent agents.

Bind Therapeutics, a Bob Langer-derived company led by CEO Scott Minick, reported mixed Phase II results for their docetaxel nanoparticle formulation. The every-three-weeks dosing showed some responders, particularly in patients with KRAS or squamous cell carcinoma subtypes, while weekly dosing showed no response. The company planned to proceed with another Phase II trial focusing on those responsive subtypes.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Bind Therapeutics faced significant challenges that ultimately led to its demise. The company's stock declined dramatically, and in May 2016, Bind Therapeutics filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The promising Phase II results mentioned in the article did not translate into successful Phase III outcomes or FDA approval.

Pfizer acquired Bind's lead nanoparticle drug candidate and other assets in 2016 during the bankruptcy proceedings, continuing development efforts. However, the high hopes for targeted nanoparticle delivery of docetaxel did not materialize into an approved therapy. The technology faced fundamental challenges including manufacturing complexity, inconsistent drug release profiles, and difficulties achieving the promised tissue-specific targeting in human patients.

Nanoparticle drug delivery has seen some successes in the broader pharmaceutical industry, including COVID-19 vaccine lipid nanoparticles, but the specific vision of targeted chemotherapy delivery that Bind pursued largely failed to achieve widespread clinical adoption. The challenges of precisely controlling nanoparticle behavior in the complex biological environment proved more difficult than anticipated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes, but rather discussed the promise and challenges of nanoparticle drug delivery technology. The only forward-looking statement was the author's acknowledgment that "these are the early days of targeted nanoparticles" and that drug discovery requires further clinical testing to determine efficacy—a prudent assessment that proved accurate given Bind's subsequent clinical failures.

## 4. INTEREST

**7/10** - This article captures an important moment in nanomedicine development and represents a cautionary case study in biotech investment and technology translation, though it primarily serves as historical documentation of a failed clinical approach rather than a breakthrough with lasting impact.
