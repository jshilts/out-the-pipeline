# Deal of the Year? (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article references InVivoBlog's poll for "Deal of the Year" in the biopharmaceutical industry for 2012 across three categories: M&A deals highlighting Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition of Inhibitex and Amgen's purchase of DeCode Genetics; strategic alliances such as the University of Pennsylvania's partnership with Novartis; and early-stage financing/exits including Warp Drive Bio. The author expresses interest in seeing the full spectrum of voting results rather than just the winners, suggesting curiosity about which deals the broader biopharma community considered successful versus questionable strategic moves.

## 2. HISTORY

The mentioned deals had significantly different long-term outcomes:

**BMS/Inhibitex**: In January 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Inhibitex for $2.5 billion, primarily for its hepatitis C drug candidate INX-189. However, just three months later (April 2012), BMS discontinued the drug's development due to cardiac safety signals. By 2016, BMS had largely exited hepatitis C development as competitors (Gilead's Sovaldi, AbbVie's Viekira) dominated the market.


**Amgen/DeCode Genetics**: Amgen acquired Icelandic genetic research firm DeCode in December 2012 for $415 million. Unlike the BMS acquisition, this deal proved strategically sound. DeCode continued identifying genetic risk factors for diseases that informed Amgen's drug development pipeline. Most notably, in 2015 Amgen launched Repatha (evolocumab), a PCSK9 inhibitor for cholesterol that was partially informed by DeCode's cardiovascular genetics research. DeCode also maintained its genetics database operations and later facilitated population genetics studies with Pfizer and AstraZeneca.


**University of Pennsylvania/Novartis CAR-T Alliance**: This partnership focused on developing CAR-T cell therapies for cancer treatment. In August 2017, Novartis received the first FDA approval of any CAR-T therapy (Kymriah/CTL019) for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Additional approvals followed, establishing CAR-T as a landmark cancer treatment modality. The alliance marked a successful academic-industry collaboration that brought a new therapeutic modality to patients. By 2022, CAR-T therapies had generated over $2 billion in annual revenues globally, though manufacturing complexity remained a significant hurdle affecting patient access.


**Warp Drive Bio**: The company raised substantial funding ($75M Series A in 2011, $112M Series B in 2014), led by Third Rock Ventures and Sanofi, aiming to discover natural product drugs through genomic mining. However, the company struggled to translate its platform into clinical candidates. After leadership changes and multiple pivots, Warp Drive exited stealth mode in 2014 but was eventually acquired by Revolution Medicines in 2019 for undisclosed terms, marking a somewhat disappointing outcome for one of the most heavily-funded early-stage biotechs of its time.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't itself make explicit predictions, but rather pointed to contemporaneous industry sentiment via InVivoBlog's voting on which deals would prove most important for 2012. Neither the author nor the blog poll provided clear forecasting statements, instead deferring to the wisdom (or lack thereof) of the biopharma community as revealed through voting patterns for various M&A, alliance, and financing deals.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

An industry blog post announcing a poll about 2012 biopharma deals, with minimal original analysis and no substantive predictions to verify or falsify, falls toward the lower end of the interest spectrum. It captures some historical context regarding major industry transactions and partnerships circa 2012, but most significance comes from subsequent developments of those deals rather than the article itself.
