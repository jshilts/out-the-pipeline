Of course. Here is a thoughtful, critical analysis of the article from the benefit of hindsight.

---

### 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 *Science* article details the severe regulatory and clinical setbacks faced by Sarepta Therapeutics for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug, eteplirsen. The central conflict stems from a large disconnect between Sarepta's public optimism about an accelerated approval based on a tiny, 12-patient study and the FDA’s increasingly stringent data demands, which included requests for more imaging, long-term results, and safety data. This forced the company to delay its filing and triggered a significant stock plunge. The author pins the blame for this "terrible mess" squarely on Sarepta, accusing the company of trying to make "far too much of a single small study" and chasing a "low-percentage" shortcut instead of conducting the large-scale, rigorous trials necessary in the biopharma industry.

### 2. HISTORY

The trajectory of Sarepta's eteplirsen from this 2014 crisis to the present day is a remarkably turbulent and consequential saga in modern drug development.

**The Initial Controversial Approval (2016):** Defying widespread scientific skepticism—mirrored in the original article—the FDA granted accelerated approval to eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51) in September 2016. This decision was not based on a successful, well-controlled Phase III trial. Instead, the agency used its accelerated approval pathway, accepting an unvalidated surrogate endpoint (the production of a protein called dystrophin in muscle tissue) as "reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit." This approval was intensely controversial, made under significant pressure from patient advocacy groups and over the objections of the FDA's own expert review panel, which found the evidence of effectiveness to be weak and inconsistent.

**Clinical Failure and Biostatistical Scandals:** Post-approval history has largely vindicated the skeptics. A confirmatory, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III trial was finally completed and its results released in 2023. The trial definitively showed that eteplirsen **did not slow the progression of DMD** compared to a placebo, failing its primary and key secondary endpoints. The drug did not demonstrate a statistically significant or clinically meaningful benefit in measures like the 6-minute walk test. This outcome confirmed the core concern from 2014: a tiny, flawed study is not predictive of real-world clinical efficacy.

Furthermore, the field learned in 2019 via a report in *The New York Times* that the FDA's 2016 approval had relied on a positive voting recommendation from a biostatistician, Dr. A. Michael Lincoff, whose participation in the advisory committee meeting was, unbeknownst to the public and even to FDA officials, directed by a contractor working for Sarepta itself. This revelation added a significant layer of controversy over the integrity of the approval process.

**Continued Success Despite Failure:** Despite the clinical failure and ethical clouds, Exondys 51 has been a commercial blockbuster for Sarepta. The drug carries an astronomical U.S. price tag (often cited around $1 million per patient annually) and generated over $1.1 billion in revenue in 2023. Sarepta has leveraged this revenue to build a dominant position in the DMD market, developing a pipeline of other "exon-skipping" therapies using the same general technology. The company is also now a leader in gene therapy for DMD.

In 2024, the FDA is currently reviewing Sarepta's gene therapy for DMD, Elevidys, for a full, traditional approval. The outcome is once again contentious; while the therapy showed a benefit on a surrogate biomarker (the same dystrophin protein), it narrowly missed the primary functional endpoint in its confirmatory trial. This highlights that the fundamental tension between patient demand, corporate strategy, and scientific rigor identified in the 2014 article remains a defining feature of Sarepta's relationship with the FDA.

### 3. PREDICTIONS

The article’s author was remarkably prescient about the specific scientific and regulatory failures, but perhaps underestimated the powerful influence of market and social forces.

**What the Article Got Right:**
- **The fundamental critique was correct.** The article’s core argument—that trying to build an approval on a "single small study" with weak data was a "low-percentage move" and a flawed strategy—was proven entirely correct. The 2023 Phase III failure is the ultimate validation of this warning.
- **It correctly identified Sarepta's overreach.** The author's assessment that Sarepta was trying to make "far too much" of its data and was misrepresenting the FDA's position proved to be accurate, foreshadowing the deep skepticism the data would face from the scientific community and FDA reviewers.

**What the Article Got Wrong (or Could Not Have Predicted):**
- **The approval outcome was wrong.** The clear implication of the article was that the drug was "a lot further away" and likely to fail in its bid for accelerated approval. The author could not have predicted the immense political and emotional pressure that patient advocacy groups would successfully exert on the FDA, leading to the 2016 approval despite the weak data. This outcome defied the standard evidence-based framework.
- **It underestimated the commercial power of a "failed" drug.** The author's focus was on the immediate clinical and regulatory failure, a common frame for scientists. The article did not predict that Sarepta would achieve a multi-billion-dollar commercial success with a drug that failed its pivotal trial. This highlights a crucial blind spot in a purely scientific analysis: the distinction between clinical efficacy and market viability. For a devastating disease with no other options, an expensive drug with marginal evidence can still become a blockbuster.
- **It couldn't foresee the biostatistician scandal.** The article questioned the science and company management but had no reason to suspect an ethical breach in the regulatory process itself, which the *New York Times* report later uncovered.

### 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 9**

This article ranks in the 90-99th percentile of interest for several reasons.

First, it serves as a near-perfect historical capsule, capturing a moment of scientific skepticism just before a pivotal event in regulatory history. It allows for a stark before-and-after comparison where the author's core scientific predictions are proven right, yet the ultimate outcome defies them.

Second, the Sarepta story exposes a fundamental and persistent crack in the drug approval framework. It forced the FDA and the public to confront a difficult question: how much scientific evidence should be sacrificed in the face of terminal illness and vocal patient demand? The case became a landmark in the debate over accelerated approval, surrogate endpoints, and the role of patient voices in scientific decision-making. Its impact has influenced policy discussions ever since. The article's account of Sarepta's "terrible mess" was not just a company-specific problem but a symptom of a much larger tension in medicine, making it a story of long-term and ongoing importance.
