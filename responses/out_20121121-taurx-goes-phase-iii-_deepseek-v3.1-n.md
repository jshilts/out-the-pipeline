# TauRx Goes Into Phase III For Alzheimer's (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports that TauRx Therapeutics, a Singapore-based company, was initiating Phase III clinical trials for its tau-targeting Alzheimer's therapy and had secured substantial financing from Malaysian conglomerate Genting Berhad to support these trials, amounting to a commitment of approximately $111.8 million. Earlier work by the company centered on "Rember," a reformulated version of methylene blue, but the new Phase III effort used TRx0237 (LMTX), an improved compound intended to inhibit tau aggregation. The company had opened patient enrollment in North America and was advancing a tau-based hypothesis for treating Alzheimer's disease.

## 2. HISTORY
TauRx initiated two large Phase III Phase 3 trials for TRx0237: one in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's and another in mild Alzheimer's (later broadened to include behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia). Results for the mild-to-moderate trial reported at AAIC 2016 did not meet the primary endpoints (ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL); a pre-specified subpopulation of patients receiving LMTX as monotherapy showed nominally significant effects on some outcomes, but the overall trials were negative. The company conducted additional post-hoc analyses and requested regulatory meetings, but no regulatory approval materialized on those data.

In 2018, TauRx announced top-level results from the second Phase III trial in mild Alzheimer's, stating that LMTX did not meet its co-primary endpoints. Meta-analyses and long-term open-label extension data were presented, but regulators did not approve the drug. The tau aggregation hypothesis remains scientifically interesting and continues to be explored by other companies, though no tau-targeting therapy has reached FDA approval to date. In recent years, anti-amyloid therapies such as aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab have progressed and, in some cases, gained accelerated or traditional FDA approval, drawing substantial clinical, payer, and policy attention, while TauRx's LMTX did not demonstrate broad efficacy in pivotal trials and has not been approved or widely adopted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- The article suggested TRx0237 would "get a real chance to prove itself" and that results would be awaited eagerly.
  - Later developments: The Phase III trials failed to meet primary endpoints; the drug was not approved.
- The article implied TauRx was positioned for "market leadership in Alzheimer's" via the funding press release it referenced.
  - Later developments: TauRx did not achieve market leadership; its trials did not succeed and other (primarily amyloid-targeting) therapies advanced instead.

## 4. INTEREST
4/9
Interest is moderate: the piece captures an important Phase III milestone and financing for a novel tau-based approach, but LMTX ultimately did not succeed, while other mechanisms eventually reached patients. The tau hypothesis itself remains scientifically relevant beyond this program.
