# The UCLA Lab Fatality: Criminal Charges Filed (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the criminal charges filed against UCLA chemistry professor Patrick Harran and the University of California regents following the 2009 laboratory death of graduate student Sheri Sangji. Sangji died from injuries sustained while working with t-butyllithium, a highly pyrophoric chemical that ignites spontaneously upon air exposure. The Los Angeles County District Attorney charged Harran and UCLA with felony violations of occupational health and safety standards, marking an unprecedented criminal prosecution in an academic lab accident case. The article notes that inspections revealed multiple safety violations in the lab, and that Sangji was inadequately prepared for handling the dangerous chemical—wearing flammable clothing without a lab coat and lacking proper safety training for t-butyllithium procedures.

## 2. HISTORY
The criminal case against Patrick Harran and UCLA continued for several years following the 2011 charges. In 2014, Harran reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, avoiding trial by agreeing to complete 800 hours of community service and pay a $10,000 fine. The charges would be dismissed after five years if he complied with the terms and violated no other laws. UCLA separately paid $4.5 million to settle civil lawsuits brought by Sangji's family and agreed to implement comprehensive laboratory safety reforms across its chemistry department.

The case had significant lasting impacts on academic laboratory safety culture and regulatory oversight. UCLA implemented mandatory safety training programs for all laboratory personnel, enhanced chemical hygiene protocols, and established more rigorous supervision requirements for graduate students working with hazardous materials. The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) issued citations totaling $31,875 to UCLA for safety violations, though these were later reduced. The prosecution became a landmark case that raised awareness about academic laboratory safety standards nationwide, prompting many universities to review and strengthen their own safety protocols and training requirements for chemical handling.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself did not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes, instead focusing on the immediate developments of the criminal charges and inviting reader commentary about whether criminal prosecution was appropriate for laboratory safety violations.

## 4. INTEREST
**7/10**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile for interest due to its significant long-term importance in establishing legal precedents for academic laboratory safety accountability and its substantial impact on university safety protocols nationwide.
