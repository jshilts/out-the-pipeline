# How Many Natural Products Are Being Found? And How Many Are There? (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2017 commentary analyzes a PNAS study (1941–2015) that tracked microbial and marine natural product discovery. The key finding: new structure reports rose steeply until the mid-1990s, then leveled off while remaining substantial. Chemical diversity metrics and structural outliers also plateaued, meaning genuinely novel architectures continued to be found but the fraction of truly novel compounds relative to all reported products has declined over time. A subsequent PNAS exchange debated whether these patterns reflect statistical saturation or simply field maturation; the original authors clarified that the absolute discovery rate of novel structures remained significant, but acknowledged that derivative structures now dominate the total. The commentary suggests that sustaining novelty rates may require improved collection/culturing techniques and argues that much synthetic "near-natural" chemical space remains unexplored—using cyclic tetrapeptides as an example where fewer than 100 known examples exist out of massive theoretical possibilities, implying either evolutionary gaps or detection limits.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this article (2017–2025), natural product drug discovery continued to face declining novelty returns, yet adaptation accelerated:

- **Approved drugs and clinical outcomes**: Marine natural products led to several approvals pre-2017 (e.g., trabectedin, eribulin) and post-2017 few new approvals emerged from traditional natural-product pipelines; meanwhile, many programs faced failures due to supply, selectivity, or complexity (e.g., some antibody–drug conjugates using natural-product payloads experienced setbacks). No major microbial/marine-origin small molecules achieved broad patient uptake post-2017, reflecting both clinical attrition and industry shifts toward biologics and targeted therapies.

- **Method adoption and pipeline changes**: Metagenomics, genome mining, and synthetic biology (e.g., CRISPR-based pathway refactoring) grew in adoption to access cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters and heterologously produce compounds previously inaccessible. However, these methods did not fully reverse the novelty plateau. Many pharma companies further de-prioritized natural-product screening in favor of target-based design and fragment-based drug discovery.

- **Business trends**: Companies heavily reliant on natural-product libraries (e.g., certain biotech screening firms) saw mixed fortunes; some pivoted toward engineered biosynthesis while others struggled to sustain discovery throughput. No major public-policy shifts specifically reshaped natural-product incentives in this period.

- **Empirical measures**: By 2020–2025, databases had expanded further, and while absolute numbers of new compounds remained substantial, the fraction of high-novelty scaffolds continued its gradual decline. Investment in automated extraction/analysis helped maintain steady yields but did not recreate the pre-1990s surge. "Near-natural" libraries produced intriguing tool compounds but delivered no major therapeutic breakthroughs in this window.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article included predictions and assertions about future developments; here is how they compared to subsequent outcomes:

- **Prediction**: "Keeping that line [of novel structure discovery] from dipping ... will probably require new collection, culture, and isolation techniques."
  - **Outcome**: Metagenomics-driven culturing, single-cell genomics, and microfluidics-based isolation methods grew in use, but did not fundamentally reverse the novelty plateau; rather, these tools sustained a roughly constant absolute discovery rate without reigniting rapid growth.

- **Prediction**: "The whole field of near-natural products should take heart ... there's a lot of useful work to be done."
  - **Outcome**: Synthetic "near-natural" libraries saw modest investment, yielding tool compounds and mechanistic probes, but no major therapeutic successes to date; the hypothesis that unexplored peptide-like space holds high value remains largely unproven clinically.

- **Assertion/Implication**: Evolution's "blind turns" could mean synthetic libraries recapitulate missed natural-product opportunities; cyclic tetrapeptide example suggests huge white space.
  - **Outcome**: Despite considerable combinatorial chemistry and peptide synthesis advances, the cyclic tetrapeptide space did not yield breakthrough drugs post-2017; practical challenges (cell permeability, stability, target engagement) often outweighed theoretical diversity advantages.

- **Bigger Picture**: The commentary anticipated sustained, but not accelerating, novelty alongside growing derivative noise.
  - **Outcome**: This proved largely accurate—the novelty fraction kept declining while absolute new-scaffold counts held roughly steady through 2025, indicating field maturation rather than sudden collapse or renaissance.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
The article captures a mature debate about novelty saturation in natural products, but its findings are variations on well-established themes; post-2017 developments offered few surprises, so this ranks in the middle-to-lower band of long-term importance.
