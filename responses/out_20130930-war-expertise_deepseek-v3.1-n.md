# A War On Expertise? (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Popular Science's decision to shut down their website's comments section, citing research showing that fractious comment threads can make the original content appear less reliable. The author references Popular Science's own explanation that this move was driven by concern over a "politically motivated, decades-long war on expertise" that has eroded public consensus on scientifically validated topics like evolution and climate change.

However, the author disagrees with this framing, arguing that there has never been a time when evolution wasn't controversial among many people, and that what appears to be a "war on expertise" is actually the normal state of affairs made more visible by the internet. The author contends that most people have never deeply understood scientific topics, and that if anything, the population today is more scientifically literate than in the past. Rather than a coordinated attack on expertise, the internet simply gives everyone with strong opinions a platform to express them—something that was much harder in earlier eras when options were limited to letters to editors or street corner proselytizing.

## 2. HISTORY

The controversy around online comment sections and expertise continued to intensify after this 2013 article. Many major publications followed Popular Science's lead in shutting down or heavily moderating comment sections, including Reuters, The Week, and various local newspapers. The New York Times and other outlets shifted to requiring social media logins for commenting.

Simultaneously, the issues Popular Science cited—climate change denial and anti-evolution sentiment—became even more politically charged. The rise of "fake news" discourse around 2016 intensified concerns about misinformation undermining scientific consensus. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter became major battlegrounds for scientific controversies, leading to eventual fact-checking initiatives and content moderation policies targeting misinformation.

The COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 onward created unprecedented challenges for science communication, with public health recommendations becoming intensely politicized and subject to the same dynamics this article described. The tension between expert consensus and public debate became a central feature of pandemic response across multiple countries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself doesn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather challenges the predictive assumptions underlying Popular Science's position and the broader narrative about declining respect for expertise.

- **Assumption that shutting comments would improve public discourse**: The trend toward closing comment sections did continue, but debate simply shifted to social media platforms where moderation was often even less effective
- **Implicit expectation that internet-enabled debate reflects new hostility to expertise**: The author's counter-argument—that this is normal human behavior amplified by new platforms—proved prescient as "comment section wars" migrated seamlessly to Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms
- **The idea that scientific topics would be uniquely protected from politicization**: Events proved the opposite—everything from vaccines to climate science became even more politically polarized in the decade following the article
- **Belief that the population was becoming more scientifically literate**: While educational attainment continued to rise, this didn't necessarily translate to greater public acceptance of scientific consensus on controversial topics

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article proved remarkably insightful about how internet discourse around science would evolve, accurately identifying that polarization around expertise wasn't new but simply more visible. Its relevance increased dramatically with subsequent events, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, making it unusually prescient for its time.
