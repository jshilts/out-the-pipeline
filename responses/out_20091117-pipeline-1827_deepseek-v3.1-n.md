# A Blogroll Update (Nov 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short article describes a routine blogroll update on what appears to be a chemistry or pharmaceutical industry blog. The author has refreshed their sidebar links, removing inactive sites and adding several new chemistry blogs including Med-Chemist, Chemical Crystallinity, Synthetic Nature, Mad Chemist Chick, Chiral Jones, and P212121. Additionally, the author created a new category for chemistry and pharmaceutical database resources, listing Drugbank, Emolecules, ChemSpider, PubChem, DailyMed, Druglib, and Clinicaltrials.gov as valuable reference sources for readers.

## 2. HISTORY

The databases and resources mentioned in this 2009 blogroll update reflect the early landscape of online chemistry and pharmaceutical information. These platforms continued to evolve significantly after 2009:

- **PubMed/Clinicaltrials.gov**: These NIH-maintained databases continued to expand and remain essential resources for clinical trial information and biomedical literature
- **PubChem**: This NCBI chemical database grew substantially in size and functionality, becoming one of the largest public repositories of chemical compound information
- **ChemSpider**: Acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2009, the platform was further developed as a comprehensive chemical structure database
- **DrugBank**: Expanded from a specialized database into a more comprehensive resource for drug and drug target information

The blogging landscape itself underwent significant changes, with many chemistry blogs eventually becoming inactive as social media platforms and professional networks (like ResearchGate, LinkedIn) became more prominent for scientific communication. The shift from personal blogs to institutional content and social media platforms was a broader trend affecting many scientific communities.
