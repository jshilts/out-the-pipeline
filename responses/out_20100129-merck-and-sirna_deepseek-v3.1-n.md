# Merck and Sirna (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Merck's 2010 acquisition of Sirna Therapeutics, focusing on an interview with Merck's head of the RNA therapeutics division. The executive emphasized that one of the biggest challenges for RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics was **delivery**—getting RNA molecules to the right tissues and cells in the body. He contrasted Merck's approach with smaller biotech companies, arguing that Merck's deep expertise in pharmaceutical R&D, drug safety, metabolism, and pharmacokinetics gave them an advantage in overcoming the delivery challenge. Merck immediately invested heavily not only in the RNA technology from Sirna but also built an entire delivery research group in Pennsylvania.

Additionally, the article mentions Merck's dual strategy: using RNAi both as potential therapies themselves and as tools to better understand targets for traditional small-molecule drugs. The Wall Street value of this internal target validation work was considered near zero since results were not publicly visible, but the internal company value could be significant. The article also notes an ironic internal Merck acronym "POS" for "probability of success."

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2010 acquisition, the subsequent decade revealed a more complex and ultimately disappointing outcome for Merck's RNAi ambitions:

**Merck's RNAi Program Fate**: Merck struggled significantly with delivery challenges despite their initial confidence. In 2014—just four years after the acquisition—Merck sold its RNAi assets to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals for $175 million, a fraction of the $1.1 billion they had paid for Sirna. This represented a substantial loss and acknowledged failure of their RNAi therapeutic strategy.

**Industry-wide Delivery Breakthrough**: Contrary to Merck's assumption that big pharma expertise would solve delivery, the major delivery breakthrough came from smaller, focused companies. In 2018, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for **Onpattro (patisiran)**, the first RNAi therapeutic approved in the United States. The key innovation was a lipid nanoparticle delivery system that successfully targeted the liver—developed by Alnylam, not Merck.

**Clinical Success and Adoption**: Onpattro proved effective for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, validating RNAi as a therapeutic modality. Several additional RNAi drugs followed, including Givlaari (2019) and Oxlumo (2020), all targeting liver diseases through improved delivery systems. As of 2024, there are multiple FDA-approved RNAi drugs, but Merck has none in its portfolio—they missed the breakthrough entirely.

**Merck's Strategic Shift**: After exiting RNAi, Merck pivoted to other modalities, particularly in oncology with their successful PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda. Their RNAi target validation efforts, while potentially useful internally, did not result in publicly disclosed drug approvals traceable to this work.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Merck's delivery expertise advantage**: The article implied Merck's decades of pharma experience would solve delivery challenges better than smaller companies. **Reality**: Failed completely—Merck abandoned RNAi altogether while smaller companies (especially Alnylam) achieved delivery breakthroughs and won FDA approvals.

• **Merck's integrated approach superiority**: The suggestion that Merck's comprehensive R&D infrastructure would outperform biotech's "interesting experimental results" without full therapeutic awareness. **Reality**: The opposite occurred—dedicated biotech companies succeeded where Merck's large-scale approach failed.

• **Wall Street undervaluing internal target validation**: The article noted that internal target validation work has significant company value despite zero external visibility. **Reality**: This cannot be directly verified, but no major Merck drugs have been publicly attributed to RNAi target validation work from this period, suggesting limited tangible impact.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This represents a fascinating cautionary tale in biotech history—a $1.1 billion acquisition that failed within four years, while smaller competitors achieved the breakthrough Merck claimed to be pursuing.
