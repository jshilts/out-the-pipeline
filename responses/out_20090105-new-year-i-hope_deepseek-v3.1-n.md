# In the Pipeline: New Year - I Hope!

## 5 January 2009

## 1. Summary

The author abandons the tradition of reviewing the previous year in the drug industry, stating that 2008 was so difficult it’s not worth reliving. He posits that the primary cause of the industry's troubles is a failure to produce enough good drugs, suggesting that the projects initiated in the mid-to-late 1990s failed to deliver as hoped. The article explores whether this is due to higher attrition rates, an insufficient number of candidates advancing to the clinic, or both.

Key factors discussed include the increasing difficulty of drug targets, clinical and regulatory hurdles being set too high without the corresponding ability to solve the problems they reveal, and a culture of self-deception where weak projects are advanced merely to meet internal targets. The author offers several New Year's resolutions to address these issues: balance finding problems with fixing them, be more intellectually honest, develop cheaper and faster ways to get answers in humans, and embrace risk-taking in research by trying things that are not guaranteed to succeed. The overall tone is one of candid self-reflection and a call for systemic change to navigate the industry's deep-rooted productivity crisis.

## 2. History

The challenges highlighted in this 2009 article—high attrition rates, soaring R&D costs, and low productivity—continued to be a dominant theme for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for the subsequent decade and a half. The period saw a mixed record of successes and failures, with shifts in strategy but not a fundamental resolution of the core problem.

In the years immediately following 2008, the "patent cliff" became a major issue, as many blockbuster drugs lost exclusivity, putting immense pressure on companies to refill their pipelines. Mergers and acquisitions remained a primary strategy; mega-mergers like Pfizer-Wyeth (2009) and Roche-Genentech (2009) were partly driven by the need to acquire late-stage assets and cut R&D overhead in the face of internal innovation shortfalls. The trend of major pharmaceutical companies slashing internal R&D spending, particularly in early-stage discovery, accelerated. This led to an increased reliance on in-licensing and acquiring smaller, nimbler biotechnology companies.

The author's wish to find ways to "go to the clinic without betting our shirts every time" saw significant progress in some areas. Adaptive trial designs gained traction with the FDA, most notably with the 2012 approval of ferroquine, allowing for more flexible and efficient studies. microdosing and 0b phase studies, while not universally adopted, became more common tools for getting early human pharmacokinetic data. Biomarker-based drug development became standard practice, especially in oncology, enabling patient stratification and leading to more targeted, albeit often more niche, therapies like the PARP inhibitors for BRCA-mutant cancers.

The decade saw genuine breakthroughs in specific therapeutic modalities. Cancer immunotherapy, driven by checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab (Keytruda, approved 2014) and nivolumab (Opdivo, approved 2014), validated a new mechanism of action, though often with high costs and for subsets of patients. Gene therapies finally became a clinical reality with approvals like alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera, EU 2012, later withdrawn), and, more durably, voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna, 2017) and onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma, 2019). RNA-based therapeutics also broke through with the approval of multiple siRNA drugs (e.g., Patisiran, 2018) and, pivotally, the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. These successes, however, came with their own set of challenges, including extreme costs, complex manufacturing, and reimbursement hurdles that limited wide uptake.

The fundamental issue of high failure rates remained stubborn. A 2014 analysis showed that the likelihood of a drug moving from Phase I to approval was less than 10%, with a slight upward tick by 2018-2021, though the overall trend remained low. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a massive, real-world stress test. It demonstrated that with sufficient funding, focus, and regulatory flexibility, the industry could deliver innovations (e.g., mRNA vaccines) with unprecedented speed. However, this was a unique circumstance and did not signal a permanent fix for the underlying productivity issues. Post-pandemic, R&D costs have continued to escalate, and the industry continues to grapple with translating scientific knowledge into a steady stream of clinically effective and commercially viable new medicines.

## 3. Predictions

The article contained more diagnoses and resolutions than explicit, falsifiable predictions, but it did point to several necessary directions for the industry. Here is an evaluation of those implied forecasts and trends:

- **Prediction: A need to "find ways to go to the clinic without betting our shirts every time."**
  - **Outcome:** Partial success. The industry made significant strides in this area, though not universally. Adaptive trial designs, championed by the FDA, became more common, allowing for more flexible and efficient clinical development. The use of biomarkers for patient selection became standard in many therapeutic areas, especially oncology, reducing trial size, cost, and duration by targeting likely responders. Technologies like microdosing and Phase 0 trials were adopted for early human data, though not as ubiquitously as once hoped. Simulation and modeling also saw widespread adoption. While these tools have lowered the cost and risk of individual trials, the overall cost of developing a drug remains exceptionally high.

- **Prediction (Implicit): The quality of the pipeline initiated in the late 1990s/early 2000s would determine near-future success.**
  - **Outcome:** This was validated by subsequent events. The challenges of the late 2000s were indeed a result of pipelines failing to deliver. The "patent cliff" of the early 2010s, where many major drugs lost exclusivity, painfully exposed the industry's inability to refill its coffers with internally developed blockbusters. This led directly to the wave of mega-mergers (e.g., Pfizer/Wyeth) and a long-term strategic shift toward acquiring innovation from the outside via biotech companies, a tacit admission that the productivity problem was an enduring one.

- **Prediction (Implicit): The industry's focus would need to shift from just "finding problems" to "fixing them."**
  - **Outcome:** Mixed. There have been clear successes in overcoming previous hurdles in specific areas. For example, the development of next-generation TKIs and combination therapies has "fixed" the problem of resistance in cancers like CML and NSCLC. The advent of CFTR modulators like ivacaftor provided a direct fix for the underlying defect in certain cystic fibrosis patients. However, on a macro level, the industry still struggles with this balance. Many late-stage failures still occur due to lack of efficacy—a core problem that wasn't successfully "fixed" before committing enormous resources to Phase III trials.

- **Prediction (A Wish): Researchers should "try some things that you aren't sure about" and not let fear run their research.**
  - **Outcome:** Unmeasurable but directionally evident. While the pressure to deliver quarterly results and the high cost of failure create a powerful incentive for risk aversion, the most celebrated breakthroughs of the last decade came from pursuing long-shot ideas. The massive success of cancer immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors) and the ultimate triumph of mRNA vaccines are prime examples of sustained, uncertain research that paid off after years of skepticism. Biotechnology venture capital has continued to fund platform technologies and novel mechanisms, encouraging calculated bets. However, this is counterbalanced by the high rate of R&D cutbacks at large pharmaceutical companies, suggesting that for every risk-taking biotech, there is a risk-averse pharma giant pruning its early-stage efforts.

## 4. Interest
Rating: **7/10**

The article is a highly interesting and historically relevant snapshot of the industry's mindset at a critical point of introspection during the Great Recession. Its value lies not in specific predictions but in its timeless and candid diagnosis of the systemic, cultural, and scientific hurdles that continue to challenge drug development more than a decade later. It is a thoughtful critique that remains applicable today.
