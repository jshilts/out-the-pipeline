# Competing Interests (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Nature Publishing Group's updated rules on author disclosure requirements for competing interests, particularly focusing on the new section requiring disclosure of non-financial interests. These include unpaid roles such as membership in advocacy organizations, advisory positions, educational consulting, or expert witness work. The author raises concerns about potential "gray areas" and chicken-and-egg problems—whether scientific conclusions lead to advocacy positions or advocacy positions influence scientific objectivity. The piece questions how stringently these requirements might be enforced and warns that broadening disclosure criteria could lead to "orthodoxy-sniffing" and ideological purity tests. The author references an editorial from Biocentury that expresses similar concerns about the policy's ambiguity and potential reach, citing historical examples like Linus Pauling's treatment during the McCarthy era for his nuclear disarmament views.

## 2. HISTORY

Nature's competing interests policy, introduced in February 2018, became part of a broader trend toward transparency in scientific publishing, but its implementation revealed practical challenges. Over the subsequent years, scientific publishing generally moved toward greater disclosure requirements, with many journals adopting similar or expanded COI (conflict of interest) policies. However, in practice, enforcement of *non-financial* competing interests remained inconsistent across journals.

Major developments included increased scrutiny of pharmaceutical industry ties (financial COIs) following various controversies, but the non-financial disclosure requirements that initially concerned the author proved less problematic than anticipated. Research misconduct cases in the late 2010s and early 2020s (such as the Cassava Sciences controversy and various COVID-19 related research controversies) primarily focused on data integrity and financial conflicts rather than non-financial ideological biases. 

The scientific community largely adapted to these disclosure requirements without the widespread "orthodoxy-sniffing" the article feared. Most journals adopted more explicit financial disclosure requirements, and some high-profile cases demonstrated that financial conflicts remained the primary concern for retractions and investigations. The broader concerns about political/religious disclosure—while theoretically valid—did not materialize into widespread abuse in practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made implicit predictions about the consequences of expanded disclosure requirements:

- **Prediction**: Broad non-financial disclosure requirements could lead to "orthodoxy-sniffing" and ideological purity tests
  - **Outcome**: This largely did not occur at the scale feared. While some isolated incidents of ideological bias in peer review emerged, the scientific community generally avoided systematic ideological screening of authors.

- **Prediction**: The lines between political, religious, and scientific beliefs might become weaponized, leading to McCarthy-era style controversies
  - **Outcome**: While scientists faced increased public scrutiny during politically charged periods (particularly during COVID-19), the feared widespread politicization of publication decisions based on disclosed non-financial interests did not materialize.

- **Prediction**: Journals would struggle with inconsistent enforcement of "encouraged" versus "required" disclosure of non-financial interests
  - **Outcome**: This proved partially accurate—many journals adopted clearer mandatory disclosure requirements, focusing more on financial conflicts. Non-financial disclosures remained inconsistently enforced across journals, but without major controversies.

- **Prediction**: Scientific findings should "stand up to scrutiny regardless of the beliefs of its authors"
  - **Outcome**: This principle largely held true. The most significant controversies in subsequent years (Ivermectin studies, hydroxychloroquine research, various clinical trial controversies) centered on data integrity and methodology rather than authors' disclosed ideological positions.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

The article addresses important but ultimately routine evolution in scientific publishing policies. While prescient in identifying potential implementation challenges, the feared widespread abuses did not materialize in practice. The issue was timely in 2018 but did not remain highly significant long-term.
