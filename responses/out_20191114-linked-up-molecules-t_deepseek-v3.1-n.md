# Linked-Up Molecules Through the Years (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reviews the history and challenges of bifunctional molecules in drug discovery, particularly in targeted protein degradation (TPD). The article traces the concept back to 1982 work by Phil Portoghese on opioid receptor bivalent ligands and notes that the field still grapples with the same fundamental lessons about linker length, flexibility, and their influence on binding. It details how linkers are not inert spacers but can participate in binding interactions, as demonstrated by Sharpless's 2002 in situ click chemistry work on acetylcholinesterase that achieved femtomolar inhibition. The article characterizes TPD as a more complex field than GPCR dimer targeting because it involves forcing proteins together that normally don't interact. Finally, it notes that TPD remains highly empirical and suggests that progress was historically slowed both by rigid molecular weight rules (Rule of Five) and an unjustified bias against the unusual appearance of linked molecules.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication in November 2019, the targeted protein degradation (TPD) field experienced explosive growth with concrete clinical and commercial outcomes.

**Clinical Progress**: The first major milestone came in 2020 when Arvinas presented clinical data for ARV-110, a PROTAC targeting the androgen receptor for prostate cancer. By 2023–2024, multiple PROTACs moved into late-stage clinical trials. ARV-471 (Arvinas/Pfizer) for ER-positive breast cancer reached Phase 3 trials with encouraging efficacy signals. ARV-766 (Arvinas) also progressed in prostate cancer trials. Beyond PROTACs, molecular glues showed renewed interest with iberdomide and mezigdomide advancing in multiple myeloma treatment.

**Regulatory Approvals**: No TPD drugs received full FDA approval by early 2024, but the progress from first-in-human trials toward Phase 3 represents substantial clinical validation of the mechanism. Traditional bivalent approaches in other therapeutic areas saw continued success, including bispecific antibodies where multiple products gained approval (e.g., teclistamab for multiple myeloma in 2022).

**Scientific Understanding**: The empirical nature described in 2019 began shifting toward more rational design. Publications increasingly reported ternary complex crystal structures—Arvinas disclosed the first PROTAC-induced complex structures in 2022. New computational methods emerged to better predict linker effects and ternary complex formation. The "linkerology" challenge remains partially empirical but with improved mechanistic understanding.

**Adoption and Commercial Impact**: Major pharmaceutical companies substantially increased TPD investments after 2019. Pfizer's expanded partnership with Arvinas, Roche's acquisitions of BMS assets, and standalone TPD companies (Nurix Therapeutics, Kymera Therapeutics) saw significant funding. Based on clinical trial registration and published papers, the number of TPD-based programs grew from dozens in 2019 to hundreds by 2024.

**Method Evolution**: New ubiquitin ligase recruiters expanded beyond the traditional cereblon-based systems. Companies developed tissue-selective or conditional degrader systems. The field also expanded into lysosomal targeting (LYTACs) and autophagy-based approaches, validated by results in animal models and early human trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2019 article contained several observations that can be compared against subsequent developments:

**Prediction:** "TPD remains a rather. . . empirical . . . field for now"  
**Outcome:** This remained largely accurate through 2024. While improved computational tools and structural data provided some rational design principles, a significant empirical component persists. Optimization still requires testing multiple linkers and configurations. The trend has moved toward partial rationalization while maintaining empirical screening.

**Implication about molecular weight rules breaking down:**  
**Outcome:** Confirmed. The trend away from rigid Rule of Five adherence continued. PROTACs commonly exceed 1000 Da and succeeded clinically despite violating traditional rules. The field matured to evaluate membrane permeability and oral bioavailability as composite properties rather than molecular weight cutoffs.

**Notion that progress was historically delayed by molecules "looking strange":**  
**Outcome:** The field moved decisively past this bias. Bifunctional molecules became mainstream in pharmaceutical R&D rather than academic curiosities. This reflected broader industry maturation beyond simplistic drug-likeness filters toward mechanism-based design.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides useful historical context for an important trend in drug discovery. While it lacks the transformational impact of a breakthrough paper, it accurately identified lasting challenges and predicted the field's maturation beyond naive design biases.
