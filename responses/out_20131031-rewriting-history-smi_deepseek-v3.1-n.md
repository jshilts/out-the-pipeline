# Rewriting History at the Smithsonian? (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 commentary critiques the NIH and Smithsonian's decision to celebrate the "10th anniversary of the sequencing of the human genome" based on the 2003 completion date, rather than the more widely recognized 2001 milestone. The author argues this revisionist approach downplays the dramatic race between the public Human Genome Project (led by Francis Collins at NIH) and Craig Venter's private Celera Genomics, which resulted in simultaneous publications of draft human genome sequences in February 2001 in *Science* and *Nature*. The piece highlights that the Smithsonian's "Genome: Unlocking Life's Code" exhibit claims it took until 2003, $3 billion, and thousands of scientists to sequence the human genome, thereby minimizing Venter's contributions and the competitive dynamic that accelerated the achievement. The author compares this to celebrating the final Apollo mission rather than the first moon landing, arguing that 2001 was when the historic breakthrough occurred and captured global attention.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2013 controversy, several relevant developments occurred:

- Craig Venter's scientific reputation remained strong, but no Nobel Prize was awarded for the Human Genome Project to either Venter or Francis Collins in subsequent years (through 2024). The Nobel Prize scrutiny likely considered the competitive and controversial aspects highlighted in this article.

- The 2003 "completion" date for the Human Genome Project has largely remained the official milestone in institutional narratives. NIH and major scientific organizations continue to reference 2003 for the "finished" human genome sequence, though the field increasingly emphasizes the reality that the genome was a work in progress through subsequent years.

- The cost of genome sequencing plummeted dramatically post-2013. By 2015, sequencing costs dropped below $1,000 per genome (from the original $3 billion), accelerating clinical applications. This economic transformation made the "completion" question less relevant as the technology democratized.

- The subsequent development of precision medicine initiatives relied heavily on genomic sequencing infrastructure. The 2015 launch of the Precision Medicine Initiative (renamed All of Us Research Program) built directly on both the 2001 draft and 2003 completion, treating them as complementary milestones rather than competing narratives.

- No major institutional narrative shift occurred at the Smithsonian. The museum field continued to present various facets of gene expression research without dramatic reorientation around this controversy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions about future biotechnology developments appear in this article. The piece focuses entirely on retrospective analysis of historical credit assignment. The implicit assumption that Venter's contributions deserved Nobel recognition did not materialize in subsequent years, suggesting the Nobel committee remained hesitant about the disputed credit allocation.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an important but narrow historiographic dispute within a specific scientific community. While it touches on broader themes of scientific credit, competition, and institutional narrative control, the core controversy has limited ongoing relevance to biotechnology development or clinical impact.
