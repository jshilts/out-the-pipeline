# Then I Felt Like Some Watcher of the Skies. . . (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the state of drug discovery in 2007, focusing on the waning dogmatism around Lipinski's "Rule of Five" (Ro5). The Rule of Five, introduced around 1997 by Christopher Lipinski, provides four simple criteria for predicting oral bioavailability and became a commandment in medicinal chemistry for filtering drug candidates.

The article notes that the Ro5 was being applied almost indiscriminately, despite evidence that successful drugs like Lipitor (atorvastatin) violated these rules. More importantly, the author observes that despite widespread adoption of these "magic rules," the number of new chemical entities reaching the market had remained constant or even declined—raising questions about whether these rules were helping focus on the right molecules or preventing discovery of new opportunities.

The author uses an astronomical analogy, comparing medicinal chemistry to early sky watchers who could observe patterns but lacked deeper understanding. The field remained fundamentally observational rather than predictive, with practitioners relying on broad theories and rules of thumb that constantly surprised them with unexpected data. While hoping for better predictive tools, the author acknowledges that drug discovery systems are much messier than planetary motion and that simple mathematical theories wouldn't suffice.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2007, the field of drug discovery indeed moved away from Rule of Five dogmatism, validating the article's observations:

**Shift Toward Broader Chemical Space:** The industry increasingly recognized that many important drug targets—particularly those involving protein-protein interactions, epigenetic targets, and challenging biological mechanisms—required molecules outside Ro5 compliance. This led to the characterization of "beyond Rule of Five" (bRo5) chemical space.

**Clinical Success of Ro5 Violators:** Numerous drugs violating Ro5 achieved FDA approval and commercial success, including:
- Several kinase inhibitors for cancer treatment
- HIV protease inhibitors and other antiviral agents
- Immunosuppressants and anti-inflammatory drugs
- Targeted protein degraders (PROTACs) emerging in the 2010s

**Methodological Evolution:** The field developed more sophisticated approaches beyond simple property filters:
- Multi-parameter optimization (MPO) considering multiple drug-like properties simultaneously
- Machine learning models incorporating more complex molecular descriptors
- Improved understanding of molecular complexity and three-dimensional structure

**Continued Pipeline Challenges:** Despite these advances, the fundamental problem identified in 2007 persisted—pharmaceutical R&D productivity remained a challenge with high failure rates, though new modalities (antibody-drug conjugates, gene therapies, cell therapies) began showing promise in the 2010s.

**Computational Advances:** While no "airtight theoretical approach" emerged as predicted, significant progress occurred in computational chemistry, molecular dynamics, and AI-driven drug design in the 2010s and 2020s, though prediction accuracy remained far from perfect.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"Rule-of-Five dogmatism has been on the wane"** ✅ **Largely accurate.** The field did move away from strict Ro5 adherence toward more nuanced approaches like bRo5 design and multi-parameter optimization.

• **"Success can't be ensured by just matching a few basic properties"** ✅ **Accurate.** The subsequent decade-plus confirmed that drug discovery success requires complex consideration of multiple factors beyond simple property filters.

• **"We're not going to be so lucky [as Kepler/Newton], since the systems we're studying are so much messier"** ✅ **Accurate.** Despite advances in computational methods and AI, precise prediction of human pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity remains elusive. The field has made progress but has not achieved the kind of simple, universal laws that characterized planetary motion.

• **"I'm not expecting an airtight theoretical approach to predicting human blood levels or toxicity, not anytime soon"** ✅ **Accurate.** While computational tools improved significantly (especially with machine learning), truly predictive models for human outcomes remain challenging even in the 2020s.

• **The implicit hope that "some sense to be made out of what we've observed"** ⚠️ **Partially realized.** The field has made substantial progress in understanding drug design principles, but fundamental unpredictability remains a major challenge, especially for complex diseases and novel targets.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates impressive foresight about the evolution of drug discovery thinking, correctly anticipating the shift away from rigid adherence to simple rules toward more nuanced, multi-parameter approaches. Its astronomical analogy has proven prescient in describing the observational nature of medicinal chemistry, which remains relevant even as computational methods have advanced.
