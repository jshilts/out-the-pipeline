# Le Dernier Cri (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2007 commentary reflects on fashion trends in chemical reagents and reactions, noting how elements and catalytic methods rise and fall in popularity. Gold catalysis had recently surged from obscurity to ubiquity in organic chemistry literature. The author rules out several elements as ever becoming popular: tellurium due to toxicity and extreme odor, mercury due to waste disposal concerns and declining use, lead as historically limited, and beryllium as peculiarly toxic with no compelling synthetic applications. The article predicts that gold's spotlight will eventually fade and speculates that iridium—already present in catalysts but not yet a "go-to" choice—might emerge as the next hot element, potentially offering undiscovered reactivity worth publishing in top journals.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2007, gold catalysis continued its ascent rather than slowing down, establishing itself as a mainstream synthetic methodology across the 2010s. The field matured with systematic mechanistic understanding, including gold's dual role in activating π-bonds through π-acidity and carbophilic Lewis acidity. Major pharmaceutical companies integrated gold catalysis into drug discovery workflows, and several FDA-approved drugs or clinical candidates now feature gold-catalyzed steps in their synthetic routes.

Iridium catalysis indeed grew significantly, fulfilling the article's prediction. Iridium-based catalysts became essential for asymmetric hydrogenation, C–H functionalization, and photoredox catalysis—with applications in industrial pharmaceutical synthesis. For example, iridium photoredox catalysts enabled previously inaccessible transformations under mild conditions and became commercially available for drug discovery.

Heavy metals largely remained out of favor due to regulatory and environmental pressures, though mercury still finds niche academic applications. Green chemistry principles further marginalized toxic elements in industrial settings. The overall trend validated the author's assessment: fashion elements persisted or emerged based on utility and safety profiles, while toxic/problematic elements remained sidelined.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Gold catalysis would end/slow down**: This prediction was **inaccurate**. Gold catalysis maintained momentum through the 2010s, with expanded applications in natural product synthesis, drug discovery, and materials chemistry.  

• **Iridium as the next candidate**: This prediction was **accurate**. Iridium catalysis flourished in asymmetric hydrogenation, C–H activation, and photoredox catalysis, becoming a "go-to" method for challenging transformations in pharmaceutical R&D.  

• **Heavy metals remaining unpopular**: This prediction was **largely accurate**. Mercury, lead, and beryllium stayed marginalized due to toxicity concerns and waste disposal challenges, aligning with industrial green chemistry adoption.  

• **Organotellurium compounds staying unpopular**: This was **accurate—**tellurium chemistry remained a niche area, with no significant uptake in chemical synthesis despite known unique reactivity.  

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides insightful commentary on chemical reagent trends, successfully predicting iridium's rise and the continued sidelining of problematic elements, while capturing gold catalysis at its inflection point. The accurate foresight and practical industrial perspective make it a historically valuable snapshot, though its niche chemistry focus limits broader appeal.
