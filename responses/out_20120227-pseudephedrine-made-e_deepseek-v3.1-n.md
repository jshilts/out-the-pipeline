# Pseudophedrine Made Easy. Kind of. (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a satirical commentary about a fake research paper published in the Journal of Apocryphal Chemistry (an apparent parody journal). The "paper" proposes a supposedly convenient synthetic route to produce pseudophedrine—an over-the-counter decongestant that became increasingly regulated due to its use in illicit methamphetamine production.

The satirical proposal suggests using methamphetamine as the starting material to synthesize pseudophedrine, humorously noting that while pseudophedrine is difficult to obtain legally, methamphetamine "can be procured at almost any time on short notice." The purported synthesis involves complex organometallic chemistry including chromium carbonyl complexes and chiral lithium dianions. The author notes the technical unlikelihood of this approach working in practice, especially regarding chirality control. The piece appears to be social commentary on drug prohibition policies and their unintended consequences.

The fictional paper's authors are listed as "O. Hai and I. B. Hakkenshit" (phonetic wordplay), making clear the satirical nature.

## 2. HISTORY

The actual historical context involves the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which placed stringent controls on pseudophedrine sales by requiring pharmacies to keep products behind counters, limit purchase quantities, maintain logbooks, and require photo identification. These restrictions were implemented because pseudophedrine serves as a precursor in clandestine methamphetamine synthesis.

After 2012, several developments occurred:

**Regulatory tightening continued**: The Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act was introduced in Congress multiple times (2011, 2013, 2017) aiming to make pseudophedrine prescription-only, though these efforts did not pass at the federal level. Some states implemented additional restrictions.

**Real-world impact**: The regulations succeeded in reducing domestic methamphetamine production using pseudophedrine, but this led to increased importation of methamphetamine from Mexico. By 2012-2019, Mexican drug trafficking organizations increasingly supplied the US market with methamphetamine produced via different synthetic routes not requiring pseudophedrine.

**Scientific reality vs. satire**: No legitimate research has pursued methamphetamine-to-pseudophedrine synthesis as a practical approach. The complex organometallic chemistry described would be prohibitively expensive, technically challenging, and impractical compared to existing legal synthesis methods or the simpler illegal methods used in clandestine labs.

**The article's actual publication context**: This appears on "Science's blog post" section, with the article being clearly labeled as commentary on apocryphal (fake) chemistry. The Journal of Apocryphal Chemistry seems to be a satirical project, though I cannot confirm its continued existence or specific real-world impact.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contains satirical rather than genuinely predictive content:

• **Prediction**: The fictional paper suggests methamphetamine-to-pseudophedrine synthesis might become widespread
  **Reality**: No evidence exists of significant clandestine or legitimate use of this approach. The complexity and inefficiency make it impractical compared to alternatives.

• **Prediction (implicit)**: Stringent pseudophedrine controls might drive creative circumvention attempts
  **Reality**: The regulations did drive changes in illicit drug production, but toward Mexican importation and alternative precursors rather than the elaborate chemistry proposed.

• **Prediction**: The author "looks forward to seeing more from this paper's authors"
  **Reality**: This refers to fictional authors, acknowledging the satirical nature.

The satire accurately anticipated that prohibition would lead to adaptive circumvention strategies, though not the specific chemical route proposed.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article is moderately interesting as social satire that highlights policy ironies, but it has limited substantive scientific or policy importance.
