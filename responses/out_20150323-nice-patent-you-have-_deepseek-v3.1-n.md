# Nice Patent You Have There. . . (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a Bloomberg article describing how hedge funds were exploiting new patent challenge rules established by Congress in 2012. Under these rules, investors like Kyle Bass and Ferrum Ferro Capital were filing challenges to pharmaceutical patents, potentially to obtain payouts or profit from short positions in drug companies' stocks. The inter partes review (IPR) process only cost about $23,000 to file, making it an inexpensive tool for third parties to challenge patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). While the author expresses general sympathy for short-sellers, they express concern that this practice crosses a line from legitimate market activity into potentially abusive behavior, especially since investment funds typically lacked standing to challenge patents in federal court before these rules. The author notes the system was designed to combat "patent trolls" but questions whether this solution created new problems.

## 2. HISTORY

The strategy described evolved significantly after 2015, yielding mixed results and encountering substantial legal pushback. In July 2016, hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, through his Coalition for Affordable Drugs, challenged numerous pharmaceutical patents. In August 2016, the PTAB made an important decision by sanctioning the Coalition under 35 U.S.C. § 315(e), terminating proceedings, and finding the challenges were filed for non-patent purposes – essentially that the primary motive was financial gain rather than legitimate patent disputes. Courts subsequently found that IPR petitions are not immune from discovery regarding the petitioner's motives.

More importantly, the biopharmaceutical industry pursued legislative remedies. In September 2015, Senators Grassley and Leahy introduced the PATENT Act, which included provisions aimed at curbing abusive patent challenges. By 2021, the industry had shifted its focus toward strengthening post-grant proceedings. The America Invents Act reforms had unintended consequences: while the IPR system successfully reduced litigation from patent assertion entities (so-called "patent trolls"), it also created new vulnerabilities for legitimate patent holders. According to 2019 USPTO data, PTAB instituted IPR proceedings in roughly 60% of petitions, and patent claims were found unpatentable in about 70% of completed trials, demonstrating the system's significant impact on patent validity.

Texas Congressman Bob Goodlatte's Innovation Act, aimed at further patent reform, passed the House but stalled in the Senate due to concerns from both the biotechnology industry and trial lawyers. By 2017, the pendulum began swinging back toward patent owners, as courts increasingly scrutinized IPR practices and motives. A 2018 Supreme Court case, Oil States Energy Services v. Greene's Energy Group, upheld the constitutionality of IPR proceedings, but with important limitations on their scope. Throughout this period, many pharmaceutical companies adjusted their patent strategies, focusing more on stronger international patent protections and using alternative mechanisms such as PTE (patent term extension) and pediatric exclusivity rather than relying solely on U.S. patent challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article predicted that the relatively low cost ($23,000) of filing IPR challenges would make them attractive weapons for hedge funds and other third parties to challenge pharmaceutical patents
  - **Actual outcome**: This proved correct initially. Between 2015-2016, IPR filings against pharmaceutical companies surged, with dozens of challenges filed by entities including Bass's Coalition for Affordable Drugs. However, after 2016, the PTAB began sanctioning petitioners for improper motives, and courts allowed discovery into petitioners' financial interests, making the strategy less attractive and predictable.

• **Prediction**: The article warned that allowing investment funds – which traditionally lacked standing in federal court to challenge patents – a cheap pathway to invalidate patents might create "new shakedowns" to replace the old patent trolling problem
  - **Actual outcome**: This partially materialized. The IPR system did become a tool for some financially-motivated challenges, but not to the extent feared. The PTAB's 2016 sanctions, coupled with legislative efforts and judicial scrutiny, constrained the most aggressive practices. However, legitimate generic manufacturers and biosimilar developers continued using IPR proceedings effectively, creating a more nuanced landscape than simply replacing old problems with new ones.

• **Prediction**: The author suggested that the system was being used far more than the PTO expected (about five times anticipated volume), implying continued growth
  - **Actual outcome**: IPR filings continued rising, reaching peak volumes in 2017-2018 before stabilizing. However, the rapid growth shifted from primarily hedge fund-driven challenges to a broader mix including traditional generic drug manufacturers, competitors, and patent assertion entities. The system's costs also evolved as legal fees mounted for both petitioners and patent owners, making indiscriminate challenges less economically viable.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured an important and timely phenomenon at the intersection of patent law, financial markets, and pharmaceutical innovation. The specific practice it described proved somewhat ephemeral (declining after 2016-2017), but it highlighted broader tensions in patent policy that remain relevant today regarding how to balance preventing patent abuses while protecting legitimate intellectual property rights.
