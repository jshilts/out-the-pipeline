# Halogen Bonds (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary discusses the underappreciated phenomenon of halogen bonding in medicinal chemistry—specifically how chlorine, bromine, and iodine can act as Lewis acids despite their electronegativity. The mechanism involves a "sigma hole": a region of slight positive charge opposite the carbon-halogen bond that enables directed interactions with electron donors (O, N, S). While fluorine lacks this effect, heavier halogens show increasingly strong halogen bonds, expandable by adding fluorines (e.g., difluorochlorobenzene approaches bromobenzene strength). The author notes that medicinal chemists traditionally avoided heavier halogens due to their mass and hydrophobicity, but suggests halogen bonding offers targeted binding leverage worth exploiting, analogous to hydrogen bonds. The piece cites examples of chloro/bromo/iodo groups forming interactions that enhanced affinity, implying a practical design strategy may emerge.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication, halogen bonding rapidly transitioned from a curiosity into an established tool in rational drug design and materials science. Academic medicinal chemistry groups began systematically deploying halogen bonds to improve potency and selectivity, especially against challenging targets. Crystal structure surveys (e.g., PDB analyses) quantified the geometry and energetics of C–X···O/N halogen bonds, confirming their prevalence and validating their utility. By the late 2010s, halogen bonding was credited with improving pharmacokinetic properties and target engagement in several development campaigns.

Concrete impacts emerged in **approved drugs and clinical candidates**. Notable examples include marketed antiviral agents (e.g., hepatitis C NS5A inhibitors with halogen-bond-acceptor networks), kinase inhibitors, and antibacterial drugs whose binding relies on specific bromine/chlorine contacts. In other cases, promising candidates featuring engineered halogen bonds advanced through preclinical or clinical phases. However, the strategy is not universally applicable or risk-free—some programs saw entropic penalties or off-target effects, and halogen-heavy candidates sometimes struggled with ADME liabilities (metabolic lability with iodides, lipophilicity with bromides). Systematic computational methods and scoring functions (docking, free-energy perturbations) were developed to predict and rank C–X···acceptor interactions, improving success rates. Some companies explicitly built halogen-bond design into their screening and optimization workflows, while public repositories now curate halogen-bond motifs in protein–ligand complexes for ML/DL training sets.

While the article did not single out specific companies, larger biopharmas and CROs adapted their hit-to-lead and lead-optimization practices to consider halogen bonding more deliberately. Public policy did not change directly from this concept, though medicinal chemistry curricula and training materials evolved to routinely include halogen-bond lectures and tutorials. The overall legacy is a durable change in design thinking: heavier halogens are now regarded as multipurpose tools that can donate a controlled electrostatic interaction rather than merely serving as hydrophobic or steric spacers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction:** Heavier halogens (bromo, iodo) would be more widely adopted as medicinal chemists learn to "exploit" halogen bonding systematically.
  - **Outcome:** Mixed. Bromine use became moderately more common, with a number of approved drugs and candidates incorporating brominated aromatics that leverage C–Br···O/N contacts for potency or selectivity. Iodine remains rare due to mass and metabolic concerns, but appears in niche cases (e.g., thyroid hormones, certain imaging agents, and enzyme probes) where its stronger halogen bond proved decisive. Overall uptake was evolutionary rather than revolutionary.

- **Prediction:** Halogen bonding might be thought of "similarly to hydrogen bonds"—valuable but difficult to deploy intentionally and directionally.
  - **Outcome:** True. Computational tools and crystal-structure databases made halogen-bond placement more predictable, but success still requires careful geometry matching and consideration of donor/acceptor contexts. It has become another standard arrow in the medicinal chemist's quiver, not a universal solution.

- **Prediction:** Adding fluorines to halogenated aromatics (e.g., difluorochlorobenzene) would enhance the sigma hole and bring halogen-bond strength up toward that of heavier congeners.
  - **Outcome:** Validated in practice. Multiple studies confirmed that strategic fluorination tunes C–X···acceptor interaction strength; this became a practical design tactic in select programs.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article stands above average because it captured a turning point in medicinal chemistry: the move to treat halogen bonding as a rational, positionable interaction rather than an oddity. It stimulated design explorations that led to real-world drug candidates and improved outcomes.
