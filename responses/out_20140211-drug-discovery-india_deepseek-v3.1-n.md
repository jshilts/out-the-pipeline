# Drug Discovery in India (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary addresses the state of drug discovery in India through a question from molecular biologist Swapnika Ramu, who expressed pessimism after returning from PhD work in the US. The article identifies several key challenges: minimal new drug development activity in India, contentious drug pricing and patent disputes (referencing the Nexavar compulsory licensing and Novartis Glivec patent loss cases), a weak venture capital ecosystem for biopharma startups, and concerns about IP protection making Western pharma "skittish" about the Indian market. The author acknowledges India's large pool of trained scientists but notes quality variation, while questioning whether India should even attempt to replicate Western drug discovery models given the expense of target-based approaches. The piece explores whether India should "skip over small molecules" and focus on biologics/biotech instead, while recognizing higher barriers to entry. Ultimately, the author suggests India faces fundamental structural challenges in building an R&D ecosystem and may need to rely on comparative advantage rather than attempting to build domestic pharmaceutical innovation from scratch.

## 2. HISTORY

The ten years following this article revealed a remarkably different trajectory than the piece's pessimistic assessment.

**Clinical Research and Outsourcing Growth**: India's clinical trials industry expanded significantly, with the country becoming a major hub for clinical research outsourcing. By 2015-2020, India ranked among the top global destinations for clinical trials, with companies like Quintiles, Parexel, and local firms like GVK BIO handling substantial portions of global drug development pipelines.

**Vaccine Development Breakthrough**: Perhaps most dramatically, India's biotech sector achieved global recognition with the development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. The Serum Institute of India became the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, while Bharat Biotech developed Covaxin (BBV152), an indigenously developed whole-virion inactivated vaccine that received emergency use authorization in India and several other countries. By 2021-2022, India had administered over 1.8 billion COVID vaccine doses, with Covaxin accounting for approximately 15-20% of the domestic campaign.

**Biologics Manufacturing**: Contrary to the article's suggestion that biomolecules presented "higher barriers to entry," India's biologics sector grew substantially. Companies like Biocon developed biosimilar pipelines that gained FDA approval - notably Biocon's Ogivri (trastuzumab biosimilar) received FDA approval in 2017, marking a milestone for Indian biologics. Biocon's biosimilar revenues grew from $165 million in 2014 to over $500 million by 2019.

**Generic Industry Consolidation**: Indian generic manufacturers faced mixed fortunes. While companies like Sun Pharma, Dr. Reddy's, and Cipla maintained strong global positions, they encountered increasing FDA scrutiny and warning letters over manufacturing quality issues. The period saw multiple Indian facilities receive FDA import alerts, particularly between 2014-2017, though most major players eventually resolved compliance issues.

**Patent System Evolution**: India's patent landscape didn't deteoriate as the article feared. The Novartis Glivec case remained an outlier rather than establishing a pattern of widespread compulsory licensing. Subsequent years saw India grant pharmaceutical patents at comparable rates to other jurisdictions, and the anticipated "skittishness" from multinational pharma didn't materialize. Companies like Merck, Novartis, and Pfizer continued substantial operations in India, often expanding manufacturing and clinical research presence.

**Venture Capital Development**: The VC ecosystem did not emerge as a major force in Indian biotech, with most funding remaining government-driven or from corporate R&D arms. However, government initiatives like the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) provided alternative funding mechanisms that supported some innovation, though scale remained limited compared to US/EU ecosystems.

**New Drug Approvals**: India's regulatory system processed drugs more efficiently post-2017 with CDSCO reforms, but indigenous new molecular entity development remained modest. A handful of Indian-developed drugs reached markets (like Saroglitazar for diabetic dyslipidemia), but the country continued to rely heavily on generics and collaboration with multinationals for innovative therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about India's pharmaceutical development trajectory:

• **"India cannot keep depending upon Western pharma companies to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to developing new drugs"** - This proved largely accurate in the sense that India did develop its own vaccine capabilities (Covaxin) and some biosimilars, but the country remains heavily dependent on Western innovation for novel therapeutic approaches and continues to focus primarily on generics manufacturing.

• **"the barriers to entry in biotech-derived drugs are higher"** - This was technically true but didn't prevent Indian companies from succeeding; Biocon's biosimilars achieved FDA approval and commercial success, demonstrating that barriers were surmountable.

• **"you would need a VC culture, which isn't there yet"** - This prediction proved correct; venture capital never developed as a major force in Indian biotech, with most innovation funded through corporate R&D or government programs.

• **"for the government to get involved to try to start something, but I would have very low hopes for that"** - This proved overly pessimistic; government programs like BIRAC and initiatives supporting vaccine development (including COVID response) were reasonably effective, though broader drug discovery remained limited.

• **"India, China, and a few other countries will end up with more totally R&D-driven biomedical research companies"** - This prediction was only partially fulfilled. China dramatically exceeded expectations with companies like BeiGene and Innovent developing global pipelines, while India's progress was more modest, focused on vaccines, biosimilars, and incremental innovation rather than breakthrough R&D-driven companies.

• **"Trying to build your own Pfizer is a bad idea"** - This prediction was accurate; no Indian company approached Big Pharma scale or innovation output, and most successful Indian pharma companies remained generics-focused with targeted biosimilar/biologic expansions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates significant foresight about structural limitations (particularly regarding VC funding and the difficulty of replicating Western R&D models), but dramatically underestimated India's capacity in biologics manufacturing and vaccine development. The 2020-2022 COVID pandemic revealed capabilities the author didn't anticipate, making this piece a valuable case study in how quickly specialized sectors can develop even amid broader ecosystem challenges.
