# J. Already Known Chem. (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post criticizes a JACS paper from Harvard and Salk Institute researchers on oxyntomodulin, a 37-amino acid peptide hormone related to glucagon that acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The paper identified proteolytic cleavage sites in the hormone using mass spectrometry, then created stabilized analogs by mutating arginine residues to alanine. The authors presented this as a novel approach for developing proteolysis-resistant peptide hormone analogs.

The blogger's criticism centers on the fact that this approach—identifying cleavage sites and making stabilizing mutations—was already standard practice in peptide drug development for many years. The article questions why this routine methodology warranted publication in a top-tier journal like JACS, suggesting the work lacked innovation and represented established techniques being presented as novel discoveries.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2014 publication controversy, several developments occurred in peptide drug development and oxyntomodulin research:

**Peptide Stabilization Methods:** The stabilization techniques discussed (cleavage site identification and amino acid substitution) remained standard industry practice. Companies continued using DPP-IV resistant modifications, fatty acid conjugation (acylation), PEGylation, and fusion proteins to extend peptide half-lives. Drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy), approved in 2017 and 2021 respectively, employed fatty acid side chains for once-weekly dosing rather than simple alanine mutations.

**Oxyntomodulin Development:** No oxyntomodulin analog based on the described mutations reached FDA approval or market application. While GLP-1 receptor agonists became a massive market segment (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide generating billions in revenue), these successful drugs used different stabilization strategies. The specific approach described in the criticized paper did not translate into clinical or commercial success.

**Scientific Publishing:** The incident highlighted ongoing concerns about research novelty requirements in high-impact journals. However, no significant policy changes resulted from this specific case.

**Broader Peptide Drug Market:** The peptide therapeutics market grew substantially post-2014, reaching approximately $35-40 billion by 2022-2023, but this growth was driven by established stabilization technologies rather than the method described in the paper.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Paper's prediction:** The authors claimed their approach "should be applicable to the preparation of numerous peptide hormone analogs with improved pharmacological properties" and could help "fill the pipeline with more candidates"
  - **Reality:** The specific stabilization technique did not become widely adopted for next-generation therapeutics. Major peptide drug advances came from different stabilization methods (acylation, PEGylation, fusion proteins)

- **Implicit prediction:** That this methodology represented a novel contribution to the field
  - **Reality:** As the blogger correctly identified, this was established practice that did not need reinvention or rediscovery

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile due to its insightful critique of scientific publishing norms and its accurate assessment of what constitutes genuine innovation versus established methodology, providing valuable perspective on biopharmaceutical research practices.
