# Makena's Market. Or Lack of One (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses KV Pharmaceuticals' struggle to commercialize Makena, a progesterone injection approved to reduce the risk of preterm birth in high-risk pregnant women. With a potential market of approximately 140,000 eligible women annually, the drug had achieved only about 2,400 patient treatments since its March 2011 launch—representing roughly 2-3% market penetration. The poor sales performance was attributed to two key factors: Makena's high price point and the FDA's reluctance to enforce regulations against compounding pharmacies that continued to produce cheaper versions of the hormone therapy. The author characterizes this as a significant shortfall from KV's likely sales projections.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Makena's market trajectory remained troubled for years. In 2012, KV Pharmaceuticals filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, driven largely by the Makena commercialization failure. The company eventually emerged from bankruptcy as Lumara Health in 2014, which was then acquired by AMAG Pharmaceuticals in 2014 for approximately \$340 million—an acquisition price significantly influenced by Makena's commercial underperformance.

The pricing controversy continued: Makena launched at over \$1,500 per injection course, while compounded versions remained available for under \$50, leading to widespread criticism from physicians, patients, and payers. Despite efforts to rebrand and revise pricing strategies, uptake remained limited compared to projections.

In October 2020, the FDA announced it would begin enforcing against compounding pharmacies producing Makena alternatives, strengthening the brand's market position. However, the drug faced additional challenges—in 2023, an FDA advisory committee voted that Makena did not demonstrate a positive benefit-risk profile based on post-approval studies, leading to a recommended withdrawal from the market. The drug's manufacturer voluntarily withdrew Makena from the US market on April 6, 2023 after failing to definitively prove clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article implied KV's sales projections far exceeded the 2-3% market penetration achieved, suggesting the company had significantly overestimated commercial viability.
  
  **Outcome**: This proved correct—the sustained low market penetration contributed directly to KV's 2012 bankruptcy filing, validating that commercial projections vastly exceeded realistic adoption rates.

• **Prediction**: High pricing combined with FDA's non-enforcement stance toward compounders would continue hampering sales.
  
  **Outcome**: This dynamic persisted for nearly a decade, with compounded alternatives remaining widely available until FDA enforcement began in 2020, limiting Makena's revenue potential throughout most of its market life.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 6**

This article correctly identified a recurring challenge in specialty pharma—navigating the intersection of pricing, regulatory enforcement, and compounded alternatives. Its analysis demonstrated prescient understanding of how these factors would undermine commercial success, making it a useful case study in pharmaceutical market access.
