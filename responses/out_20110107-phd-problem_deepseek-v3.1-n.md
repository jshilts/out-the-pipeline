# The PhD Problem (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article addresses the systemic oversupply of PhDs relative to academic job openings, highlighting a structural misalignment where doctorate programs produce more graduates than the academic market can absorb. It references an Economist analysis describing research doctorates as problematic, with critics comparing the system to "Ponzi or pyramid schemes" due to the disconnect between training purpose and employment reality. The piece notes that while a doctorate is designed for academic careers, the number of PhD positions bears no relation to job availability, and business leaders paradoxically complain about shortages of high-level skills despite the PhD surplus. Dropout rates are substantial—only 57% of doctoral students in America complete their PhD within ten years, with humanities at 49%—indicating student discouragement. The author identifies misaligned incentives: universities and academics benefit from graduate students who bring grants and enhance publication records, even when this doesn't serve students' career interests. Science PhDs are described as having better industrial prospects than humanities doctorates, where industrial employment concepts barely exist.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following 2011, the PhD oversupply problem persisted and arguably intensified, with several concrete developments:

**Academic Job Market Deterioration**: The academic job market continued its decades-long decline, with tenure-track positions becoming increasingly scarce across most disciplines. The 2008 financial crisis had already reduced university hiring, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 caused further contractions. Many institutions shifted toward contingent faculty positions (adjuncts, lecturers) rather than tenure-track roles.

**Growth of Alternative Careers**: The "alt-ac" (alternative academic) movement gained momentum, with PhD recipients increasingly pursuing careers in industry, government, consulting, and nonprofit sectors. Major technology companies, pharmaceutical firms, and research institutes became significant employers of PhD holders, particularly in STEM fields. However, humanities PhDs continued facing the most limited opportunities.

**Policy and Institutional Responses**: Some universities began implementing reforms, such as limiting PhD program sizes, improving career counseling, and integrating professional development into graduate training. Government funding agencies in various countries started requiring better career outcome tracking and support for non-academic career paths.

**Industry Skill Mismatch Continued**: Business complaints about skill shortages persisted despite PhD oversupply, suggesting the mismatch between PhD training and industry needs remained unresolved. Particularly in biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, companies continued reporting difficulty finding candidates with the right combination of technical expertise and business/practical skills.

**Graduate Student Unionization**: Labor organizing among graduate students increased, with more institutions recognizing graduate student unions and addressing issues like stipend levels, healthcare, and working conditions—reflecting growing recognition of graduate students as workers rather than merely apprentices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Talk of a 'higher education bubble' may not be idle chatter"**: The higher education bubble narrative gained significant traction, particularly regarding student debt, but the predicted catastrophic collapse didn't materialize. Enrollment pressures and financial strains on institutions did intensify, with some smaller colleges closing, but the system largely persisted through incremental adaptations rather than dramatic collapse.

- **Implicit prediction that humanities PhDs face worse prospects than STEM**: This proved accurate. Humanities PhDs continued experiencing the most severe job market challenges, with many fields showing limited growth in academic positions and few industrial alternatives. STEM PhDs, particularly in biotechnology, computer science, and engineering, found better industry opportunities.

- **Suggestion that the fundamental incentive misalignment would persist without systemic reform**: This proved largely correct. While some individual programs implemented changes, the core structural issues—academic self-interest in maintaining graduate programs, misalignment between training and career outcomes, and oversupply relative to academic positions—persisted through the following decade.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
The article identified a structural problem in higher education that has persisted and evolved over more than a decade, remaining highly relevant as the PhD oversupply crisis continued affecting thousands of students annually and informing ongoing policy discussions about graduate education reform.
