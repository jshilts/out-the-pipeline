# One Darn Miracle After Another (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the case of Andrew Stimpson, a British man who claimed to have naturally cleared HIV from his body without antiretroviral therapy. In 2002, Stimpson received a positive HIV diagnosis based on two antibody tests showing extremely low viral load. By late 2003, he tested negative and subsequently sued the British health trust that conducted the original tests, initially claiming the positive results were errors. When the lawsuit yielded no damages, Stimpson changed his story and sold it to British tabloids as a "miracle recovery" from HIV, claiming he had gotten rid of the virus from his body. He refused further testing and became unavailable to researchers. The author expresses extreme skepticism, noting that false-positive HIV test rates are far higher than spontaneous HIV clearance rates. The commentary concludes that the most plausible explanation is either an initial false positive or the possibility that Stimpson remains infected.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Stimpson Case After 2005:**
Andrew Stimpson never became available for the comprehensive scientific testing that researchers requested. No peer-reviewed studies were published about his case, and he did not participate in HIV research. The story largely disappeared from mainstream scientific discourse after the initial media coverage died down.

**Spontaneous HIV Clearance - The Broader Scientific Record:**
The scientific consensus remains that spontaneous HIV clearance is exceptionally rare. The few documented cases of apparent HIV clearance (such as the "Berlin Patient" Timothy Brown in 2007, the "London Patient" in 2019, and the "Düsseldorf Patient" in 2023) all involved intensive medical interventions:
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplants from CCR5-Δ32 donors (a genetic mutation conferring HIV resistance)
- These cases required chemotherapy, immunosuppression, and months of hospitalization
- They represent treatment-driven cures, not spontaneous clearance

**HIV "Elite Controllers" - The Follow-up:**
Research subsequent to 2005 identified a small subset of HIV-positive individuals called "elite controllers" who can suppress HIV without medication. However:
- This represents less than 0.5% of HIV-positive individuals
- These individuals still carry HIV DNA integrated into their cells
- They are not considered cured and remain at risk for HIV-related complications

**The Matthias Rath Connection:**
Matthias Rath, the vitamin seller mentioned in Stimpson's story, faced continued controversy and legal action. In 2008, the South African Supreme Court ruled that Rath's vitamin trials were illegal, and his organization was ordered to pay significant damages. Rath's claims that vitamins could cure HIV/AIDS were widely condemned by the scientific community as dangerous misinformation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions Made in the Article:**
- The author predicted the most likely scenario was either a false positive or that Stimpson remained infected
- The article suggested Stimpson would not cooperate with further scientific investigation
- Implicitly predicted this case would not lead to scientific breakthroughs in HIV treatment

**What Actually Happened:**
- ✓ **Correct:** Stimpson never underwent comprehensive testing or participated in research
- ✓ **Correct:** The case did not result in any scientific advances in HIV treatment
- ✓ **Correct:** The story faded from scientific significance
- ✓ **Correct:** HIV spontaneous clearance remains vanishingly rare - subsequent research showed that of the billions of HIV infections worldwide, no well-documented cases of true spontaneous clearance have been confirmed
- ✓ **Correct:** Alternative explanations (testing error or ongoing infection) proved to be the most likely scenarios

The author's skepticism was well-founded given the available evidence at the time and subsequent developments over nearly two decades.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

The Stimpson case itself is primarily of historical interest as a media story that highlighted the importance of scientific skepticism. While it touches on the broader scientific question of HIV clearance/cure that remains highly relevant, this specific incident generated more tabloid headlines than scientific insights and had no long-term impact on HIV research or treatment development.
