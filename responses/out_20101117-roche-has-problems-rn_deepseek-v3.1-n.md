# Roche Has Problems - But RNA Interference Has More (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Roche's announcement of a 6% worldwide headcount reduction in November 2010, which was largely expected given ongoing pharmaceutical industry trends. However, the more significant news was Roche's decision to abandon RNA interference (RNAi) as a drug development mechanism, representing a major vote of no-confidence in the technology.

The article highlights the ripple effects of this decision on smaller RNAi-focused companies. Alnylam, considered the field leader, had received over $300 million from Roche in 2007 but faced the end of that partnership. This came shortly after Novartis ended its own five-year collaboration with Alnylam, though Novartis retained rights to continue developing targets from the collaboration. Tekmira, which had a nanoparticle RNAi delivery deal with Roche, also faced disruption but maintained other partnerships. The author questions whether other major pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Pfizer would follow Roche's lead or view this as a market opportunity with reduced competition.

## 2. HISTORY
The years following this 2010 article revealed a more nuanced story for RNAi therapeutics than Roche's exit suggested. While RNAi faced significant challenges and several early clinical setbacks, the field ultimately achieved major breakthroughs.

**Clinical and Regulatory Success:**
The first RNAi therapeutic, Alnylam's patisiran (Onpattro), received FDA approval in August 2018 for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR). This was followed by several other FDA approvals including givosiran (Givlaari) in 2019, lumasiran (Oxlumo) in 2020, and inclisiran (Leqvio) in 2021. These approvals represented the culmination of decades of research and validated RNAi as a viable therapeutic modality.

**Delivery Technology Advances:**
One of the key challenges mentioned in the article - delivery mechanisms - saw significant improvement. Enhanced delivery platforms, particularly lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugation, improved the ability to target RNAi therapeutics to specific tissues and cells, addressing one of the field's fundamental technical hurdles.

**Business Developments:**
Contrary to the bleak outlook presented in 2010, Alnylam's stock value increased significantly, and the company became profitable. Novartis continued licensing agreements with RNAi companies and brought inclisiran to market. The field saw sustained investment with multiple companies (Alnylam, Dicerna [acquired by Novo Nordisk], and others) maintaining viable business models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not present explicit predictions about RNAi's future success or failure. Rather, it analyzed Roche's strategic decision as a vote of no-confidence, implying skepticism about the technology's viability as a drug discovery platform based on a major pharmaceutical company's withdrawal.

**Implicit Assessment vs. Outcomes:**
- **Implicit prediction**: Roche's exit suggested RNAi faced fundamental challenges as a therapeutic approach
- **Reality**: RNAi became an established therapeutic modality with multiple FDA-approved drugs and a robust pipeline
- **Implicit prediction**: Other pharmaceutical companies might follow Roche's lead in abandoning RNAi research
- **Reality**: While some companies restructured their RNAi programs, the field saw sustained investment and ultimately successful commercialization
- **Implicit prediction**: The delivery challenges highlighted might prove insurmountable
- **Reality**: Delivery technology advancements (LNP and GalNAc platforms) largely solved these problems

## 4. INTEREST
Score: 8/9

The article captures a pivotal moment in RNAi's development - a major pharmaceutical company's strategic withdrawal that seemed to signal the technology's limited therapeutic potential. The interest derives from how mistaken this assessment proved to be, as RNAi ultimately succeeded as a therapeutic modality, offering important lessons about technology maturation timelines in biotechnology and the challenges of predicting therapeutic platform success from early-stage setbacks.
