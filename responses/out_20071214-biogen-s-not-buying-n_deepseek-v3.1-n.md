# Biogen's Not For Buying. For Now (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This December 2007 commentary discusses Biogen Idec's decision to take itself off the market after approximately one month of being up for sale. The author views this as positive news for Biogen's employees (who would face redundancies in a merger) and for the biotech industry's "genetic diversity," preferring multiple competing firms over consolidation. The article identifies several parties harmed by the failed sale: investors who bought stock at elevated levels (BIIB fell from ~$75 to ~$54 on the news), employees holding company stock/options, speculators in similar biotech stocks like Genzyme (which also declined), and investment bankers who lost potential M&A fees. The piece notes that major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer evaluated but ultimately passed on the deal, partly due to Biogen's drugs being tied up in external collaborations, raising questions about biotech valuations. Carl Icahn is mentioned as a potential activist investor who may have been hedged or could now acquire more shares at lower prices. The author anticipates future M&A cycles as large companies still need to strengthen their pipelines.

## 2. HISTORY

Biogen Idec remained independent following this 2007 episode and has since undergone significant transformation. The company continued operating as Biogen Idec until 2015, when it rebranded to **Biogen**. Throughout this period, the company maintained its focus on neurodegenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis, and rare diseases.

Following the 2007-2008 period, Biogen's therapeutic pipeline evolved considerably. The company continued to develop its established products while advancing new candidates. Most notably, in subsequent years Biogen would face major successes and controversies, particularly around its Alzheimer's disease programs.

The consolidation trends mentioned in the article did continue in the broader biotech/pharmaceutical industry, with numerous major M&A deals occurring in subsequent years. However, Biogen itself remained independent through multiple additional speculation cycles about potential acquisitions. The company's stock price and market valuation fluctuated significantly based on clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, and market conditions.

Carl Icahn continued his activist investor activities in biotech and other sectors beyond this 2007 Biogen situation, pursuing various other targets in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **More M&A cycles coming**: The article predicted that large companies would still need to "shore up their portfolios" and that M&A fever would recur. **Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate broadly - the pharmaceutical industry experienced numerous major acquisitions in subsequent years (e.g., Pfizer's acquisitions continued, and many other major deals occurred). However, Biogen itself remained independent rather than being acquired.

• **Carl Icahn's continued involvement**: The piece speculated Icahn might be hedged or could "pick up some more shares" if he believed the company was undervalued. **Outcome**: While Icahn remained active in biotech activism, his specific level of continued involvement with Biogen following this period is unclear without access to detailed shareholder records.

• **Impact on other biotech valuations**: The author suggested the failed deal might indicate that "other buyout candidates should [not] be commanding the prices that they've been." **Outcome**: This was partially accurate - while M&A activity continued, valuation pressures and deal scrutiny did affect market dynamics in subsequent years, particularly around companies with complex collaboration structures.

• **Biogen's strategic direction**: The implied prediction was that remaining independent would allow Biogen to continue developing its small-molecule expertise and maintain its research approach. **Outcome**: Biogen did continue operating independently and maintained its research focus, though the company navigated significant clinical and regulatory challenges in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article captures a specific moment in a company's history and broader industry dynamics, but lacks the broader scientific or medical significance of other biotech analyses. While it provides insight into M&A dynamics and market speculation, it doesn't address fundamental scientific questions or long-term therapeutic developments that characterize the most impactful biotech commentary.
