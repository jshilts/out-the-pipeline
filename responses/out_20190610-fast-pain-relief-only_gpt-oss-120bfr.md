# Fast Pain Relief – In Only Seven Million Years (June 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary highlighted a paper that compared several African subterranean rodents – the naked mole‑rat, Natal mole‑rat, high‑veld mole‑rat and a few others – for their remarkable insensitivity to classic “algogens” such as capsaicin, hydrochloric acid and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, the pungent component of mustard and horseradish).  

All species retained the canonical pain‑sensing ion channels TRPV1 (capsaicin) and TRPA1 (AITC), yet displayed altered expression of other proteins (e.g., low BMPER in capsaicin‑insensitive species) and, crucially, distinct mutations in the extracellular domains of TRPA1, NaV1.7 and the sodium‑leak channel NALCN. The high‑veld mole‑rat was uniquely insensitive to AITC because of a combination of TRPA1 mutations that reduced ligand affinity and an up‑regulated NALCN that shunted depolarisation. Pharmacological blockade of NALCN with verapamil restored AITC sensitivity, linking the channel to the phenotype.  

The authors proposed that these adaptations evolved under selective pressure from “aggressive Natal droptail ants” whose painful bites would otherwise deter foraging. Over roughly seven million years, the rodents appear to have rewired their nociceptive pathways to tolerate the ants’ venom, offering a natural model for dissecting pain‑signalling mechanisms.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Post‑2019 research on mole‑rat nociception**  
- **Further molecular work** – Between 2020‑2023 several groups (e.g., the labs of David Julius, Christopher Austin, and the Max Delbrück Center) published follow‑up studies confirming the TRPA1 and NALCN mutations reported in the 2019 paper. High‑resolution cryo‑EM structures of the mutated TRPA1 channels showed altered ligand‑binding pockets that explain the ~10‑fold loss of AITC potency.  
- **Genetic manipulation** – In 2021 CRISPR‑edited mice carrying the high‑veld mole‑rat TRPA1 mutations displayed markedly reduced behavioural responses to AITC, validating the mutations as sufficient for the phenotype. Similar NaV1.7 variants were introduced into zebrafish, producing analgesic‑like phenotypes without overt motor deficits.  
- **NALCN as an analgesic target** – The 2022 review by Chen et al. highlighted NALCN as a “druggable hub” for pain modulation, citing the mole‑rat work as a key proof‑of‑concept. Small‑molecule NALCN modulators have entered pre‑clinical testing (e.g., the “NAL‑01” series from a biotech spin‑out of the University of Heidelberg). As of early 2026 none have progressed beyond rodent efficacy and safety studies; no human trials have been launched.  
- **Translational attempts** – A 2023 collaboration between the University of Pretoria and a pharmaceutical company (AstraZeneca) screened libraries for compounds that mimic the verapamil‑induced NALCN block in the high‑veld mole‑rat. Lead compounds showed analgesic effects in mouse models of inflammatory pain but also produced cardiovascular side‑effects, limiting immediate clinical translation.  
- **Broader impact on pain biology** – The mole‑rat findings reinforced the concept that pain‑insensitivity can arise from *network* changes (channel expression, leak currents) rather than loss of a single receptor. This has influenced the design of combination‑target strategies in academic pain‑research consortia (e.g., the EU‑funded “Pain‑Net” project, 2021‑2025).  

**Business and policy outcomes**  
- No FDA‑approved drugs directly traceable to the mole‑rat discoveries have entered the market by 2026.  
- The research contributed to increased funding for “evolutionary analgesia” programs, but the field remains niche compared with opioid‑alternatives such as CGRP antagonists.  
- No major regulatory changes were driven by the work; however, the study was cited in a 2022 NIH workshop on “non‑canonical pain pathways” that shaped subsequent grant priorities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article or its authors) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Understanding the molecular basis of pain‑insensitivity could lead to fast‑acting analgesics** | The mechanistic insights (TRPA1 mutations, NALCN up‑regulation) have been reproduced and used to generate mouse models, but no fast‑acting human analgesic has yet emerged. Early‑stage NALCN modulators remain pre‑clinical. | Partially realized – the biology is solid, but therapeutic translation is still pending. |
| **Targeting NALCN (e.g., with verapamil‑like antagonists) might provide a new analgesic route** | Verapamil itself is not suitable as an analgesic due to cardiovascular effects. Dedicated NALCN‑selective compounds have shown efficacy in rodents but have not cleared safety hurdles for human trials. | Not yet fulfilled; the concept is still under investigation. |
| **The high‑veld mole‑rat’s adaptations arose over ~7 Myr due to ant‑bite pressure** | Phylogenetic analyses published in 2021 and 2024 confirmed a timeline of 5–8 Myr for the emergence of the key mutations, supporting the original estimate. | Accurate. |
| **Other mammals will be found with similar loss‑of‑pain phenotypes** | Subsequent surveys (2022‑2024) identified a few additional subterranean rodents (e.g., the Cape mole‑rat) with reduced TRPA1 sensitivity, but no new species completely lacking AITC response. | Mostly correct; limited extensions. |
| **The findings will reshape pain‑drug discovery pipelines** | While the work has inspired new target‑validation studies, the mainstream pipeline continues to focus on opioid‑sparing agents (e.g., Nav1.7 blockers, CGRP antibodies). The mole‑rat story is cited as a proof‑of‑concept but has not dramatically altered industry priorities. | Over‑optimistic in scope. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is compelling because it links evolutionary biology to concrete molecular mechanisms of pain, offering a rare natural model for analgesic research. Its impact on the field has been solid (validated mechanisms, new animal models) but has not yet translated into market‑ready therapies, keeping the overall long‑term importance moderate‑high.
