# How the New BioPharma IPOs Have Been Doing (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reviews Bruce Booth's analysis of biotech IPO performance during the 2013-2014 window, examining returns for different classes of investors from founders through public market buyers. The analysis reveals a bifurcated market: approximately equal numbers of top-quintile performers achieving >5x returns and money-losing investments, with significant performance spread across outcomes. A notable finding was that post-IPO trading contributed substantially to overall returns, with many offerings trading up significantly after going public, sometimes doubling or tripling in value. The strong overall performance helped sustain the biotech IPO market momentum despite predictions of a downturn.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 biotech IPO market analysis captured early momentum in what became an extended biotech boom cycle. Looking back from the present:

**Market Trajectory:** The 2013-2015 period represented the beginning of a multi-year biotech bull market that peaked around 2021, followed by a significant correction starting in 2022. The IPO window remained robust through 2020, particularly benefiting from pandemic-related enthusiasm for therapeutic companies.

**Post-IPO Performance Reality:** Many of the 2013-2014 IPO cohort experienced dramatic post-offering appreciation, but with notable volatility. Companies like bluebird bio, Spark Therapeutics, and others saw significant valuation swings over the subsequent years, reflecting both clinical successes and failures.

**Investment Returns:** The prediction of bifurcated outcomes proved accurate. While some companies delivered substantial returns, many others struggled with clinical setbacks, regulatory challenges, or commercial failures. The "top decile" outcomes did emerge, but the risk profile remained high.

**Market Evolution:** The biotech financing environment evolved significantly post-2014, with increased sophistication around clinical validation points, regulatory pathways, and commercial viability assessments becoming more central to investor decision-making.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions present in the article:**

• **Bifurcated Outcomes:** ✓ **Accurate** - The biotech sector continued to show extreme performance dispersion, with clear winners and losers, validating the "top decile vs. money-losers" dichotomy

• **Continued IPO Market Strength:** ✓ **Accurate** - Despite "predictions of a dip," the biotech IPO window remained robust for several more years, lasting through 2020-2021

• **Post-IPO Outperformance:** ✓ **Mixed** - While many companies did appreciate post-IPO, market volatility, clinical failures, and sector corrections meant this wasn't universally sustained

• **Investor Interest Sustained by Strong Returns:** ✓ **Accurate** - The sector continued attracting investment based on strong performance stories, until the broader biotech correction starting in 2022

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article provides valuable historical insight into biotech market dynamics and financing patterns that remain relevant to understanding sector investment cycles. However, its analysis is primarily backward-looking and limited to financing mechanics rather than fundamental scientific or therapeutic breakthroughs.
