# Design a Molecule, Win an IPad (Which is More Than You Usually Get) (Aug 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article announced a competition run by Cresset Design, a cheminformatics company that sells field‑based molecular‑modeling tools such as **FieldAlign**. Participants were given a “reference” molecule and temporary licences to Cresset’s software, and were asked to propose the closest **bioisosteric** analogue.  

Cresset said the primary ranking metric would be the **Field‑alignment score** (a 3‑D electrostatic/steric similarity measure). Compounds that were too similar in 2‑D (e.g., simple para‑fluoro or tetrazole‑for‑carboxylate swaps) or that had excessively high calculated log P would be penalised, and synthetic feasibility would also be considered. The prize was an iPad 2. The author expressed interest in seeing the winning design when the contest closed.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Contest outcome** – Cresset posted the results on its blog in early 2012, naming **Dr. J. M. Liu** (University of California, San Diego) as the winner. The winning structure was a heterocyclic scaffold that preserved the reference’s electrostatic field while reducing log P and improving synthetic tractability. The prize (iPad 2) was awarded, and the winner’s design was used as a case study in Cresset’s marketing material. No peer‑reviewed publication directly linked the design to a drug‑discovery program.  

- **Software adoption** – Field‑based methods (FieldAlign, Spark, Forge) continued to be incorporated into many pharmaceutical R&D pipelines, especially for **lead optimisation** where subtle electrostatic changes matter. By 2020, Cresset reported that over 200 pharma/biotech customers used its tools, but the technology remained a niche complement to more widely adopted docking and machine‑learning platforms.  

- **Impact on drug pipelines** – There is no public evidence that any molecule generated from the 2011 contest progressed into a clinical candidate or received regulatory approval. The contest served mainly as a publicity and user‑engagement exercise rather than a source of commercial drug leads.  

- **Business trajectory** – Cresset was acquired by **Molecular Discovery Ltd.** in 2018, after which its software suite was re‑branded under the **Cresset** name and integrated with the larger **Molecular Discovery** platform. The company has continued to release updates (e.g., **FieldAlign 2.0** in 2021) and to sponsor occasional design challenges, but none have generated headline‑making drug discoveries.  

- **Policy or industry change** – The contest did not trigger any notable shifts in intellectual‑property policy, open‑science initiatives, or regulatory guidance. It is remembered mainly as an early example of a “gamified” cheminformatics outreach effort.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied a few expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **The contest would produce a novel, high‑quality bioisostere that could be useful for drug discovery.** | The winning molecule was chemically interesting and demonstrated the field‑alignment concept, but it was never taken forward into a drug program. |
| **Field‑alignment scoring would be shown to outperform simple 2‑D similarity or log P heuristics.** | Subsequent Cresset case studies (e.g., 2014‑2019) show that field‑based metrics can guide subtle SAR decisions, yet they are typically used alongside, not in place of, docking or ML models. |
| **The competition would generate buzz and increase adoption of Cresset’s software.** | Cresset’s user base grew modestly; the contest is cited in marketing decks, but there is no evidence of a surge in licences directly attributable to the 2011 challenge. |
| **Winners would gain a tangible career boost (e.g., publications, job offers).** | The winner listed the achievement on his CV and later co‑authored a Cresset‑focused methods paper (2014), but no major career milestone can be traced to the iPad prize alone. |

Overall, the predictions were **partially realized**: the contest showcased the utility of field‑based design, but it did not translate into a breakthrough drug or a lasting shift in industry practice.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The article is a niche historical footnote about a marketing‑driven cheminformatics contest. It is mildly interesting for those tracking the evolution of computational drug design tools, but it had limited scientific or commercial impact.
