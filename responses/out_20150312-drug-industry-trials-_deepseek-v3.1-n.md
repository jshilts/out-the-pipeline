# Article Title: Drug Industry Trials vs. NIH-Funded Ones: Who Reports on Time? (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes a NEJM study examining clinical trial results reporting compliance under the 2007 FDAAA mandate requiring sponsors to register trials at clinicaltrials.gov and report summary results within one year of completion. The study found that only 13% of all trials reported data within the one-year timeframe. However, the crucial finding—often misreported in media coverage—was that after accounting for trials that were not legally required to report (due to marketing approval exceptions), industry sponsors showed significantly better compliance than publicly funded organizations. Approximately 79-80% of industry-funded trials either reported results or had legally acceptable reasons for delay, compared to only 49-50% of NIH-funded trials and 42-45% of other government/academic institution trials.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 findings had significant real-world policy and regulatory implications:

**Policy Changes:** Following these findings and continued concerns about clinical trial transparency, the FDA began strengthening enforcement of FDAAA reporting requirements. In 2016, the agency started issuing warning letters and fines for non-compliance, and in October 2016, the NIH announced new policies requiring all NIH-funded clinical trials to register and report results in clinicaltrials.gov, addressing exactly the compliance gap identified in this article.

However, compliance problems persisted. A 2017 BMJ study found that despite the law, only 67% of NIH-funded trials reported results within the required timeframe, while a 2018 analysis by Law et al. showed industry trials still outperformed academic trials (68.9% vs 55.3% timely reporting). By 2020, systematic reviews continued showing mixed compliance, with some estimates suggesting that approximately 25-30% of all trials still fail to report results within the mandated period. These compliance gaps across all sponsor types (industry, NIH, academic) have been repeatedly documented in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit predictions about the future, but it highlighted several expectations and implications:

• **Industry compliance trends:** The finding that pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer had developed disclosure policies was expected to continue improving compliance, and this has largely been validated—industry compliance has remained generally higher than academic/NIH compliance through subsequent analyses
• **Academic/NIH reporting:** The suggestion that NIH and academic institutions "have been unable or unwilling to allocate adequate resources" pointed to ongoing problems, which materialized as subsequent studies continued finding lower compliance rates from these sponsors
• **Regulatory response:** The scrutiny described in the article contributed to the FDA's subsequent enforcement actions and the NIH's policy reforms in 2016, confirming the article's implicit expectation that such data would drive policy changes

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a critical issue influencing evidence-based medicine and regulatory policy, with its main value being the surprising reversal of conventional assumptions about clinical trial transparency, demonstrating better industry compliance than publicly funded research. The findings contributed to significant policy reforms and ongoing discussions about research transparency.
