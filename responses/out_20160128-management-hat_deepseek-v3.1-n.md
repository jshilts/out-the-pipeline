# The Management Hat (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commemorative post marks the anniversary of the Challenger disaster by pointing back to Roger Boisjoly, a Morton Thiokol engineer who repeatedly warned that cold temperatures could cause catastrophic O-ring failure in the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters. The article references Boisjoly's efforts to prevent the launch, which were overruled by upper management who prioritized schedules and timelines over technical safety concerns. The piece serves as a cautionary reminder about the critical importance of heeding engineering expertise over administrative pressures.

## 2. HISTORY
The Challenger disaster occurred on January 28, 1986, when the Space Shuttle broke apart 73 seconds after launch, killing all seven crew members. In the years following this blog post and the events it describes:

**Technical Validation:** Boisjoly's warnings about O-ring failure in cold weather were validated by post-disaster investigations. The Rogers Commission confirmed that management had been aware of O-ring erosion issues since 1977 but continued launches despite ongoing concerns.

**Corporate Impact:** Morton Thiokol, the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, faced significant damage to its reputation. Several managers involved in the decision-making process left the company or were reassigned.

**Engineering Culture Changes:** The disaster significantly influenced engineering ethics education, with Boisjoly's case becoming a standard example in engineering ethics curricula. It prompted discussions about engineering responsibility, whistleblower protections, and the balance between safety and schedule pressures in technical organizations.

**Regulatory and Policy Changes:** NASA underwent substantial organizational reforms, creating independent safety oversight bodies and improving communication channels between engineers and management. The agency's "faster, better, cheaper" culture faced intense scrutiny and reform.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **No explicit predictions are made** - this is a retrospective commemorative piece referencing historical events, rather than a forward-looking analysis with predictive claims about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**

This post is of moderate interest primarily for its ethical value and educational function in highlighting engineering responsibility and decision-making under pressure. While historically significant for illustrating industrial safety culture, it's a brief commemorative piece rather than an in-depth analysis.
