# Good News! Our Alzheimer's Drug Didn't Work! (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses an unusual announcement from AFFiRiS AG regarding their Phase 2 clinical trial of AD02, an Alzheimer's vaccine targeting beta-amyloid. The company reported that their placebo group—which received only an "immunomodulator" component of the vaccine formulation rather than the active Aβ antigen—showed better outcomes than any treatment group. Patients in this placebo group exhibited less cognitive decline and less hippocampal shrinkage over 18 months. AFFiRiS responded by naming this placebo formulation AD04 and announced plans to develop it further as a potential therapy.

The author expresses significant skepticism about these claims, noting the company presented no actual data, error bars, or sample sizes in their announcement. The analysis also questions why the company created a composite score by combining two separate clinical rating scales, suggesting this was likely done to make results appear more favorable. The tone is highly skeptical of what appears to be a post-hoc attempt to salvage negative trial results by reframing the placebo as a new therapeutic candidate.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 announcement, AFFiRiS's approach with AD04 did not lead to successful clinical development or regulatory approval. The Alzheimer's field continued to face significant challenges throughout the 2010s, with multiple high-profile clinical failures in the amyloid-targeting space. 

The broader anti-amyloid immunotherapy field eventually saw one notable regulatory approval: Biogen's aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 under the accelerated approval pathway, followed by lecanemab (Leqembi) in 2023 and donanemab in 2024. However, these approvals came with significant controversy regarding clinical benefit magnitude, safety concerns (particularly ARIA side effects), and questions about real-world effectiveness. The therapeutic effects have remained modest at best, with debate continuing about whether the clinical benefits are meaningful for patients.

Despite these limited successes, the verdict on AFFiRiS's specific claims about their "immunomodulator" placebo effect appears negative—no clinically validated therapy emerged from this line of investigation. The Alzheimer's drug development landscape remains notoriously difficult, with most investigational approaches failing to demonstrate clear clinical benefit despite promising preclinical or early-phase results.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **AFFiRiS's implied prediction about AD04 development**: The company suggested their placebo formulation showed genuine therapeutic potential and planned to pursue clinical development of AD04. **Outcome**: This did not result in an approved therapy or successful late-stage development.

• **Author's skeptical prediction**: The author heavily implied that the apparent placebo effect was likely statistical noise or manipulation rather than a real therapeutic effect. **Outcome**: The author's skepticism appears to have been well-founded, as no successful therapy emerged from this approach.

• **Underlying prediction about amyloid hypothesis**: While not explicitly stated, the piece touches on the broader context of repeated failures in amyloid-targeting approaches. **Outcome**: The amyloid hypothesis has had mixed results—some recent approvals exist but with very modest clinical benefits and ongoing controversy about whether they represent meaningful therapeutic advances.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article captures a fascinating and cautionary episode in Alzheimer's drug development, illustrating the desperation and questionable practices that can emerge when clinical trials fail. However, it represents a minor footnote rather than a pivotal moment in the field's history, hence the moderate score.
