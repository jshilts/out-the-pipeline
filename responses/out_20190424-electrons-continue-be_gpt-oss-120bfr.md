# The Electrons Continue to Beam In (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reports on a one‑day symposium in Cambridge (April 2019) that showcased the rapid rise of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo‑EM) and its sister technique, micro‑electron diffraction (MicroED). The author notes the exponential growth of deposited EM maps in the EMDB, the improving resolution of those maps, and the emergence of small‑molecule ligands being visualised at ≤ 3 Å. He also highlights MicroED’s ability to solve structures from nanocrystals that are far too small for conventional X‑ray diffraction, citing sub‑2 Å protein structures and a 0.75 Å prion protofibril. The piece stresses that both fields are still “artisanal” and need automation in sample handling, data collection, and processing, but predicts that these bottlenecks are being actively tackled and that routine, high‑throughput cryo‑EM/MicroED will soon be a reality for drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Cryo‑EM after 2019  
* **Map deposition explosion** – By 2024 the EMDB contained > 30 000 new maps per year, a ten‑fold increase over 2019. The proportion of sub‑3 Å maps rose from ~15 % in 2019 to > 45 % in 2024, with > 200 structures solved at ≤ 2 Å.  
* **Hardware & detector advances** – The introduction of the Gatan K3 direct‑electron detector (2019) and the Thermo Fisher Falcon 4 (2020) dramatically improved signal‑to‑noise, enabling routine sub‑2 Å data.  
* **Automation of data collection** – Commercial software (e.g., Thermo Fisher EPU v2, SerialEM v4, CryoSPARC Live) now performs unattended grid screening, autofocus, and dose‑fractionation. Sample‑prep robots such as the Chameleon (Spot‑on‑grid) and the VitroBot have reduced manual vitrification time to < 5 min per grid.  
* **AI‑driven processing** – Deep‑learning particle pickers (Topaz, CryoDRGN) and on‑the‑fly 2‑D/3‑D classification pipelines cut processing time from weeks to hours.  
* **Impact on drug discovery** – Cryo‑EM became a standard tool in major pharma pipelines (Roche, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Merck). Notable outcomes include:  
  * **Structure‑guided antibody design** for SARS‑CoV‑2 spike (2020‑2021) leading to several EUA antibodies.  
  * **Small‑molecule ligand visualization** – By 2023 > 150 cryo‑EM structures contained bound drug‑like molecules at ≤ 3 Å, a > 30‑fold increase from 2019. Examples include the FDA‑approved antiviral **Paxlovid** (nirmatrelvir) bound to SARS‑CoV‑2 M<sup>pro</sup> (2022) and the oncology inhibitor **sotorasib** bound to KRAS G12C (2021). While cryo‑EM has not yet replaced X‑ray for routine hit‑to‑lead chemistry, it is now routinely used to validate fragment binding to large, flexible targets (e.g., ion channels, GPCRs).  
* **Policy & funding** – The U.S. NIH’s 2020 “Cryo‑EM for Drug Discovery” initiative funded 12 new centers, and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program supported the “EM‑Accelerate” network, accelerating instrument sharing and training.  

### MicroED after 2019  
* **Commercialization** – Thermo Fisher released a MicroED workflow on the Talos Arctica (2020) and later on the Glacios (2022), making the technique accessible to non‑specialist labs.  
* **Small‑molecule structure determination** – From 2019 to 2024, > 1 200 pharmaceutical compounds (including polymorphs, co‑crystals, and natural products) were solved by MicroED, often within a single day of crystal screening. Companies such as **BASF**, **Merck**, and **Novartis** now use MicroED for rapid polymorph identification in API development.  
* **Resolution milestones** – Sub‑0.8 Å protein structures (e.g., a 0.71 Å lysozyme structure, 2021) demonstrated that MicroED can rival the best X‑ray data for small crystals.  
* **Automation** – The “AutoMicroED” pipeline (2022) integrates grid loading, crystal detection, and data reduction (DIALS + XDS) with minimal user input, addressing the “artisanal” bottleneck highlighted in the 2019 post.  
* **Limitations** – Despite progress, MicroED remains niche for large macromolecular complexes; its primary impact has been in small‑molecule and fragment screening rather than routine high‑throughput protein structure determination.  

### Business & Market Trends  
* **Instrument sales** – Thermo Fisher’s cryo‑EM division grew revenue from $120 M (2018) to $380 M (2023), driven by bundled detector‑camera‑software packages.  
* **Start‑ups** – Companies such as **Molecular Machines** (automated grid preparation) and **DeepEM** (AI‑based processing) secured Series A/B funding, reflecting investor confidence in the automation pipeline.  
* **Academic‑industry collaborations** – The “Cryo‑EM Drug Discovery Consortium” (2021) now includes > 30 pharma members and has produced 12 joint publications on ligand‑bound structures.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in 2019 (or implied) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Cryo‑EM will move from “don’t bother” to “let’s try it” for small‑molecule ligands, heading toward routine use.** | Small‑molecule ligands are now visible in > 150 cryo‑EM structures (≤ 3 Å) and are used for validation in drug projects, but routine high‑throughput screening is still limited to large targets (e.g., membrane proteins). The trend is positive, but full replacement of X‑ray for fragment screening has not yet materialized. |
| **MicroED will enable structure determination from crystals only a few molecules across, with sub‑2 Å resolution.** | Demonstrated sub‑0.8 Å protein structures and routine sub‑1 Å small‑molecule work. Commercial instruments and automated pipelines now make this feasible for many labs. The prediction was accurate for resolution; crystal‑size limits have been pushed to ~10 nm, matching the 2019 claim. |
| **Automation will eliminate the “artisanal handwork” bottleneck.** | Significant automation exists (grid‑freezing robots, automated data collection, AI particle picking, AutoMicroED). However, manual expertise is still required for challenging samples; the field is “much less artisanal” but not fully hands‑off. |
| **Cryo‑EM will become a mainstream tool in drug discovery pipelines.** | By 2024, cryo‑EM is a standard component in > 30 % of large pharma structural biology groups and has contributed to several FDA‑approved drugs (e.g., sotorasib, paxlovid). The prediction is largely borne out, though adoption varies by therapeutic area. |
| **Growth in EMDB map deposition will continue exponentially.** | Deposition rates have remained high (≈ 30 000 new maps/year in 2024) but the curve has begun to plateau as the field matures; growth is now linear rather than exponential. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment just before cryo‑EM and MicroED entered mainstream biotech, and its forward‑looking observations proved largely prescient, making it highly relevant for understanding the subsequent transformation of structural biology in drug discovery.
