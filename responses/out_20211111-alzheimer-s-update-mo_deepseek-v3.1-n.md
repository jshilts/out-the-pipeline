# Alzheimer's Update: More Disarray (November 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2021 commentary critiques the Alzheimer's drug development landscape, focusing on the controversial FDA approval of Biogen's anti-amyloid antibody Aduhelm (aducanumab). The author argues that Aduhelm lacked demonstrated efficacy and carried risks, citing a recent death from cerebral edema in a post-approval patient as concerning evidence. The piece highlights ongoing scientific debates about the amyloid hypothesis, referencing a heated exchange in *Science* where researchers disputed claims of disease modification by amyloid-targeting therapies like donanemab and lecanemab. The letter-writers argued that most trials were stopped for futility or showed minimal clinical benefit, questioning whether beta-amyloid is truly causative in Alzheimer's or merely a bystander effect ("removing smoke" rather than putting out the fire). The author also discusses the failure of infectious-disease hypothesis trials and mixed results from Genentech's anti-tau antibody semorinemab, which showed possible cognitive effects but no functional improvement. The overall tone is highly skeptical of the amyloid hypothesis and concerned about the precedent set by Aduhelm's approval.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the November 2021 article, several major developments occurred in Alzheimer's drug development:

**Aduhelm (aducanumab):**
The drug faced continued controversy and extremely limited adoption. Medicare severely restricted coverage in April 2022, essentially limiting reimbursement to patients in clinical trials. This effectively doomed the drug's commercial prospects. Biogen subsequently discontinued the drug and shifted focus to other candidates. By 2024, aducanumab was essentially withdrawn from the market due to lackluster sales and continued safety concerns.

**Donanemab:**
Contrary to the 2021 skepticism, Eli Lilly's donanemab showed more substantial positive results in subsequent Phase 3 trials. In 2023, results published in *JAMA* demonstrated that donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline by about 35% compared to placebo in early-stage Alzheimer's patients, with more pronounced effects in those with low-to-medium tau levels. The drug received FDA approval in July 2024 and has shown better commercial uptake than aducanumab, though still with significant ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) side effects including brain swelling and bleeding.

**Lecanemab:**
Eisai and Biogen's lecanemab also demonstrated positive Phase 3 results, showing approximately 27% slowing of cognitive decline in the CLARITY AD trial published in late 2022. The FDA granted accelerated approval in January 2023 and full approval in July 2023 following confirmatory trial data. However, the drug still carries a black box warning for ARIA side effects, and real-world adoption has been limited by the need for frequent monitoring MRIs, high costs, and modest clinical benefits.

**Anti-tau approaches:**
Semorinemab, the antibody mentioned in the article, ultimately failed in further trials and was discontinued. However, other tau-targeting approaches continue in development, including vaccines and small molecules. No tau-targeting therapy has yet reached FDA approval.

**The amyloid hypothesis:**
While the field moved beyond aducanumab's weak evidence, the fundamental debate about the amyloid hypothesis continues. The modest but real benefits of donanemab and lecanemab provide some validation for the approach, though many researchers maintain that targeting amyloid alone is insufficient and combination therapies may be necessary.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions and their outcomes:**

• **"Bad decisions linger" / Aduhelm precedent concern:** Partially validated. While the FDA did subsequently approve lecanemab and donanemab with stronger evidence than aducanumab, the agency's credibility took a hit, and the controversy influenced more rigorous evaluation of subsequent amyloid drugs. However, the feared "floodgate" of approvals for marginal drugs did not materialize.

• **Skepticism about anti-amyloid antibodies broadly:** Mixed outcome. The author's pessimism proved justified for aducanumab, which essentially failed commercially and clinically. However, both lecanemab and donanemab subsequently demonstrated genuine (though modest) efficacy in large Phase 3 trials, validating at least some value to the approach—though the benefits remain incremental rather than transformative.

• **Concern about cerebral edema risks:** Validated. ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, including brain swelling and microhemorrhages) remains a significant concern with all approved anti-amyloid antibodies. The complication rates are substantial enough that the FDA requires black box warnings, and real-world monitoring burden limits widespread adoption.

• **Implied skepticism about immediate breakthrough:** Largely validated. Despite subsequent approvals, Alzheimer's treatment has not been transformed. Current therapies offer modest delay of progression rather than reversal of disease, and patient/family enthusiasm has been tempered by the modest benefits weighed against risks and burden of treatment.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article proved prescient in identifying the fundamental problems with aducanumab and the broader challenges in Alzheimer's drug development, while the subsequent evolution of lecanemab and donanemab shows how the field can self-correct when better evidence emerges.
