# What Are the Best Med-Chem Books? (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a brief post in which the author solicits recommendations for medicinal chemistry and drug development books. The author notes receiving regular requests for book recommendations and wants to compile a comprehensive list based on reader suggestions. They are seeking books across multiple categories: introductory and overview texts for newcomers to the field, as well as specialized reference works covering specific aspects of drug discovery such as pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicology, formulations, prodrugs, animal models, and patent issues. The author planned to assemble the highest-recommended books into a master list for the community.

## 2. HISTORY

This post represents a common type of community engagement that was popular on science blogs in the late 2000s. Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog (where this post appeared) has continued to be a prominent venue for medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical industry discussion over the subsequent decade and a half. The blog maintained its focus on drug discovery, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutical industry commentary, with the author continuing to write about clinical trials, drug approvals, industry trends, and scientific challenges in drug development. The blog's format evolved with the changing media landscape, but it remained a respected voice in the field. No specific policy changes or drug approvals directly resulted from this particular post, as it was primarily a community resource-building effort.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction:** The author planned to "assemble the highest-recommended volumes into a master list and post that" for the holidays.

**Outcome:** The author did follow through on this promise. Derek Lowe compiled and published a comprehensive list of recommended medicinal chemistry and drug development books, which became a valued resource within the medicinal chemistry community. This master list was periodically updated and referenced by students, researchers, and professionals entering the field, serving its intended purpose as a curated guide to important literature in drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a routine community-engagement post seeking book recommendations, not a substantive analysis of biotechnology developments. It served a useful practical purpose for students and professionals but lacks the broader scientific or industry implications that would warrant a higher interest rating.
