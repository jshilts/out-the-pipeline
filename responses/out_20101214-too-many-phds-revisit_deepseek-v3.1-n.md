# Too Many PhDs, Revisited (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2010 blog post references a data-rich discussion on the "Too Many PhDs" debate occurring in chemistry and science fields. The post highlights an ongoing roundtable discussion about whether academia is producing an oversupply of PhD graduates, or whether the issue is simply a lack of available jobs in the current market. The author points readers to a detailed analysis that examines the distinction between overproduction of PhDs versus underavailability of positions, and questions whether this distinction actually matters in practical terms. The tone suggests this was part of a broader conversation happening within the scientific community about career prospects for advanced degree holders.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent decade (2010-2020) revealed that the PhD oversupply concerns raised in 2010 were prescient. The academic job market remained extremely competitive throughout the 2010s, with many PhD graduates unable to secure tenure-track positions. This led to several concrete developments:

- **Postdoc Proliferation**: The average time spent in postdoctoral positions increased significantly, with many scientists remaining in temporary positions for 5+ years before leaving academia
- **Growth of Alternative Careers**: Increased movement of PhD scientists into industry, science policy, science writing, and non-research roles
- **Structural Changes**: Some universities began reassessing their graduate program sizes, though production of PhDs generally continued to increase
- **Policy Attention**: The issue gained mainstream attention, with reports from organizations like the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation examining graduate education outcomes
- **Industry Shift**: The biotech and pharmaceutical industries experienced significant growth, absorbing some PhD talent, though industry positions also became more competitive

The fundamental mismatch between PhD production and academic positions persisted and arguably worsened, particularly following funding constraints and the 2008-2010 economic impacts that affected university hiring.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original discussion did not include specific forward-looking predictions in the excerpt provided. The referenced analysis focused primarily on assessing the then-current situation and questioning the framing of the problem rather than making explicit predictions about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

This post captures an important ongoing discussion about science career structures, but the blog format and brief nature limit its long-term analytical value. The underlying topic proved highly significant for the subsequent decade of science policy and career development.
