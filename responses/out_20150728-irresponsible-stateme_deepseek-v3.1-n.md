# An Irresponsible Statement About Curing Cancer (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a statement by Gary Gilliland, president of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute, who predicted that "in 10 years we will have cures and therapies for most, if not all, human cancers." The author raises four main objections: (1) many common aggressive cancers (glioblastoma, pancreatic, renal cell, hepatocellular carcinomas) still have poor prognoses despite recent advances, (2) ten years is insufficient for drug development timelines, (3) early diagnostics remain inadequate, citing Oliver Sacks' late-stage liver cancer diagnosis, and (4) such sweeping predictions are irresponsible given the high failure rate of promising treatments.

The author acknowledges genuine progress in cancer research, particularly immunotherapy, but argues for more measured communication about realistic expectations rather than overpromising cures.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immunotherapy Progress:** Immunotherapies (checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab, nivolumab) did achieve significant FDA approvals and clinical adoption between 2015-2025, particularly for melanoma, lung cancer, and some other solid tumors. However, response rates vary dramatically (often 20-40% depending on cancer type), and many patients develop resistance.

**CAR-T Cell Therapy:** The first CAR-T therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta) were approved in 2017 for certain blood cancers. These represent genuine breakthrough treatments for specific hematological malignancies, with some patients achieving long-term remissions. However, they work poorly for most solid tumors.

**Aggressive Cancers:** Glioblastoma remains largely incurable with median survival around 15 months. Pancreatic cancer survival improved modestly (5-year survival increased from ~8% to ~11% by 2024), but most patients still present with advanced disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma saw incremental improvements with combination therapies.

**Precision Medicine:** Genomic profiling became more widespread, and targeted therapies like EGFR inhibitors, ALK inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors found success in biomarker-selected populations. However, these typically prolong life by months to a few years rather than providing cures.

**Failure Rate:** The overall drug development failure rate remained high. Most cancer drugs entering clinical trials did not reach approval, and even approved drugs often provide modest benefits measured in months of survival.

**Public Perception:** The decade saw increased awareness of cancer complexity, with more nuanced public discussions acknowledging progress while emphasizing the distance remaining to curative treatments for most advanced cancers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction 1**: "Most, if not all, human cancers" would be cured within 10 years. **Outcome**: Clearly did not happen. While significant progress occurred in specific cancers (particularly certain blood cancers and immunologically "hot" tumors), most solid tumors with advanced diagnosis remain incurable. The 10-year timeframe proved unrealistic for the sweeping claim.

• **Prediction 2** (implicit): That whatever treatments Gilliland referenced were close enough to fruition to deliver on this timeline. **Outcome**: No revolutionary curative treatments emerged from Fred Hutch or elsewhere that would justify this timeline. Progress was incremental and cancer-type specific.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents a rare and prescient pushback against overhyped scientific claims, correctly identifying why the timeline and scope were unrealistic. It provides enduring lessons about responsible science communication and the genuine complexities of cancer biology that remain relevant today.

## 5. ANALYSIS

The author's skepticism proved well-founded. By 2025, cancer treatment had indeed advanced significantly, with immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and CAR-T cells becoming standard tools. However, "most, if not all" cancers remained far from cured, particularly the aggressive solid tumors mentioned in the article.

The 10-year timeline dramatically underestimated the complexity of translating biological understanding into curative treatments. The article correctly identified the major barriers: drug development timelines, diagnostic limitations, tumor heterogeneity, and the high failure rate of promising approaches.

Where the author might have been too conservative was in not fully appreciating how much immunotherapy would transform some cancer types—melanoma and certain lung cancers saw dramatic improvement in outcomes. However, these successes remained confined to subsets of cancer types and patients, far from the universal cure predicted.

The core message—that responsible scientists should communicate progress honestly while acknowledging limitations—remains critically important. The Gilliland statement exemplifies the temptation to overpromise in cancer research, while the article demonstrates the value of measured, evidence-based assessment.
