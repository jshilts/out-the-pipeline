# Fred Sanger, 1918-2013 (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 article from the Science Magazine blog post mourns the death of Frederick Sanger at age 95, celebrating his legacy as a double Nobel laureate in chemistry. The piece highlights Sanger's two groundbreaking contributions: his 1950s work sequencing insulin, which established that proteins have definite amino acid sequences and launched modern protein structural studies, and his 1970s development of the dideoxy chain-termination method for DNA sequencing. The author emphasizes the ferocious difficulty of protein sequencing in the 1950s and how Sanger's innovations became foundations of modern biology.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2013 memorial article, Sanger's foundational work continued to manifest in practical applications. DNA sequencing costs plummeted dramatically—while the first human genome cost billions, by 2023 whole-genome sequencing approached $100-$200, making genomic medicine accessible in clinical settings. Next-generation sequencing technologies, while moving beyond Sanger's original dideoxy method for large-scale applications, still relied on the fundamental principles he established. Clinical applications expanded significantly: newborn screening programs integrated genomic sequencing, oncology adopted ctDNA monitoring, and rare disease diagnosis became increasingly genomic-first. The COVID-19 pandemic showcased sequencing's public health value through global SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and variant tracking. However, Sanger sequencing itself remains the gold standard for clinical validation due to its accuracy, still widely used for confirming variants detected by NGS. The field also faced challenges including data interpretation bottlenecks, privacy concerns, and ensuring equitable access to genomic medicine.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There were no explicit predictions made in this memorial article—it was retrospective rather than forward-looking.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8/10**

The article deserves a high interest score because it memorializes a scientist whose foundational work enabled the entire field of genomics and precision medicine that now impacts millions of patients annually through sequencing-based diagnostics, drug development, and clinical applications.
