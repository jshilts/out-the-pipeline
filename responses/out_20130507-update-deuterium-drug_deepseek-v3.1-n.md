# An Update on Deuterium Drugs (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article provides an update on deuterated drugs, focusing on Concert Pharmaceuticals' progress in deuterium-modified therapeutics. Concert had secured their third collaboration within a year, including a $300 million deal with Celgene focused on cancer treatments using deuterium modification technology. The company had its own compound, CTP-499, in Phase II clinical trials for diabetic nephropathy. CTP-499 was described as a deuterated analog of HDX, an active metabolite of the known drug pentoxifylline. The strategic rationale was that deuteration would prolong the metabolite's half-life in the body. The author noted that while the deuterium concept was becoming more widespread in drug discovery, Concert appeared well-positioned for success based on their existing partnerships and pipeline.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent development of deuterated drugs has been mixed:

**Concert Pharmaceuticals trajectory**: Concert continued advancing their deuterium platform, building on early partnerships. The most significant development was the eventual approval of AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine) for treating tardive dyskinesia and Huntington's disease chorea in 2017. The FDA approval validated the deuterium drug concept by showing improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to the non-deuterated parent compound tetrabenazine, with reduced dosing frequency and potentially fewer side effects.

**CTP-499 outcome**: The compound mentioned in the article for diabetic nephropathy appears to have been discontinued after Phase II trials, with no regulatory approval or further development advancing to late-stage trials.

**Industry adoption**: Large pharmaceutical companies increasingly incorporated deuterium chemistry into drug discovery programs, particularly where metabolic stability was a limiting factor. Several deuterated compounds entered clinical development across various therapeutic areas. However, the broader impact was more moderate than initially anticipated, with deuterium modification proving valuable in specific cases rather than becoming a universal drug optimization strategy.

**Market evolution**: The field became more competitive as companies beyond Concert explored deuteration, though Concert maintained a strong intellectual property position.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Concert already set for a longer term than most startups"** - This prediction proved accurate. Concert continued operations for many years beyond the article's publication, achieved regulatory approval for deutetrabenazine, and established deuterium chemistry as a legitimate drug development approach.

• **Successful application of deuterium technology to improve existing drugs** - This proved correct. The approval and clinical use of AUSTEDO demonstrated that deuterium substitution could meaningfully improve drug properties and navigate the regulatory pathway.

• **Wider adoption in drug discovery** - This also proved accurate, with numerous companies incorporating deuterium chemistry into their medicinal chemistry toolkits and several deuterated compounds advancing into clinical trials. However, it did not become the revolutionary breakthrough technology that might have been anticipated; rather, it became a valuable specific tool among many optimization strategies.

• **No more "easy pickings" as the field became more competitive** - This was largely correct. Patent landscape complexity increased, and multiple companies pursued deuterium modifications, reducing any single company's competitive advantage.

• **Implicit prediction that CTP-499 would advance successfully** - This did not materialize, as the compound was ultimately discontinued in development.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides accurate contemporary insight into an emerging drug discovery approach that did achieve meaningful success, making it of substantial long-term interest for understanding pharmaceutical chemistry evolution, though of moderate importance compared to breakthrough therapeutic developments.
