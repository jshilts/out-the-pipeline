# Drug Discovery With the Most Common Words (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a blog post where the author attempts to describe the drug discovery and development process using only the 1,000 most common English words, inspired by an XKCD comic. Key constraints include not being able to use words like "lab," "chemical," "test," and "medicine."

The simplified explanation covers the iterative nature of drug discovery, the high failure rate of candidates, the need to optimize molecular properties (potency, stability, safety), scale-up manufacturing challenges, and the multi-phase clinical trial pathway from animal studies through human testing to regulatory approval. It also touches on patent protection timelines, generic competition, high drug costs, and public perception challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry.

## 2. HISTORY

The drug discovery and development landscape has evolved significantly since 2013:

**Successes:**
- **mRNA vaccines**: The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated unprecedented speed in vaccine development (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines approved in 2020-2021), though this was enabled by decades of prior research and emergency authorization pathways.
- **CAR-T cell therapy**: First FDA approvals in 2017 (Kymriah, Yescarta), representing breakthrough cancer immunotherapy with actual patient impact.
- **Gene therapies**: Luxturna (2017) for inherited retinal disease, Zolgensma (2019) for spinal muscular atrophy, though adoption has been limited by extremely high costs ($850,000-$2.1M per treatment).
- **Immuno-oncology**: Checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) became mainstream cancer treatments with multiple approvals post-2014.

**Technological advances:**
- **AI/machine learning**: Companies like DeepMind (AlphaFold in 2020) and numerous startups have applied AI to drug discovery, though clinical impact remains limited and few AI-designed drugs have reached market approval.
- **CRISPR gene editing**: First clinical trials began around 2019, with early therapeutic applications still in development phases.
- **Precision medicine**: More targeted therapies approved, with companion diagnostics becoming more common.

**Persistent challenges:**
- **High costs**: Drug prices continued rising, with average new drug development costs exceeding $2.5 billion (recent analyses)
- **Clinical trial failures**: Failure rates remain high (~90% for drugs entering clinical trials)
- **Patent cliffs**: Major drugs lost patent protection (e.g., Humira biosimilars entering US market in 2023)
- **Public perception**: Drug pricing controversies intensified, particularly around insulin and other essential medicines

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself wasn't predictive; it was descriptive using constrained vocabulary. However, the final statement "But no one has got any other way to do it, at least not yet!" implicitly raised questions about alternative approaches:

- **Status of alternatives**: Traditional pharmaceutical R&D remains the primary pathway, though AI, computational methods, and platform technologies (like mRNA) are showing potential for disruption
- **No fundamental paradigm shift**: Despite advances, the core process of discovery → preclinical → clinical trials → regulatory approval remains essentially unchanged since 2013
- **Timeline expectations**: The hope for faster development has seen mixed results—COVID showed emergency speed is possible, but routine drug development still takes 10-15 years

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While clever and accessible, this piece is primarily a linguistic exercise rather than substantive scientific or industry analysis. It offers no original insights, predictions, or data that would make it historically significant or particularly informative for understanding the evolution of drug discovery.

**Confidence notes:** This analysis focuses on well-documented developments in drug discovery since 2013, including FDA approvals, pricing trends, and technological advances. The evaluation avoids speculation about future developments or unverified claims about therapeutic efficacy.
