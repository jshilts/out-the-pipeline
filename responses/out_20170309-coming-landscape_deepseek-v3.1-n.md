# Article Title (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses Adam Feuerstein's list of "Gnarly Nine" biotech companies facing FDA scrutiny, focusing on the broader question of whether drug approval standards might be lowered under the new administration. The article highlights PTC Therapeutics as a key example, noting that their drug Ataluren had failed multiple clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis, yet the company filed for FDA approval anyway—an unusual move. The author expresses skepticism about approval under existing efficacy standards and suggests PTC was hoping for regulatory changes. The piece also critiques simplistic public statements about curing major diseases, contrasting political rhetoric with the complex reality of biomedical research.

## 2. HISTORY
**PTC Therapeutics and Ataluren (Translarna):** The FDA did not approve Ataluren for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the US. However, the drug maintained conditional approval in Europe for nmDMD. The company continued facing regulatory challenges and clinical setbacks, including negative trial results for other indications. PTC's strategy of filing "over protest" reflected broader industry tensions around regulatory standards.

**Broader FDA Context:** The period following this article saw continued debate about drug approval standards, though no fundamental lowering of efficacy requirements occurred. The biotech sector experienced both successes and failures in the 2017-2024 period, with some high-profile approvals but also significant clinical trial failures, particularly in areas like Alzheimer's disease where the underlying biology remains incompletely understood.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **PTC's FDA approval prospects:** The article predicted Ataluren would not be approved under existing efficacy standards. This proved accurate—the drug was not approved in the US.
• **Regulatory standards lowering:** The piece suggested PTC hoped standards would change. While FDA processes evolved, fundamental efficacy requirements did not significantly weaken.
• **Implied success predictions from political figures:** The article's critique of oversimplified disease-cure rhetoric anticipated that breakthroughs in complex diseases would remain difficult, which has been borne out by continued challenges in Alzheimer's, cancer, and other areas.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
The article provides insightful regulatory analysis of a specific biotech case study and captures important tensions between public expectations and biomedical reality, though limited to one company's situation.
