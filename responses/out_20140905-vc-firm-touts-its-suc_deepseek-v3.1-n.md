# A VC Firm Touts Its Successes - And Its Failures (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article analyzes an initiative by VC firm Index Ventures to create a website documenting both successful and failed early-stage biopharma projects. The main case study presented is "Purple Pharmaceuticals," a virtual company founded in 2013 to develop small molecule inhibitors of PCSK9 as oral alternatives to injectable antibody treatments.

The article explains that Purple spent approximately £300,000 over one year attempting to identify selective small molecules against PCSK9. Their "killer experiment" revealed that while they found hits that inhibited PCSK9's activity against external substrates, none of these molecules inhibited PCSK9's crucial auto-activation (autocatalytic cleavage). The company learned from Genentech that PCSK9 requires autocatalytic self-cleavage for maturation and function, invalidating their screening approach. This led Index Ventures to terminate the project relatively early and inexpensively, before significant infrastructure investment.

The author questions why Purple's team didn't discover the known literature about PCSK9's autocatalytic mechanism earlier, as this was well-documented by 2008. An update reveals that Purple was specifically seeking molecules that could inhibit only the autocatalytic activity, but their screening approach failed to identify such compounds.

## 2. HISTORY

Index Ventures' transparency initiative came at a time when PCSK9 inhibitors were indeed becoming major therapeutics, though not as small molecules. **Evolocumab (Repatha, Amgen)** and **alirocumab (Praluent, Regeneron/Sanofi)** received FDA approval in 2015 and demonstrated significant LDL cholesterol reduction in clinical trials (50-60% reduction). Both drugs achieved blockbuster status, with Repatha reaching approximately $1.5 billion in annual sales by 2023 and Praluent reaching over $400 million.

However, the oral small molecule approach that Purple pursued **never succeeded commercially**. No small molecule PCSK9 inhibitor has received FDA approval as of 2024. The fundamental challenges identified in 2014 proved insurmountable: PCSK9's mechanism depends on protein-protein interactions with the LDL receptor, making it inherently difficult to target with traditional small molecules. The scientific community's understanding that inhibiting PCSK9's catalytic activity might not affect its LDL receptor interactions (established by 2008) was later validated by clinical experience showing that antibody approaches work by blocking PCSK9-LDLR binding rather than inhibiting enzymatic activity.

The biopharma industry trend toward early portfolio pruning and rapid kill decisions, exemplified by Index Ventures' approach, became increasingly common as VCs sought to minimize losses from expensive late-stage failures. This methodology aligned with broader industry recognition that being able to cheaply disprove hypotheses early is more valuable than maintaining unsuccessful programs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **PCSK9 antibodies as potential blockbusters**: ✓ **Correct**. Evolocumab and alirocumab both became major revenue generators demonstrating substantial clinical benefit and widespread adoption in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

• **Small molecule PCSK9 inhibitors having advantages over antibodies**: ✗ **Incorrect**. No oral small molecule PCSK9 inhibitor succeeded clinically. The antibodies maintained dominance due to excellent efficacy, manageable injection frequency (evolving to biweekly or monthly dosing), and proven cardiovascular outcomes benefits demonstrated in landmark trials like FOURIER and ODYSSEY.

• **Purple's approach of identifying small molecules that selectively inhibit PCSK9 autocatalytic activity**: ✗ **Failed**. The fundamental mechanism Purple targeted proved insufficient. Even if autocatalytic inhibition were achievable, subsequent clinical understanding showed this approach wouldn't address the primary therapeutic mechanism (PCSK9-LDLR protein-protein interactions). Purple's early termination may have saved significant investment that would have led to dead-end programs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides valuable insight into the practical challenges of drug discovery and the importance of literature analysis, while documenting a notable VC transparency initiative. It captures the gap between theoretical opportunities and practical execution, with the PCSK9 small molecule failure becoming a permanent case study in the limits of druggability.
