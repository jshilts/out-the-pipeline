# How Much Do Drug Companies Spend on R&D, Anyway? (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article challenges the notion that pharmaceutical companies spend "only" 16% of revenue on R&D, arguing this figure actually represents an exceptionally high R&D intensity compared to other industries. The author cites Booz's "Global Innovation 1000" survey showing most industries spend 1-7% of sales on R&D, with semiconductors being the notable exception at 17-28%. 

Major pharmaceutical companies like Roche (19%), Merck (17%), and AstraZeneca (16%) match or exceed Intel's R&D intensity. Smaller biopharma companies often spend 50% or more of revenues on R&D. The piece emphasizes that eight of the world's top 20 industrial R&D spenders are drug companies—more than any other sector—demonstrating the industry's substantial R&D commitment.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's 2013 publication, pharmaceutical R&D spending patterns continued evolving with significant shifts:

**R&D Intensity Trends**: Many large pharmaceutical companies gradually reduced their R&D as a percentage of revenue over the subsequent decade. Pfizer, mentioned at 13.5% in the article, dropped to approximately 15-17% of revenue by the late 2010s and early 2020s. Industry consolidation and productivity concerns led companies to focus more on R&D efficiency rather than maintaining the highest possible R&D percentages.

The rise of biotechnology and specialty pharma created new dynamics. Smaller biotech companies maintained extremely high R&D intensities (often 50-100%+), while larger companies increasingly acquired innovation through M&A rather than purely internal R&D.

**Industry Restructuring**: The 2010s saw major pharmaceutical companies continuing to optimize R&D footprints, closing facilities and focusing on specific therapeutic areas. This reflected the ongoing challenge of R&D productivity that the industry faced throughout this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article primarily describes rather than predicts, focusing on correcting misconceptions about industry R&D spending. However, some implicit expectations can be evaluated:

• **Implicit expectation that high R&D spending would continue**: Pharmaceutical companies have generally maintained relatively high R&D intensities compared to other industries, though some companies mentioned (like Pfizer through various restructurings) saw their R&D percentages fluctuate.

• **Implicit assumption about industry structure**: The concentration of R&D spending among top companies has persisted, though the specific rankings have shifted over time.

• **Editorial implications about productivity**: While not explicitly stated, the emphasis on high spending suggests expected returns. However, R&D productivity in pharma has remained challenging throughout this period, with continued debate about whether high spending translates to proportional output.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an ongoing public policy and industry perception issue with data-driven analysis, and the R&D spending debate in pharma has continued relevance for drug pricing discussions and industry policy. However, it's primarily a correction of misconceptions rather than forward-looking analysis.
