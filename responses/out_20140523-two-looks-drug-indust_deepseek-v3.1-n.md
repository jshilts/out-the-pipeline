# Two Looks At Drug Industry Productivity (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The 2014 article examines two conflicting analyses of pharmaceutical R&D productivity. Richard Evans (Sector and Sovereign Health) ranked 22 drug companies by early-stage innovation using patent citations, therapeutic area pioneering, and non-"Not Invented Here" behavior, yielding top rankings for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Vertex, Gilead, and Allergan, with Novartis, Regeneron, Bayer, Lilly, and Alexion at the bottom. Evans' analysis showed poor ten-year returns when R&D spending was adjusted for capital costs. 

In contrast, a Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper from Boston Consulting Group argued productivity had improved since 2008, with the ratio of aggregate peak sales to R&D spending doubling from 0.12 to 0.29 by 2013. The BCG analysis suggested the industry had returned toward acceptable productivity ratios of 0.25-0.35 needed to meet cost of capital requirements, though the author expressed skepticism about whether this represented true improvement or merely R&D budget cuts that would later manifest as fewer approved drugs.

## 2. HISTORY
After 2014, several key developments shaped pharmaceutical productivity:

**Productivity Trends:** Industry R&D productivity remained challenging through the late 2010s. Approved new molecular entities (NMEs) increased modestly, with FDA approvals reaching peaks in 2018 (59 approvals) and maintaining higher levels than pre-2012 periods, though debate continued about whether this reflected improved efficiency or industry maturation of earlier pipeline investments.

**R&D Investment Patterns:** Total R&D spending continued rising across the industry, though with significant variation by company. The period saw increased focus on oncology, rare diseases, and biologics as companies pursued higher-margin opportunities.

**Company Performance Developments:**
- **Gilead** (ranked #4) faced challenges with hepatitis C franchise decline post-2015 but maintained strong HIV portfolio
- **Vertex** (ranked #3) achieved major success with cystic fibrosis franchise expansion (Trikafta approved 2019)
- **Celgene** (ranked #2) was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2019 for $74 billion
- **Bristol-Myers Squibb** (ranked #1) acquired Celgene and maintained oncology leadership, though faced patent cliffs
- **Allergan** (ranked #5) was acquired by Actavis (later renamed Allergan), then by AbbVie in 2020
- **Regeneron** (ranked #19) demonstrated strong growth with Eylea and later COVID-19 antibody collaboration success
- **Novartis** (ranked #18) maintained pipeline strength particularly in oncology and gene therapy

**Industry-Wide Developments:** The post-2014 period saw continued consolidation through major M&A, increased outsourcing of R&D functions, and rising investment in platform technologies (gene therapy, cell therapy, mRNA). The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated both industry capabilities and limitations in rapid response. Cost pressures intensified with payer scrutiny, generic competition, and pricing debates becoming more prominent.

**Policy and Market Dynamics:** The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) aimed to accelerate drug development, while FDA approval pathways evolved with increased use of accelerated approvals and breakthrough therapy designations. Value-based pricing discussions intensified, and outcomes-based contracting gained limited traction.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

- **Implicit prediction that 2008-based BCG analysis showing productivity improvement might be wrong**: The author expressed skepticism about whether productivity had truly improved since 2008. **Outcome: Mixed.** While drug approvals increased post-2014, debate continued about whether this represented true productivity gains or pipeline maturation from sustained high investment levels.

- **Concern that BCG's peak-sales methodology might be flawed due to estimation uncertainty**: The author questioned whether peak-sales metrics over recent years could be reliably estimated. **Outcome: Valid concern.** Peak sales predictions for newly approved drugs remained notoriously difficult, and late-stage pipeline valuations continued showing high uncertainty.

- **Author's concern that recent productivity improvement might reflect R&D cuts requiring future payback through fewer approved drugs**: **Outcome: Difficult to isolate.** While R&D spending continued increasing industry-wide, the relationship between spending and output remained complex, with no clear evidence that 2008-2014 cuts caused subsequent approval shortfalls.

- **Richard Evans' implicit prediction about the ranking methodology predicting future company success**: **Outcome: Mixed.** Some highly-ranked companies (Vertex with cystic fibrosis success, Gilead despite hepatitis C challenges) performed well, while others faced different trajectories (Allergan's acquisition path). Bottom-ranked companies showed varied outcomes—Regeneron significantly outperformed its #19 ranking.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses perennial questions about pharmaceutical R&D productivity with relevant company-specific analysis and methodological discussion, but lacked the transformative insights or predictive accuracy that would warrant higher scores.
