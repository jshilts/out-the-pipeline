Based on the very limited information provided about this 2014 Science Magazine mention of an XKCD comic about protein folding, here's my analysis:

## 1. SUMMARY

The article appears to be a brief commentary or mention of an XKCD comic that referenced protein folding, specifically the line "Someone may someday find a harder one." Given the context, this likely refers to the protein folding problem - understanding how amino acid sequences fold into their functional three-dimensional structures, which was (and remains) one of the most challenging problems in computational biology. The tone suggests the comic and article were highlighting the immense difficulty and complexity of protein structure prediction.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent developments in protein folding have been nothing short of revolutionary, particularly since 2018. Most notably:

- **AlphaFold (2018-2021)**: DeepMind's AI system dramatically transformed the field, achieving unprecedented accuracy in protein structure prediction and winning CASP14 in 2020
- **AlphaFold Database (2021)**: Release of predicted structures for ~200,000 proteins, later expanded to over 200 million structures
- **RoseTTAFold and other competitors**: Baker lab's RoseTTAFold and other neural network approaches emerged as alternatives
- **Accelerated drug discovery**: The ability to predict protein structures has significantly accelerated pharmaceutical research and development
- **Recognition of limitations**: Growing understanding that structure prediction doesn't fully solve protein function, dynamics, or drug design challenges

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit prediction was that protein folding would remain an extremely difficult problem. This was partially correct but dramatically overtaken by events:

**What matched**: The core complexity of understanding protein behavior, function, and druggability remains challenging even with structure prediction capabilities.

**What was wrong**: The prediction that "finding a harder one" might be needed was ironically undercut by AlphaFold's breakthrough just a few years later. Protein structure prediction became substantially solvable for many cases.

**Missed entirely**: The imminent AI revolution in structural biology that would transform the field within 4-6 years.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5/9**

This article ranks in the 5th decile of interest. While it focuses on an important scientific topic, the brevity of the original piece and its focus on a comic strip limits its depth. However, the protein folding problem's subsequent transformation into a largely solved challenge gives this historical artifact some retrospective significance. It's a interesting time capsule of pre-AlphaFold thinking about computational biology challenges.
