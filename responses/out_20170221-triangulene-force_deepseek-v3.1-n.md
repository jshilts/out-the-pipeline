# Triangulene, By Force (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the first successful synthesis of triangulene, a theoretically predicted but previously unattainable organic molecule. IBM researchers in Zürich used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to manipulate individual atoms, starting with a dihydro precursor prepared at the University of Warwick and selectively removing two hydrogen atoms with atomic precision. The resulting triangulene molecule demonstrated the expected triplet diradical properties and remained stable for days on a copper surface at low temperatures. The piece emphasizes that while press coverage mentioned quantum computing applications, the primary significance lay in achieving direct mechanical synthesis of an elusive chemical species that had existed only in theory for decades.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the February 2017 breakthrough, triangulene research expanded significantly. In July 2019, researchers reported the bottom-up synthesis of π-extended [5]triangulene using conventional solution chemistry techniques, representing important progress beyond the original surface-based approach. The field witnessed growing interest in triangulene derivatives and related open-shell nanographenes, primarily as part of fundamental research into quantum materials and spintronics. This work contributed to the broader development of atomically precise molecular manipulation techniques, particularly in scanning probe microscopy. IBM continued to leverage the STM expertise demonstrated in this work for other molecular-scale investigations. The fundamental advance achieved—proving triangulene's existence and stability—opened research avenues rather than leading to immediate commercial applications, reflecting the lengthy timeline from laboratory demonstration to technological implementation characteristic of quantum material research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Quantum computing utility**: The article references press coverage suggesting quantum computing applications but expresses skepticism about overstating this prospect. The subsequent reality shows that while triangulene's magnetic properties remain scientifically interesting for quantum information research, no practical quantum computing devices utilizing triangulene have emerged to date—the technology remains experimental.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This represents a genuinely important milestone in synthetic chemistry and molecular manipulation, demonstrating unprecedented atomic-scale control. The synthesis of a theoretically predicted but previously inaccessible fundamental molecule represents significant fundamental science, though its practical applications remain distant rather than immediate.
