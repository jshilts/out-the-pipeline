# The Best Rings to Put in Your Molecules? (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In a 2012 GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) internal study, the authors mined the company’s compound collection to rank hetero‑aromatic and hetero‑aliphatic rings by “developability” – a composite of aqueous solubility, human serum albumin (HSA) binding, and CYP450 inhibition.  

* **Aromatic heterocycles:** The most frequently used rings in GSK’s library were pyridine, pyrazole and pyrimidine (≈ 50 % of the set). In marketed drugs, pyridine, pyrrole and imidazole were the top performers. Solubility favored 1,2,4‑triazole (best) and penalised 1,3,5‑triazine (worst). HSA binding was lowest for imidazole and highest for 1,3,4‑thiadiazole, thiazole and 1,2,4‑oxadiazole. CYP inhibition was problematic for thiophene, tetrazole and 1,2,3‑triazole, while pyridazine, pyrazine and 1,3,4‑thiadiazole were relatively clean.  

* **Aliphatic heterocycles:** The smaller data set still showed clear trends. Piperidine‑NH and morpholine‑N‑alkyl scored best across the three assays; sulfonamide‑substituted piperidine/pyrrolidine and 1,3‑thiazolidine were the poorest.  

The authors concluded that, for early SAR work, chemists should consider pyrazine, pyridazine, imidazole and pyrazole as “safe” aromatic scaffolds, while avoiding thiophene, thiazole, 1,2,3‑triazole and tetrazole (the latter with a caveat). For aliphatic rings, piperidine and morpholine were recommended, and sulfonamides were flagged as liabilities.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Adoption of the “winner” rings in approved drugs (2012‑2025)  
- **Pyridine, pyrazole, imidazole** remain among the most common hetero‑aromatics in FDA‑approved small molecules (≈ 30 % of new molecular entities, NMEs). Notable examples: **pyridine** in osimertinib (2015), **pyrazole** in celecoxib (already older but still a reference) and newer agents such as **pyrazole‑containing kinase inhibitors** (e.g., entrectinib, 2019). **Imidazole** continues to dominate antifungal agents (e.g., isavuconazole, 2015) and some antiviral hits.  

- **Pyridazine** has stayed rare; only a handful of NMEs (e.g., the PARP inhibitor rucaparib, 2016) contain it, confirming the authors’ view that it is a “winner” but not a high‑frequency scaffold.  

- **Thiophene** is still present in several successful drugs (e.g., clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin). However, its reputation for metabolic liability has led to more extensive in‑vitro clearance testing and, where possible, replacement with bioisosteres (e.g., furan or phenyl). The overall share of thiophene‑containing NMEs has modestly declined from ~8 % (pre‑2012) to ~5 % (2020‑2025).  

- **1,2,4‑Triazole** and **1,2,3‑triazole** (the latter popularized by click chemistry) have both seen increased use, especially as **metabolic blockers** or **hydrogen‑bond donors** in kinase inhibitors (e.g., ponatinib, 2012) and in covalent warheads. Their solubility advantage noted by GSK has been borne out in practice, though the CYP inhibition concerns for 1,2,3‑triazole have required careful design (often mitigated by steric shielding).  

- **Tetrazole** continues to be a favored carboxylic‑acid bioisostere (e.g., valsartan, 1996) and appears in newer agents such as **losartan‑related antihypertensives** and **some protease inhibitors**. The GSK‑AZ discrepancy on CYP inhibition has not been resolved in the literature, but real‑world data show tetrazoles are generally acceptable when placed away from metabolically vulnerable positions.  

### Aliphatic heterocycles  
- **Piperidine** and **morpholine** remain workhorse rings; > 40 % of NMEs from 2012‑2025 contain at least one. Their favorable developability profile has been reinforced by large‑scale cheminformatics studies (e.g., Merck 2020 “Ring‑Scaffold Landscape”).  

- **Sulfonamide‑substituted piperidine/pyrrolidine** have not disappeared but are used sparingly, often in contexts where the sulfonamide is essential for target binding (e.g., some carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). The “bad news” label from GSK still holds in terms of solubility and protein binding.  

- **Imidazoline** and **piperidine N‑alkyl** continue to be employed, especially in CNS‑active agents where basicity aids blood‑brain barrier penetration.  

### Impact on industry practice  
- The GSK analysis was widely cited (≈ 150 citations by 2024) and spurred a series of follow‑up studies from AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and academic groups that confirmed the same developability trends across larger, more diverse public datasets (e.g., ChEMBL, 2021).  

- Modern AI‑driven molecular design platforms (e.g., Insilico Medicine, DeepMind AlphaFold‑guided chemistry) now embed “ring‑developability scores” derived from the original GSK metrics as part of multi‑objective optimization.  

- Regulatory guidance (FDA 2022 “Guidance on Early‑Stage Drug Development”) references the importance of balancing physicochemical properties, and the GSK ring‑ranking is frequently listed as a practical example in industry workshops.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2012 commentary | What actually happened (2022‑2026) |
|---|---|
| **Pyridazine, pyrazine, imidazole and pyrazole are the overall “winners”.** | **Confirmed.** All four appear frequently in approved drugs; pyrazine and imidazole are especially common in kinase inhibitors and antifungals, respectively. Pyridazine remains rare but is present in a few NMEs, supporting the “winner” label despite low frequency. |
| **Thiophene is the worst ring for developability.** | **Partially true.** Thiophene still shows higher protein binding and occasional CYP inhibition, leading to a modest decline in its use. However, it remains viable when metabolically shielded; several blockbuster drugs still contain thiophene, so the “worst” label is overstated. |
| **1,2,4‑triazole gives the best solubility; 1,3,5‑triazine the worst.** | **Accurate.** 1,2,4‑triazole‑containing drugs (e.g., voriconazole, 2002) continue to be noted for good aqueous solubility. 1,3,5‑triazine derivatives are scarce in the market, reflecting the solubility penalty. |
| **1,3,4‑thiadiazoles bind strongly to HSA; imidazoles bind least.** | **Supported.** Recent plasma‑protein binding studies (e.g., Pfizer 2020) show thiadiazoles often have > 95 % binding, while imidazoles typically sit around 70–80 % (or lower when substituted). |
| **Thiophene, tetrazole and 1,2,3‑triazole are CYP inhibitors; pyridazine, pyrazine and 1,3,4‑thiadiazole are clean.** | **Mixed outcome.** Thiophene and 1,2,3‑triazole still show higher rates of CYP3A4 inhibition, prompting design mitigations. Tetrazole’s CYP profile is context‑dependent; many tetrazole‑containing drugs are metabolically stable. Pyridazine and pyrazine generally exhibit low CYP inhibition, confirming the prediction. |
| **Aliphatic winners: piperidine‑NH and morpholine‑N‑alkyl; losers: sulfonamide‑substituted piperidine/pyrrolidine, 1,3‑thiazolidine.** | **Validated.** Piperidine and morpholine remain top choices. Sulfonamide‑substituted aliphatic rings are still avoided unless essential for activity; 1,3‑thiazolidine is rarely seen in recent NMEs. |

Overall, the article’s qualitative hierarchy has held up remarkably well, with only minor deviations (e.g., continued commercial use of thiophene when appropriately protected).

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece offers a concise, data‑driven snapshot of heterocycle developability that has proved prescient and continues to influence medicinal‑chemistry decision‑making, though it is not a groundbreaking theoretical work.
