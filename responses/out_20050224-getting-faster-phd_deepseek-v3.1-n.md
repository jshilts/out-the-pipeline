# Getting a Faster PhD?
## 24 Feb 2005

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2005 commentary addresses the extended duration of graduate and postdoctoral training in sciences, particularly molecular biology, prompted by the Harvard gender-in-science debate. The author draws from Virginia Postrel's observations about how prolonged PhD and postdoc periods (often 6+ years for PhD plus 2+ years postdoc) delay scientists' first tenure-track positions until around age 30, creating particular challenges for women considering family planning.

Postrel's proposed solutions include: accelerating undergraduate and graduate education by eliminating summer breaks for science students; penalizing faculty whose students take excessively long to complete PhDs; reducing teaching assistant loads; and using university endowments to eliminate distractions from research. The author, an organic chemist, confirms these concerns from personal experience—graduate students already work year-round including summers and holidays, contrary to undergraduate vacation schedules. He supports penalizing slow faculty, rewarding timely completions, and reducing TA assignments, arguing that 5-6 year PhDs should not be the norm when training could be streamlined without sacrificing quality.

## 2. HISTORY

In the two decades since this article was published, concerns about PhD program length and postdoctoral training duration have persisted, but concrete systemic changes have been limited and uneven across institutions.

**PhD Completion Times**: Data from the NSF and disciplinary surveys show that median time-to-degree for biological sciences PhDs has remained stubbornly high, typically 5.5-6.5 years, with molecular biology often at the upper end. Chemistry PhDs have generally been somewhat faster (median around 5 years), but the gap between fields persists. Some universities implemented "time-to-degree" tracking and began providing completion incentives, but widespread penalties for faculty with slow students never materialized at scale.

**Structural Reforms**: A few universities experimented with accelerated PhD programs, particularly in the 2010s, though these remained exceptions rather than the norm. Some institutions reduced formal TA requirements or provided more fellowship support to reduce teaching loads. The NIH and NSF increasingly emphasized training grant programs that provided full support without TA obligations. However, reliance on graduate student labor for undergraduate teaching remained entrenched at many research universities.

**Postdoctoral Training**: Postdoc duration actually increased in many fields during the 2000s-2010s, with median postdoc periods reaching 4-5 years in some biomedical fields before scientists secured tenure-track positions. The increasing competition for academic positions exacerbated this trend, with more PhDs pursuing multiple postdocs. Some funding agencies (like NIH) introduced postdoc salary scales and time limits on postdoctoral positions, but these were often advisory rather than mandatory.

**Career Outcomes**: The academic job market became even more competitive, with many PhDs transitioning to industry careers. This didn't directly address the training duration issue but changed the calculus—if most graduates weren't pursuing academic careers, the rationale for extended training became less defensible.

**Gender and Family Issues**: Awareness of family-friendly policies increased, with more institutions offering parental leave for graduate students and postdocs. However, the fundamental timeline issue—late career start affecting family planning—persisted, particularly for women in fields with the longest training periods.

**Impact on Scientific Workforce**: Extended training periods have been implicated in driving talented students away from research careers, particularly those from underrepresented groups and those prioritizing work-life balance. Some professional societies issued reports addressing these concerns, but systemic reform proved difficult due to the decentralized nature of graduate education and faculty autonomy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions about potential reforms and outcomes:

• **Penalizing slowpoke professors would be implemented**: 
  - **Outcome**: NOT REALIZED at scale. While some institutions discussed this, widespread penalties never materialized. Faculty autonomy and concern about graduate program rankings prevented meaningful enforcement. Some departments monitor time-to-degree but rarely attach serious consequences.

• **Rewarding groups with high percentages of timely completions**:
  - **Outcome**: PARTIALLY REALIZED. Some institutions created incentives (additional graduate slots, recognition), but these remained limited. The fundamental funding and reward structures didn't change significantly.

• **Reducing or eliminating TA loads**:
  - **Outcome**: Partially realized through increased fellowship support, but highly variable. Well-funded universities and departments reduced TA requirements, but many programs still rely heavily on graduate student teaching labor due to budget constraints.

• **Speeding up graduate education to get first jobs by 25-26**:
  - **Outcome**: NOT REALIZED for most fields. Median age at PhD completion remains 29-31 for most sciences, with first tenure-track positions typically around 32-35. The timeline didn't accelerate; if anything, postdoc periods lengthened in many fields.

• **Summer breaks would be eliminated for science students**:
  - **Outcome**: This was already largely true, and it continued. Science graduate students work year-round, but the issue was more about efficient progress rather than adding more working time.

• **The 5-6 year PhD norm would change**:
  - **Outcome**: NOT REALIZED as hoped. While some programs achieved shorter timescales, 5-6 years remained typical, and in many biomedical fields, anything under 5 years became increasingly rare.

The broader prediction—that prolonged training would continue creating problems for women in science—proved accurate, though awareness grew and some supportive policies emerged. However, the fundamental timeline problem persisted largely unchanged.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article remains relevant for capturing perennial issues in graduate education still unresolved twenty years later. It gains interest from the different dimensions it addresses—gender equity, training efficiency, faculty incentives, and workforce development—even though concrete solutions remain elusive.
