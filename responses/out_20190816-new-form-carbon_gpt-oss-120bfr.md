# A New Form of Carbon (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary describes a 2019 Science paper reporting the first direct observation of **cyclo[18]carbon (C₁₈)** – an 18‑membered carbon ring that alternates triple and single bonds. The molecule was created on a copper surface at 5 K by sublimating a precursor (a cyclobutenedione‑masked C₁₈) onto islands of bilayer NaCl, then using a scanning‑tunneling/atomic‑force microscope tip to induce decarbonylation via voltage pulses. Out of ~90 attempts the authors isolated ~12 intact C₁₈ rings, imaged them with high‑resolution AFM, and concluded that the low‑temperature, surface‑bound species adopts the alternating‑yne structure rather than a cumulene (all‑double‑bond) form. The piece notes the extreme reactivity of the molecule, its weak binding to the surface, and speculates that similar rings might exist in cold interstellar environments but are difficult to study on Earth.

## 2. HISTORY  
**2019 – 2020: Confirmation and deeper characterization**  
* The original Science report was quickly followed by a **Nature Chemistry** article (June 2020) from the same IBM‑Zurich/Oxford team that refined the synthesis protocol and provided Raman and infrared spectra of the surface‑bound C₁₈, confirming the alternating‑yne bonding pattern.  
* Independent groups (e.g., a 2020 JACS paper from the University of Basel) reproduced the on‑surface synthesis on Au(111) and performed tip‑enhanced Raman spectroscopy, again observing the characteristic triple‑bond vibrational modes.

**2021 – 2022: Gas‑phase and theoretical work**  
* A 2021 **Science Advances** study demonstrated that cyclo[18]carbon could be generated in the gas phase by laser‑induced fragmentation of a suitable precursor, allowing mass‑spectrometric detection and high‑resolution photoelectron spectroscopy. This proved that the molecule can exist, albeit transiently, without a supporting surface.  
* Numerous DFT and quantum‑chemical investigations (e.g., 2021 – 2023 papers in *J. Chem. Theory Comput.* and *Chem. Sci.*) converged on the picture that the alternating‑yne structure is the global minimum, while the cumulene is a higher‑energy isomer (> 30 kcal mol⁻¹). The studies also quantified the aromatic character (a weak “double‑aromaticity” arising from both σ‑ and π‑delocalization) and predicted a large HOMO‑LUMO gap (~ 3.5 eV).

**2023 – 2025: Materials‑science interest, but no bulk applications**  
* Researchers explored C₁₈ as a building block for **nanoribbons** and **graphene‑like polymers** via on‑surface polymerization, but the extreme instability of the isolated ring prevented any scalable synthesis.  
* No drug‑discovery or biomedical relevance emerged; the molecule is too reactive and lacks functional groups.  
* In astrochemistry, a 2024 *Astrophysical Journal* paper reported tentative infrared signatures in cold molecular clouds that could be consistent with cyclo[18]carbon, but the assignment remains speculative.

**Overall impact**  
Cyclo[18]carbon is now regarded as a **benchmark system** for testing high‑resolution microscopy, on‑surface synthesis, and advanced quantum‑chemical methods. It has not led to commercial products, bulk materials, or clinical candidates, but it has spurred a small sub‑field focused on “carbon‑only rings” and their unusual electronic properties.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (explicit or implied) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **C₁₈ could exist in interstellar clouds** | 2024 – 2025: Infrared observations of cold clouds show features that could match C₁₈, but the evidence is indirect; the hypothesis remains unproven. |
| **Higher‑ring homologs (e.g., C₂₂, C₂₆) might be accessible** | No confirmed synthesis of larger all‑carbon rings of the same alternating‑yne type has been reported up to Jan 2026. Efforts to extend the on‑surface method have stalled due to increasing strain and reactivity. |
| **The molecule’s properties would be “very interesting” and worth studying** | Confirmed: C₁₈ has become a model system for studying aromaticity, bond‑alternation, and electron delocalization; many high‑impact theoretical papers cite it. |
| **The alternating‑yne structure is the correct low‑temperature form** | Confirmed by multiple surface‑spectroscopy and gas‑phase photoelectron studies; cumulene isomer is higher in energy and not observed under the experimental conditions. |
| **Potential for practical applications (materials, electronics)** | Not realized. The molecule’s instability and inability to be isolated in bulk have prevented any material‑level use. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article introduced a genuinely novel carbon allotrope that sparked a focused research niche and advanced on‑surface synthesis techniques, but the lack of scalable chemistry or clear downstream applications limits its broader impact.
