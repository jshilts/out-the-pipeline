# Grinding Up The Leaves and Roots (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief commentary on the state of plant‑based natural‑product drug discovery as of 2016.  It highlights the long history of successful medicines that originated from plants (e.g., paclitaxel/Taxol and artemisinin) but points out that no new blockbuster from a wild plant has appeared in decades.  The author notes two practical obstacles: (1) many “hits” in cell‑based screens disappear when the crude extract is fractionated, suggesting that activity often depends on a mixture of compounds rather than a single molecule; and (2) even when a single active compound is identified, scaling up supply can be difficult because the source plant may be rare, seasonal, or environmentally fragile.  

The article then turns to the work of Jing‑ke Weng’s group at the Whitehead Institute, which is using modern analytical chemistry and molecular‑biology tools (including heterologous expression of plant biosynthetic pathways) to hunt for new bioactive molecules while trying to avoid the pitfalls above.  The author ends on an optimistic note, saying that the approach is not exhausted and that continued funding could eventually yield “very interesting” drugs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What has happened to plant‑derived drug discovery since 2016?**  

* **Few new plant‑derived small‑molecule approvals.**  The only major FDA‑approved product that can be traced directly to a plant source after 2016 is **Epidiolex** (cannabidiol, 2018), a purified cannabinoid from *Cannabis sativa* for severe epilepsy.  Other approvals such as **lurbinectedin** (Zepzelca, 2020) are marine‑derived, not terrestrial plants.  No new plant‑derived anticancer or anti‑infective agents have reached the market in the period 2016‑2025.  

* **Shift toward synthetic biology and genome mining.**  The challenges described in the article have driven many groups—including the Whitehead Institute—to focus on **heterologous production** of plant natural products in microbes (yeast, *E. coli*, or engineered plant cell cultures).  Weng’s lab has published several papers (e.g., 2017‑2022) demonstrating the reconstruction of complex alkaloid and terpenoid pathways in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, but none have yet resulted in a commercial drug candidate.  

* **Commercial outcomes for companies mentioned.**  
  * **Shaman Pharmaceuticals** was acquired by **AstraZeneca** in 2015 (just before the article) and its natural‑product pipeline was folded into AstraZeneca’s broader discovery platform.  The acquisition did not produce a marketed product directly attributable to Shaman’s original plant‑screening program.  
  * **Amyris**, a synthetic‑biology company that famously produced semi‑synthetic artemisinin, continued to expand its “Renewable Chemistry” portfolio, but its plant‑derived pipeline has remained modest, with no FDA‑approved medicines as of 2025.  

* **Policy and funding landscape.**  The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) continued to fund natural‑product discovery through programs such as the **NIH Natural Products Discovery Initiative** (renewed 2018).  However, funding levels have been modest compared with oncology or immunology, reflecting the perceived risk‑reward balance.  

* **Academic impact.**  The “omics‑driven” approach championed by Weng—combining high‑throughput sequencing of plant genomes with metabolomics and CRISPR‑based pathway engineering—has become a standard toolbox in academic natural‑product labs.  It has accelerated the identification of **cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters**, but translation to clinic‑stage candidates remains a bottleneck.  

In short, the field has made technical progress (better genome data, more efficient heterologous expression), but the concrete outcome—new, widely used plant‑derived medicines—has been limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit numeric forecasts, but it contains implicit expectations:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **New, clinically important plant‑derived drugs will appear within a few years.** | Only one notable plant‑derived drug (Epidiolex) reached approval, and it is a purified phytochemical rather than a novel scaffold.  No blockbuster comparable to Taxol has emerged. |
| **Whole‑extract therapeutics are unlikely to become mainstream because of dosing and supply issues.** | The prediction holds: the pharmaceutical market continues to favor single‑entity drugs.  Whole‑extract products remain largely in the nutraceutical or traditional‑medicine space, not in FDA‑approved prescription drugs. |
| **Modern analytical chemistry and molecular biology will rescue the field.** | These tools have indeed transformed the *discovery* phase (more gene‑cluster identification, microbial production), but they have not yet solved the *translation* bottleneck.  No plant‑derived candidate discovered by Weng’s group has entered late‑stage clinical trials as of late 2025. |
| **Companies focused solely on natural‑product screening will struggle financially.** | Accurate.  Shaman’s acquisition and the subsequent winding down of its independent pipeline illustrate the difficulty of sustaining a pure natural‑product business model.  Most surviving efforts are now hybrid (natural product + synthetic biology) or are embedded within larger pharma R&D units. |

Overall, the article’s cautious optimism was partially correct regarding methodological advances, but overly hopeful about near‑term drug approvals.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The piece is a concise snapshot of a long‑standing debate in drug discovery, and it references a specific research group whose work illustrates broader trends.  Its relevance persists because the challenges it outlines remain central, even though the concrete outcomes have been modest.  The article is therefore moderately interesting for historians of biotechnology and for scientists tracking the evolution of natural‑product strategies.
