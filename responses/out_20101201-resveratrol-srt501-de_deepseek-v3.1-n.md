# Resveratrol (SRT501): Development Halted (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2010 blog post reported that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) had halted all further development of SRT501, a proprietary formulation of resveratrol. The decision came after multiple myeloma trials were suspended in May 2010 due to kidney failure cases among patients. According to GSK's internal analysis, while the kidney failures most likely stemmed from the underlying disease, the SRT501 formulation itself was poorly tolerated, causing gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) that may have led to dehydration and exacerbated kidney failure. The company concluded SRT501 offered only minimal efficacy while increasing kidney failure risk—an unfavorable risk-benefit profile. GSK stated it would redirect resources to other compounds in development, specifically SRT2104 and SRT2379, which had similar mechanisms of action targeting SIRT1 activation but with potentially better properties.

## 2. HISTORY
**Clinical and Regulatory Outcomes:**
- SRT501 never progressed beyond Phase II trials. After the 2010 halt, no further clinical development occurred, and the compound never achieved FDA approval or market authorization in any jurisdiction.

**Scientific Controversy and Replication Issues:**
- Between 2012-2016, several key papers supporting resveratrol's SIRT1 activation mechanism—particularly foundational work by David Sinclair and colleagues—faced significant challenges regarding reproducibility and methodological concerns (as hinted in the article's reference to "brouhaha").
- Multiple independent research groups failed to replicate the reported lifespan extension effects of resveratrol in various organisms.
- The underlying science linking resveratrol directly to SIRT1 activation was later questioned, with some studies suggesting earlier findings may have involved measurement artifacts or off-target effects.

**GSK's SIRT1 Program Evolution:**
- SRT2104, mentioned in the article, progressed to multiple Phase II trials across various indications including metabolic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular conditions, but ultimately failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy and was discontinued around 2017-2018.
- SRT2379 had a similar trajectory with early-to-mid phase trials but did not advance to approval.
- GSK gradually de-emphasized its entire SIRT1-targeting portfolio after 2015, shifting resources toward other therapeutic areas.

**Market and Supplement Industry:**
- Following SRT501's clinical failure and subsequent scientific controversies, resveratrol transitioned almost entirely to the dietary supplement market, where it continues to be sold without FDA drug approval or health claims.
- The compound maintains popularity as an "anti-aging" supplement despite limited robust clinical evidence supporting its efficacy for any medical indication.
- The SRT501 case became a cautionary example of challenges translating basic research on natural compounds into pharmaceutical therapeutics, particularly compounds with poor bioavailability and unclear mechanisms of action.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"These compounds [SRT2104 and SRT2379] are still a bit of a mystery... we're just going to have to see how they perform out there in the real world"**: These protean predictions proved accurate in outcome but not in success—both compounds did face real-world testing but ultimately failed to demonstrate sufficient clinical efficacy across multiple trials.
- **"This would appear to be it for resveratrol itself in the real world, as far as GSK's concerned"**: This prediction was overwhelmingly correct, as GSK never resumed resveratrol development and the pharmaceutical pathway for resveratrol as a prescription therapy effectively ended.
- **"Does this mean that they'll let their two former Sirtris execs start selling it again on the side"**: Implicitly, the article foresaw resveratrol might continue commercially as a supplement once pharmaceutical development failed—this prediction proved largely correct, though without formal involvement of former Sirtris executives.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4/9**

This piece serves as a valuable real-time documentation of a critical moment when enthusiasm for a much-hyped compound collided with clinical trial realities, encapsulating broader challenges in translating natural product research and preclinical findings into viable therapies. However, the article's impact was limited by its blog format and contemporaneous perspective—by the time of publication, key developments in the underlying science were already unfolding.
