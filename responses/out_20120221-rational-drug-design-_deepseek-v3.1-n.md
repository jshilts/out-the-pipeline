# Rational Drug Design. Hmm. (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on a comprehensive review about "rational drug design" - a term the author notes generally means "computationally modeled" in drug discovery contexts. The article wrestles with the inherent contradictions and complexities of computational approaches to drug development. The author acknowledges that drug potency operates through physical laws that should theoretically be computable, but recognizes the extreme difficulty of modeling protein flexibility, water interactions, electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and entropy changes with sufficient accuracy. While admitting there are documented cases where modeling has genuinely helped, the author questions whether such successes represent the norm or mostly cherry-picked examples, and ponders whether earlier predictions from the 1980s about computational drug design capabilities would have led to excitement or disappointment by 2012.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this article, several significant developments reshaped rational drug design:

**Advances in Computational Power and Methods**: The period saw substantial improvements in molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and structure-based drug design. Methods like FEP+ (Free Energy Perturbation) gained traction in pharmaceutical companies, with companies like Schrödinger commercializing these tools for drug discovery pipelines.

**AI/ML Transformation**: The biggest shift came from machine learning and artificial intelligence applications to drug discovery. Deep learning models for predicting molecular properties, generative models for novel compound design, and protein structure prediction breakthroughs like AlphaFold2 (2021) fundamentally changed computational drug design capabilities.

**Concrete Drug Development Outcomes**: Computational approaches contributed to several approved drugs, though attribution remains complex. Venetoclax (FDA approved 2016) incorporated structure-based design in its development. However, drug discovery timelines (10-15 years) mean many projects from 2012 remain in development or failed without public disclosure.

**Industry Adoption**: By the mid-2010s, virtually all major pharmaceutical companies had expanded computational chemistry and bioinformatics departments. Companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Exscientia built businesses explicitly around AI-driven drug discovery. Success rates for drug discovery showed modest improvement, with computational methods reducing some early-stage failure rates.

**Public and Private Investment**: Following this article, investment in computational drug discovery grew substantially, with AI drug discovery companies raising billions in venture capital, though the productivity paradox noted in the original article still persists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was notably cautious about making explicit predictions, but contained several implicit ones:

- **"Computing power making molecular modeling more capable"**: ✓ **Accurate** - This occurred dramatically, with GPU-accelerated computing and specialized hardware enabling orders of magnitude more complex calculations.

- **"Tools getting better over time"**: ✓ **Accurate** - Methods significantly improved, particularly with machine learning approaches supplementing traditional physics-based modeling.

- **"Frequency of modeling helping would increase"**: ✓ **Partially accurate** - Use increased, though measuring true impact remains difficult due to industry secrecy about failures.

- **Implicit question about whether 2012 capabilities would disappoint 1985 expectations**: ⚠ **Mixed** - 2012 capabilities exceeded many 1985 predictions (especially computational power), but the fundamental challenges of accurate molecular modeling remained more difficult than early enthusiasts anticipated. The subsequent AI revolution might have satisfied some 1985 visionaries by the early 2020s.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article shows strong prescience about the fundamental tensions in computational drug design that remain relevant today, anticipating both the potential and limitations that would characterize the subsequent decade. Its balanced skepticism about the term "rational" and awareness of hype cycles demonstrates understanding of the field's sociology.
