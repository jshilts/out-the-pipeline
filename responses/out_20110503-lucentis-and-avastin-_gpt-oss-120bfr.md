# Lucentis and Avastin: Results (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary discusses the first‑year results of the CATT (Comparison of Age‑Related Macular Degeneration Treatment Trials) study, which directly compared intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin) for neovascular age‑related macular degeneration (AMD). The author notes that **monthly injections of either drug produced essentially identical visual‑acuity outcomes**, with only minor differences in retinal‑thickness measurements that did not translate into functional benefit.  

A second comparison examined dosing schedules: **monthly versus “as‑needed” (pro‑re‑nata) dosing**. Ranibizumab performed equally well under both regimens, whereas bevacizumab showed a modest loss of efficacy when given as‑needed. The piece highlights the huge cost differential (ranibizumab ≈ $2,000 – $2,500 per injection vs. bevacizumab ≈ $50 – $60) and argues that the data support continued off‑label use of bevacizumab as a low‑cost alternative, while suggesting that regulators might have to revisit policies that prohibit off‑label use.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical follow‑up (CATT 2‑year data, 2012)** – The extended analysis confirmed the 1‑year findings: mean visual‑acuity gains were within 2 letters between the two drugs, and safety profiles remained comparable. No late‑emerging safety signal (e.g., systemic vascular events) was detected.

**IVAN trial (UK, 2012)** – A parallel head‑to‑head study reached the same conclusion: bevacizumab was non‑inferior to ranibizumab for visual outcomes, with similar rates of ocular and systemic adverse events.

**Market impact**  
* **U.S. practice** – Bevacizumab quickly became the de‑facto first‑line therapy for most ophthalmologists because of its price. By 2015, > 80 % of intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections for AMD in the United States were bevacizumab, according to Medicare claims data.  
* **European health systems** – The UK’s NHS, the Dutch health authority, and several other national formularies formally endorsed bevacizumab as the preferred initial agent, citing cost‑effectiveness analyses (≈ $1,500 per quality‑adjusted life‑year saved versus ranibizumab).  
* **New competitors** – Aflibercept (Eylea) received FDA approval in 2011 and offered a longer dosing interval (every 8 weeks after loading). Its price sits between ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and it captured a substantial share of the market, especially for patients who responded poorly to the other agents.  

**Regulatory stance on off‑label use** – The FDA has not prohibited intravitreal bevacizumab; instead, it issued guidance encouraging the use of **compounding pharmacies** that meet USP <797> sterility standards. A 2015 outbreak of endophthalmitis linked to a compounding facility (NECC) prompted stricter oversight, but the practice of repackaging bevacizumab for ophthalmic use has persisted.

**Biosimilars** – In 2021 the EU approved the first ranibizumab biosimilar (Byooviz). The FDA followed in 2022 with the same product, providing a lower‑cost ranibizumab option (≈ 30 % cheaper than the reference). However, uptake has been modest because many clinicians already prefer bevacizumab for its price advantage.

**Policy and reimbursement** – Several U.S. insurers introduced **step‑therapy** requirements, mandating a trial of bevacizumab before covering ranibizumab or aflibercept. Medicare’s reimbursement for ranibizumab remained higher than the drug’s acquisition cost, reinforcing the economic incentive to start with bevacizumab.

**Safety record** – Over more than a decade of real‑world use (> 10 million injections worldwide), no credible evidence has emerged that bevacizumab carries a higher risk of systemic thromboembolic events than ranibizumab. Ocular infection rates are similar when compounding standards are met.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *Regulators will be forced to reconsider bans on off‑label use because patients cannot afford ranibizumab.*  
  **Outcome:** The FDA never banned off‑label intravitreal bevacizumab; it allowed continued use under compounding‑pharmacy guidelines. No major regulatory reversal was needed.

- **Prediction:** *Second‑year CATT data could change the picture.*  
  **Outcome:** The 2‑year results reinforced the original conclusion—no meaningful difference in efficacy or safety.

- **Prediction:** *European trials might reveal safety concerns not captured by CATT.*  
  **Outcome:** The IVAN trial (Europe) confirmed safety parity; no new safety signals have been reported in subsequent meta‑analyses.

- **Prediction:** *Cost‑saving protocols (as‑needed dosing) would be attractive but might be inferior for bevacizumab.*  
  **Outcome:** Real‑world practice adopted a “treat‑and‑extend” regimen for all anti‑VEGF agents, including bevacizumab, with visual outcomes comparable to monthly dosing in large registries. The modest inferiority seen in CATT’s as‑needed bevacizumab arm has not translated into a widespread clinical shift away from flexible dosing.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when a high‑cost, FDA‑approved biologic was shown to be clinically equivalent to a cheap off‑label drug, reshaping ophthalmic practice, health‑policy debates, and pharmaceutical economics worldwide.
