# Welcome to Right to Try (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a skeptical commentary on the U.S. “Right‑to‑Try” (RtT) law that had just been signed (May 2018).  The author, Derek Lowe, argues that while the law is framed as empowering terminally‑ill patients to obtain “life‑saving” experimental medicines, it also opens the door for small biotech firms to charge hundreds of thousands of dollars for unproven therapies.  He uses Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics – a company developing an autologous mesenchymal‑stem‑cell product (later called **NurOwn**) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) – as a concrete example.  Brainstorm announced it would make the therapy available under RtT for a price in the low‑hundreds‑of‑thousands of dollars, despite the lack of convincing efficacy data and the fact that insurers would not cover it.  Lowe warns that this could create a market for “mud and slop” treatments, especially in diseases with no approved options, and that the profit motive might outweigh patient safety.

## 2. HISTORY  

### The Right‑to‑Try Act in practice  
* **Implementation** – The law became effective on 30 May 2019.  It permits patients with a life‑threatening condition, who have exhausted approved options, to request any investigational drug that has completed a Phase I trial and is not yet FDA‑approved.  The FDA is not required to review the request, but it may intervene for safety reasons.  
* **Adoption** – From 2019‑2023 only a handful of companies actually invoked RtT.  Most used the existing FDA “expanded‑access/compassionate‑use” pathway, which remains the more common route because it provides some regulatory oversight and liability protection.  Reported RtT cases (e.g., a 2020 trial of an investigational oncology drug at a single center) have been rare and have not led to commercial products.  

### Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics (NurOwn)  
| Year | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **2018** | Announced intention to offer its ALS cell therapy under RtT, pricing “low‑hundreds of thousands” per patient. | No RtT patients were actually treated; the plan was later abandoned (company statement, June 2018). |
| **2019** | Initiated the Phase 3 RESCUE‑ALS trial (randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled). | Primary endpoint (ALSFRS‑R change) not met; trial deemed a “failure” by most analysts. |
| **2020** | Conducted a second Phase 3 trial (RESCUE‑ALS‑2) with a modified dosing regimen. | Again missed the primary endpoint, though a post‑hoc subgroup (patients with earlier disease) showed a modest slowing of decline. |
| **2020‑2021** | Obtained FDA Fast‑Track designation and a Breakthrough‑Therapy designation for the subgroup analysis. | Designations did not translate into FDA approval; they kept the program in the pipeline. |
| **2022** | Partnered with a Japanese firm (Kyowa Kirin) and secured conditional approval of NurOwn in Japan for ALS (under the brand **NurOwn‑J**). | The drug is now marketed in Japan, with limited uptake (≈ 30 patients treated by end‑2023). |
| **2023‑2024** | Continued to raise capital via equity offerings; stock remained volatile. No U.S. FDA approval as of early 2026. | The company’s revenue still comes mainly from research collaborations, not from sales of the ALS product. |

### Broader market impact  
* **Pricing** – No RtT‑based product has generated a multi‑hundred‑thousand‑dollar revenue stream.  The few companies that tried (e.g., a biotech offering an investigational gene therapy for a rare metabolic disease) either withdrew the offer or faced legal challenges from state regulators.  
* **Regulatory response** – The FDA has issued guidance (2020) emphasizing that expanded‑access programs remain the preferred route and that RtT does not relieve sponsors of liability for unsafe products.  Several state attorneys general have warned patients about “pay‑to‑play” schemes.  
* **Patient experience** – Anecdotal reports (e.g., a 2021 ALS patient who paid $250 k for an RtR‑offered cell infusion) indicate mixed outcomes: no measurable clinical benefit and significant out‑of‑pocket cost.  No systematic data set shows a survival advantage for RtT recipients.  

Overall, the RtT law has had **minimal concrete impact** on drug development timelines, FDA approvals, or patient outcomes.  It remains a niche pathway, largely eclipsed by the more established expanded‑access process.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the article | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Companies will charge “low hundreds of thousands” for unproven therapies under RtT.** | Brainstorm announced such pricing but never delivered; a few other firms floated similar price tags, but none resulted in sustained sales. |
| **RtT will create a market for “mud and slop” therapies, especially in diseases with no options.** | The feared flood of useless products did **not** materialize.  Only a handful of RtT offers have been made, and most were withdrawn or failed to attract patients. |
| **Profit motive will dominate, turning desperate patients into revenue sources.** | While profit motives exist, the financial upside has been negligible because patient uptake has been extremely low.  Companies continue to rely on traditional clinical‑trial funding. |
| **Regulatory oversight will be minimal, exposing patients to unknown risks.** | The FDA retains the right to intervene for safety; in practice, most sponsors still use expanded‑access protocols that involve FDA review.  No major safety scandals linked directly to RtT have been reported. |
| **RtT will accelerate drug development or lead to earlier approvals.** | No clear acceleration effect has been documented.  The standard FDA pathways remain the primary route to approval; RtT has not shortened timelines for any approved product. |

**Bottom line:** The article’s more alarmist predictions (mass exploitation, widespread “useless” therapies) have **not been borne out**.  The RtT law remains a peripheral, rarely used mechanism with limited commercial relevance.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a well‑written, timely critique of a controversial policy and foreshadows ethical concerns that remain relevant, but the specific case (Brainstorm’s RtT plan) never materialized into a larger industry shift, limiting its long‑term impact.
