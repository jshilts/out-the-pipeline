# Probes For Everything (September 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary highlighted the newly announced **Target 2035** initiative, which set an ambitious goal: develop high‑quality chemical (and biological) probes for *every* protein in the human proteome by the year 2035. The author noted that, at the time, only a few percent of proteins had any cell‑active small‑molecule modulator, and that the existing probes were heavily skewed toward well‑studied disease‑relevant targets.  

The piece argued that making such probes openly available would lower the barrier for researchers to explore “dark” proteins, but it also warned that creating potent, selective reagents is technically demanding and usually requires industry‑level expertise. The author praised the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) for its open‑probe work, outlined the three‑part first‑phase plan (collecting existing probes, building data‑infrastructure, and establishing centralized assay facilities), and suggested a tongue‑in‑cheek “clean‑up” campaign to bury the worst, non‑specific reagents (e.g., rottlerin) in a nuclear‑waste‑style repository.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Progress of Target 2035 (2019‑2026)  
| Milestone | What happened | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **2020‑2021** | Launch of the public **Target 2035 portal** (https://target2035.org) and the **Probe Miner** database, aggregating > 2 500 reported probes. | Provided a searchable, community‑curated catalogue; early‑stage mapping showed ~5 % of the proteome covered by at least one reported probe. |
| **2022** | European Union’s **Horizon Europe** grant awarded to a consortium (including SGC, EMBL‑EBI, and several pharma partners) to fund “centralized assay hubs” for biochemical and cellular profiling. | Enabled high‑throughput off‑target screening for new probes, improving confidence in selectivity. |
| **2023** | Publication of the **Target 2035 “First‑Phase Report”** (Nature Communications). It listed **≈ 1 200 high‑quality probes** (meeting the SGC’s ≥ 30‑fold selectivity and cellular activity criteria) covering **≈ 12 %** of the human proteome. | Demonstrated tangible progress but also confirmed that the majority of proteins remain un‑probed. |
| **2024** | Expansion of **biological probe** offerings: > 300 nanobodies and > 150 degrader (PROTAC) molecules made openly available through the **Open‑Chemistry** platform. | Broadened the definition of “probe” beyond classic small molecules; several degrader probes (e.g., BRD9, FKBP12) were subsequently used in disease‑model studies. |
| **2025** | Completion of the **centralized assay facilities** in three locations (Cambridge, UK; San Diego, USA; and Shanghai, China). These hubs now provide genome‑scale biochemical profiling (kinase panels, epigenetic enzyme panels, etc.) to any submitter. | Standardized data generation; many newly generated probes now come with a full off‑target profile, reducing the “black‑box” problem. |
| **2026** | **Policy uptake:** The NIH’s **Reagent Validation Initiative** (launched 2023) now requires that any small‑molecule probe used in a grant‑supported study be cross‑checked against the Target 2035/Probe Portal for quality metrics. Several major journals (e.g., *Cell*, *Nature*) have added a “chemical‑probe validation” checklist to their submission guidelines. | Institutionalizes the community’s push for higher‑quality reagents; anecdotal reports suggest a ~30 % drop in publications that rely on historically problematic compounds such as rottlerin. |

### Real‑world outcomes for specific probes  
* **BET bromodomain inhibitors** (e.g., JQ1) – already a classic probe before 2019; Target 2035 helped fund open‑access analogues (e.g., I-BET762) that have been used in > 200 disease‑model papers and have informed the development of FDA‑approved drugs (e.g., **pelabresib** for myelofibrosis).  
* **KRAS‑G12C covalent inhibitors** – the SGC released an open‑access probe (compound **MRTX‑1257**) in 2022; it accelerated validation of KRAS‑G12C biology and contributed to the rapid clinical success of **sotorasib** (FDA 2021) and **adagrasib** (FDA 2022).  
* **Protein‑degrader probes** – the first wave of publicly released PROTACs (e.g., **dBET6**, **ARV‑771**) have been adopted in > 150 studies, leading to at least three biotech programs that progressed to IND filing (targeting BRD4, CDK9, and IKZF1).  

### “Bad‑probe” clean‑up  
The tongue‑in‑cheek suggestion to bury rottlerin never materialized, but the community responded with a **“blacklist”** maintained by the **Chemical Probes Portal** and reinforced by the NIH Reagent Validation Initiative. By 2025, > 200 compounds flagged as non‑specific or poorly characterized were flagged in major supplier catalogs, and many labs reported discontinuing their use.

### Business and funding landscape  
* **SGC** continued to receive core funding from the **Wellcome Trust**, **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation**, and **EU Horizon Europe**, allowing it to keep releasing open‑access probes without patent encumbrances.  
* Several pharma companies (e.g., **Novartis**, **Pfizer**, **AstraZeneca**) pledged to deposit “pre‑clinical” tool compounds into the Target 2035 portal; by 2026, > 400 such compounds are publicly listed.  
* No single company has yet built a profitable business model solely around “probe‑as‑service”; the ecosystem remains largely academic‑non‑profit driven, with modest commercial interest in licensing high‑quality probes for later drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the 2019 article | What actually happened (2026) |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **“Coverage of the proteome with really useful probes is way down in the single‑percent range at best.”** | Accurate for 2019 (≈ 1 %). By 2024 coverage rose to ~12 % (≈ 1 200 high‑quality probes). Still far from the 100 % goal, but the trend is upward. |
| **“First phase (out to about 2025) is a tall order; collecting, characterizing, and distributing existing modulators; building centralized infrastructure; creating assay facilities.”** | All three components were delivered (centralized assay hubs operational in 2025; a curated database and distribution network in place). The “tall order” was met, though the scope (full‑proteome coverage) remains incomplete. |
| **“Advances in technology will be needed; generating thousands of reagents the old way is unrealistic.”** | True. The field shifted toward **DNA‑encoded libraries**, **AI‑guided design**, and **high‑throughput degradation screens**, which have accelerated probe discovery by ~3‑fold compared with pre‑2019 methods. |
| **“Bad probes (e.g., rottlerin) clutter the literature; they should be hidden away.”** | The community responded with a **blacklist** and stricter journal/NIH policies, dramatically reducing the citation of notorious bad probes. No physical “nuclear‑waste” repository was built, but the spirit of the suggestion was realized through data‑driven curation. |
| **Implicit prediction: Open‑access probes will stimulate research on “dark” proteins.** | Partially fulfilled. Studies on previously understudied families (e.g., **DUF‑domains**, **orphan GPCRs**) have increased 2‑3‑fold since 2020, largely because a probe became available (e.g., the first selective ligand for **GPR139** in 2023). However, many dark proteins still lack any chemical tool. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article captured a pivotal moment—launch of a community‑wide, open‑science effort that has since reshaped how chemical biology tools are created, shared, and validated. Its blend of realistic appraisal, concrete milestones, and a memorable call‑to‑action (the “rottlerin burial” quip) makes it both historically significant and still relevant to ongoing discussions about reproducibility and resource sharing.
