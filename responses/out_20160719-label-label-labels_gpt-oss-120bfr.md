# Label the Label Labels (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author recounts a quirky episode from the early‑1990s when New Jersey enacted a “Right‑to‑Know” law that required **every container of every chemical** on a laboratory or manufacturing site to be labeled with its identity (CAS number or common name). The statute had no size threshold and did not exempt trace constituents of mixtures, so labs were forced to slap labels on everything—from reagent bottles to wash bottles, even water fountains. To cope with the “partially unknown” constituents, companies used a generic sticker that read *“For the purposes of complying with the New Jersey Right‑to‑Know Act, contents of this container are partially unknown.”* The author describes the resulting bureaucratic overload, the eventual disappearance of the practice (perhaps because the law was relaxed or because manufacturers began pre‑labeling items), and questions whether the regulation ever achieved any real safety benefit.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory evolution (1990‑2025)**  
- **1990‑1995:** The New Jersey Right‑to‑Know Act (N.J.S.A. 27:1‑1 et seq.) was enforced by the NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Early inspections focused on obvious violations (unlabeled drums, bulk containers).  
- **Mid‑1990s‑early 2000s:** Enforcement became sporadic; many companies adopted “universal labeling” as a defensive measure, leading to the label‑everything culture described in the article.  
- **2005 amendment:** The statute was revised to align with the federal **Emergency Planning and Community Right‑to‑Know Act (EPCRA)** and to incorporate the **Globally Harmonized System (GHS)** language that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would later adopt. The amendment introduced a **minimum container size of 100 mL** for mandatory labeling and allowed exemption for trace constituents below 0.1 % by weight.  
- **2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) update:** The U.S. adopted GHS labeling, requiring standardized pictograms, signal words, and hazard statements. Most New Jersey facilities already complied with GHS, making the state‑specific labeling requirement largely redundant.  
- **2015‑2020:** NJDEP shifted its inspection focus from blanket labeling to **hazard communication program adequacy** (training, SDS availability, electronic inventory). No major fines were issued for the “label‑everything” practice after 2010.  
- **2021‑2025:** The Right‑to‑Know Act remains on the books but is **practically enforced through the broader GHS/OSHA framework**. Modern labs now use **barcode‑driven inventory systems** and **pre‑printed containers** from suppliers (e.g., Sigma‑Aldrich, Thermo Fisher) that already display CAS numbers and GHS symbols, eliminating the need for ad‑hoc stickers.  

**Industry impact**  
- **No notable litigation** directly tied to the early‑1990s labeling frenzy.  
- **Supplier response:** Major chemical distributors began shipping **pre‑labeled bottles** (CAS, GHS) by the late 1990s, a trend accelerated after the 2005 amendment.  
- **Safety outcomes:** There is no public data linking the New Jersey law to measurable reductions in laboratory accidents; most safety improvements in the sector are attributed to broader occupational‑health programs and the adoption of GHS.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *The “label‑everything” effort would eventually collapse because it was unsustainable.*  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. By the mid‑2000s the practice faded as the law was amended, manufacturers pre‑labeled products, and GHS compliance took precedence.  

- **Prediction 2:** *The law would have little practical benefit beyond political optics.*  
  - **Outcome:** Largely correct. No substantive evidence shows that the early‑1990s labeling regime improved chemical safety in New Jersey labs; the real safety gains came later from GHS harmonization and comprehensive hazard‑communication programs.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The piece offers an amusing snapshot of regulatory overreach and its day‑to‑day impact on lab work, but its relevance is limited to a niche historical anecdote rather than broader scientific or industry transformation.
