# Literature Notes (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief blog post from February 2010 discussing two publishing-related developments in chemistry journals. First, the author notes that Tetrahedron Letters, which pioneered graphical abstracts in organic chemistry, has finally started including these graphical abstracts in their RSS feeds. The author expresses appreciation for this change, noting that many readers (including themselves) consume journal content through RSS feeds. Second, the author announces that they've accepted an invitation to join the editorial advisory board of a new American Chemical Society journal, ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters. The author observes that the board includes colleagues from their graduate school days and former coworkers, indicating they've reached a career stage where peers hold editorial positions. The post closes with a lighthearted comment about ensuring quality control by not letting flawed chemical structures "get past me," referencing a previous post about anti-Bredt cyclobutenes.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2010 article, both journals and the broader publishing landscape evolved significantly:

**ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters** became established as a legitimate publication venue for medicinal chemistry research. The journal has published continuously since 2010 and maintains an editorial advisory board structure. By 2024, it had established itself as one of several options for rapid publication in medicinal chemistry, alongside Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters (BMCL) as mentioned in the article. The journal operates within the ACS portfolio and follows standard peer-review practices.

**Tetrahedron Letters** continued publishing with its graphical abstract format, though Elsevier (its publisher) later expanded graphical abstract features across multiple journals in its portfolio. The practice of including graphical content in RSS feeds became more widespread across scientific publishing as RSS consumption grew, then later declined with the rise of other content delivery methods.

The broader context is that **RSS feed usage peaked around 2010-2013** and then gradually declined as social media platforms, email alerts, and other content discovery methods became more popular among scientists. Many publishers shifted focus to other distribution channels.

**Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters** (the competing journal mentioned) continued publishing and remains active as of 2024, maintaining its position alongside ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters in the short-form medicinal chemistry publication landscape.

No specific drugs, drug approvals, policy changes, or business outcomes are directly traceable to these publication developments—they represent routine evolution in academic publishing infrastructure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article contains only one implicit prediction:
- **That ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters would "work out" as a journal and compete with BMCL**

**Outcome**: ✓ **Prediction accurate**. ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters has operated continuously since 2010, established itself as a legitimate venue in medicinal chemistry, and serves as a competitive alternative to Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters as intended. Both journals remain active and serve similar niches in the publication ecosystem.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This ranks in the bottom 20-30% because it's essentially administrative news about routine publishing developments with no broader scientific, clinical, or industrial implications. While mildly interesting to publishing insiders in 2010, it has minimal lasting importance and contains no significant scientific insights or developments that impacted the biotechnology industry.
