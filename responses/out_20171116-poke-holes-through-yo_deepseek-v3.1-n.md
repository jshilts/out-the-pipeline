# Poke Holes Through Your Membranes. It's Fun. (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the persistent challenge of cell membrane permeability in drug development. The author explains how cell membranes naturally block many drug candidates, with membrane crossing ability being one of the most fundamental properties required for effective therapeutics. The piece reviews traditional approaches to membrane penetration including electroporation (using electric fields to create temporary pores), which works well for charged molecules like DNA and RNA but is less effective for uncharged proteins and drug molecules, and cell-penetrating peptides, which require chemical conjugation and have uncertain effectiveness.

The main focus is on a newer mechanical approach using microfluidic techniques, where cells are forced through tiny constrictions, stressing their membranes enough to allow small molecules to slip through. This method appears complementary to electroporation as it works particularly well for uncharged molecules. The article highlights a specific study using this technique to successfully deliver normally impermeable Pfizer JAK inhibitors into cells for target-engagement studies, suggesting this could address the backlog of interesting molecules that can't reach their intracellular targets.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2017 article, the field of membrane permeability and intracellular delivery has continued to evolve with both progress and limitations:

**Clinical Translation of JAK Inhibitors:** The Pfizer JAK inhibitors mentioned in the article likely refer to compounds like abrocitinib or other JAK1 inhibitors. Several JAK inhibitors have indeed achieved FDA approval and clinical success since 2017, including abrocitinib (Cibinqo) approved in 2021 for atopic dermatitis, and upadacitinib (Rinvoq) approved for multiple inflammatory conditions. However, these drugs' success came through traditional oral administration and formulation optimization rather than mechanical membrane disruption techniques.

**Microfluidic Cell Squeezing:** The mechanical membrane disruption technique described has found niche applications in research settings but has not become a mainstream clinical delivery method. Companies like SQZ Biotech, founded to commercialize cell squeezing technology, initially showed promise but faced significant challenges. SQZ Biotech's stock declined dramatically (from ~$14 IPO price to delisting) and the company was acquired by iECURE in 2024 for significantly reduced value, indicating limited commercial success despite promising preclinical data.

**Electroporation Advances:** Electroporation has continued to be a workhorse technique in research and has found expanded applications in gene therapy and CAR-T cell manufacturing. However, the inherent limitations mentioned in the article - cellular stress responses and variable efficiency - remain ongoing challenges.

**Cell-Penetrating Peptides:** This field has continued to be an active area of research with hundreds of publications, but clinical translation has been limited by the exact challenges mentioned: conjugation complexity, payload size limitations, and uncertain tissue distribution. No major FDA-approved drugs using cell-penetrating peptides have emerged as blockbusters since 2017.

**General Membrane Permeability Challenge:** The fundamental problem highlighted in the article remains largely unsolved. Membrane permeability continues to be a primary reason for drug candidate failure, and the pharmaceutical industry still relies heavily on traditional small molecule design rules (Lipinski's Rule of Five, etc.) rather than breakthrough delivery technologies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about future developments:

• **Prediction:** The microfluidic cell squeezing technique would enable better target-engagement studies for impermeable molecules
  - **Outcome:** **Mostly accurate** - The technique has been used in research settings for target engagement studies, but has not become widespread due to complexity, cost, and competing methods

• **Prediction:** This mechanical approach would complement electroporation by working well for uncharged molecules
  - **Outcome:** **Technically accurate** - Mechanically-induced membrane disruption does work differently from electroporation and can deliver uncharged payloads, but the approach hasn't achieved broad adoption

• **Prediction:** The technique would help address the backlog of interesting molecules that don't penetrate cells
  - **Outcome:** **Not realized** - No significant clinical pipeline or widespread research adoption has emerged using this approach; the "backlog" problem persists

• **Implicit prediction:** JAK inhibitors specifically mentioned would benefit from these delivery studies
  - **Outcome:** **Accurate for the broader class, but not due to delivery method** - JAK inhibitors did achieve success, but through traditional formulation and dosing optimization, not mechanical membrane disruption techniques

• **Implicit prediction:** These alternative delivery methods would gain broader adoption
  - **Outcome:** **Not realized** - Traditional formulation approaches, nanoparticle delivery systems, and prodrug strategies remain dominant; mechanical disruption methods remain niche research tools

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article addresses a real and persistent challenge in drug development, but focuses on a delivery technique that ultimately had limited impact. The broader membrane permeability problem is highly relevant, but the specific mechanical disruption method discussed has not delivered on its initial promise.
