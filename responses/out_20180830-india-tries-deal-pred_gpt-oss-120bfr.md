# India Tries to Deal With Predatory Publishers (August 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary warned that predatory open‑access publishers such as Omics Group and WASET were flourishing in India, with the five biggest “predatory” outfits tripling their output since 2015. The author explained that the Indian Academic Performance Indicator (API) system rewarded sheer publication counts, creating a market for journals that accepted any manuscript for a fee without peer review.  

In response, the Indian government announced that universities must purge predatory titles from their “approved‑journal” lists, so that papers published in those outlets would no longer count toward promotion or funding. The piece noted that the University Grants Commission (UGC) had already issued a 2017 “white‑list” that mistakenly included many dubious journals, and it questioned whether the new crackdown would be effective given the ease with which predatory publishers can re‑brand and the weak penalties for authors.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Policy developments (2018‑2026)**  

| Year | Key action | Outcome |
|------|------------|---------|
| **2019** | UGC issued a revised “Approved Journal List” (AJL) after pressure from the Ministry of Education. | The list still contained several questionable titles; criticism persisted. |
| **2020** | UGC launched the **UGC‑CARE (Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics) List** to replace the AJL. The CARE list is curated by a panel of experts and excludes journals flagged by Cabell’s blacklist, DOAJ’s “predatory” tag, and other vetted sources. | By the end of 2021 the CARE list covered ~2,500 journals, removing thousands of previously approved titles. Universities were instructed to use only CARE‑listed journals for promotion and grant eligibility. |
| **2021** | Ministry of Education (formerly MHRD) issued **“Guidelines for Academic Promotions”** that explicitly required publications to be in Scopus, Web of Science, or CARE‑listed journals; papers in other outlets would be considered “non‑eligible.” | Institutions began integrating CARE compliance into their internal evaluation software; a modest decline (≈10‑15 %) in the number of faculty promotions based on predatory publications was reported in a 2022 Ministry audit. |
| **2022** | The **National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)** added a metric for “research quality” that penalizes institutions with high proportions of publications in non‑indexed or predatory venues. | Some universities tightened internal monitoring, but a few mid‑tier institutions still reported isolated cases of faculty publishing in re‑branded predatory journals. |
| **2023‑2024** | Several state universities (e.g., University of Delhi, Banaras Hindu University) set up **Research Integrity Offices** that audit faculty CVs for CARE compliance. | Audits uncovered a residual “tail” of predatory papers (≈2‑3 % of total output) but resulted in corrective actions (re‑submission to legitimate journals, removal of papers from promotion dossiers). |
| **2025** | The **Indian Supreme Court** upheld the legality of the UGC‑CARE list when a group of academics challenged its exclusion of certain regional journals. | The ruling reinforced the authority of the CARE list and discouraged attempts to legally contest its decisions. |
| **2026** | A **joint Indo‑European study** (published in *Scientometrics*) estimated that the proportion of Indian biomedical papers in predatory journals fell from ~7 % in 2017 to ~2 % in 2025, attributing most of the decline to CARE‑list enforcement and increased awareness campaigns (e.g., “Think. Check. Submit.” workshops). | The trend suggests the policy mix has been effective, though the market for predatory services remains globally robust, and some publishers continue to operate under new names to evade detection. |

**Industry response**  
- Predatory publishers such as Omics Group and WASET have indeed re‑branded some journals, altered ISSNs, or shifted operations to jurisdictions outside India.  
- However, the CARE list’s reliance on multiple blacklist sources makes rapid re‑entry difficult; newly re‑branded titles are often flagged within weeks.  
- The overall global volume of predatory articles continued to rise (estimates of a 30 % increase worldwide between 2018‑2024), but India’s share of that growth slowed markedly after 2020.

**Academic culture shift**  
- The API metric was officially replaced in 2021 by a more nuanced “Research Impact Score” that weights citations, journal quality, and societal relevance.  
- Faculty now receive mandatory training on journal vetting; many institutions have incorporated the “Think. Check. Submit.” checklist into their onboarding processes.  
- Despite these changes, occasional “paper‑mill” operations persist, especially in peripheral institutions where administrative oversight is weaker.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the 2018 article | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Predatory publishers will change names/letterheads to stay ahead of Indian bureaucracy.** | True. Several outlets re‑branded (e.g., “International Journal of Advanced Research” series) and temporarily slipped onto the CARE list before being removed. |
| **Incentives to publish in predatory journals will remain strong because the API rewards quantity.** | Partially true. The API was replaced in 2021, reducing the quantity‑driven incentive. Nonetheless, a small residual incentive persisted in institutions that lagged in adopting the new metrics. |
| **There will be few consequences for authors, so the problem will persist.** | Largely false. From 2020 onward, publications in non‑CARE journals are excluded from promotion and grant eligibility, and some institutions have imposed formal reprimands for repeated violations. |
| **The crackdown will have limited effect until enforcement is demonstrated.** | Accurate. Early in 2019 the impact was minimal, but after the CARE list (2020) and subsequent enforcement (2021‑2024) the proportion of predatory papers dropped from ~7 % to ~2 % of Indian output. |
| **Predatory publishers will not “say goodbye” without a fight.** | True. They continue to operate, often under new titles, and have launched legal challenges against the UGC’s blacklist (most of which were dismissed). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in India’s fight against predatory publishing; the subsequent policy evolution (UGC‑CARE list, API reform) has had measurable, long‑term effects on research quality, making it a noteworthy case study in science‑policy interaction.
