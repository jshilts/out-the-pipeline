# Calls For Andrew Witty's Job at GSK (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes mounting pressure on GlaxoSmithKline CEO Andrew Witty in May 2015, with investors calling for his removal due to poor performance. GSK faced multiple challenges: lagging share prices, a depleted drug pipeline, a $489 million fine from a bribery scandal in China, and sluggish U.S. sales. The company's profits remained heavily dependent on the aging asthma drug Advair, while newer respiratory medications Breo and Anoro were underperforming. Some analysts recommended cutting dividends to reinvest in research and development, but the article's author expressed skepticism that such measures would be implemented given GSK's stated commitment to shareholder returns over R&D investment.

## 2. HISTORY
**Leadership Changes**: Andrew Witty remained CEO until March 2017, when he retired after nearly 9 years. Emma Walmsley succeeded him in April 2017, becoming the first woman to lead a major pharmaceutical company.

**Pipeline and Drug Development**: GSK's respiratory franchise continued to face challenges. Advair eventually lost patent protection and faced generic competition. Breo (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) and Anoro (umeclidinium/vilanterol) eventually gained traction but never fully replaced Advair's revenue. The company did eventually spin off its HIV medicines into a joint venture with Pfizer (ViiV Healthcare), which became highly successful.

**R&D Strategy**: GSK maintained its focus on shareholder returns while gradually increasing R&D investment. The company pursued bolt-on acquisitions rather than major internal research expansion, consistent with the 2015 strategy. The dividend was maintained throughout this period.

**Business Performance**: GSK's stock underperformed relative to pharmaceutical peers during much of this period. The company later pursued major restructuring, including the 2019 consumer healthcare joint venture with Pfizer and eventual demerger.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"Witty running out of time"** - **Accurate**: Witty announced his retirement within two years (March 2017), though the timeline was longer than the 12 months some investors demanded.

• **Dividend cut for R&D** - **Inaccurate**: GSK maintained its dividend throughout this period and did not significantly increase R&D spending as a percentage of revenue. The company continued prioritizing shareholder returns.

• **Stock price reaction to R&D investment** - **Accurate in principle**: The author correctly predicted that markets would punish R&D-focused strategies. Most large pharma companies, including GSK, continued emphasizing financial engineering over risky long-term research investments.

• **Respiratory franchise replacement** - **Mixed**: While Breo and Anoro eventually achieved moderate success and generics eroded Advair sales, GSK's respiratory portfolio never fully recovered its dominant market position.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical industry dynamics, illustrating the tension between short-term shareholder returns and long-term R&D investment that continues to shape drug development strategy today.
