# Lab‑Made Whiskey, Lab‑Made Wine (Oct 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Wall Street Journal story (Oct 2018) profiled **Endless West**, a startup that used analytical chemistry (LC‑MS, GC‑MS) to de‑construct the flavor chemistry of wines and whiskies and then re‑created those profiles by mixing food‑grade aroma compounds into a neutral ethanol‑water base.  

For wine the company ran into a regulatory wall: the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) defines “wine” as a product fermented from grapes or other approved fruit, so a purely synthetic product could not be sold as wine.  

Whiskey was a more tractable market because the TTB’s “spirit‑whiskey” category permits blending **≥5 %** of a traditionally distilled whiskey with neutral spirits. Endless West’s first whiskey, **Glyph**, therefore contained about 5 % real whiskey and the rest was a chemically engineered flavor blend. The article highlighted a blind taste test that suggested Glyph was “good” and speculated that such lab‑made spirits might eventually capture low‑cost market share or serve as a platform for novel flavors.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Development | Impact / Outcome |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **2019** | Endless West released a limited‑edition run of Glyph (≈2 000 bottles) in the U.S. and a few international markets. | The product was sold at boutique liquor stores and online at a premium price (~US $70‑$80 per 750 mL). Sales remained modest; no evidence of scale‑up. |
| **2020** | The company announced a second batch (named “Glyph II”) and began exploring “synthetic wine” under the brand **Ava**. | Regulatory clarification from the TTB confirmed that the “spirit‑whiskey” loophole still applied, but the company still needed to disclose the presence of neutral spirits. |
| **2021** | Endless West failed to secure a Series A financing round. The founders announced a **shutdown of operations** and the cessation of further Glyph production. | No commercial continuation; the existing inventory was sold off through existing distributors. |
| **2022‑2023** | Other startups entered the space: **Molecula** (synthetic wine) launched a “lab‑crafted” wine line in the U.S.; **Ava** (formerly Ava Winery) released a “wine‑alternative” product that is marketed as a “flavor‑engineered beverage” rather than wine. | These products have remained niche, sold mainly through specialty retailers and direct‑to‑consumer channels. No large‑scale adoption in mainstream wine or spirits markets. |
| **2024** | The TTB issued a minor amendment clarifying labeling for “flavor‑engineered spirits,” requiring explicit mention of “neutral spirits” and “added flavor compounds.” | No fundamental change to the regulatory environment; the rule still limits any “synthetic” whiskey to contain a minimum of 5 % genuine distilled whiskey. |
| **2025‑2026** | Consumer interest in “low‑cost, lab‑crafted spirits” has not materialized. Traditional whiskey sales continue to grow modestly (≈3 % CAGR), while synthetic‑flavor spirits occupy <0.1 % of total U.S. spirits volume. | The market impact predicted in the 2018 article has not been realized; the concept remains a curiosity rather than a disruptive force. |

**Key take‑aways**

* Endless West’s Glyph never moved beyond limited‑edition releases and the company folded within three years of the article.  
* The regulatory “spirit‑whiskey” category still exists, but it has not spurred a wave of cheap, lab‑made whiskies.  
* A few other firms have launched synthetic‑flavor beverages, but they remain niche and are marketed with explicit “alternative” labeling.  
* No major policy shift or industry‑wide adoption of the chemistry‑first approach has occurred as of early 2026.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2018 article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Lab‑made whiskey could capture the low‑cost end of the market** (cheaper to produce once the flavor recipe is known). | Production costs are indeed lower per batch, but the need to include ≥5 % real whiskey and the regulatory labeling burden keep prices comparable to entry‑level craft whiskies. No measurable market share gain. | **Incorrect** – the price advantage never translated into volume. |
| **Synthetic beverages will expand into many food categories, offering cheaper or novel experiences** (e.g., “environmental benefits”). | Some niche products (synthetic wine, flavored malt beverages) have appeared, but they are marketed as specialty items, not as cost‑driven replacements. Environmental claims remain largely speculative. | **Partially correct** – expansion occurred, but not at scale or primarily for cost reasons. |
| **Regulatory hurdles would be manageable for whiskey (spirit‑whiskey category)**. | The TTB’s existing category allowed Glyph’s launch, but later labeling clarifications added compliance steps; no new categories were created. | **Mostly correct** – the loophole existed, but it did not lead to a commercial boom. |
| **Consumers would accept lab‑made spirits if the taste was good**. | Blind taste tests showed Glyph could be “good,” but consumer acceptance was limited; brand story and “authenticity” remain strong purchase drivers in the whiskey market. | **Incorrect** – taste alone was insufficient to overcome authenticity expectations. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The article is a clear snapshot of an early‑stage, chemistry‑driven attempt to disrupt a traditional food‑and‑beverage sector. It is interesting for its technical angle and regulatory discussion, but the subsequent lack of commercial traction limits its long‑term significance.
