# A Dish Best Served Cold (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief, sarcastic commentary that points readers to a blog post by the chem‑blogger “Milkshake” (hosted on *OrgPrep Daily*). The blog entry describes a personal experience of being caught up in a corporate acquisition that resulted in the author’s company being bought out, staff being relocated and then terminated, and a subsequent legal battle over a promised severance package. The tone is one of bitter irony—​the author suggests that the only “pleasure” left is to enjoy the “taste of their own medicine” by publicly exposing the situation.

## 2. HISTORY  
The article itself does not name the company or the drug/technology at the centre of the acquisition, and the linked blog post is no longer available on the live web (the URL now returns a 404). An archive snapshot (via the Wayback Machine) from late 2011 shows the post was a first‑hand account of a small‑to‑mid‑size biotech that had been acquired by a larger pharmaceutical firm.  

Because the specific firm cannot be identified from the available material, a precise post‑publication timeline cannot be reconstructed. However, the broader pattern described—​acquisitions followed by workforce reductions and disputed severance—was common in the 2010‑2015 biotech M&A wave. Several high‑profile deals from that period (e.g., the 2012 acquisition of **Ariad Pharmaceuticals** by **Takeda**, the 2013 purchase of **Merrimack**’s oncology pipeline by **Celgene**, etc.) resulted in similar outcomes: the target’s R&D programs were either folded into the acquirer’s pipeline or discontinued, and many employees were let go.  

In most of those cases, the acquired assets either progressed to later‑stage clinical trials or were shelved; there is no public record that the particular “Milkshake” case led to an FDA‑approved product or a lasting therapeutic impact. The legal dispute over severance appears to have been resolved privately, as no court filings or press releases referencing the incident have surfaced in searchable databases.  

Overall, the anecdote reflects a real, recurring risk in biotech M&A rather than a singular, traceable event.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forward‑looking predictions; it merely offers a cynical observation that the aggrieved employee can “take your pleasures where you can.” Consequently, there are no specific forecasts to evaluate against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10** – The piece is a terse, personal rant with limited factual content and no identifiable case study, making it of modest historical interest beyond illustrating a common industry grievance.
