# A New Way to Make GSK3 Inhibitors (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the challenges and potential of GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) as a drug target. GSK3 is a kinase enzyme involved in numerous cellular processes with over 100 known substrates, making it implicated in diabetes, Alzheimer's, bipolar disorder, inflammation, cancer, and other conditions. Despite years of research and many known inhibitors, no GSK3-targeted therapy had successfully completed clinical trials as of 2016, primarily due to issues with selectivity and off-target effects.

The article focuses on a new approach published in *Science Signaling* by Israeli researchers who developed L807myr, an 11-amino-acid peptide modified with myristic acid that acts through a "substrate-inhibitor conversion" mechanism. The compound binds to GSK3 as a substrate, gets phosphorylated, and the resulting phosphorylated peptide becomes the actual tight-binding inhibitor. The authors reported promising results: the compound showed selectivity across a kinase panel, demonstrated activity in cell culture and mice, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and showed potential benefits in an Alzheimer's mouse model including reduced beta-amyloid levels and behavioral improvements. However, the author expressed caution given that previous GSK3 inhibitors showed toxicity in normal animals, and this new work lacked control experiments in healthy mice.

## 2. HISTORY

Since the 2016 article, GSK3 inhibitors have continued to face significant challenges in clinical development, and the specific L807myr compound has not emerged as an approved therapeutic:

**Clinical Development Landscape:**
- As of 2024, **no GSK3-selective inhibitor has received FDA approval** for any indication, confirming the article's assertion that this target remains challenging despite decades of research.
- Several GSK3 inhibitors have entered clinical trials but failed to advance, including tideglusib (for Alzheimer's and progressive supranuclear palsy) which showed hepatotoxicity in Phase II trials.
- Lithium, an old psychiatric drug, remains the only clinically used GSK3 inhibitor (as an indirect inhibitor), primarily for bipolar disorder. Its narrow therapeutic window and side effects highlight the challenges of modulating this pathway.

**Alzheimer's Disease Research Context:**
- The amyloid hypothesis that underpinned much GSK3 inhibitor development for Alzheimer's has faced significant challenges. The controversial approval of aducanumab (Aduhelm) in 2021 and lecanemab in 2023 has shifted focus toward antibody-based approaches, though debate continues about their efficacy.
- Mouse models of Alzheimer's remain problematic for drug development, as the 2016 article anticipated, with many compounds showing promise in animals but failing in human trials.

**GSK3 Research Developments:**
- The field has increasingly focused on understanding isoform-specific effects (GSK3α vs GSK3β), tissue-specific roles, and conditional knockout studies revealing the complexity of GSK3 inhibition.
- Research has expanded into new areas including cancer immunotherapy, where GSK3 inhibitors are being explored to modulate T cell function and enhance immune responses.
- Academic research on GSK3 continues robustly, with hundreds of papers published annually, but translation to approved medicines remains elusive.

**Specific Compound Status:**
- The L807myr compound described in the 2016 paper **has not advanced to clinical trials** or achieved commercial development. No published reports indicate further development beyond the original study.
- The innovative "substrate-inhibitor conversion" mechanism, while scientifically interesting, does not appear to have been widely adopted or successfully applied to other targets in the intervening years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author included several predictions and assessments:

• **"This new work has a long way to go"** ✓ **VERIFIED**. The compound did not advance to clinical trials and the GSK3 field continued to struggle with clinical translation.

• **"We'll see!" (regarding whether the selectivity approach would succeed)** ✓ **VERIFIED AS NON-SUCCESSFUL**. The L807myr compound did not succeed in getting "anywhere in the real world" as predicted—it did not advance beyond preclinical research.

• **"Other GSK3 inhibitors have shown activity in rodent models... but have been undone by toxicity"** ✓ **VERIFIED**. This pattern continued, with compounds like tideglusib failing in clinical trials due to safety concerns, reinforcing that mouse model success doesn't guarantee clinical utility.

• **Caution about lack of control animals in the study** ✓ **METHODOLOGICALLY CORRECT**. This highlighted a legitimate concern about the rigor of the preclinical data, which continued to be an issue in GSK3 inhibitor development.

• **Implication that selectivity alone might not solve GSK3 targeting problems** ✓ **VERIFIED**. Despite advances in understanding GSK3 biology and inhibitor design, achieving therapeutically useful GSK3 modulation remains challenging due to the fundamental complexity of its cellular roles.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates strong scientific insight in accurately predicting the challenges facing a novel therapeutic approach, with its cautionary notes about GSK3 inhibitor development proving prescient. The mechanism described was genuinely innovative but, as predicted, selectivity improvements alone were insufficient to overcome fundamental biological challenges in translating GSK3 modulation to clinical success.
