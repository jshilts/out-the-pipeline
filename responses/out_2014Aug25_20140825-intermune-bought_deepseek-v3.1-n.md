# Analysis of "InterMune Bought" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Roche's $8.3 billion acquisition of InterMune as the culmination of a "bizarre ride" for the biotechnology company and its stakeholders. The author characterizes this outcome as remarkable given that "a few years ago" such a valuation would have seemed unbelievable. The piece suggests the acquisition validates investment strategies focused on small biopharma companies, as investors will now use InterMune as a model for "trying to pick the next InterMune."

The article positions the deal as strategically logical for Roche while acknowledging InterMune's tumultuous history, including references to regulatory controversies and volatile investor experiences. The underlying implication is that persistence through biotech volatility can yield spectacular returns, even for companies that faced significant skepticism.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Context (Pre-2014):** InterMune's journey was indeed tumultuous. The company faced substantial controversy over its idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drug pirfenidone, including a 2010 FDA advisory panel vote against approval and subsequent FDA rejection that caused the stock to drop 78% in one day. The company also faced shareholder lawsuits and SEC investigations related to promotional practices for another drug.

**The Acquisition:** Roche's $8.3 billion purchase in August 2014 represented a 38% premium over InterMune's market value at the time. The deal centered on pirfenidone (marketed as Esbriet), which had gained approval in Europe and Canada for IPF treatment and was under FDA review in the US.

**Post-Acquisition Developments (2014-Present):**
- **FDA Approval:** In October 2014, just two months after the acquisition, the FDA approved pirfenidone for IPF treatment
- **Market Competition:** Esbriet faced competition from Boehringer Ingelheim's nintedanib (Ofev), approved by the FDA in 2014, creating a duopoly in the IPF treatment market
- **Revenue Performance:** Esbriet generated approximately $1 billion in annual sales at its peak, though revenues declined as generics entered the market
- **Patent Expirations:** Key patents expired in major markets (US patent expired 2019, European patents expiring 2020-2022)
- **Generic Competition:** Generic versions entered the market, significantly reducing revenue and market share for the branded product

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions:**
- **Strategic Value for Roche:** The acquisition proved strategically sound, providing Roche with an IPF treatment that generated substantial revenue during its patent-protected period
- **Investor Behavior:** The article correctly anticipated that the InterMune acquisition would become a reference point for biotech investors seeking the "next InterMune." The narrative of dramatic recovery and premium acquisition did indeed become part of biotech investment lore

**Incorrect or Overstated Predictions:**
- **Market Rationale Permanence:** The article implied this acquisition would provide a "rationale for years" for biotech investing. While it did become a case study, it proved to be more of an outlier than a replicable model
- **Timing:** The suggestion that such valuations would have seemed impossible "a few years ago" underestimated the biotech market's volatility—recent years have seen even more dramatic swings in both directions
- **Long-term Value Proposition:** The piece didn't fully capture how quickly patent expirations and generic competition would erode the acquired asset's value

**Market Context Evolution:** The article appeared during a biotech bull market (2012-2015) that saw numerous acquisitions at high premiums. However, the subsequent biotech market corrections (2016, 2022) revealed that many acquisitions failed to deliver expected returns, making InterMune more of an exception than the rule.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4/9**

This article represents a moderately interesting case study in biotech investment narratives, but its long-term importance is limited by several factors:

**Strengths:**
- Illustrates the dramatic volatility and potential of biotech investing
- Demonstrates how regulatory setbacks don't necessarily preclude eventual success
- Captures a moment when premium acquisitions were validating early-stage investment theses

**Limitations:**
- The specific case of InterMune proved to be more of an outlier than a replicable model
- The article focuses primarily on financial aspects rather than clinical or scientific innovation
- The acquisition's long-term strategic value was time-limited due to patent expirations
- The piece doesn't deeply explore the underlying science or clinical impact of the drug

**Historical Significance:** While the article captures an important moment in biotech M&A history, it serves more as a snapshot of market sentiment during a particular period rather than a prediction of enduring trends. The biotech sector's subsequent volatility and the mixed results of other premium acquisitions have contextualized this deal as part of a broader—and more complex—investment landscape.

The article's primary enduring value is as a reminder that biotech fortunes can change dramatically, but it doesn't provide the deeper insights into scientific innovation or healthcare impact that would warrant higher interest ranking.
