# Moderna's mRNA Flu Vaccine (December 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This December 2021 article analyzes Moderna's early-stage clinical data for its mRNA influenza vaccine candidate. The author notes that while mRNA technology proved highly effective for COVID-19 vaccines, the flu vaccine results were merely "OK" - not particularly better than existing influenza vaccines and perhaps somewhat inferior, particularly for influenza B strains and in older patients. The piece explains the fundamental challenge of influenza: unlike coronaviruses, flu viruses exhibit both antigenic drift (gradual mutations) and antigenic shift (genetic reassortment between strains), requiring annual vaccine updates and complicating strain prediction. Moderna's data showed less robust seroconversion across flu types, weaker responses in elderly patients compared to Sanofi's Fluzone, and required two doses rather than the single dose used by competitors. While acknowledging potential advantages like faster strain-matching and future multi-respiratory-virus combination vaccines, the author cautions against assuming mRNA technology would "sweep everything else away," emphasizing that immunology remains complex and multiple approaches should compete in clinical trials.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments have largely validated the article's measured skepticism about immediate mRNA superiority for influenza vaccines:

**Clinical Trial Progress**: Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech both advanced their mRNA flu vaccine programs into larger Phase 3 trials. Moderna's mRNA-1010 candidate showed promise but continued to face challenges matching the efficacy of established egg-based and recombinant vaccines. By 2023-2024, both companies had completed or were conducting pivotal studies.

**Regulatory Outcomes**: As of late 2024, no mRNA influenza vaccine has received full FDA approval for widespread use. The FDA has been particularly scrutinizing the manufacturing consistency and broader population data, given the higher reactogenicity profile (more side effects like fever and fatigue) compared to traditional flu shots.

**Market Performance**: Traditional flu vaccine manufacturers like Sanofi, GSK, and Seqirus maintained dominant market positions. The existing quadrivalent influenza vaccines, including high-dose and adjuvanted versions for elderly patients, continued to be the standard of care. 

**Combination Vaccine Development**: Moderna continued pursuing combination respiratory vaccines (flu + COVID + RSV), but these remained in early development stages, facing the complex challenge of balancing immunogenicity across multiple antigens without excessive reactogenicity.

**Manufacturing and Cost**: The shorter production timeline advantage of mRNA technology proved less decisive than anticipated, as traditional manufacturing had also evolved with cell-based and recombinant technologies that offered faster turnaround times than egg-based production.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and observations about mRNA flu vaccines:

• **"mRNA isn't magic" - that the technology wouldn't automatically be superior for influenza**: ✓ **Mostly accurate**. Subsequent Phase 3 data showed mRNA flu vaccines achieved non-inferiority but not clear superiority over existing vaccines. Traditional vaccines maintained competitive efficacy, especially in elderly populations.

• **"We're going to be seeing a lot of clinical data" and "we're in the early days"**: ✓ **Accurate**. Both Moderna and Pfizer conducted extensive Phase 3 trials through 2022-2024, generating substantial clinical datasets comparing mRNA flu vaccines against established alternatives.

• **Multiple companies would compete (Pfizer/BioNTech, GSK/CureVac, Sanofi/Translate Bio)**: ✓ **Accurate**. The competitive landscape evolved with these players, though partnerships shifted (e.g., Sanofi eventually acquired Translate Bio outright).

• **"Don't assume that mRNA is out of the flu-vaccine picture"**: ✓ **Partially accurate**. While mRNA flu vaccines haven't been eliminated from consideration, they haven't achieved breakthrough status. Clinical development continues, but widespread adoption remains uncertain pending clear advantages in efficacy, safety, or cost.

• **Shorter lead time advantage would be valuable**: ⚠️ **Mixed results**. While mRNA production is faster theoretically, the practical advantage proved less significant as regulatory timelines, distribution logistics, and the complexity of strain selection still constrained rapid deployment.

• **Potential for multi-respiratory-virus combination shots**: ⚠️ **Still unproven**. Combination vaccines remain in development but face significant scientific and regulatory hurdles; no such product has reached market approval as of 2024.

• **"Immunology is still immunology; we have no keys yet that will unlock all those doors"**: ✓ **Accurate**. The fundamental challenges of influenza immunity - variable strain effectiveness, waning immunity in elderly patients, and the complexity of broadly protective responses - remained challenging across all vaccine platforms.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrated prescient analysis by challenging prevailing mRNA enthusiasm and correctly identifying the key scientific and practical hurdles for mRNA flu vaccines, most of which were later validated by clinical and market developments.
