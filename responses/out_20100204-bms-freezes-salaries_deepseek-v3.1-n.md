# BMS Freezes Salaries (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article reported that Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) announced a company-wide salary freeze for 2010, catching many employees by surprise as discussions about pay increases had been ongoing just the previous week. The author noted this move while not necessarily signaling imminent bad news, was "never a sign of good news." The article also mentioned BMS was dealing with the approaching patent expiration of Plavix (clopidogrel), its blockbuster antiplatelet drug, among other challenges facing the company at the time.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2010 salary freeze announcement, BMS underwent significant transformation:

**Plavix patent cliff impact**: Plavix lost US patent protection in May 2012, causing revenue to plummet from over \$7 billion annually to minimal sales almost overnight as generics flooded the market. This represented one of the largest patent cliffs in pharmaceutical history.

**Strategic transformation**: BMS executed a major strategic shift toward specialty biologics and immuno-oncology. The company divested non-core assets including selling its diabetes business to AstraZeneca for \$4.1 billion in 2013-2014, and spinning off its nutritional business (Mead Johnson) in 2009.

**Key drug approvals and launches**: BMS achieved major successes with immunotherapies—Opdivo (nivolumab) was approved in 2014 for melanoma and expanded to multiple cancer types, becoming a multi-billion dollar blockbuster. Eliquis (apixaban), developed with Pfizer, gained approval in 2012 and grew into a cardiovascular blockbuster exceeding \$10 billion annually.

**Business performance**: Despite the initial salary freeze and patent cliff challenges, BMS maintained profitability and ultimately thrived through successful pipeline development and strategic acquisitions, including the \$74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article made no explicit predictions about future events, instead taking an observational stance about the salary freeze and noting uncertainty about whether it signaled "imminent bad news" while acknowledging BMS's patent expiration challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article was a brief, timely industry note about a specific company's cost-cutting measure during a challenging period, but lacked broader analytical depth or long-term perspective that would make it particularly noteworthy in retrospect. While it correctly identified BMS's patent cliff concerns, the salary freeze itself was a routine corporate response rather than a meaningful indicator of the company's future trajectory.
