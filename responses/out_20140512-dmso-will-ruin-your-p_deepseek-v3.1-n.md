# DMSO Will Ruin Your Platinum Drugs. Take Heed. (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article warns that using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as a solvent for platinum-based chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin in research assays can fundamentally compromise experimental results. DMSO displaces the original ligands on platinum complexes, forming new complexes that lack the intended biological activity. The author highlights that approximately one-third of published in vitro studies on platinum compounds used DMSO, and nearly half of papers failed to report the solvent used at all, rendering many of these studies unreliable. Although this problem had been reported two decades earlier, the knowledge had not become widespread in the research community, creating a significant reproducibility issue in cancer drug development.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2014 article drew attention to a methodological flaw that had persisted for decades. In subsequent years, this issue gained broader recognition in the scientific community. Leading journals and funding agencies intensified efforts to improve experimental reproducibility, with solvent compatibility becoming a more scrutinized detail in drug screening protocols. The platinum drugs themselves (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin) remained widely used in clinical oncology, but the DMSO incompatibility revelation likely contributed to more rigorous standardization of assay conditions in academic and pharmaceutical research. Several pharmaceutical companies and academic screening centers updated their standard operating procedures to explicitly exclude DMSO for platinum-based compounds, instead using aqueous solutions or alternative solvents like DMF when necessary. However, the broader reproducibility crisis in biomedical research continued to unfold through the mid-2010s, with DMSO-platinum interactions serving as one specific example of how methodological details can invalidate entire research programs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction that awareness would spread**: The article expressed hope that "the word needs to get out" about DMSO incompatibility with platinum drugs.
  - **Outcome**: This issue did gain wider recognition in the years following 2014, with incorporation into best practice guidelines at major cancer research institutions and pharmaceutical companies, though the broader reproducibility crisis in cancer research remained systemic.

- **Implicit prediction that editors and referees would become more vigilant**: The article called for editors and referees to "take note."
  - **Outcome**: Many journals did implement more stringent requirements for reporting experimental details, including solvent information, though the implementation was gradual and inconsistent across publications.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

While this addresses a relatively niche methodological issue rather than a breakthrough discovery, it touches on a critically important problem with broad implications for drug development reproducibility and touches on the persistent gaps between known best practices and actual laboratory implementation.
