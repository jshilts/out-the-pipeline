# Tarceva Targets (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the market dynamics surrounding OSI Pharmaceuticals' cancer drug Tarceva, which was co-owned with Genentech. Tarceva is described as a HER1/HER2 inhibitor similar to AstraZeneca's already-existing drug Iressa, with Tarceva consistently being compared to and "living in Iressa's shadow" even before launch. Notably, OSI's stock price had shown significant volatility, spiking in April when clinical results made Tarceva appear to outperform Iressa, then declining when Genentech issued more conservative patient uptake estimates that were below what OSI had been indicating. The piece highlights an unusual public disagreement between two partner companies about their shared drug's revenue potential. Wall Street analysts were divided, with CSFB projecting that upcoming Iressa survival data (the ISEL study) would show similar efficacy and make the two drugs look "clinically comparable," while Morgan Stanley maintained a more positive outlook on Tarceva's broad market opportunity. The author expresses skepticism about major differentiation between Tarceva and Iressa, viewing them as near-simultaneous developments that often face challenges, and also suggests problems for ImClone's Erbitux, which targets similar pathways but at higher cost.

## 2. HISTORY
Tarceva (erlotinib) did go on to receive FDA approval for non-small cell lung cancer and later pancreatic cancer. However, the competitive landscape evolved in ways that both validated and contradicted the article's concerns. Iressa (gefitinib) did face significant setbacks—the ISEL trial mentioned in the article failed to show survival benefit (contrary to CSFB's prediction), leading to Iressa's withdrawal from the U.S. market in 2005 and restricting its use elsewhere. This created space for Tarceva to establish itself, which it did with moderate success in the EGFR-mutant lung cancer population. The more transformative development, not anticipated in this 2004 piece, was the emergence of molecular testing and personalized medicine in oncology. We now understand that both drugs work primarily in patients with specific EGFR mutations, which dramatically reshaped prescribing patterns and market dynamics. Erbitux (cetuximab) found success but in different cancer types (colorectal and head/neck cancers), so the direct threat to ImClone was less severe than suggested. OSI Pharmaceuticals was eventually acquired by Astellas in 2010 for $4 billion, suggesting some vindication of the drug's value, though this came after years of stock volatility. The broader prediction about cancer therapy markets fragmenting by patient subsets proved accurate—today's oncology relies heavily on biomarker testing to guide treatment selection, fundamentally different from the "blockbuster for all" approach prevalent in 2004.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Iressa ISEL trial success prediction**: CSFB predicted the Iressa study would meet its survival endpoint and show the drugs as "clinically comparable." ❌ **Incorrect**—The ISEL trial actually failed to demonstrate survival benefit, leading to Iressa's U.S. market withdrawal and giving Tarceva a competitive advantage.
  
- **Tarceva-Iressa differentiation**: Author expressed uncertainty about significant differences between the two drugs. ⚠️ **Partially correct direction, wrong specifics**—While both were EGFR inhibitors, Iressa's failure and Tarceva's success created meaningful clinical differentiation. The real differentiator emerged later: different toxicity profiles and subtle efficacy differences that mattered in clinical practice.
  
- **Oncology market fragmentation**: Author predicted cancer therapy markets would move away from treating everyone with the same drug. ✅ **Accurately prescient**—This prediction proved remarkably forward-thinking, as personalized oncology based on molecular markers now dominates cancer treatment paradigms.
  
- **ImClone/Erbitux competitive threat**: Suggested Erbitux would face challenges competing against Tarceva. ❌ **Overstated the direct threat**—Erbitux found strong markets in colorectal and head/neck cancers, not primarily lung cancer, so direct competition was less intense than predicted.
  
- **Near-simultaneous development challenges**: Suggested simultaneous development of similar drugs "doesn't always work out too well." ⚠️ **Mixed outcomes**—Tarceva ultimately succeeded, Iressa mostly failed, illustrating that near-simultaneous development can benefit one party significantly at the other's expense.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates sharp observation of clinical development and market dynamics, especially regarding the Tarceva-Iressa relationship and correct anticipation of oncology's shift toward personalized treatment, making it valuable reading for understanding the period's competitive tensions despite some inaccurate specific predictions.
