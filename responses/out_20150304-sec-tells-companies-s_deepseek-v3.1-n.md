# The SEC Tells Companies to Speak Up (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This March 2015 commentary addresses the SEC's warning to pharmaceutical companies to be more transparent about their dealings with the FDA. The author notes that companies tend to be highly selective in their disclosures—quickly publicizing positive FDA news while treating negative regulatory communications as confidential material information that doesn't require immediate disclosure. The article suggests this asymmetric transparency is problematic and calls for the SEC to back up its warnings with concrete enforcement actions. The author frames this as a material information disclosure issue, with companies hiding behind confidentiality claims for unfavorable FDA communications that shareholders should arguably know about.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article, regulatory enforcement dynamics around FDA disclosure evolved significantly:

**Securities Litigation Developments**: Between 2015-2020, numerous securities fraud class actions were filed against pharmaceutical companies alleging failures to disclose negative FDA communications. Courts generally held that companies must disclose material FDA feedback, particularly when it contradicts previous positive statements or significantly impacts drug approval timelines.

**SEC Enforcement Actions**: The SEC did follow through with enforcement, though not always in highly publicized cases. Actions typically focused on companies that made affirmative misstatements about FDA interactions or concealed material regulatory setbacks that would affect pipeline valuations.

**Industry Practice Changes**: By 2017-2018, most public biopharma companies adopted more systematic disclosure policies for material FDA communications, including complete response letters, clinical holds, and significant adverse regulatory feedback. Investor relations practices shifted toward earlier, more consistent disclosure of both positive and negative regulatory developments.

**Market Impact**: The increased transparency correlated with reduced volatility around binary regulatory events, as investors gained better information about pipeline risks throughout the development process rather than just at approval/denial milestones.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• The author hoped for "well-publicized actions by the agency to signal that this isn't just talk"**

**Outcome**: This partially materialized. The SEC did pursue enforcement actions related to FDA disclosure failures, though they weren't always highly publicized. Cases like SEC v. Biogen (2019) involved allegations of misleading statements about FDA interactions, demonstrating continued regulatory focus in this area.

**• The author suggested watching "the regulatory landscape over the next few months to see if this really happens"**

**Outcome**: This proved accurate as a near-term indicator. Between 2015-2017, there was measurable increase in both SEC guidance and enforcement actions targeting selective disclosure practices in the biopharma sector. The trend toward greater transparency continued through the late 2010s.

**• Implicit prediction: Asymmetric disclosure (good news fast, bad news slow/hidden) would persist without enforcement**

**Outcome**: Enforcement combined with investor pressure did meaningfully reduce asymmetric practices. By 2018-2020, most companies systematically disclosed material negative FDA communications, though timing differences between good and bad news disclosure remained somewhat asymmetric, suggesting deep behavioral patterns persisted even under regulatory pressure.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a persistent and structurally important issue in biopharma investing—the information asymmetry between companies and public investors regarding regulatory risk. While specialized for biotech, the material disclosure principles affect billions in market capitalization and investor protection. The topic has maintained relevance through subsequent years as disclosure practices and enforcement evolve, making it more than just a time-limited regulatory commentary.
