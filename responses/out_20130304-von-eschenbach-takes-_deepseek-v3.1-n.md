# von Eschenbach Takes Another Whack at Phase III Trials (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an editorial by former FDA commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach advocating for scaling back Phase III clinical trials in favor of greater reliance on post-market surveillance. The proposal argued that traditional large Phase III trials are outdated in the era of personalized medicine, failing to recognize benefits for smaller patient subgroups while modern information technologies enable better post-approval monitoring. The author notes this is a recurring theme from von Eschenbach, who suggests that safety evidence from earlier trial phases combined with manufacturers' financial incentives and post-market surveillance could replace extensive pre-market testing.

However, the article's author expresses skepticism about the practical implementation, raising concerns about insurance coverage for less-proven drugs, potential gaming by unscrupulous companies rushing high-priced but ineffective treatments to market (particularly for difficult diseases like Alzheimer's), unclear legal liability frameworks, and whether this approach would actually improve pharmaceutical research productivity.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, FDA regulatory pathways have evolved considerably, though not in the wholesale dismantling of Phase III trials that von Eschenbach proposed. Several concrete developments emerged:

**FDA Regulatory Evolution (2013-2023):** The FDA implemented more flexible pathways including Breakthrough Therapy Designation (2012), Accelerated Approval expansion, and Emergency Use Authorizations during COVID-19. However, all maintained some form of substantial pre-market efficacy demonstration—just with smaller, faster, or more targeted studies. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) expanded the use of real-world evidence but primarily for label expansions and post-market commitments, not initial approvals.

**Alzheimer's Drug Controversy:** Biogen's aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial accelerated approval in 2021 based on biomarker data rather than definitive clinical benefit, sparking massive controversy about lowered standards. This partially echoed von Eschenbach's vision but demonstrated the challenges—insurers largely refused coverage, legal/commercial complications arose, and the approval faced intense criticism from the medical community. Lecanemab followed in 2023 with more robust (but still mixed) data.

**Breakthrough Therapy Impact:** Through 2023, over 350 Breakthrough Therapy designations were granted, leading to accelerated approvals primarily for cancer and rare diseases. These drugs still undergo Phase III-equivalent studies but with smaller sample sizes, surrogate endpoints, and extensive post-market requirements. Notably, many accelerated approvals have been withdrawn when confirmatory trials failed (including multiple cancer drugs).

**Real-World Evidence Implementation:** The FDA established frameworks for using real-world data (RWE) starting in 2016, but adoption has been cautious. RWE primarily supplements traditional trials rather than replacing them, particularly for demonstrating safety and effectiveness in broader populations or for label expansions. As of 2024, no new molecular entity has been approved based solely on post-market surveillance.

The von Eschenbach vision of drastically reduced pre-market study proved politically and practically impossible. However, it contributed to ongoing debates about regulatory flexibility versus evidentiary standards.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1: Phase III trials would become less necessary due to improved post-market surveillance capabilities**
- **Actual Outcome:** Mixed. Phase III trials remain the gold standard for efficacy demonstration, though they've become more targeted and efficient. Post-market surveillance has improved through FDA adverse event reporting and real-world databases, but post-marketing studies often fail to complete recruitment or show definitive results. The fundamental architecture of large pre-approval efficacy trials persists.

**Prediction 2: Personalized medicine would make traditional large trials obsolete**
- **Actual Outcome:** Partial success for narrow indications. Targeted therapies (especially in oncology) do use smaller, biomarker-enriched trials, but most drugs still require evidence of benefit in defined populations. The precision medicine revolution occurred but at smaller scale—most approved drugs still serve broad populations, and even targeted therapies face pressure for traditional trial designs for payer acceptance.

**Prediction 3: Insurance and legal frameworks would be significant barriers**
- **Actual Outcome:** Confirmed. The Aduhelm controversy exemplified this—CMS restricted coverage, patients faced uncertainty, legal challenges emerged, and prescribing remained extremely limited. Integration into healthcare payment systems proved a massive barrier to the von Eschenbach model, exactly as the article's author predicted.

**Prediction 4: Gaming by companies would be a concern**
- **Actual Outcome:** Validated. Multiple companies pursued accelerated approval pathways with questionable data, leading to subsequent withdrawals (multiple PD-1 inhibitor combinations, cancer drugs). However, increased transparency and FDA's willingness to withdraw approvals has limited the most egregious examples, though accusations of data manipulation and selective reporting persist.  

**Bigger Picture:** Von Eschenbach's broader vision of accelerated innovation through reduced regulation partially materialized through breakthrough designations and accelerated approval pathways, but not in the form of wholesale Phase III elimination. The pharmaceutical industry maintains productivity challenges, and regulatory flexibility has been one tool among many rather than a revolutionary transformation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article anticipated major debates about regulatory flexibility that played out dramatically in subsequent years, including the COVID-19 emergency use authorizations and highly controversial approvals like Aduhelm. The discussion remains highly relevant to ongoing pharmaceutical policy, evidence-based medicine, and the tension between innovation speed versus the need for rigorous safety and effectiveness data.
