# Gilenya's Price (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary notes that Novartis’s oral multiple‑sclerosis (MS) drug fingolimod (brand name Gilenya) entered the market with a list price that exceeded even the already‑expensive disease‑modifying therapies highlighted in a recent cost‑effectiveness study. The author points out that the UK’s health‑technology assessment body, NICE, had concluded that, at that time, Gilenya had not demonstrated enough clinical benefit to justify its price. The piece anticipates a heated public debate and suggests that the outcome was predictable for anyone following the pricing and efficacy data, including Novartis itself.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory and market rollout (2010‑2014)**  
- Gilenya received FDA approval in September 2010 and was launched in the United States and Europe later that year.  
- In the UK, after the 2011 NICE “not recommended” decision, Novartis entered a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) that offered a confidential discount. The revised economic model satisfied NICE in 2015, leading to conditional approval for patients with highly active relapsing‑remitting MS.  

**Clinical uptake and competition**  
- From 2012‑2016 Gilenya generated roughly $2–3 billion in annual global sales, making it one of the top‑selling MS drugs.  
- Real‑world studies confirmed the pivotal trial’s findings: a ~30 % reduction in annualized relapse rate and modest slowing of disability progression, but also highlighted safety concerns (cardiac bradycardia, macular edema, opportunistic infections).  
- The launch of other oral disease‑modifying therapies—dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, 2013), teriflunomide (Aubagio, 2012), and later cladribine (Mavenclad, 2019)—eroded Gilenya’s market share. Intravenous monoclonal antibodies such as ocrelizumab (2017) further shifted prescribing patterns toward higher‑efficacy options.  

**Pricing evolution**  
- In the United States, the list price remained near $70,000 USD per patient per year throughout the 2010s, prompting ongoing payer negotiations and occasional rebates.  
- In Europe, the confidential PAS reduced the net price by roughly 30‑40 % in the UK and similar discounts were negotiated in other countries.  
- Patent protection in the US and EU expired in 2022. The first generic fingolimod (manufactured by Mylan, now Viatris, and others) received FDA approval in August 2022, and European generics entered the market in 2023. Generic pricing is roughly 30‑50 % lower than the branded product, leading to a steep decline in Gilenya’s sales (global revenue fell below $500 million in 2023).  

**Policy impact**  
- The 2011 NICE decision reinforced the use of health‑technology assessments for high‑cost specialty drugs in the UK and encouraged manufacturers to adopt PAS‑type discounts.  
- The episode contributed to broader discussions on “value‑based pricing” that later influenced the UK’s 2022 reforms to the NICE appraisal process and the US’s increasing use of outcomes‑based contracts for MS therapies.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“People should have been able to see this coming… and Novartis as well.”*  
  - **Outcome:** The high price and modest incremental efficacy relative to existing injectables were indeed anticipated by health‑economics analysts. Novartis responded with a PAS in the UK, which eventually satisfied NICE’s cost‑effectiveness threshold. The prediction about predictable controversy was accurate.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *NICE would reject Gilenya on cost grounds.*  
  - **Outcome:** Correct for the 2011 appraisal; however, the decision was later reversed after price concessions, showing that the initial rejection was not permanent.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The drug’s price would be a major barrier to adoption.*  
  - **Outcome:** True in the short term—U.S. payer negotiations and UK discounting were necessary for uptake. Over the longer term, the price barrier persisted until generic competition entered in 2022‑23, after which adoption of the generic version increased.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is a concise snapshot of a pivotal moment in drug‑pricing policy and MS therapeutics; its relevance endures because it foreshadowed the value‑based pricing debates that shape today’s specialty‑drug market.
