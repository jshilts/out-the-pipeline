# A Few More Victories Like This, And We Will Be Undone (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary laments AstraZeneca’s “victory” in obtaining regulatory approval for Brilinta, a new blood‑thinning drug, and warns that the company (and the whole field) may be over‑optimistic about the financial payoff.  The author notes that many firms have chased the lucrative market once dominated by the generic antiplatelet Plavix (clopidogrel) and points out the narrow therapeutic window of anticoagulants/antiplatelets: a slight excess of activity can cause dangerous bleeding.  The piece ends with a Pyrrhic‑victory metaphor, suggesting that a string of such approvals could ultimately hurt rather than help the companies involved.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Regulatory and clinical trajectory**  
- **EU approval:** Brilinta (ticagrelor) received a European Medicines Agency licence in July 2011 for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  
- **US approval:** The FDA approved ticagrelor in October 2012, also for ACS. The pivotal PLATO trial (2009) had already shown ticagrelor’s superiority to clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, albeit with a modest increase in non‑fatal bleeding.  
- **Expanded indications:** In 2015 the PEGASUS‑TIMI 54 trial demonstrated benefit of long‑term (up to 3 years) ticagrelor therapy after a myocardial infarction, leading to an FDA label extension for secondary prevention.

**Market performance**  
- **Peak sales:** Brilinta generated roughly $2–3 billion in global revenue per year between 2014 and 2016, making it a solid but not blockbuster product for AstraZeneca.  
- **Erosion by generics:** Generic clopidogrel entered the US market in 2013, and generic ticagrelor launched after patent expiry in the US (2020) and EU (2022). Brilinta’s sales fell to about $1.5 billion by 2019 and continued to decline thereafter.  
- **Business divestiture:** In 2018 AstraZeneca sold its cardiovascular portfolio—including Brilinta—to Novartis for $5.3 billion. The drug now resides in Novartis’ “Cardiovascular & Metabolism” division.

**Clinical adoption**  
- **Guideline status:** Both ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines (latest updates 2020‑2022) list ticagrelor as a preferred P2Y12 inhibitor for ACS patients without high bleeding risk, alongside prasugrel.  
- **Real‑world use:** Uptake varies by region; in the United States, ticagrelor captured ~30 % of the P2Y12 market in 2021, while clopidogrel (generic) still accounts for >50 % because of cost considerations.  

**Broader anticoagulant landscape**  
- The article’s focus on “anticoagulants” conflates antiplatelet therapy with true anticoagulants.  In the same decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban achieved blockbuster status, collectively generating > $30 billion in annual sales by 2025.  Thus, the “huge Plavix‑style revenues” that many firms chased never materialised for antiplatelet agents, but the broader blood‑thinning market proved highly profitable for the DOAC class.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article or implied) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“More victories like this … will be undone” – a string of new anticoagulant approvals will ultimately hurt companies** | Partially true for antiplatelet agents: Brilinta achieved moderate success but did not become a blockbuster, and competition from generic clopidogrel limited long‑term profitability.  However, the broader anticoagulant space (DOACs) exploded, delivering multi‑billion‑dollar revenues to companies such as Boehringer Ingelheim (Xarelto) and Bristol‑Myers Squibb (Eliquis). |
| **“Huge, huge Plavix‑style revenues” will be captured by new drugs** | Not realized.  Brilinta’s peak sales (~$3 bn) fell far short of the >$10 bn annual revenue that clopidogrel generated before generic erosion.  The market remained dominated by the inexpensive generic. |
| **Regulatory approval will be a cause for celebration** | Approval did bring a new product line, but the celebratory impact was muted by the simultaneous launch of generic clopidogrel and the later sale of the whole cardiovascular portfolio. |
| **Companies will continue to pile into the space** | Some did (e.g., Merck’s prasugrel, Sanofi’s cangrelor), but the rush slowed after the market showed limited upside for antiplatelet agents.  Investment shifted toward DOACs and biologics. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a useful snapshot of the optimism and skepticism surrounding cardiovascular drug development in the early 2010s, and its hindsight analysis touches on market dynamics that proved consequential for AstraZeneca and the field at large.  It is not a landmark piece, but it offers clear historical context for later industry shifts.
