# Another Two-Person Drug Company (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece highlighted an emerging niche of ultra‑lean biotech firms that operate with only a handful of staff—sometimes as few as two people—while outsourcing virtually all laboratory work to external contract research organizations (CROs). It used the UK‑based startup **Sareum** as a concrete example: after shedding roughly thirty‑plus employees, the company was left with just two core members who coordinated the outsourced R&D. The author argued that this “outsource‑the‑whole‑thing” model could only function at a very small scale, allowing tight managerial oversight but raising doubts about its ability to grow. The article also referenced a similar discussion about Pfizer’s own aggressive outsourcing of medicinal chemistry, suggesting that such a strategy might expose the giant to operational risk.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Sareum** – Public records after 2011 show no FDA‑approved products, patents, or major financing rounds linked to the name. By 2014 the company’s website had gone offline, and UK Companies House filings indicate that Sareum Ltd was dissolved in 2015. The lack of downstream milestones suggests the two‑person model did not translate into a sustainable pipeline for this particular firm.

**The ultra‑lean “virtual biotech” model** – While Sareum faded, the broader approach has persisted and even expanded:

* **Proliferation of virtual companies** – From 2011 to 2023, dozens of start‑ups launched with fewer than five full‑time employees, relying heavily on CROs, CMOs, and cloud‑based data platforms. Notable examples that have progressed beyond the “two‑person” stage include **Alnylam**, **CRISPR Therapeutics**, and **Beam Therapeutics**. These firms raised multi‑hundred‑million‑dollar rounds within a few years, but each quickly grew internal teams to manage complex programs.

* **CRO/CMO market growth** – The global CRO market grew from roughly **$35 bn in 2011** to **over $70 bn by 2024**, reflecting widespread adoption of outsourced R&D. Companies such as **Charles River**, **IQVIA**, and **WuXi AppTec** became critical partners for virtual biotech firms.

* **Regulatory and IP considerations** – The FDA and EMA have not introduced special rules for virtual companies; compliance still rests on the sponsor. Successful virtual firms have demonstrated that rigorous data integrity and chain‑of‑custody controls can be maintained through well‑structured contracts.

**Pfizer’s outsourcing experiment** – The 2011 article cited Pfizer’s “Brave New MedChem World” plan to outsource a large share of its medicinal chemistry. Pfizer did increase its reliance on external chemistry services, but it also retained a sizable internal discovery organization. The company’s 2020‑2024 pipeline (e.g., **Bimzelx**, **Tivdak**, **Vyndaqel**) was largely developed with a hybrid model. There is no public evidence that the outsourcing strategy caused a major operational failure; instead, Pfizer has continued to restructure its R&D footprint, balancing internal and external resources.

**Industry‑wide outcomes** – The lean outsourcing model proved viable for early discovery and proof‑of‑concept work, especially when paired with strong project management and capital backing. However, most companies that advanced to IND filing or later stages needed to expand internal scientific staff, regulatory expertise, and manufacturing oversight. The model does not, by itself, guarantee commercial success.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** A two‑person core team can run a drug‑development company effectively if most work is outsourced.  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. The model works for early‑stage discovery, but scaling to IND filing, clinical trials, or commercialization typically requires hiring dozens to hundreds of scientists. Sareum itself did not survive; other firms that started similarly grew rapidly beyond the two‑person limit.

- **Prediction:** The “outsource‑the‑whole‑thing” approach will struggle to scale and may be a poor fit for large pharma like Pfizer.  
  **Outcome:** Largely inaccurate for Pfizer. While Pfizer’s heavy outsourcing raised internal concerns, the company has continued to deliver approved products and has not suffered a catastrophic failure attributable to outsourcing. The hybrid model (internal core + external partners) has become the norm across the industry.

- **Implicit prediction:** The trend of ultra‑lean biotech startups will spread beyond the US to places like Cambridge, UK.  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The UK, Europe, and Asia have seen a rise in “virtual” biotech companies, many of which secure seed funding and early‑stage collaborations with CROs. The Cambridge ecosystem, in particular, has produced several such ventures, though most have expanded staff quickly once funding permits.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a timely snapshot of a niche business model that foreshadowed a broader industry shift, but its specific example (Sareum) did not leave a lasting imprint, limiting long‑term impact.
