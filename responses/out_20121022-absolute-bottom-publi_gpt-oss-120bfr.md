# The Absolute Bottom of the Publishing Barrel (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author laments the proliferation of obscure, low‑quality scientific journals, especially those that sprang up with the rise of open‑access (OA) publishing. He distinguishes between legitimate OA titles and “predatory” outlets that accept virtually any manuscript for a fee, provide little or no editorial oversight, and are rarely read. He points readers to Jeffrey Beall’s List of Predatory Open‑Access Publishers as a catalog of such operations, citing Bentham Open (the OA arm of Bentham Science) and its *Open Medicinal Chemistry Journal* as a concrete example. The piece also mentions a well‑known hoax in which a mathematician generated nonsensical text with a paper‑generator (SciGen/MathGen) and succeeded in getting it published, underscoring how easily these venues can be gamed.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What happened to the predatory‑publishing landscape after 2012?**  

* **Beall’s List** – The list grew rapidly, becoming a widely used reference for librarians, funders, and researchers. In January 2017 the site was taken down after legal pressure and threats of litigation; Jeffrey Beall left his university position. Although the original list disappeared, several community‑maintained mirrors (e.g., *Stop Predatory Journals*, *Cabell’s Blacklist*) continue to provide similar guidance.  

* **Bentham Open** – Bentham Science was acquired by the Taylor & Francis Group in 2017. The OA imprint was folded into the larger publisher’s portfolio, and many of the “Bentham Open” journal titles were either discontinued or relaunched under stricter editorial policies. The *Open Medicinal Chemistry Journal* ceased publishing new issues in 2016.  

* **Regulatory and policy responses** – Funding agencies (e.g., NIH, European Commission) and institutions introduced mandatory checks for journal legitimacy in grant‑reporting systems. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) tightened its inclusion criteria, and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) issued clearer guidance on predatory practices.  

* **Continued existence of predatory outlets** – Despite the crackdown, new “pay‑to‑publish” venues still appear, often re‑branding after being black‑listed. The overall number of active predatory journals is believed to have plateaued rather than exploded, according to analyses of Scopus and Web of Science coverage up to 2023.  

* **Impact on researchers** – Studies published after 2012 show that papers in predatory journals receive far fewer citations and are rarely indexed in major databases. However, a small subset of authors—particularly early‑career researchers from low‑resource institutions—continue to publish there, sometimes inadvertently.  

* **Awareness and tools** – The “SciGen” hoax inspired a wave of educational material on how to spot bogus journals. Librarians now routinely teach “whitelisting” (using DOAJ, PubMed, etc.) rather than “blacklisting.”  

Overall, the concerns raised in 2012 proved prescient: predatory publishing remains a niche but persistent problem, and the community has responded with a mix of policy, tooling, and cultural change.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not lay out explicit, numbered forecasts, but it implied several expectations. Below are the implied predictions and how they fared:

| Implied prediction | Outcome |
|--------------------|---------|
| **Predatory OA journals will continue to proliferate, driven by author fees and minimal editorial work.** | Partially true. The number of active predatory titles grew sharply through the mid‑2010s, then stabilized as awareness and blacklist tools curbed easy entry. |
| **Bentham Open (and similar “borderline” OA imprints) will be of low scientific value and may be exposed as vanity presses.** | Confirmed. Bentham Open journals were largely discontinued or re‑branded after the 2017 acquisition; their impact remained negligible. |
| **Scholars will be able to submit gibberish and still get acceptance, exposing the lack of peer review.** | Demonstrated repeatedly. The original “Stochastic Orthogonal” hoax (2012) was followed by several similar experiments (e.g., 2015 “Molecular Cancer” hoax) that succeeded, reinforcing the article’s point. |
| **Beall’s List will become a central resource for identifying predatory publishers.** | Realized until 2017, after which community‑maintained mirrors and commercial blacklists took over. |
| **Open‑access publishing will be “fuzzier” and harder to distinguish from scams.** | Accurate; the OA ecosystem remains mixed, but the development of vetted OA platforms (e.g., DOAJ, PubMed Central) has improved transparency. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece is a clear, early‑stage commentary on a problem that later shaped publishing policy and researcher behavior; its relevance endures, though the specific journal examples are now historical footnotes.
