# Pfizer's Shareholders and AstraZeneca's (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Pfizer's attempted takeover bid for AstraZeneca, referencing a Financial Times editorial that criticized the deal. The central argument is that the proposed acquisition appeared to lack genuine commercial or scientific logic, driven primarily by Pfizer's desire to re-domicile from the US to the UK for tax advantages. The FT editorial and the article's author both question whether companies should be governed solely by delivering immediate shareholder value through financial engineering, or whether boards have wider responsibilities to advance the business's long-term interests, particularly in R&D-intensive industries like pharmaceuticals. The piece notes Pfizer's historical reputation for cost-cutting acquisitions rather than organic innovation, and raises concerns about the potential damage to AstraZeneca's research capabilities and the broader pharmaceutical industry's intellectual capital if the deal were to succeed.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Deal's Failure (2014)**: Pfizer's £69.4 billion offer was ultimately rejected by AstraZeneca's board in May 2014, partly due to concerns about preserving UK research capabilities and skepticism about Pfizer's long-term commitments to R&D.

**Pfizer's Tax Strategy Workaround (2015-2016)**: Though Pfizer failed to acquire AstraZeneca for tax inversion purposes, the company pivoted and successfully executed a similar strategy through its $160 billion acquisition of Allergan in 2015, which would have moved Pfizer's legal domicile to Ireland. However, in April 2016, the US Treasury Department issued new regulations specifically targeting tax inversion deals, causing Pfizer to abandon the Allergan merger just days before the shareholder vote.

**AstraZeneca's Independent Trajectory**: After rejecting Pfizer, AstraZeneca continued operating independently under CEO Pascal Soriot, who had argued the company's pipeline was undervalued. The company focused heavily on oncology, immunology, and rare diseases R&D. By 2023, AstraZeneca had successfully grown its revenue to over $45 billion, with oncology becoming its largest therapeutic area.

**Subsequent Industry Consolidation**: The pharmaceutical industry continued seeing major M&A activity, including Pfizer's later acquisitions (though none as large as the proposed AstraZeneca deal), and ongoing debates about whether large mergers enhance or diminish innovation capabilities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Pfizer's Acquisition-Driven Growth Strategy**: The prediction that Pfizer would continue pursuing acquisitions rather than organic growth proved accurate. After failing with AstraZeneca, Pfizer acquired Hospira (2015), Anacor (2016), and eventually grew through the Allergan deal (though it collapsed due to regulatory intervention). The prediction about "accountant-led, cost-crunching acquisitions" remained consistent with Pfizer's demonstrated M&A pattern.

• **Damage to R&D and Innovation**: The article predicted that Pfizer's approach would damage industry R&D. While difficult to quantify this precisely, there has been ongoing concern in the pharmaceutical industry about whether large mergers result in R&D productivity gains or simply create larger entities with duplicated infrastructure. The mixed evidence suggests this concern was valid, though not necessarily specific to Pfizer alone.

• **AstraZeneca's Recovery Potential**: The suggestion that AstraZeneca "deserve[d] a chance to see if they can work out of the pit" proved largely accurate. The company successfully transformed itself post-2014, with significant pipeline developments and revenue growth, validating the decision to remain independent.

• **Shareholder Primacy vs. Long-term Interests**: The broader philosophical question about whether companies should prioritize immediate shareholder returns versus long-term interests remained highly relevant, echoing through subsequent corporate governance debates in the pharmaceutical industry and beyond.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article has lasting relevance because it captured a pivotal moment involving major pharmaceutical companies and crystallized fundamental questions about corporate purpose, tax policy, and innovation strategy that remain unresolved today.
