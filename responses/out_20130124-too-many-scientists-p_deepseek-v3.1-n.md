# Too Many Scientists: A Pyramid Scheme (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on a *Chemistry World* editorial by economics professor Paula Stephan that critiques the U.S. biomedical research training model. It traces the shift from Vannevar Bush's original post-war vision—building research capacity through training while keeping training somewhat separate—to a system where graduate students and postdocs became essential cheap labor to staff faculty labs, resembling a pyramid scheme. The author acknowledges that students accept long training periods, modest stipends, and uncertain career prospects due to genuine interest in science, overconfidence about their own prospects, and the absence of viable alternatives. The piece concludes by endorsing Stephan's recommendation to decouple research from training by increasing permanent staff positions instead of relying on a continuous influx of trainees, but notes that real change would require altering funding incentives at the NIH/NSF level rather than expecting voluntary reform from universities.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in 2013 accurately foreshadowed systemic problems that became more acute over the subsequent decade. The academic labor market tightened further: postdoc appointments lengthened, tenure-track positions remained scarce relative to PhD output, and contingent (non-tenure-track) roles expanded. The National Institutes of Health did implement some modest reforms, including raising NRSA postdoctoral stipends, capping the number of years of NRSA support, and offering career transition awards to encourage movement beyond traditional academic pathways. However, these changes did not substantially alter the structural reliance of research universities on trainees for labor.

Concrete policy shifts were incremental. NIH began collecting data on trainee outcomes more systematically and experimenting with alternative funding mechanisms, but large-scale decoupling of research and training did not occur. The growth of staff scientist positions remained limited, constrained by university financial models and grant structures that reward principal investigators for supervising trainees. The 2014 National Academies report "The Postdoctoral Experience Revisited" echoed these issues, yet tangible reforms remained slow.

In the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, demographic trends and industry consolidation compounded the challenge. Industry increasingly sought scientists with specific technical skills and cross-functional experience, putting additional pressure on academic training programs. While some trainees successfully transitioned to industry careers—particularly those with skills in computational biology, data science, or specialized therapeutic areas—many still faced prolonged training periods and uncertain job prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily boosted demand in certain areas (vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics) but did not fundamentally restructure the academic pipeline.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions beyond the implication that the system would remain stable until funding incentives changed. However, several implicit predictions can be evaluated:

- **Prediction**: Change would require action "at the source of the money" (NIH/NSF), with different funding mechanisms as the prerequisite for reform.
  - **Outcome**: **Partially accurate.** NIH did implement modest policy adjustments, including postdoctoral pay increases and some alternative training models, but these were incremental rather than transformative. The fundamental incentive structure remained intact.

- **Prediction**: Without changes to funding, little movement "in any direction" would occur regarding permanent staff positions versus trainee dependency.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate.** Most academic research institutions continue to rely heavily on graduate students and postdocs as essential labor, and permanent staff positions remain the exception rather than the rule.

- **Prediction**: The pipeline would keep attracting students due to "taste for science," stipend availability, and overconfidence about career prospects.
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate.** PhD production in biomedical sciences has remained high, though some fields saw plateauing or slight declines. Student optimism persists despite awareness of career challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlights a persistent structural problem in academic training that continues to shape scientific careers and institutional dynamics. It accurately diagnosed deep issues and correctly identified that change would require altering funding incentives at the NIH/NSF level, making it prescient about subsequent policy debates.
