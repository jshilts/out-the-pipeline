# Rise of the Electron Beams (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights the rapid advancement of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as an emerging technique in structural biology, driven by impressive results presented at a Gordon Conference talk by Sriram Subramaniam. The author notes cryo-EM's significant advantages over traditional X-ray crystallography: it eliminates the need for protein crystallization (a major bottleneck), avoids the "phase problem" inherent in X-ray diffraction, and handles large multiprotein complexes more readily. Recent achievements mentioned include structures of tau filaments, ribosomes, CRISPR enzymes, and various membrane proteins. Technical improvements in electron sources, direct electron detectors, Volta phase plates, and computational processing have accelerated progress. The article poses whether cryo-EM could eventually supplant X-ray crystallography for macromolecular structure determination, noting that many crystallographers are retraining in electron microscopy techniques.

## 2. HISTORY

Cryo-EM has indeed experienced explosive growth since 2017, fundamentally transforming structural biology. The technique's trajectory was validated by the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, and Richard Henderson for developing cryo-electron microscopy, which brought widespread recognition to the field's maturity.

**Resolution Revolution Continues:** By 2020-2022, cryo-EM routinely achieved near-atomic resolution (better than 3Å) for many targets, with some structures reaching 1.5-2Å resolution. The Protein Data Bank saw cryo-EM depositions grow from approximately 5% of structures in 2017 to over 30% by 2022, with diminishing gaps in resolution compared to X-ray crystallography.

**Structural Coverage Expands:** Cryo-EM successfully tackled previously intractable targets: membrane proteins (GPCRs, ion channels), large complexes (ribosomes, proteasomes), and flexible systems (intrinsically disordered proteins, conformational ensembles). Structures like the spliceosome, nuclear pore complex, and various viral capsids became routine. Alzheimer's tau and amyloid structures advanced significantly.

**Pharmaceutical Impact:** The technique accelerated drug discovery by enabling structure-based design for targets resistant to crystallization. Notable examples include rapid structural determination of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (spike protein, RNA polymerase) during the pandemic, which guided vaccine development and antiviral drug design. Several drugs (including antivirals and cancer therapeutics) have leveraged cryo-EM structures in their development.

**Technology Adoption:** Commercial instruments from Thermo Fisher (Krios, Glacios, Talos) became widespread. Automated data collection, improved detectors (Gatan K3, Falcon), and AI-driven processing (cryoSPARC, RELION) became standard. Grid preparation robotics and vitrification devices (Vitrobot, chameleon) reduced the art-to-science transition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Cryo-EM will overtake X-ray crystallography for many macromolecular targets**
- **Outcome: Largely accurate but nuanced.** Cryo-EM did not completely replace crystallography but emerged as a complementary technique that dominates certain niches. For membrane proteins, large complexes, and flexible systems, cryo-EM became the primary method. X-ray crystallography retained advantages for small soluble proteins, ultra-high-resolution work (<1.5Å), rapid screening, and time-resolved studies. Hybrid approaches combining both techniques grew in popularity.

**Prediction: Resolution improvements will continue rapidly**
- **Outcome: Correct.** Resolution continued improving through better detectors, phase plates, and processing algorithms. Sub-2Å structures became common for well-behaved samples by 2020-2023. Phase plates and energy filters improved contrast for smaller proteins.

**Prediction: Cryo-EM will handle proteins recalcitrant to crystallization**
- **Outcome: Accurate.** The technique successfully determined structures for numerous targets that had resisted crystallization for decades, including GPCRs, ion channels, and large complexes. Drug targets previously considered "undruggable" due to lack of structural information became tractable.

**Prediction: Sample preparation challenges will persist but improve**
- **Outcome: Accurate.** Sample preparation remained a bottleneck but became less of an art through standardized protocols, commercial kits, and improved understanding of vitrification. Automation helped but did not eliminate variability.

**Prediction: Crystallographers will retrain in cryo-EM**
- **Outcome: Correct.** Many structural biology departments invested heavily in cryo-EM facilities, and training programs proliferated. Some crystallographers transitioned fully, while others adopted hybrid approaches using both techniques.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article accurately identified a paradigm shift in structural biology with far-reaching implications for both basic research and pharmaceutical applications. The prediction of cryo-EM's ascendance proved remarkably prescient for drug discovery and fundamental biology.
