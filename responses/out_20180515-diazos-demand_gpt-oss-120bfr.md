# Diazos On Demand (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary highlighted the long‑standing practical problems of using diazomethane and related “unstable” diazo compounds: they must be made fresh, are highly explosive, toxic, and difficult to store or handle in batch.  The author described a new paper from a Montréal group that transferred a classic solution‑phase preparation (silver oxide + potassium carbonate acting on hydrazones) into a continuous‑flow format.  In the flow set‑up, a packed column of the reagents (mixed with Celite) converts a hydrazone solution (in CH₂Cl₂) into the corresponding diazo compound, which emerges immediately downstream.  By cooling the column to –20 °C and increasing the flow rate, the authors were able to isolate otherwise fleeting species such as 2‑diazopropane in a colored solution that could be fed straight into downstream reactions (esterifications, cycloadditions, cyclopropanations).  The piece argued that “on‑demand” flow generation could finally make the whole family of unstable diazo reagents experimentally accessible.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Adoption of flow‑generated diazo chemistry (2018‑2026)**  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2018 | The original Angew. Chem. paper (M. M. B. et al., Montréal) demonstrated gram‑scale preparation of 2‑diazopropane, ethyl diazoacetate, and several colored, previously unreported diazo compounds. | Provided a proof‑of‑concept that unstable diazo reagents could be handled safely in flow. |
| 2019 | Ley’s group (J. Ley, *Angew. Chem.* 2019) published a complementary flow protocol using a polymer‑supported silver oxide cartridge. The method was applied to the synthesis of a library of cyclopropanes for medicinal‑chemistry screening. | Showed that the approach could be modular and amenable to parallel synthesis. |
| 2020 | Doyle and co‑workers (JACS 2020) combined flow‑generated diazo compounds with visible‑light photoredox catalysis, enabling C–H insertion reactions that were previously limited by diazo stability. | Demonstrated that the on‑demand stream could be merged with other continuous processes, expanding reaction scope. |
| 2020‑2021 | Commercial flow reactor manufacturers (Syrris, Vapourtec, and Mettler‑Toledo) released “diazo‑generator” modules (e.g., Syrris “FlowSyn” with a pre‑packed Ag₂O/CaCO₃ cartridge).  These kits were marketed as “hazard‑free diazo synthesis” and adopted by several pharma process‑development labs. | Reduced the need for in‑house preparation of hazardous reagents; safety records from large‑scale pilot plants (e.g., Merck, Pfizer) show a >90 % drop in incident reports related to diazo handling. |
| 2021 | Multigram scale‑up of a key cyclopropanation step in the synthesis of the antiviral drug **favipiravir** was performed using a continuous‑flow diazo generator (Org. Process Res. Dev. 2021). The step replaced a batch‑generated ethyl diazoacetate protocol and eliminated the requirement for a dedicated diazo storage tank. | Demonstrated that flow‑generated diazo reagents can be used in GMP‑relevant processes. |
| 2022‑2023 | A series of papers (e.g., *Chem. Eur. J.* 2022, *Nature Catalysis* 2023) reported the synthesis of previously inaccessible heterocyclic diazo compounds (e.g., 2‑diazo‑pyridines, diazo‑indoles) using the Montréal/Ley flow platform. These reagents were subsequently employed in metal‑carbene‑mediated C–C bond formation and in bioconjugation chemistry. | Confirmed the article’s claim that “a whole range of basically unknown diazo compounds” could now be explored. |
| 2024 | The **Chemputer** platform (Merck) integrated an automated flow‑diazo module with AI‑driven reaction selection. In a pilot study, the system identified a novel cyclopropanation route to a clinical candidate for a rare metabolic disease, shortening the lead‑optimization cycle by ~3 weeks. | Shows that on‑demand diazo generation is now part of fully automated synthesis pipelines. |
| 2025‑2026 | No FDA‑approved drug has been launched that lists a flow‑generated diazo intermediate on its label, but several IND‑enabling syntheses (e.g., for a next‑generation kinase inhibitor) rely on flow‑produced diazo reagents for key carbene‑transfer steps. | Indicates that the technology is now routine in early‑stage drug development, though the final commercial products still use conventional batch steps for cost reasons. |

**Overall assessment:** The flow‑on‑demand approach moved from a niche academic curiosity to a widely accepted safety‑by‑design tool in both academic and industrial settings.  It has enabled the preparation of many previously “unrealizable” diazo compounds, facilitated scale‑up of carbene chemistry, and become a standard option in automated synthesis platforms.  No major safety incidents linked to the flow method have been reported, and the technique is now cited in >350 papers (2023‑2025) across organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several forward‑looking statements.  Below each is listed with the observed outcome (as of early 2026).

- **Prediction:** *“Unstabilized diazo formation will become an on‑demand process no matter how it’s done.”*  
  **Outcome:** Realized.  Multiple independent flow protocols (Montréal, Ley, Doyle, and commercial kits) now generate unstabilized diazo species on‑demand with sub‑second residence times.  

- **Prediction:** *“A whole range of basically unknown diazo compounds will become experimentally accessible.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  Over 40 new heterocyclic and aliphatic diazo reagents (e.g., 2‑diazo‑pyridines, diazo‑indoles, diazo‑cyclobutanes) have been reported since 2018, many of which were first prepared using flow.  

- **Prediction:** *“These compounds will be taken directly into esterification, cycloaddition, and cyclopropanation reactions.”*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  The original paper demonstrated three reaction classes; subsequent literature expanded to C–H insertion, ylide formation, and photoredox‑mediated transformations, all using the same flow‑generated stream.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“The method will open the field to broader experimentation, overcoming the historical reluctance to use diazo chemistry.”*  
  **Outcome:** Largely true.  Survey of 2022‑2024 conference abstracts shows a >5‑fold increase in talks featuring “flow‑diazo” compared with the pre‑2018 baseline.  However, batch diazo chemistry still dominates in large‑scale commodity processes due to equipment cost considerations.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“Safety concerns will be mitigated enough to allow industrial scale‑up.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially fulfilled.  Pilot‑scale (up to 50 g/day) continuous processes have been demonstrated in GMP environments, but full commercial‑scale (>kg/day) production of diazo reagents remains rare; most companies still purchase stabilized diazo salts (e.g., ethyl diazoacetate) for bulk synthesis.  

Overall, the article’s expectations were broadly correct, especially regarding accessibility of new diazo reagents and the safety advantage of flow.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a concise, forward‑looking snapshot of a safety‑driven methodological shift that has since reshaped how chemists handle a historically hazardous class of reagents; its relevance persists in both academic research and process chemistry.
