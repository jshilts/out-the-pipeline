# Combichem Into Drugs: How Many? (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses a reader's question about how many drugs have emerged from combinatorial chemistry (combichem), the high-throughput synthesis approach that boomed in the 1990s. The author notes the challenge in tracing compound origins, as they can become "forgotten or mysterious" over time, but poses the central question of whether the combichem boom produced identifiable drug success stories. The piece reflects skepticism about combichem's tangible pharmaceutical impact while acknowledging the methodological difficulty in definitively attributing drug origins to specific discovery technologies.

## 2. HISTORY

Combinatorial chemistry emerged in the early 1990s as a paradigm shift in drug discovery, promising to accelerate identification of lead compounds through massively parallel synthesis of chemical libraries. Pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in robotic synthesis platforms and screening infrastructure, expecting that screening millions of compounds would yield more viable drug candidates than traditional medicinal chemistry approaches.

By the late 2000s and 2010s, the limitations of early combichem became apparent. While the technology did contribute to some approved drugs, the sheer volume of compounds often did not translate to higher quality leads. Many combichem libraries suffered from poor drug-like properties, excessive molecular weight, and insufficient structural diversity. Companies like Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer eventually shifted away from pure combinatorial approaches toward more focused, fragment-based, and structure-guided drug design.

Several drugs with combichem origins reached approval. Sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer), approved by the FDA in 2006 for renal cell carcinoma and GIST, originated from combichem libraries targeting multiple kinase inhibitors. Boceprevir (Victrelis, Merck) and telaprevir (Incivek, Vertex), both HCV protease inhibitors approved in 2011, benefited from combinatorial optimization approaches. Carfilzomib (Kyprolis, Onyx) and other kinase inhibitors also trace some development lineage to high-throughput synthesis methods. HIV protease inhibitor darunavir and certain antibiotics were optimized using combinatorial techniques.

However, many combichem-derived programs failed in clinical development due to poor pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or lack of efficacy. By the 2010s, the pharmaceutical industry had largely integrated combichem as one tool among many rather than treating it as a standalone discovery engine. The focus shifted toward DNA-encoded libraries and fragment-based drug discovery for early lead identification.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself does not make explicit predictions but rather poses a retrospective question. However, it implicitly raises several issues about combichem's legacy:

- **Implicit prediction**: Combichem may have produced few identifiable drugs due to "forgotten or mysterious" compound origins
  - **Outcome**: While tracing exact origins remains challenging, several approved drugs do have documented combichem lineage (sunitinib, boceprevir, telaprevir, carfilzomib). The technology contributed to drug discovery but not at the revolutionary scale initially envisioned.

- **Underlying concern**: Whether the massive investment in combichem translated to medicines reaching patients
  - **Outcome**: Combichem did contribute to FDA-approved therapies, particularly in oncology and antivirals, but fell short of replacing traditional medicinal chemistry. Most successful applications involved optimizing existing lead compounds rather than discovering entirely new chemical entities.

- **Methodological challenge**: Difficulty in attributing drug origins to specific discovery technologies
  - **Outcome**: This remains problematic in pharmaceutical history. Combichem's impact is clearer in retrospective analyses showing its role as an optimization tool rather than a discovery breakthrough.

The bigger picture shows that combichem transitioned from a supposed revolutionary paradigm to a standard tool in medicinal chemistry, similar to how high-throughput screening became routine rather than transformative.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses an important historical question in pharmaceutical technology assessment but does so at a relatively late date (2014) when combichem's trajectory was already becoming clear. The topic has moderate long-term relevance for understanding drug discovery history.
