# More ENCODE Skepticism (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article discusses ongoing scientific criticism of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, specifically responding to a PNAS paper by W. Ford Doolittle that challenged ENCODE's interpretation of its 2012 results. The central controversy was ENCODE's claim that 80% of the human genome is "functional," which was widely reported as signaling the "end of junk DNA."

The article focuses on Doolittle's thought experiment comparing two fish species: the pufferfish with a compact 365 million base pair genome versus the marbled lungfish with 133 billion base pairs (about 300 times larger). The author questions whether ENCODE would have declared 80% of the lungfish's massive genome as functional, and suggests that the huge size differences between similar organisms undermine the claim that most non-coding DNA is biologically important. The piece also includes an industry perspective warning that pharmaceutical companies were overreacting to the ENCODE hype by launching premature initiatives with unrealistic timelines for drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

The ENCODE controversy evolved significantly after this 2013 commentary:

**Scientific Consensus Development**: Over the subsequent decade, the scientific community largely rejected ENCODE's broad definition of "function" and its claim that 80% of the genome is functional. The debate crystallized around the distinction between biochemical activity and biological function. Critics argued that ENCODE had conflated biochemical signals (like transcription or protein binding) with evolutionary selected function. The "function" vs "activity" distinction became better understood and widely accepted.

**Ongoing Research**: Large-scale functional genomics continued, including expanded ENCODE phases and complementary projects like GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) and Roadmap Epigenomics. However, these subsequent efforts took more nuanced approaches to defining function, often using evolutionary conservation and genetic evidence rather than just biochemical assays.

**Impact on Drug Discovery**: The author's skepticism about immediate pharmaceutical applications proved largely accurate. Despite some continued interest in non-coding variants for drug targets, the massive wave of ENCODE-inspired drug development predicted by "jumping up and down" pharma leaders did not materialize as envisioned. Clinical successes directly attributable to ENCODE have been limited, though some insights have informed target discovery more broadly.

**Junk DNA Concept**: The "junk DNA" concept was neither eliminated nor fully vindicated. Instead, scientists developed more sophisticated frameworks recognizing that non-coding DNA includes functional regulatory elements, pseudogenes, viral remnants, and truly non-functional sequences, with estimates of functional proportion varying widely depending on definition (typically 8-15% under conservative evolutionary definitions).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Pharmaceutical industry overreaction with 3-year candidate delivery timeline**  
  **Outcome**: Largely accurate. While ENCODE data has informed some drug discovery efforts, there was no wave of ENCODE-derived approved drugs within 3-5 years as feared/expected by industry leaders. The timeline for translating basic genomics to approved therapeutics remained much longer than anticipated. No major blockbuster drugs can be clearly attributed to direct ENCODE findings in this timeframe.

- **Implication that ENCODE's broad functional claims would not hold up to scrutiny**  
  **Outcome**: Accurate. The scientific community largely moved away from ENCODE's 80% "functional" figure toward more conservative estimates recognizing the genome contains both functional regulatory elements and substantial non-functional sequence. The criticism expressed in this article reflected and contributed to this consensus shift.

- **Concern about misguided research investment based on ENCODE hype**  
  **Outcome**: Mixed. While some resources may have been misallocated initially, genomics research broadly continued to advance. The more significant impact was conceptual - helping establish more rigorous standards for defining genomic function and preventing premature clinical translation of insufficiently validated findings.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important moment in genomics history when the field grappled with defining function in the post-genomic era. It highlighted critical scientific methodology issues and the risks of hype-driven research investment that remain highly relevant as genomic technologies continue advancing.
