# The Instructive Case of Galena Biopharma (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from February 2014 documented a stock manipulation scheme involving Galena Biopharma (GALE), a small Oregon-based biotechnology company with a cancer vaccine candidate. The stock experienced unexplained price surges from $2 to nearly $8 per share in December 2013 and January 2014, despite no material changes in the company's prospects. 

The author revealed that Galena had hired a PR firm called "DreamTeam Group" to artificially promote the stock through multiple channels, including fake independent articles on Seeking Alpha under pseudonyms, Twitter campaigns, and other promotional tactics. During this period, company insiders sold millions of dollars worth of shares at inflated prices. By the article's publication in February 2014, the stock had already declined to about $4, and skeptical analysts estimated the company's true value at around $0.72 per share.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Immediate Aftermath (2014-2015):**
The stock promotion scheme eventually led to regulatory action. In 2015, Galena Biopharma settled with the SEC over allegations of violating securities laws through the paid promotion scheme, agreeing to pay a $750,000 penalty without admitting or denying the charges.

**Clinical Development Failures:**
Galena's lead cancer vaccine candidate, NeuVax (nelipepimut-S), failed to demonstrate efficacy in subsequent clinical trials. Despite early hype, the Phase 3 PRESENT trial for breast cancer was terminated in 2016 due to futility after an interim analysis showed it was unlikely to meet primary endpoints.

**Business Decline and Restructuring:**
Galena Biopharma struggled significantly following these revelations. The company underwent multiple restructuring efforts, name changes, and leadership transitions. By 2019, the company had transformed itself multiple times and struggled to maintain market relevance.

**DotRepatriot Resources Inc:**
Concerning the "DreamTeam Group" mentioned in the article, additional research reveals this appears to have been part of a broader network of stock promotion firms that operated during this period. However, specific long-term outcomes for this particular entity remain unclear from publicly available information.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** The article strongly implied that the stock was dramatically overvalued at $4 (down from its $8 peak), with one analysis suggesting its true worth was around $0.72 per share.
  - **Outcome:** The prediction about overvaluation proved accurate. The stock continued to decline as the company faced both regulatory scrutiny and clinical failures, eventually trading at much lower levels.

• **Prediction:** Implicit skepticism was expressed about the prospects for Galena's cancer vaccine, reinforced by a referenced comment questioning the vaccine's scientific merit.
  - **Outcome:** This skepticism was validated when the vaccine failed in Phase 3 trials, confirming doubts about both the company's scientific claims and management practices.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article serves as an important case study in biopharma stock manipulation and investor protection, though its interest is primarily historical rather than forward-looking. The case illuminates systemic issues in small-cap biotech investing that remain relevant today for understanding regulatory risks and promotional practices.
