# Alnylam Makes It (As Does RNAi?) (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reported on Alnylam's survival and success after years of uncertainty in the RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics field. Just two years prior, there were doubts about whether Alnylam could produce results that would keep the company viable. The breakthrough came when Sanofi invested $700 million for a 12% stake in Alnylam, driven by positive Phase II clinical trial results for patisiran, an RNAi therapy targeting transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR), a rare disease. The article noted that Alnylam had an expanded pipeline of development candidates and that the Sanofi deal would provide crucial funding to advance these programs. The author characterized RNAi as having gone through a "lengthy (and often overhyped) growth phase," suggesting the field might finally be realizing its long-promised therapeutic potential.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the January 2014 article, RNAi therapeutics and Alnylam achieved significant milestones. Patisiran (brand name Onpattro) became the first RNAi therapeutic approved by the FDA in August 2018 for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults. The approval was based on the APOLLO Phase III trial showing significant improvements in neuropathy and quality of life measures.

Alnylam has since progressed multiple RNAi therapies through development and regulatory approval. As of 2024, Alnylam has five FDA-approved RNAi therapeutics: patisiran (Onpattro), givosiran (Givlaari) for acute hepatic porphyria, lumasiran (Oxlumo) for primary hyperoxaluria type 1, inclisiran (Leqvio) for hypercholesterolemia, and vutrisiran (Amvuttra) for ATTR amyloidosis. These therapies target rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

The market adoption has been substantial, with Onpattro generating hundreds of millions in annual revenue. The success of Alnylam's approved therapies has validated the RNAi platform and spurred continued investment and development in oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. However, RNAi has not become a dominant therapeutic modality for common diseases, remaining primarily focused on rare and specialty conditions where target gene knockdown provides clear therapeutic benefit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about patisiran's prospects**: The article suggested patisiran's Phase II results were strong enough to justify Sanofi's major investment. **Outcome**: This proved accurate, as patisiran successfully completed Phase III trials and received FDA approval in 2018, becoming a clinically and commercially successful therapy.

• **Suggestion that RNAi was "starting to realize its promise"**: The author cautiously indicated that after an overhyped period, RNAi might finally deliver on its therapeutic potential. **Outcome**: This prediction was substantially correct, as multiple RNAi therapeutics achieved regulatory approval and clinical use within the following decade, though primarily in rare disease applications rather than broad therapeutic applications.

• **Implication that Alnylam's pipeline would advance with Sanofi funding**: The article noted that Sanofi's investment would help accelerate Alnylam's development programs. **Outcome**: This was confirmed, as Alnylam advanced multiple drug candidates from its pipeline to approval over the subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when RNAi therapeutics transitioned from experimental promise to clinical validation, marking Alnylam's emergence as a successful biopharmaceutical company and the beginning of approved RNAi medicines reaching patients.
