# Making Their Own ALS Drug (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Wall Street Journal story highlighted a small group of ALS patients who, after learning that Neuraltus Pharmaceuticals was testing a compound called NP001 (later identified as a formulation of sodium chlorite), decided to purchase the chemical themselves, mix it with distilled water, and administer it via feeding tube. The author described this as a striking example of “do‑it‑yourself” science: a deadly, rapidly progressing disease, an inexpensive, readily available chemical, and a patient community organized enough to share dosing protocols online. The piece suggested that if NP001 proved effective, the company would face patent‑ability questions, and it implied that many ALS patients would continue self‑medicating while awaiting formal trial results.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development of NP001**  
- **Phase II (2010‑2011):** A small, open‑label study showed modest reductions in inflammatory biomarkers but no clear functional benefit.  
- **Phase IIb (2014):** Neuraltus reported that NP001 failed to meet its primary endpoint of slowing ALS progression (measured by ALSFRS‑R) in a randomized, placebo‑controlled trial of ~200 patients. The company announced the setback publicly in late 2014.  
- **Shift of focus:** After the ALS failure, Neuraltus redirected NP001 toward other inflammatory conditions. A Phase II trial in ulcerative colitis (2015‑2016) showed some improvement in remission rates, but the data never progressed to a pivotal Phase III study, and the company eventually discontinued development of NP001 for any indication.  

**Regulatory status**  
- NP001 never received FDA approval for ALS or any other disease. No subsequent IND filings for ALS were made after the 2014 failure.  

**DIY sodium chlorite use**  
- The patient‑driven “home‑brew” regimen remained a niche activity. Health‑authority warnings (FDA, CDC) about the toxicity of sodium chlorite—particularly the risk of methemoglobinemia, renal injury, and severe gastrointestinal irritation—were reiterated in 2013‑2015.  
- No large‑scale adoption or clinical evidence emerged to support the practice. Online forums that once discussed dosing largely fell silent after the 2014 trial results.  

**Business outcome**  
- Neuraltus (later renamed **NPI‑Pharma** and eventually **Apexigen**) experienced a steep decline in market valuation after the ALS trial failure. The company was acquired in 2018 by a private‑equity firm and its pipeline was restructured away from sodium chlorite.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “We should expect to see more of this sort of thing” (DIY patient‑made drugs).  
  - **Outcome:** Limited to a few isolated cases; no broader movement in ALS or other diseases. The practice did not become a recognized therapeutic avenue.  

- **Prediction:** NP001 could become an approved ALS therapy, raising patent‑ability questions.  
  - **Outcome:** NP001 failed Phase IIb in ALS and was never approved; thus the patent issue never materialized.  

- **Prediction:** Patients would continue self‑medicating “until NP001 is available to all.”  
  - **Outcome:** After the 2014 negative trial, most patient groups shifted focus to other experimental agents (e.g., antisense therapies, gene therapy) rather than sodium chlorite.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The chemical’s low cost and easy access would make it an attractive stop‑gap.  
  - **Outcome:** Safety concerns and lack of efficacy data discouraged broader use; regulatory agencies issued advisories against unsupervised consumption.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a vivid snapshot of patient‑driven experimentation at a time when ALS research was limited, making it historically interesting, but the subsequent failure of NP001 and the marginal impact of DIY sodium chlorite limit its long‑term significance.
