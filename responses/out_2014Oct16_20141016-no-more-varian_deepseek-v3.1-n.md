# Looking Back at “No More Varian” (2014): NMR Market Consolidation Then and Now

## SUMMARY

Derek Lowe’s 2014 piece “No More Varian” mourned the end of the Varian NMR line after Agilent exited the NMR business, framing it as a symptom of broader market consolidation. The article described how the NMR hardware landscape had winnowed from multiple major players—including Varian, Bruker, JEOL, Oxford, and GE—to Bruker emerging as the dominant, near-monopoly supplier. Key drivers included market saturation (universities and companies already had plenty of NMR capacity), a robust used-equipment market that dampened new purchases, and a hardware plateau where even high-field 700 MHz instruments could handle most experiments, making extreme field strengths like 1000 MHz niche curiosities with limited practical demand. The tone was one of fond nostalgia for classic Varian workhorses like the EM-360, combined with concern that a lack of competition might not keep Bruker sufficiently “on their toes.”

## HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely confirmed Lowe’s core observations about market structure while revealing more nuanced dynamics in NMR technology and demand.

- **Bruker’s continued dominance**: Bruker has maintained its position as the leading NMR vendor. In 2019, the company expanded its systems and service offerings, further solidifying market control. No major new competitor has emerged to challenge Bruker’s high-field NMR systems, though smaller players like JEOL and Magritek (specializing in benchtop systems) remain active in niche segments.

- **Technology evolution within a mature paradigm**: NMR technology hasn’t seen revolutionary jumps, but incremental improvements continued. Bruker introduced the *Ascend* line of high-field magnets with enhanced stability, and bio-NMR applications (protein dynamics, drug discovery, metabolomics) drove adoption of 800–1000 MHz systems more than Lowe anticipated. By the early 2020s, there were indeed more 1000 MHz instruments in operation than he predicted, especially in structural biology and pharmaceutical research.

- **Market behavior remained stable**: Demand for NMR instruments grew modestly, primarily driven by life sciences and pharmaceutical applications, but consolidation continued. Agilent’s exit marked a major realignment, and companies like Oxford Instruments shifted focus away from broad NMR markets toward specialized areas. The used-equipment market remained strong, especially for mid-field systems (400–600 MHz).

- **Rise of benchtop NMR**: A notable trend Lowe didn’t emphasize was the emergence of compact, lower-field benchtop NMR systems (like Magritek’s Spinsolve or Thermo Fisher’s picoSpin), which opened new markets in education, quality control, and field applications, though these didn’t challenge Bruker’s high-end dominance.

## PREDICTIONS

Lowe’s analysis was largely prescient, with a few notable exceptions:

- **More accurate**:
  - **Bruker’s monopoly persisted**: The consolidation to Bruker remained a defining feature, and no major new competitors emerged.
  - **Hardware plateau**: NMR field strengths didn’t dramatically increase. The 700–800 MHz range remained the practical upper limit for most labs, though 1000 MHz instruments found greater adoption in structural biology than he expected.
  - **Market saturation**: Most universities and companies already had NMR capacity, limiting sales growth.

- **Less accurate**:
  - **Underestimation of ultra-high-field demand**: Lowe suggested 1000 MHz NMR systems were niche, but pharmaceutical research and structural biology increasingly relied on them for complex biomolecular studies, driving more installations than he anticipated.
  - **Neglect of benchtop NMR growth**: The emergence of compact, benchtop systems (e.g., from Magritek, Nanalysis) created a new market segment he didn’t foresee, broadening NMR accessibility beyond traditional labs.

- **Highly accurate insight**:
  - **No “2000 MHz” revolution**: As Lowe predicted, no one has built a 2000 MHz system, and even if one existed, its applications would be extremely limited. NMR’s demand curve flattens at ultra-high fields, unlike computation.

## INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article is in the **80–89 percentile** of interest. It’s an excellent microcosm of broader themes in scientific instrumentation: market consolidation driven by technological maturity and industry dynamics. Lowe’s analysis of Varian’s exit serves as a compelling case study of how innovation plateaus in mature fields, leading to dominant players. While the NMR niche might seem narrow, its lessons apply to many specialized technology markets (e.g., mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction). The only limitation is that NMR itself is a niche technique compared to, say, DNA sequencing or CRISPR, so the article’s broader societal impact isn’t as profound as some other *Science* pieces—hence an 8 or 9 would be reserved for more transformative technologies. It’s a thoughtful, historically grounded reflection that resonates well beyond NMR.
