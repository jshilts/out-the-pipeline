# Myths of Vaccine Manufacturing (February 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article challenges the popular notion that "dozens of other pharma companies" were standing ready to produce COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, arguing this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the specialized manufacturing required. The author explains that unlike traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines require a complex, multi-step production process that cannot be easily scaled or delegated to other manufacturers without significant lead time. The piece breaks down the manufacturing into six key steps: DNA plasmid production, mRNA transcription, lipid synthesis, lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation, vial fill-and-finish, and distribution. The author identifies LNP formulation (Step Four) as the critical bottleneck—a highly specialized microfluidics-based process requiring bespoke equipment that very few facilities possess. Even major pharmaceutical companies like Sanofi and Novartis required months to contribute meaningfully to production efforts, demonstrating that rapid scaling was far more complex than commonly assumed.

## 2. HISTORY

In the months and years following this February 2021 article, the author's central argument proved largely accurate. The mRNA vaccine manufacturing ecosystem did remain concentrated among a small number of players, though capacity expanded significantly through several pathways:

**Manufacturing Expansion:** Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna dramatically scaled their own production capabilities throughout 2021. Pfizer increased its 2021 production target from 1.3 billion to 2.5 billion doses, while Moderna expanded from 600 million to 800 million-1 billion doses. This was achieved through internal expansion rather than enlisting "dozens" of new manufacturers.

**Limited Third-Party Involvement:** The partnerships mentioned in the article materialized as described. Sanofi began filling and packaging Pfizer vaccines at its facilities starting in August 2021, exactly on the timeline predicted. Novartis similarly engaged in fill-and-finish operations in Switzerland. However, these collaborations focused primarily on downstream steps (vial filling, packaging) rather than the core LNP formulation bottleneck identified in the article.

**Continued Manufacturing Bottlenecks:** Throughout 2021, production constraints remained a significant issue. The fragmented global supply chain for specialized components—particularly the proprietary lipids required for LNPs—continued limiting rapid scale-up. Countries faced vaccine shortages and distribution delays well into 2021, validating the article's assessment that manufacturing complexity prevented immediate mass production.

**Market Concentration Persists:** By 2023, mRNA vaccine production remained dominated by the original players. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna controlled the vast majority of global mRNA vaccine supply. While some additional contract manufacturers eventually participated in fill-and-finish operations, the core LNP production technology remained tightly held by the originators and their key partners.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about vaccine manufacturing scalability:

- **Prediction: Rapid enlistment of "dozens" of new manufacturers was not feasible**
  - **Outcome:** This proved entirely correct. Throughout 2021 and beyond, mRNA vaccine production remained concentrated among Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and a very limited number of partners. No "dozens" of additional companies entered mRNA vaccine production.

- **Prediction: LNP formulation would remain the critical bottleneck**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. While DNA plasmid and mRNA production capacity expanded, the specialized microfluidics-based LNP formulation continued to constrain production. Most third-party partnerships focused on downstream steps (fill-finish, packaging) rather than the core LNP technology.

- **Prediction: Even major pharmaceutical companies would require extended timelines (Sanofi's August 2021 impact)**
  - **Outcome:** Precise. Sanofi began contributing to Pfizer vaccine production in August 2021 as announced, confirming that even well-resourced manufacturers needed approximately six months to meaningfully participate.

- **Prediction: Building additional LNP manufacturing capacity would be slow**
  - **Outcome:** Correct. The specialized equipment and process expertise required for LNP production meant that scaling beyond existing players occurred gradually. CureVac's later struggles to rapidly scale production further validated the complexity of LNP manufacturing.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrated significant prescience in explaining why mRNA vaccine manufacturing couldn't be rapidly democratized across the pharmaceutical industry. Its technical breakdown of LNP formulation as the critical bottleneck and predictions about manufacturing timelines proved remarkably accurate during the subsequent global vaccine rollout challenges. The piece provided important technical reality-checking during a period of widespread misunderstanding about pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities.
