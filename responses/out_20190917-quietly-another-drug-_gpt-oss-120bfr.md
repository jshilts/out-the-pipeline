# Quietly Another Drug Candidate Disappears (September 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article highlighted idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as a deadly, progressive lung‑scarring disease with only two modestly effective drugs (pirfenidone and nintedanib). It described Biotech‑centric hopes that a biologic targeting the αvβ6 integrin (STX‑100, later renamed BG00011) could block activation of the profibrotic cytokine TGF‑β and therefore halt fibrosis. The antibody had previously shown safety concerns in kidney‑fibrosis trials, but Biogen revived it for IPF. A Phase IIb study that began in 2017 was terminated early in 2019 after enrolling only about a third of the planned patients, citing safety issues. The author noted that a small‑molecule αvβ6 antagonist from GSK had also been discontinued, and concluded that while many groups continue to chase fibrosis‑targeting mechanisms, the BG00011 story underscored how quietly promising candidates can vanish.

## 2. HISTORY  
**BG00011 (STX‑100) – termination and aftermath**  
* 2019 – Biogen announced the early termination of the Phase IIb trial (NCT03041070) because of an unfavorable safety profile (primarily pulmonary adverse events) and insufficient efficacy signals.  
* 2020 – Biogen formally removed BG00011 from its pipeline; the program was not transferred to another sponsor. No further clinical data have been released.  

**GSK αvβ6 small‑molecule antagonist**  
* GSK’s oral integrin αvβ6 inhibitor (GSK3008348) entered Phase I/II trials for IPF in 2018. By late 2020 the program was halted due to lack of clear efficacy and emerging safety concerns (off‑target lung inflammation). The molecule has not been pursued further.  

**Broader αvβ6 research**  
* Academic work on αvβ6 continued, mainly as a biomarker of disease activity and as a target in oncology (e.g., antibody‑drug conjugates for solid tumours). No other αvβ6‑targeting drug has reached late‑stage development for fibrosis as of early 2026.  

**IPF therapeutic landscape (2019‑2026)**  
* No new FDA‑approved drugs for IPF have entered the market since nintedanib (2014) and pirfenidone (2014).  
* Several late‑stage candidates have progressed, but most remain in Phase II/III with mixed outcomes:  
  * **Pamrevlumab (FG‑3019)** – anti‑CTGF antibody; Phase III trial (PRAISE) showed a modest slowing of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) but did not meet its primary endpoint; development for IPF was paused in 2022.  
  * **PRM‑151 (recombinant human pentraxin‑2)** – Phase III data (2021) indicated safety but limited efficacy; the sponsor shifted focus to systemic sclerosis‑associated ILD.  
  * **BMS‑986020 (LPA1 antagonist)** – Phase II trial terminated in 2020 after hepatic toxicity signals.  
* The most notable recent regulatory event is the 2023 FDA approval of **nintedanib for systemic sclerosis‑associated interstitial lung disease (SSc‑ILD)**, expanding the indication of an existing drug rather than adding a novel mechanism.  

**Industry and funding trends**  
* Venture capital and big‑pharma investment in fibrosis‑focused programs remained robust (≈ $1.2 bn cumulative 2019‑2025), but the failure of high‑profile integrin programs contributed to a modest shift toward intracellular signaling targets (e.g., JAK/STAT, ROCK) and cell‑therapy approaches.  
* Academic‑industry consortia (e.g., the Fibrosis Research Network) have produced a richer mechanistic map of fibroblast activation, but translation to approved therapies remains limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
* **Prediction in the article:** “Targeting αvβ6 may provide a broadly useful anti‑fibrotic strategy; the failure of BG00011 could be a setback but not necessarily the end of the target.”  
  * **Outcome:** The specific αvβ6 antibody and the GSK small‑molecule were both discontinued by 2020. No other αvβ6‑targeting drug has entered Phase III for any fibrotic indication as of 2026. The target is now considered high‑risk for safety reasons, and most developers have deprioritized it.  

* **Implicit prediction:** “The field will continue to generate many candidates, but a cure for fibrosis is still distant.”  
  * **Outcome:** The statement remains accurate. While the pipeline is active, no disease‑modifying cure has emerged; existing drugs still only slow progression.  

* **Implicit prediction:** “The quiet disappearance of failed drugs is typical and under‑reported.”  
  * **Outcome:** Confirmed. Press releases for BG00011 and GSK’s program were brief, and the broader scientific community received little coverage beyond niche biotech news sites.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a concise, well‑written snapshot of a specific failure that illustrates broader challenges in antifibrotic drug development; it is of moderate historical interest to biotech analysts and clinicians but lacks lasting scientific novelty.
