# What I, um, Meant to, um, Say (November 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary reflecting on poor public speaking and communication skills among executives and academics. The author observes that some people in leadership positions seem unable to deliver coherent speeches, with rambling, unfocused thoughts that never complete a sentence before jumping to the next idea. The piece suggests these individuals may excel in one-on-one or small group settings but fail at formal presentations. The author illustrates the point with a humorous example of a professor giving a lecture that's been fictionalized as a cake recipe - showing how someone can talk at length without actually communicating anything meaningful. The central question posed is whether people who speak incoherently actually think in the same fragmented way they speak.

## 2. HISTORY

This article represents general commentary about communication skills rather than an analysis of the biotechnology industry specifically. Published in November 2002, this piece predates the major implosion of ImClone Systems, whose CEO Sam Waksal (briefly mentioned in the article) was sentenced to prison in June 2003 for insider trading, and Martha Stewart was subsequently convicted in March 2004 for lying to investigators about her ImClone stock sale. The broader context suggests this was published during a period of increasing scrutiny of biotech executives and their public communications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No specific predictions about biotechnology developments, drug approvals, scientific methods, or business outcomes are made in this article. The piece is observational commentary about communication styles rather than forward-looking analysis of the biotech industry.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 0/10**

This article does not actually discuss biotechnology industry developments, scientific breakthroughs, drug pipelines, or related business/policy matters, despite the prompt template indicating it should be a biotechnology commentary piece. It appears to be misclassified - the content is about public speaking skills rather than biotech industry analysis.
