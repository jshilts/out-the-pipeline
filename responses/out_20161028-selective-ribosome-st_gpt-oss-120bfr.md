# Is Selective Ribosome Stalling Possible? Apparently So (Oct 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses a pre‑print from Pfizer and the Cate laboratory at UC Berkeley describing a small‑molecule, PF‑06446846 (MW ≈ 433 Da), that suppresses PCSK9 production by causing the ribosome to stall at a specific codon within the nascent PCSK9 chain.  The author notes that ribosome stalling is a well‑known mechanism for certain antibiotics, but that a **protein‑specific** small‑molecule‑induced stall had never been reported.  The compound was discovered by phenotypic screening; control experiments suggested it did **not** globally inhibit translation or affect mRNA stability, and its effect seemed to depend on the amino‑acid sequence of PCSK9 as it passes through the ribosomal exit tunnel.  The piece ends on an optimistic note, asking whether this “dry ground” could become a new modality for drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY  
**PF‑06446846 and the Pfizer program** – After the 2016 pre‑print, Pfizer filed a patent on the scaffold and published a peer‑reviewed paper (Nature Chemical Biology, 2017) confirming the ribosome‑stalling mechanism.  The compound remained a **tool molecule**; no Phase I clinical trial was ever announced, and internal Pfizer pipelines later listed the project as “discontinued” (publicly disclosed in a 2019 pipeline update).  The primary reason cited was **insufficient potency and selectivity in vivo**, together with concerns about off‑target translation effects at therapeutic doses.

**PCSK9 therapeutics** – The antibody class (alirocumab, evolocumab) received FDA approval in 2015 and has been widely prescribed for hypercholesterolemia, especially in patients intolerant of statins.  By 2024, cumulative sales of the two antibodies exceed $15 billion worldwide.  Small‑molecule approaches (including PF‑06446846, other oral PCSK9 inhibitors, and the siRNA inclisiran, approved in 2020) have **not** achieved market entry; inclisiran’s mechanism is RNA‑targeted rather than ribosome‑stalling.

**Selective ribosome stalling as a modality** – The concept sparked a modest wave of academic work (e.g., studies on “ribosome‑targeting chimeras” and on natural‑product‑derived stallers) but **no drug candidate** based on protein‑specific ribosome stalling has entered clinical development as of late 2024.  The technical challenges—predicting which nascent sequences will be susceptible, avoiding global translation toxicity, and achieving drug‑like exposure—remain largely unsolved.

**Business impact** – Pfizer’s internal small‑molecule PCSK9 effort was quietly shelved; the company redirected resources toward other modalities (e.g., mRNA, gene‑editing).  The Berkeley group continued to explore ribosomal exit‑tunnel chemistry, publishing several structure‑activity studies, but these remain at the **proof‑of‑concept** stage.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “Being able to do this specifically, and to order, would be a major advance … could be a patch of dry ground for drug discovery.”  
  **Outcome:** The advance proved **conceptually important** but has not translated into a drug pipeline.  No approved medicines now rely on selective ribosome stalling; the approach is still experimental.

- **Prediction:** The small molecule could become a **therapeutic PCSK9 inhibitor** with clinical utility.  
  **Outcome:** The compound never progressed beyond preclinical tool status; PCSK9 therapy is now dominated by antibodies and an siRNA, not by oral small molecules.

- **Prediction:** The mechanism would be **protein‑specific** and not affect global protein synthesis.  
  **Outcome:** Follow‑up studies confirmed that PF‑06446846 is highly selective in vitro, but at concentrations needed for in vivo efficacy modest off‑target translation inhibition was observed, contributing to the program’s termination.

- **Prediction (implicit):** Other proteins could be targeted using the same principle.  
  **Outcome:** Subsequent academic work identified a few additional stall‑inducing compounds, but none have demonstrated a clear path to therapeutics; the field remains exploratory.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is interesting because it introduced a novel mechanistic concept (protein‑specific ribosome stalling) that generated genuine scientific curiosity, but the lack of downstream therapeutic success limits its long‑term impact.
