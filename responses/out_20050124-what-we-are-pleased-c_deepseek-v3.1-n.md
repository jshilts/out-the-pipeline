# What We Are Pleased to Call State of the Art (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the standard cancer drug discovery model of implanting human cancer cell lines into immunodeficient mice (xenografting), then testing drug candidates on tumor growth. The author details how these models are flawed: cell lines evolve in vitro and may not reflect real tumors, the tumors grow in an artificial matrix with mouse vasculature rather than native tissue, and the athymic (nude) mice lack functional immune systems. A key example is Iressa, which showed activity in these models but failed to deliver real benefit in humans, highlighting a false-positive problem. The author concludes the models serve a crude pass/fail screening role but are poor at rank-ordering compounds, and calls for better animal models that could help patients and save industry significant costs.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in 2005 proved prescient and catalyzed significant changes in preclinical oncology research over the following two decades. The problems with traditional xenograft models became increasingly documented, leading to multiple tangible shifts:

**Iressa's Mixed Trajectory:**
Iressa (gefitinib), the article's key example, exemplifies the xenograft problem. While it showed activity in mice, subsequent clinical trials in unselected NSCLC patients showed no survival benefit compared to placebo in the ISEL trial (2004-2005). This led the FDA to restrict Iressa in 2005 to patients already benefiting from the drug. Years later, the discovery of EGFR activating mutations explained the discrepancy—Iressa works in the 10-15% of patients with these mutations. The drug gained new life as a targeted therapy after companion diagnostics identified responders, though it never achieved the broad blockbuster status originally hoped for when developed using traditional xenograft models.

**FDA Drug Approvals and Xenograft Correlation:**
Multiple analyses confirmed the poor predictive value of xenograft models. Studies reviewing oncology drug development found that only about 8-10% of agents showing anti-tumor activity in xenografts eventually achieved FDA approval. More damningly, many approved drugs showed minimal activity in standard xenografts during development (e.g., immunotherapies, some targeted agents).

**Model System Evolution:**
The industry responded by developing more sophisticated preclinical models:
- **PDX (Patient-Derived Xenograft) models** emerged as superior alternatives, using fresh tumor tissue directly implanted into mice rather than cell lines, preserving tumor heterogeneity and biology better than traditional xenografts. Several contract research organizations now specialize in PDX services, and many pharmaceutical companies adopted PDX panels in their screening cascades by the early 2010s.
- **Humanized mouse models** evolved with better immune system reconstitution, allowing testing of immunotherapies in immunocompetent but humanized contexts. This addresses the article's concern about missing immune system effects.
- **Organoid and 3D culture systems** became widespread, allowing in vitro testing that preserves more tissue architecture than traditional 2D cultures.
- **Syngeneic mouse models** (using mouse tumors in immunocompetent mice) became standard for immunotherapy development, addressing the immune system blind spot the author identified.

**Immunotherapy's Validation Challenge:**
The rise of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors from ~2010 onward) highlighted how traditional xenograft models were completely inadequate for immunotherapy development, as they entirely missed immune-mediated efficacy—the very mechanism driving blockbuster drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **The article predicted that better animal models would "help large numbers of desperate patients and save the drug industry about a billion dollars"**: This proved largely accurate. The development of PDX models, humanized mice, and better preclinical systems has improved drug development success rates, though the billion-dollar savings is difficult to quantify precisely. What is verifiable is that the industry rapidly adopted more sophisticated models—companies like Charles River, Taconic, and The Jackson Laboratory built significant businesses around improved mouse models. Additionally, the FDA and cancer research communities invested heavily in model improvement (e.g., NCI's Patient-Derived Models Repository launched in 2016, and numerous academic centers focused on translational modeling). The cost savings manifested in reduced late-stage failures and better early-stage go/no-go decisions.

- **The Iressa example served as an implicit prediction that xenograft results wouldn't translate**: This prediction was validated by extensive subsequent data. The pharmacogenomics revolution revealed that many targeted therapies failed in unselected populations but succeeded in biomarker-selected subgroups, fundamentally changing oncology drug development away from traditional empirical screening approaches.

- **The pass/fail screening utility remained**: This modest assessment proved accurate. Even today, standard xenografts maintain some utility for gross toxicity screening and basic proof-of-concept, but rank-ordering and predicting human efficacy remains problematic without better model systems.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates substantial insight that proved highly relevant over time. The specific criticisms of xenograft models identified real limitations that the field spent the next two decades addressing, and the broader concerns about preclinical-to-clinical translation accuracy have become central themes in oncology drug development, with tangible impacts on FDA guidance, industry practices, and the evolution of model systems biology.
