# Vivek Ramaswamy's Plans (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines Vivek Ramaswamy's emerging biopharmaceutical portfolio strategy through Roivant Sciences. The author highlights serious skepticism about Ramaswamy's approach, particularly focusing on Axovant's Phase III Alzheimer's drug acquired from GlaxoSmithKline—a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor that had already failed in two previous Alzheimer's clinical trials. The business model involved acquiring "shelved" pharmaceutical compounds and spinning them out into separate companies (Axovant, Myovant, Dermavant) with dedicated scientific teams and financial incentives.

The author challenges Ramaswamy's central claim that traditional pharma suffers from incentive misalignment, arguing that the pitch about scientists not being rewarded for blockbusters and companies designing trials to "not get the answer" makes little sense given the enormous costs and commercial pressures of drug development. The piece suggests that most shelved compounds fail for legitimate scientific reasons (lack of efficacy or toxicity) rather than business decisions, questioning whether enough viable assets exist to support Ramaswamy's "Berkshire Hathaway of biopharma" ambition.

## 2. HISTORY

**Axovant's Alzheimer's Failure**: In September 2017, eight months after this article, Axovant announced that its Phase III MINDSET trial of intepirdine (RVT-101) failed to meet primary or secondary endpoints in Alzheimer's patients. The stock plummeted over 70% in one day, validating the article's skepticism about the improbable success of a twice-failed mechanism. By 2018, Axovant pivoted entirely away from Alzheimer's and neurology, laying off staff and licensing entirely different assets.

**Roivant's Evolution**: Despite Axovant's collapse, Ramaswamy continued building his portfolio. Roivant raised $1.1 billion from SoftBank in 2017 and expanded its "Vant" companies to include Datavant (data), Enzyvant (rare diseases, acquired by Sumitomo for $2 billion in 2019), and others. However, by 2020-2021, Roivant pivoted to become a more conventional drug developer, abandoning the pure "pharma cast-offs" model and conducting a SPAC merger. In 2023, Roivant acquired Telavant from Pfizer and Roche, gaining an inflammatory bowel disease drug that later showed positive Phase II results—marking a significant departure from the original strategy.

**Clinical Outcomes**: Between 2017-2023, only one of Ramaswamy's major "Vants" delivered an approved drug: Enzyvant's Rethymic (for congenital athymia, approved 2023 after being acquired by Sumitomo in 2019). Meanwhile, several high-profile assets failed or struggled: Axovant's subsequent schizophrenia drug failed Phase II (2019), and Myovant faced manufacturing issues and modest commercial uptake for its endometriosis and prostate cancer drugs despite FDA approval.

**Financial Performance**: Publicly traded "Vants" underperformed significantly. Axovant merged with privately-held Roivant in late 2018 in an all-stock deal that amounted to a rescue. The company later renamed itself Sio Gene Therapies and eventually delisted. Myovant was fully acquired by Sumititomo in 2021 at a valuation roughly equal to its 2016 IPO price, representing negligible shareholder returns after five years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The Axovant drug has an extremely low chance of working"** ✓ **CORRECT**  
The drug failed Phase III in September 2017, validating this prediction completely.

• **"...there are not enough [shelved compounds] to make a Ramaswamy drug empire"** ✓ **PARTIALLY CORRECT**  
While Roivant grew significantly through its pivot strategy, the business model did evolve away from purely acquiring shelved compounds to more conventional drug development, licensing, and partnerships.

• **"No one so far has been able to take over the world doing this"** ✓ **CORRECT**  
Roivant never became the dominant "Berkshire Hathaway of biopharma" that Ramaswamy envisioned. Competitors like The Medicines Company achieved some success with the model but never achieved massive scale either.

• **"I have seen nothing about just how these new companies are going to reward people"** ✓ **NEUTRAL**  
The internal incentive structures were never publicly detailed, but the high attrition and company pivots suggest incentive issues persisted.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates rare insight in an early evaluation of a controversial business model, correctly predicting Axovant's specific failure while providing a nuanced critique of pharma development economics that became more relevant as the biotech funding environment tightened.
