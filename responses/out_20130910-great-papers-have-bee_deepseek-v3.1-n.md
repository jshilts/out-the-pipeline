# Great Papers That Have Been Rejected (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from 2013 discusses the phenomenon of influential scientific papers that were initially rejected by journals. The author notes that this is a familiar topic in scientific circles and provides several examples: Dan Shechtman's quasicrystal work faced significant opposition during publication and criticism from prominent scientists like Linus Pauling; Nature rejected Hans Krebs' original 1937 Krebs cycle paper, which a later Nature editor called the journal's biggest mistake; and the Black-Scholes option pricing model paper in economics was reportedly rejected initially. The piece solicits additional examples from chemistry and promises a follow-up post with more extensive thoughts on the subject.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 article highlighted a real and ongoing issue in scientific publishing. The phenomenon of important papers facing initial rejection has continued to be documented, with the scientific community becoming increasingly aware of publication bias and the challenges of peer review. 

However, subsequent developments have shown a more complex picture. Studies examining this phenomenon systematically have found that while some landmark papers were indeed rejected, the narrative of "great papers always face rejection" may be oversimplified. Research analyzing the publication history of highly-cited papers suggests that rejection rates for eventually influential work may not be dramatically higher than for ordinary papers.

The peer review system has faced increased scrutiny since 2013, particularly regarding reproducibility crises in various scientific fields and concerns about bias, lack of transparency, and gatekeeping in traditional publishing. This has led to the growth of alternative publishing models including preprint servers (bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, etc.), open access journals, and post-publication peer review systems.

Notably, Dan Shechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011 for his quasicrystal discovery, with the Nobel Committee explicitly noting the initial skepticism and resistance his work faced, bringing renewed attention to this issue just two years before the article was published.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not make explicit predictions about the future. It was primarily a discussion piece highlighting historical examples of rejected papers that later became influential. However, the implied suggestion was that this phenomenon would likely continue and that awareness of such cases could inform ongoing debates about peer review and scientific publishing.

While the article didn't make forward-looking statements, we can observe that:
• The tension between peer review reliability and the potential for important work to be initially rejected remains unresolved
• The examples cited (Shechtman's Nobel recognition in 2011, continued discussion of the Krebs cycle story) did increase broader awareness of these issues
• The fundamental challenges of peer review that lead to such rejections persist, though mitigation efforts have evolved

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an important and persistent issue in scientific publishing, but its brevity and anecdotal nature limit its broader impact. The topic has enduring relevance for discussions about peer review and scientific progress.
