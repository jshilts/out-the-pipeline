# Dendreon: Watch the Cost Curve Being Bent (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary highlighted Dendreon’s commercial struggles with **sipuleucel‑T (Provenge)**, the first FDA‑approved therapeutic cancer vaccine for metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer. Although the drug had cleared the regulatory hurdle in 2010, the article argued that its **personalized manufacturing process** made it expensive, and that the **real obstacle was reimbursement**: health‑insurers and Medicare were reluctant to pay the price tag. The author suggested that either the market would force Dendreon to lower its price or demand for Provenge was simply too weak, and that the “cost‑curve” tension would determine the company’s fate.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Commercial performance (2011‑2014)**  
- After launch, Provenge generated about **$300 M in U.S. sales in 2012**, but revenues fell sharply each subsequent year (≈ $150 M in 2013, <$50 M in 2014).  
- Medicare’s national coverage determination (NCD) covered Provenge, but many private payers limited or denied reimbursement, citing modest overall survival benefit (≈ 4 months) relative to cost (~ $93 k per treatment course).  

**Financial distress and restructuring**  
- Dendreon reported a **$140 M loss in Q2 2012** and missed earnings forecasts repeatedly, as the article noted.  
- In **April 2014** the company filed for **Chapter 11 bankruptcy**. A restructuring plan reduced debt and cut the workforce, but the product remained on the market.  

**Acquisition and eventual discontinuation**  
- **April 2015**: Valeant Pharmaceuticals (now Bausch Health Companies) acquired Dendreon for **≈ $442 M**. Valeant kept Provenge in its portfolio but did not invest in expanding indications.  
- Sales continued to decline; by **2019** annual U.S. revenue was under **$10 M**.  
- In **January 2020** Bausch Health announced it would **cease manufacturing and withdraw Provenge** from the market, citing unsustainable demand and high production costs. The FDA subsequently removed the product from its database.  

**Broader impact on the field**  
- Provenge’s commercial failure tempered enthusiasm for autologous cancer‑vaccine approaches.  
- The industry’s focus shifted toward **immune‑checkpoint inhibitors** (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and **CAR‑T cell therapies**, which achieved faster regulatory approvals and larger market uptake.  
- The case became a textbook example of how **pricing, reimbursement, and manufacturing complexity** can dominate the fate of advanced‑therapy biologics, influencing later policy discussions (e.g., CMS reforms on “value‑based” pricing for cell‑based products).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “Reimbursement will be the main barrier; insurers will balk at the price.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Private payer coverage remained limited; Medicare’s coverage was present but did not translate into high utilization. The reimbursement gap contributed directly to the revenue shortfall.  

- **Prediction:** “Demand may be weaker than the company claims; the price‑point may already be beyond what the market will bear.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Clinical adoption never reached the levels Dendreon projected. Even with a price‑cut in 2013 (≈ $70 k per course), uptake did not recover.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** “If the price cannot be lowered, the company will have to accept lower profits or exit.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Dendreon’s bankruptcy, subsequent acquisition, and eventual product withdrawal illustrate that the firm could not sustain the original pricing model.  

Overall, the article’s forward‑looking statements were validated by the subsequent five‑year trajectory of Provenge and Dendreon.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a clear illustration of how pricing, reimbursement, and manufacturing complexity can make or break a breakthrough therapy, a theme that remains highly relevant for today’s cell‑ and gene‑therapy pipelines. It is less about scientific novelty than about business‑model risk, which gives it solid but not top‑tier long‑term interest.
