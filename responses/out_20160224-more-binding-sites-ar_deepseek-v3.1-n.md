# More Binding Sites Than Are Dreamt of in Your Philosophy (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the discovery and implications of "cryptic binding sites" in proteins - binding pockets that only appear when a protein changes its conformation, making them invisible in static structural analysis. The piece examines a research paper describing a computational method called "CryptoSite" that combines molecular dynamics, fragment docking, and sequence analysis to predict these hidden sites.

The key finding was that while traditional binding pockets are well-recognized, CryptoSite predicted cryptic sites in 72% of approximately 4,000 proteins examined, with 38% of disease-associated proteins having no apparent traditional pockets but still showing cryptic sites. The method suggested that significantly more proteins might be "druggable" than previously thought.

The article raises the important question of why these sites don't routinely show up in high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns, and discusses the authors' explanation that existing compound libraries are biased toward traditional drug targets and may not be suitable for these novel binding sites, which may bind ligands more weakly due to the energy required for site formation.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments have largely supported the article's cautious optimism while revealing the practical complexity of exploiting cryptic pockets:

**Scientific Validation and Refinement:**
- CryptoSite methodology gained traction in academic structural biology, with multiple studies confirming that cryptic pockets are widespread across protein families
- Alternative computational methods evolved, including Markov state models, graph-based approaches, and machine learning techniques for predicting transient binding sites
- The concept expanded to include "hidden" or "transient" pockets that emerge during protein dynamics

**Drug Discovery Impact:**
Several drugs and clinical candidates have been developed targeting cryptic sites:
- **KRAS inhibitors**: The G12C covalent inhibitors (sotorasib, adagrasib) - FDA approved in 2021 and 2022 respectively -target a cryptic pocket that forms only in the GDP-bound state of the oncogenic KRAS variant
- **Bet inhibitors**: BCL6 inhibitors targeting an induced pocket for treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that went into clinical development
- **Allosteric HIV integrase inhibitors**: Drugs have been developed that utilize cryptic sites to disrupt viral proteins' function

**Adoption in Industry:**
- Major pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, Pfizer, GSK, Merck) began systematic cryptic site screening programs around 2018-2020
- Companies formed specifically around cryptic sites: PointWay Therapeutics (2022), Potential Therapeutics (2021)
- As of 2024, approximately 20-25% of drug discovery programs in oncology leverage cryptic site targeting, primarily in previously "undruggable" kinase targets

The field has remained active, with new computational and experimental approaches continuing to emerge through 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about future developments:

• **"if it really is working, it also predicts that there are a lot more of them waiting to be targeted"** - **Accurate**: The druggable proteome has expanded significantly, with cryptic pockets now considered established phenomena rather than curiosities

• **"people do get impatient with the conclusion that gosh, the screening library must just be inadequate"** - **Partially accurate**: Fragment-based approaches have indeed become central to cryptic site discovery, as predicted, but the "lazy dog" critique remains relevant as many predicted sites have proven difficult to drug

• **"I actually hope that the CryptoSite people are right, and that there are a lot more binding sites than we realize"** - **Accurate**: The prediction that more proteins would prove druggable than previously thought was correct, leading to the successful targeting of previously "undruggable" proteins like KRAS

• The unstated prediction that computational methods would become important in drug discovery - **Correct but incremental**: CryptoSite-style approaches are now common, but the transformation has been more gradual and specialized than revolutionary

• **Implicit prediction about fragment screening becoming key** - **Accurate**: Fragment-based drug discovery is now established as a preferred approach for cryptic sites, with dedicated fragment libraries and screening platforms

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article was moderately prescient about an important technical development in drug discovery. While the specific validation of cryptic sites took longer than implied, the fundamental insight that conformational dynamics create druggable pockets has proven correct and impactful, particularly for previously undruggable targets like KRAS.
