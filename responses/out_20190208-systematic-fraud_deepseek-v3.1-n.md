# Systematic Fraud (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe highlights a 2019 Nature report from researcher Jennifer Byrne about discovering fraudulent scientific papers focused on a gene she first reported in 1998. Multiple papers from different Chinese authors contained shared irregularities, similar language, and figures, suggesting they came from third-party "paper mills" operating for profit to help researchers meet publication expectations amid intense academic pressure.

Byrne and collaborator Cyril Labbé developed software tools to detect such fraudulent papers. However, they encountered significant resistance: when they contacted 48 authors requesting explanations for problematic results, not one responded. Only 17 papers were retracted at that point, with authors offering only cursory explanations. The article notes the social discomfort around discussing research fraud and how papers scattered across obscure, low-impact journals make it easier to dismiss as unworthy of attention. Lowe highlights that the Chinese government had recently announced crackdown measures including public naming of misconduct violators and punishments affecting funding, promotions, and even personal loans.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following this 2019 article have seen significant developments in both the scale of the problem and response mechanisms:

**Retraction surge and systematic investigations:** Retraction Watch reported that by 2021-2023, thousands of papers—particularly from China—were retracted due to systematic fraud. Major publishers including Springer Nature, Wiley, and Elsevier conducted massive retractions of hundreds of papers citing systematic manipulation of the peer review process and image duplication.

**Paper mill evolution:** Research integrity experts documented the increasing sophistication of paper mills, which expanded beyond biomedical fields into engineering, computer science, and other disciplines. These operations now provide complete "publication packages" including fake data, manipulated images, and even fabricated peer reviews.

**Chinese government policy escalation:** China's Ministry of Science and Technology and National Health Commission implemented increasingly stringent measures. The 2020 "Academic Integrity Regulations" established cadres of researchers involved in fraud being barred from funding, positions, and in some cases faced criminal prosecution. By 2022, China had established a national research integrity database tracking violations across institutions.

**Publisher and institutional responses:** Major journals implemented AI-based screening tools to detect image manipulation, plagiarism, and suspicious data patterns. ImpactStory and other services began offering systematic fraud detection as a service. Universities established research integrity offices with mandatory training, though enforcement remained patchy across different countries.

**COVID-19 impact:** The pandemic initially diverted attention from research integrity and relaxed peer review standards, enabling fraud to proliferate. Several high-profile COVID-19 papers were retracted due to problematic data, accelerating adoption of post-publication review systems.

**Hindawi scandal:** In 2023, Wiley announced closing 19 Hindawi journals after discovering systematic manipulation affecting thousands of papers, primarily from paper mills. This marked a major turning point in publisher accountability.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article and its sources contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **Chinese government crackdown effectiveness:** Lowe acknowledged the possibility this could be "window dressing" but noted China's willingness to follow up with "severe measures if it really perceives a threat." 
  *Outcome:* Partial success. China implemented significant policy changes with real consequences, but paper mills adapted and continued operating, suggesting enforcement limitations.

• **Fraud volume trajectory:** "It'll get worse" - Lowe predicted the corpus of fraudulent literature would continue growing.
  *Outcome:* Correct. The period 2020-2023 saw thousands of additional retractions with increasingly sophisticated fraud mechanisms.

• **Systematic detection tools impact:** The implication that detection tools could stem the tide when combined with institutional response.
  *Outcome:* Mixed. Detection improved significantly with AI tools, but institutional responses remained inconsistent.

• **"Whoops, our mistake" accountability:** Lowe's concern about inadequate consequences for fraud.
  *Outcome:* Mostly accurate. University investigations and funder sanctions increased but remained uneven, with many researchers facing minimal consequences for isolated violations.

• **Obscure journal dismissal:** The tendency for the problem to be dismissed due to concentration in low-impact journals would continue.
  *Outcome:* This pattern continued through 2024, with major fraud scandals receiving attention primarily when involving high-impact venues or major publishers.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a critical systemic problem in scientific publishing before it reached peak visibility, and the subsequent years proved many of its concerns prescient. The intersection of economic incentives, international pressure differentials, and technological arms races between fraud and detection makes this a case study in scientific governance failure that continues to evolve.
