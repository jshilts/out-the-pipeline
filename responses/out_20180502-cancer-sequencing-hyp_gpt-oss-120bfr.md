# Cancer Sequencing Hype And Reality (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary argues that the public perception of “precision oncology” – the idea that most cancer patients can have their tumors sequenced and then be matched to a highly effective, DNA‑guided drug – is vastly overstated. Citing a debate between David Hyman and Vinay Prasad, the author notes that, under FDA‑approved indications at the time, only about 15 % of patients were even eligible for tumor‑DNA sequencing, and perhaps a third of that subset actually derived clinical benefit. The piece attributes the hype to media stories, optimistic statements from cancer leaders in the early 2000s, and a misunderstanding of what “precision targeting” means. It contrasts the early successes of kinase inhibitors in genetically homogeneous cancers (e.g., GIST) with the messy reality of most solid tumors, which are genomically unstable and composed of many sub‑clones. The author points to immuno‑oncology as a promising alternative, especially for hematologic malignancies, but cautions that solid‑tumor applications remain limited. Overall, the article calls for a sober view of how far precision medicine has truly progressed.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory landscape and approved targeted agents (2018‑2026)**  
- The FDA’s “tumor‑agnostic” approvals have expanded the fraction of patients who can be matched to a drug based on a molecular alteration rather than tissue of origin. Since 2017, pembrolizumab for MSI‑H/dMMR, larotrectinib (2020) and entrectinib (2020) for NTRK‑fusion cancers, and pembrolizumab for high tumor mutational burden (2020, later withdrawn) have added roughly 1–2 % of all cancer diagnoses to the eligible pool.  
- By 2023, the NCCN and ASCO guidelines listed **≈30 %** of solid‑tumor patients as candidates for some form of next‑generation sequencing (NGS) with a therapeutic implication, up from the ~15 % cited in 2018. This increase reflects broader insurance coverage (e.g., Medicare’s NGS coverage decision in 2020) and the proliferation of multiplex panels.  

**Clinical impact**  
- Real‑world studies (e.g., the AACR Project GENIE and the Flatiron Health database) show that **≈10–12 %** of all cancer patients receive an FDA‑approved targeted therapy matched to an NGS result, and of those, **≈30–40 %** experience a measurable clinical benefit (objective response or progression‑free survival extension). This aligns closely with the author’s “one‑third of eligible patients” estimate.  
- Notable successes include KRAS G12C inhibitors (sotorasib, adagrasib) approved for NSCLC in 2021 and colorectal cancer in 2022, and the continued expansion of ALK, ROS1, and RET inhibitors. However, resistance mechanisms (secondary mutations, bypass signaling) remain common, limiting durability.  

**Immuno‑oncology**  
- Checkpoint inhibitors (PD‑1/PD‑L1) have become standard of care for many solid tumors, but response rates still hover around **15–25 %** in unselected populations. Combination regimens (e.g., pembrolizumab + chemotherapy) have modestly increased overall response rates but add toxicity and cost.  
- CAR‑T cell therapies have achieved durable remissions in B‑cell malignancies (e.g., axi‑cel, brexu‑cel) and, as of 2024, received FDA approval for multiple myeloma (ide‑cel). Solid‑tumor CAR‑T remains experimental, with only early‑phase trials showing limited activity.  

**Economic and access realities**  
- The average cost of a comprehensive tumor‑DNA panel in the U.S. is **$3,000–$5,000**, often reimbursed only when a matched therapy is prescribed. Out‑of‑pocket expenses and the high price of targeted drugs (often > $150,000 / year) have led to documented financial toxicity for patients.  
- Disparities persist: community hospitals and safety‑net clinics lag behind academic centers in offering NGS, resulting in lower sequencing rates among under‑insured populations.  

**Policy and research trends**  
- The 2022 “Precision Medicine Initiative” renewal emphasized data sharing (e.g., the Cancer Moonshot’s Clinical Data Aggregation Network) and mandated that all FDA‑approved targeted therapies be accompanied by a companion diagnostic when feasible.  
- Basket and umbrella trial designs (e.g., NCI‑MATCH, ASCO‑TARGET) have become routine, providing a pathway for rare genomic alterations to be studied across tumor types.  

Overall, the field has **progressed**: eligibility for sequencing has roughly doubled, and a handful of tumor‑agnostic drugs have validated the concept that a molecular alteration can trump tissue origin. Yet the **overall impact on population‑level cancer mortality** remains modest; U.S. cancer death rates have continued to decline at ~1.5 % / year, a trend driven more by early detection and improvements in standard chemotherapy/radiation than by precision oncology alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction (from article):** Only ~15 % of patients are eligible for sequencing under FDA guidelines; about one‑third of those will benefit.  
  - **Outcome:** By 2023, eligibility rose to ~30 % (due to broader insurance coverage and tumor‑agnostic approvals). The benefit proportion among sequenced patients stays around 30–40 %, so the absolute benefit fraction is now roughly 9–12 % of all cancer patients—close to the article’s estimate when adjusted for the larger eligible pool.  

- **Prediction:** The 2015 “eliminate cancer deaths” deadline would be missed.  
  - **Outcome:** The deadline was indeed missed; cancer mortality continues to fall slowly but has not been eliminated. No major policy shift has altered this trajectory as of 2026.  

- **Prediction:** Immuno‑oncology will become the dominant strategy, especially for solid tumors, because it sidesteps the need to understand every genomic sub‑clone.  
  - **Outcome:** Checkpoint inhibitors are now standard for many solid tumors, but response rates remain limited and resistance is common. CAR‑T and bispecific antibodies have transformed hematologic cancers but have not yet achieved broad solid‑tumor efficacy. Thus, immunotherapy is a major pillar but not the singular solution the article implied.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** The hype around “personalized therapy plans” will lead patients to make poor medical or financial decisions.  
  - **Outcome:** Surveys (e.g., ASCO 2022 patient‑experience study) confirm that many patients overestimate the likelihood of a “perfect match” and sometimes pursue expensive off‑label targeted agents with limited evidence, supporting the author’s concern.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when optimism about genomic medicine met the sobering reality of clinical implementation; its critique remains relevant, though many of its quantitative estimates have shifted modestly with the field’s gradual maturation.
