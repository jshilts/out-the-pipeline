# The Top 100 Chemists? (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief commentary on Thomson Reuters’ “Top 100 Chemists” list that covered the decade 2000‑2010. The ranking was built from publication counts and citation impact, and the author notes that the list is heavily weighted toward fields such as metal‑organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanotechnology, while relatively few organic‑synthesis scientists appear near the top. The writer treats the list as a conversation starter, questioning whether the methodology inflates the visibility of fast‑growing, highly collaborative sub‑disciplines and wondering what the skew tells us about the chemistry enterprise.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Citation‑based rankings after 2011** – Thomson Reuters’ “Highly Cited Researchers” database was transferred to Clarivate Analytics in 2016 and renamed the *Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers* list. The methodology was refined (e.g., field‑normalised citation thresholds, removal of “self‑citation” spikes) but the same bias toward large‑author, high‑impact fields persisted.  

**MOFs** – The surge noted in 2011 proved durable. Between 2012 and 2024, MOF research exploded, with >30 000 papers added to the Web of Science. Several MOF groups (e.g., Omar Yaghi’s lab at UC Berkeley, Hong‑Cai Zhou’s team at Nankai University) entered the top‑10 of the Clarivate list in multiple years. Commercial translation also materialised: companies such as **MOF Technologies**, **BASF’s “Matrimid” line**, and **Aramco’s “Matriflex”** launched products for gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, many early hype claims (e.g., “MOFs will replace all conventional adsorbents”) were tempered by practical issues—scale‑up costs, stability under real‑world conditions, and competition from porous polymers.  

**Nanotechnology** – Nanomaterials continued to dominate citation metrics, especially in energy (perovskite solar cells, quantum dots) and biomedical delivery. The field’s citation intensity remained high, but a growing awareness of “citation bubbles” led journals and funding agencies to demand clearer reproducibility standards. By 2022, the proportion of nanotech papers in the top‑cited 1 % of chemistry fell modestly (≈5 % drop) as other sub‑disciplines caught up.  

**Organic & synthetic chemistry** – Contrary to the 2011 impression, the 2010s saw a renaissance in synthetic methodology. Photoredox catalysis (MacMillan, Yoon), C–H activation (Hartwig, Yu), and flow chemistry (Ley, Jensen) generated highly cited papers that repeatedly entered the Clarivate top‑100. By the late 2010s, at least six synthetic‑organic chemists were consistently in the top‑50, reflecting the field’s shift toward concise, high‑impact transformations that are broadly applicable across pharma and materials.  

**Policy & evaluation** – The article’s implicit critique of citation‑driven rankings fed into a broader debate. In 2015, the *San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment* (DORA) gained traction, urging institutions to de‑emphasise journal‑based metrics. Funding bodies (e.g., NIH, EU Horizon Europe) introduced “responsible metrics” guidelines that explicitly mention the pitfalls of field‑biased citation lists.  

**Business outcomes** – Companies that were heavily cited for MOF or nanotech work (e.g., **Nanosys**, **BASF**) experienced mixed commercial success. Some secured multi‑billion‑dollar contracts (e.g., Nanosys’ quantum‑dot displays), while others faced market pull‑back when competing technologies (e.g., OLED, perovskite) advanced faster than anticipated.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *MOFs and nanotech would dominate the citation‑driven “top chemist” rankings.*  
  - **Outcome:** Largely true for the early 2010s; MOF and nanotech researchers occupied a disproportionate share of the top‑100 list through ~2016. After that, the dominance waned as synthetic‑organic and computational chemistry groups rose in citation impact.  

- **Prediction 2:** *Organic and synthetic chemists would remain under‑represented among the elite.*  
  - **Outcome:** Not borne out. By the mid‑2020s, synthetic‑organic chemists regularly appeared in the top‑100, driven by a wave of broadly useful catalytic methods and the integration of machine‑learning‑guided synthesis.  

No other concrete predictions were made in the piece.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a concise snapshot of how citation metrics can skew perception of scientific fields; its relevance endures because the same debates about metric‑driven rankings, field bias, and the rise of MOFs/nanotech continue to shape research evaluation today.
