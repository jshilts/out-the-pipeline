# Go Home, Gaijin (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses opposition within Takeda Pharmaceutical to the company's globalization strategy, specifically the hiring of non-Japanese executives in senior positions. A group of 110 former executives and individual investors wrote a letter questioning Takeda's appointment of foreigners to key roles including finance, HR, and purchasing. The dissenting group, led by former Takeda real estate subsidiary head Yujiro Hara, argued that the company's globalization was "wrong" and that it should remain a Japanese company rather than being "acquired by foreign capital" through extensive foreign hiring at all levels. The article frames this as a uniquely Japanese cultural phenomenon, contrasting it with what would be unimaginable in the US business environment.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2014 controversy, Takeda continued its international expansion in subsequent years. In 2018-2019, Takeda completed its $62 billion acquisition of Irish drugmaker Shire, one of the largest pharmaceutical deals in history. This acquisition significantly increased Takeda's global footprint and made it more dependent on international markets, particularly rare disease treatments. The company faced substantial debt from this acquisition, leading to restructuring efforts and asset sales to manage the financial burden. In 2020, Takeda relocated its primary stock listing from Tokyo to the New York Stock Exchange, further cementing its global corporate identity. The transformation from a traditionally Japanese company to a truly global pharmaceutical player continued, with the headquarters remaining in Japan but operations becoming increasingly internationalized and decentralized across different regions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction of ongoing cultural resistance to foreign leadership in Japanese companies**: The article implicitly suggests that Takeda's globalization strategy would face continued resistance. What actually happened: Takeda largely continued and accelerated its globalization despite internal opposition.
• **Suggestion that Japan's "uniqueness" would limit such corporate transformations**: The article emphasizes Japan being "its own place, maybe more so than anywhere else" as a barrier to foreign leadership integration. What actually happened: While cultural challenges persisted, Takeda successfully transformed into a global company, and other major Japanese corporations followed similar paths.
• **Implicit assumption that Takeda might retreat from globalization due to internal pressure**: The article presents the resistance as significant and potentially influential. What actually happened: Takeda doubled down on globalization with the Shire acquisition and other international moves.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 4/10**

This article captures an interesting moment in corporate Japan's globalization struggle, but its relevance is limited to a specific cultural/workforce topic rather than broader biotechnology industry developments, scientific innovation, or drug development outcomes.
