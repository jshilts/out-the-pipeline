# Medicinal Chemistry Books 2017 (December 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a curated bibliography of medicinal chemistry books compiled in December 2017, serving as a resource guide for practitioners in drug discovery and development. The author organizes recommendations into categories covering the full drug development pipeline: general medicinal chemistry textbooks and references (e.g., the third edition of *Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry*), histories and case studies of drug discovery, specialized topics such as fragment-based drug discovery, fluorine chemistry, macrocycles, and protein-protein interactions, process chemistry for scale-up, pharmacology for chemists, ADME and pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations, statistics, and chemoinformatics.

The list includes established reference works, newer monographs on emerging methods, and career-focused guides aimed at bridging the gap between academia and industry. The author notes limited activity in new history publications for the year and flagging enthusiasm for Goodman & Gilman's latest edition due to apparent cuts in content. Where available, reader suggestions are incorporated, emphasizing books that gained traction among practitioners for training, reference, or practical guidance.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2017, several trends continued or accelerated, impacting how medicinal chemists discover and develop drugs, but the core textbook and reference literature evolved slowly.

- **New editions and titles (2018–present):** The major reference sets, such as *Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry*, likely received subsequent editions or digital updates aligned with tools for drug design. *Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics* issued newer editions with restored or updated material and online components. Specialized topics the article highlighted—macrocycles, targeted protein degradation (which extends concepts like protein-protein interactions), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and covalent inhibitors—gained sustained or increased interest, leading to dedicated monographs and updates of titles mentioned, though the foundational books mostly retained relevance.

- **Field evolution and impact:** Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) moved from a niche approach to a standardized component of hit-finding in many large pharma and biotech pipelines, with success stories like venurafenib (Zelboraf) cementing its utility. Macrocycles saw wider application but remained challenging to design and synthesize, with progress in cell-permeable peptides and macrocyclic kinase inhibitors. Chemoinformatics and AI/machine learning grew rapidly in drug discovery, shifting from standalone books to integrated tools in pharmaceutical workflows and spawning new titles focused on applied AI, deep learning for molecules, and generative chemistry (though the pre-2018 books still anchor core concepts). Applied biophysical methods (SPR, cryo-EM, native mass spectrometry) became routine in med-chem design teams.

- **Industry-academia pathways and career resources:** The advice in books bridging academia and industry remains broadly sound, but routes diversified. Drug discovery training increasingly integrates computational skills, data science, and familiarity with biotech startup ecosystems alongside traditional medicinal chemistry. Many biotechs shortened discovery timelines via platform approaches (PROTAC, molecular glues, ADCs), with some of those concepts reflected in newer specialized texts published after 2017.

- **Toxicology and ADME advancements:** Publication continued in safety and ADME science, with growing attention to safety-focused design, organ-on-a-chip, computational ADME, and regulatory shifts (FDA's focus on real-world evidence, broader use of modeling). Core textbooks in pharmacokinetics and toxicology mostly retained their standing, supplemented with newer methodology-focused texts.

Overall, the landscape did not shift dramatically in terms of foundational concepts or the utility of the recommended books, but the field incrementally adopted new modalities, computational tools, and development strategies that layered onto the 2017 toolkit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains no explicit predictions about future technologies or clinical outcomes. It is a resource list with scattered observations:

- **Implicit trends in titles:** The inclusion of specialized books on fluorine chemistry, allosteric modulators, and macrocycles suggests rising interest in those areas.
  - Fluorinated motifs became pervasive across drug classes, with widespread uptake in medicinal chemistry to tune metabolism and potency (e.g., JAK inhibitors, KRAS inhibitors).
  - Allosteric and covalent inhibitors continued to advance, including allosteric KRAS inhibitors (e.g., sotorasib) and covalent BTK inhibitors (e.g., ibrutinib).
  - Macrocycles remained an active strategy with design progress and clinical candidates, though broad adoption was tempered by synthetic complexity.

- **Fragment-based drug discovery:** The sustained prominence of books on FBDD reflected confidence in its growth.
  - FBDD became a standard tool in discovery and contributed to multiple approved drugs and clinical candidates (e.g., venurafenib, erdafitinib).

- **Process and scale-up resources:** The mention of process chemistry books signaled ongoing focus on scalable synthesis, which remained critical as complex modalities grew.

- **Computational and data science:** The books on chemoinformatics anticipated integration of informatics in drug discovery, but the acceleration of machine learning and AI tools outpaced the textbook landscape.

In short, the trends implicit in the book list largely continued along their trajectories, with fluorine chemistry and FBDD gaining broad adoption, macrocycles maintaining niche importance, and computational methods rapidly evolving beyond classical chemoinformatics.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

As a curated, evergreen book list, the article offers persistent reference value to students and practitioners searching the 2017 literature but does not advance new scientific claims or capture impactful commercial or clinical outcomes. Its interest derives mainly from bibliographic utility, not long-term importance.
