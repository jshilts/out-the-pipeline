# One Case of Plagiarism Down. Two Zillion to Go. (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article discusses a plagiarism case from *Chemistry - A European Journal* where a paper was largely copy-pasted from an earlier JACS paper. The paper was eventually retracted with the unusual statement that "The authors regret this approach."

The author explores cultural explanations for plagiarism, particularly highlighting the concept of "shanzhai" (copycat) culture in parts of Asia, referencing Yu Hua's book *China in Ten Words*. The article suggests that in some cultures, verbatim copying from authoritative sources is considered more acceptable than in Western academic contexts. The author distinguishes between different types of plagiarism: complete fabrication, templating (borrowing presentation structures while doing original work), and the proliferation of "least publishable units" where minimal variations on existing research generate multiple papers.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, the landscape of academic plagiarism and integrity continued evolving:

**Retraction Trends**: The retraction rate in scientific literature continued to increase, with plagiarism remaining a significant cause. The Retraction Watch database, mentioned in the article, has grown substantially and become a major resource for tracking academic misconduct.

**Detection Technology**: Automated plagiarism detection systems became more sophisticated and widely adopted. Tools like Crossref's Similarity Check and commercial services implemented more advanced algorithms to identify copied text, including paraphrased content and translated plagiarism.

**Continued Cultural Challenges**: The issue of cultural differences in plagiarism remained relevant. Studies continued to document different attitudes toward copying across educational systems, particularly between Western academic expectations and practices in some Asian institutions.

**"Least Publishable Units" Problem**: The pressure to publish led to continued proliferation of incremental research, with many papers adding minimal novel contributions. The "salami slicing" phenomenon described in the article remained a concern in academic assessment systems.

**Institutional Responses**: Many universities and journals strengthened their plagiarism detection and enforcement mechanisms, though these practices remained inconsistent across different regions and disciplines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations about future trends:

- **"Two Zillion to Go"**: The title predicted that many more plagiarism cases would emerge. **Outcome**: True. Retraction rates continued rising, and plagiarism cases remained numerous.
- **Cultural causes would persist**: The article suggested that cultural differences in attitudes toward copying would continue causing problems in scientific publishing. **Outcome**: True. Cultural factors in plagiarism continued to be discussed and studied throughout the 2010s-2020s.
- **Templating and minimal variations would continue**: The article predicted that "least publishable units" and templating behavior would persist. **Outcome**: True. Salami slicing and formulaic papers remained common in many fields.
- **"Least Publishable Units" would proliferate**: The article correctly identified that scientific publication incentives would continue to encourage minimal, incremental papers rather than substantive contributions. **Outcome**: True. This remained a persistent problem in academic publishing.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article addresses an important academic integrity issue and provides cultural context for plagiarism that remains relevant, but it focuses on a situation with limited broader impact and presents largely anecdotal evidence.
