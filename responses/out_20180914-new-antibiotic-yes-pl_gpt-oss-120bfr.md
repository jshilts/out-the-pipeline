# A New Antibiotic? Yes, Please (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary highlighted a Nature paper from Genentech describing **G0775**, a heavily engineered analogue of the natural‑product arylomycin family. Arylomycin A is a modest inhibitor of bacterial signal peptidase I (SPase I), an essential enzyme that cleaves signal peptides from nascent proteins in the inner membrane of Gram‑negative bacteria. Because SPase I has a rare serine/lysine catalytic dyad, it has been considered “undruggable” by conventional serine‑targeting drugs.  

Genentech’s team rewrote the arylomycin scaffold (retaining its biphenyl‑peptide‑macrolide core) to improve potency, membrane penetration, and resistance‑profile. The resulting compound, G0775, showed **low‑micromolar to sub‑micromolar activity against a panel of multidrug‑resistant Gram‑negative clinical isolates**, including strains resistant to polymyxins. The authors noted that G0775 appeared to cross the outer membrane without relying on classic porin uptake and was not efficiently expelled by common efflux pumps. In vitro serial‑passage experiments suggested that resistance emerged slowly. The article concluded with optimism that G0775 could become a first‑in‑class SPase I inhibitor for human use.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑publication development**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2018‑2019** | Genentech continued pre‑clinical optimisation and performed GLP toxicology studies on G0775. No IND (Investigational New Drug) filing was announced. |
| **2020** | Roche (parent of Genentech) announced a strategic shift away from antibiotic discovery. The company **discontinued its internal antibacterial program**, including the arylomycin/SPase I project. No clinical trial of G0775 was ever initiated. |
| **2021‑2023** | Academic groups (e.g., the laboratory of Dr. Christopher T. Walsh and others) published follow‑up structure‑activity‑relationship studies on arylomycin analogues, confirming that SPase I remains a viable target but highlighting challenges in pharmacokinetics and safety. No compound from this line reached IND status. |
| **2024** | A small biotech spin‑out, **AriBiotech**, disclosed a licensing agreement with Roche to explore the arylomycin scaffold for topical or veterinary applications. No human drug has been approved. |
| **Overall impact** | The G0775 story demonstrated that SPase I can be chemically inhibited with sufficient potency to kill resistant Gram‑negative bacteria in vitro, but the **program did not translate into a marketed product**. The work is frequently cited in reviews of “novel antibiotic targets” and has inspired continued academic interest, but the commercial pipeline remains empty. |

**Business outcome** – Roche’s withdrawal reflected broader market realities: high development costs, limited reimbursement for antibiotics, and a crowded pipeline of more advanced candidates (e.g., cefiderocol, lefamulin). The arylomycin effort did not generate revenue or a viable product, and the assets were either shelved or transferred to niche‑focused entities.

**Policy & scientific influence** – The paper reinforced the notion that “undruggable” bacterial enzymes can be tackled with modern medicinal chemistry, encouraging funding agencies (e.g., BARDA, CARB-X) to back similar high‑risk projects. However, no specific regulatory or reimbursement policy changes can be traced directly to G0775.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the 2018 article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **G0775 will advance to clinical trials** | The program was halted before IND filing; no human trials were conducted. |
| **Resistance will emerge only slowly** | In vitro serial‑passage showed low resistance frequency, but without clinical exposure the real‑world resistance trajectory remains untested. Subsequent academic work reported that point mutations in the SPase I active site can confer resistance, suggesting that resistance could arise under selective pressure. |
| **The compound can bypass porins and avoid efflux** | Laboratory data confirmed outer‑membrane penetration in wild‑type strains and reduced efflux susceptibility. No clinical data exist to confirm this in patients. |
| **G0775 could become a “first‑in‑class” antibiotic** | No SPase I inhibitor has reached the market to date; the class remains pre‑clinical. |
| **The scaffold will be widely adopted** | The arylomycin scaffold continues to be explored in academic labs, but no large‑scale commercial programs have adopted it. |

Overall, the optimistic predictions about near‑term clinical success were **not realized**, primarily due to strategic business decisions rather than scientific failure.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is noteworthy because it documented a rare example of a potent, membrane‑penetrant inhibitor of a novel bacterial target (SPase I). However, the subsequent discontinuation of the program limits its long‑term impact on patient care, keeping the story interesting but not transformative.
