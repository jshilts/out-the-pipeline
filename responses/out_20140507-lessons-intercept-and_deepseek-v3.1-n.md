# The Lessons of Intercept and NASH (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses Intercept Pharmaceuticals' dramatic stock surge following positive clinical trial results for their FXR ligand drug treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The stock went from $72 to $445 per share in two days of trading in early 2014 before settling back to the $250-300 range.

The article analyzes why NASH represented both a huge market opportunity and significant development challenges. The condition had no approved treatments, making it potentially lucrative, but clinical development was particularly difficult due to unclear biological mechanisms and the need for repeated liver biopsies to monitor treatment effects. The author endorses the thesis that small companies like Intercept were better positioned to accept these high risks compared to large pharmaceutical companies, where uncertain market size and regulatory pathways might not justify the pioneering effort required.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at what actually happened after this May 2014 article:

**Intercept's NASH Program Timeline:**
- In 2014, Intercept was conducting the FLINT trial with obeticholic acid (OCA) for NASH
- The FLINT trial was stopped early (2014) due to efficacy concerns about primary endpoint achievement
- In 2015, Intercept completed its Phase 2 trial showing some promise
- In 2016, Intercept initiated the REGENERATE Phase 3 trial for OCA in NASH
- Between 2016-2019, the company faced multiple regulatory and clinical challenges
- **In June 2023, Intercept announced it was abandoning its NASH program** after the FDA issued a complete response letter indicating that the REGENERATE trial data did not support approval
- **In September 2023, Intercept was acquired by Italian company Alfasigma** for approximately $800 million, effectively ending its independent pursuit of NASH treatments

**NASH Treatment Landscape Evolution:**
- By 2024, there were still no FDA-approved medications specifically for NASH
- Many other companies also failed in NASH drug development (Gilead, Genfit, Allergan)
- The regulatory pathway remained unclear for years, with the FDA struggling to define acceptable surrogate endpoints
- Some companies shifted focus to different mechanisms and combination approaches

**Market Reality:**
- The "potentially big market" of NASH never materialized as expected
- NASH drug development proved far more challenging than anticipated in 2014
- Most companies that pursued NASH treatments faced significant setbacks or failures

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Prediction: Intercept had promising prospects in NASH treatment**
  - **Outcome: WRONG** - Intercept ultimately abandoned its NASH program in 2023 after nearly a decade of development and regulatory failures

• **Prediction: The NASH market was potentially large and underserved**
  - **Outcome: HALF-RIGHT** - The market was indeed underserved (still no approved NASH drugs by 2024), but the anticipated market size never translated into successful drug development

• **Prediction: FDA guidance would be crucial and trigger market reactions**
  - **Outcome: RIGHT** - Regulatory uncertainty and FDA feedback did drive significant volatility and ultimately contributed to program failures

• **Prediction: Small companies were better positioned for these high-risk NASH programs**
  - **Outcome: WRONG** - Intercept's experience suggested that even nimble small companies couldn't overcome the fundamental biological and regulatory challenges in NASH

• **Prediction: Investors would face continued volatility around regulatory events**
  - **Outcome: RIGHT** - Stock volatility continued through multiple clinical and regulatory milestones until the program's ultimate failure

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captures a fascinating moment in biotech history and demonstrates how even informed commentary can miss the mark when fundamental scientific and regulatory challenges prove insurmountable. The Intercept/NASH story became emblematic of the broader difficulties in drug development for metabolic liver diseases.
