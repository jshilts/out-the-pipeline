# Naming Your Company After Yourself (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article raises a skeptical question about whether modern biopharma companies named after their founders tend to succeed. The author notes that while naming companies after founders was common historically, they couldn't think of any successful recent examples in the drug industry. The piece frames founder-named companies as potentially problematic, suggesting this naming convention might be "on the list of potential warning signs" for biopharma ventures.

## 2. HISTORY
The article's core question has mostly held true over the subsequent decade: very few successful modern biopharma companies bear their founder's surname. 

Major successes like Moderna (founded by Derrick Rossi but not named Rossi Therapeutics), BioNTech (founded by Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci, where "BioNTech" is descriptive rather than personal), and Alnylam (founded by David Bartel and others, with a name derived from RNA interference) did not use founder surnames. Smaller firms have sometimes used founder names, but they are indeed rare among top-tier biopharma companies, especially those with successful product development and approval records.

This pattern is likely due to industry consolidation, the need for broad commercial appeal across global markets, and the preference for names that can be trademarked and positioned for mass-market recognition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction**: Founder-named biopharma companies are likely warning signs for failure.

**Actual outcome**: The correlation mostly persists—very few major successful biopharma companies use founder surnames. Notable exceptions like Perrigo exist but remain rare. Most successful firms use either descriptive names (Pfizer, Eli Lilly) that emphasize their mission, or invented brand names (Novartis, AstraZeneca) that are globally marketable.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 1**

This article addresses a niche, almost trivial aspect of biopharma company strategy. While the underlying observation has held up moderately well—founder-named firms remain rare among successful drug companies—the question's importance to biotechnology progress, clinical outcomes, or industry dynamics is extremely limited. It's a minor footnote rather than a substantive analytical insight.
