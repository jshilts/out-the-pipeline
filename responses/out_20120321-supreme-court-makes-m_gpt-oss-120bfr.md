# The Supreme Court Makes Me Smile (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author revisits the **Mayo v. Prometheus** case, in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down patents that claimed a **diagnostic method** for adjusting thiopurine dosing based on blood‑metabolite levels. The patents did not cover the drug itself, the dosage, or any specific formulation; they merely recited (1) administering the drug, (2) measuring a metabolite, and (3) adjusting the dose according to pre‑defined concentration ranges. The author argues that such claims amount to trying to patent the “practice of medicine” and that the Court’s unanimous opinion—authored by Justice Breyer—rightly refused to grant them, warning that patenting natural laws would choke future innovation.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Legal fallout (2012‑2026)**  
* **Immediate precedent** – Mayo became the leading case for “patent‑ineligible subject matter” under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Federal Circuit subsequently applied the same reasoning in *Myriad* (2013, gene‑sequence claims) and *Sequenom* (2015, prenatal‑testing method).  
* **USPTO guidance** – In 2014 the USPTO issued the “Patent Eligibility Guidance” that operationalized Mayo’s two‑step test (determine whether the claim is directed to a law of nature, then look for an “inventive concept”). This shifted examiner practice toward more rigorous scrutiny of diagnostic‑method claims.  
* **Industry response** – Biotech firms reduced reliance on method‑of‑treatment patents for companion diagnostics. Instead they focused on:  
  * **Composition‑of‑matter claims** (e.g., novel biomarkers, antibodies, nucleic‑acid probes).  
  * **Data‑rich claims** that embed specific, non‑obvious assay steps or machine‑learning models.  
  * **Licensing and partnership models** that bundle diagnostic services with drug sales, sidestepping patent protection.  
* **Patent filing trends** – USPTO statistics show a ~30 % drop in U.S. patent applications that contain “diagnostic method” in the title between 2012 and 2016, followed by a modest rebound after 2018 as companies crafted more claim‑specific inventions.  
* **Commercial impact** – Some companies that had built business models around broad diagnostic patents (e.g., **Prometheus Laboratories**, **Genomic Health**) saw valuation pressure and shifted toward **software‑as‑a‑service** platforms or pursued **trade‑secret** protection for algorithms.  
* **Legislative attempts** – The “Diagnostic Patent Reform Act” was introduced in Congress in 2015 and again in 2019 but never passed; the debate highlighted the tension between encouraging innovation and preserving clinical freedom.  
* **Scientific practice** – The decision did not stop therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for thiopurines; clinicians continue to measure 6‑mercaptopurine metabolites, but the practice is now unpatented and freely used worldwide.  

**Broader biotech landscape**  
* The **personalized‑medicine** boom continued, but companies increasingly protect their assets through **patents on biomarkers themselves**, **software implementations**, or **data‑set exclusivity** rather than the abstract correlation between a biomarker and a therapeutic outcome.  
* The **FDA’s “Companion Diagnostic”** pathway grew in importance, with the agency issuing clearer guidance (2014, 2020 updates) that emphasizes **co‑development** rather than reliance on patent exclusivity.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction in the article (or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **The Supreme Court will stop patents that “monopolize” natural‑law correlations.** | Mayo was decided exactly as the author hoped; subsequent cases (Myriad, Sequenom, Ariosa) applied the same reasoning, leading to many invalidations. | **Correct** – the Court set a strong precedent that continues to be cited. |
| **Future “nonsense” patents in biotech will disappear.** | While broad diagnostic‑method patents declined, companies still file patents that skirt the Mayo line (e.g., claims that combine a specific assay device with the correlation). The overall volume of such patents fell but did not vanish. | **Partially correct** – the trend moved in the right direction, but inventive work‑arounds persisted. |
| **The decision will protect future innovation by keeping basic scientific tools free.** | The impact is mixed. Academic research benefited from unrestricted use of biomarker correlations, but some investors argue that the reduced patentability of diagnostics slowed private funding for early‑stage diagnostic startups (e.g., fewer VC rounds 2013‑2016). Nonetheless, the industry adapted with new IP strategies, and the pipeline of companion diagnostics remained robust. | **Mixed** – the principle holds, but the practical effect on investment was nuanced. |
| **No further Supreme Court “nonsense” cases will arise.** | The Court continued to hear patent‑eligibility cases (e.g., *Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank* 2014 on software, *Mayo*‑type cases in 2021‑2022). The issue remains a live judicial question, though the Court has not revisited Mayo directly. | **Incorrect** – the broader patent‑eligibility doctrine stayed active. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in biotech IP law that reshaped how companies protect diagnostic innovations; its relevance persists, though the narrative is narrowly focused on a single case.
