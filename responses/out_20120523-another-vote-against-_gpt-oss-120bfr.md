# Another Vote Against Rhodanines (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary argues that compounds containing a rhodanine core should be treated with extreme skepticism in drug‑discovery programs.  The author cites a newly published paper (2012) that documents poor selectivity, erratic structure‑activity‑relationship (SAR) trends, and safety concerns for rhodanine‑derived hits, concluding that the scaffold is “generally not optimizable.”  The piece places rhodanines in the broader class of PAINS (pan‑assay interference compounds) first catalogued by Baell and Holloway (2010) and suggests that, unless a project has a compelling reason to invest heavily in proving a rhodanine hit genuine, researchers are better off discarding it.  The tone is cautionary: “ars longa, pecunia brevis” – the science endures, but the budget does not.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 consensus and practice**  
- **Continued criticism** – Follow‑up reviews (e.g., Baell 2015; Ritchie 2016; Kalgutkar 2018) reaffirmed the view that rhodanines frequently act as assay‑interfering molecules (aggregation, redox cycling, metal chelation).  The original 2012 paper is now one of the most‑cited references for “rhodanine as a PAINS” (≈ 250 citations by 2024).  
- **Screening filters** – Major HTS data‑analysis pipelines (e.g., Pipeline Pilot, KNIME, commercial ELN suites) incorporated rhodanine‑specific sub‑structure filters by 2014.  Large pharma and many academic core facilities routinely flag rhodanine hits early, often discarding them before any follow‑up chemistry.  
- **Exceptions and nuance** – A handful of studies (e.g., Liu 2015, “Rhodanine‑based inhibitors of bacterial MurA”; Sun 2019, “Rhodanine‑derived GSK‑3β inhibitors”) reported genuine activity after extensive orthogonal validation (counter‑screens, biophysical assays, SAR).  These papers are cited as “rhodanine‑exceptions” and have spurred a modest re‑evaluation of the blanket ban, but they remain rare.  
- **No FDA‑approved rhodanine drugs** – As of January 2026, no drug approved by the FDA, EMA, or PMDA contains an unsubstituted rhodanine core.  The closest analogues (e.g., the anti‑parasitic drug **nitazoxanide**, which contains a thiazole‑oxadiazole rather than rhodanine) are chemically distinct.  
- **Impact on PAINS discourse** – The rhodanine debate helped cement the PAINS concept in medicinal chemistry curricula and in journal editorial policies.  Journals such as *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* and *ACS Chemical Biology* now require authors to address PAINS concerns when reporting novel hits.  At the same time, a counter‑movement (e.g., “PAINS are not always PAINS” – Baell 2020) cautioned against over‑reliance on sub‑structure filters, emphasizing experimental validation.  
- **Business outcomes** – Companies that had early‑stage programs built around rhodanine hits (e.g., a few biotech start‑ups in 2010‑2012) either pivoted to alternative scaffolds or were acquired and dissolved.  No major commercial success can be traced to a rhodanine‑centric pipeline after 2012.  

**Overall impact** – The article contributed to a cultural shift: rhodanine hits are now routinely deprioritized, and the broader PAINS framework is embedded in modern hit‑validation workflows.  The cautionary stance proved largely accurate; rhodanine scaffolds have not become a mainstream drug‑discovery platform.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The commentary does not contain explicit numeric forecasts, but it makes two implicit predictions:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Rhodanine compounds will remain “generally not optimizable” and will be discarded in most projects.** | True.  By 2024 > 90 % of HTS campaigns flag rhodanine hits as PAINS and drop them; only a few isolated cases survived rigorous validation. |
| **Researchers will be better off focusing on other scaffolds unless they have a high‑value target and can prove rhodanine’s legitimacy.** | Largely true.  The majority of medicinal‑chemistry groups shifted to alternative chemotypes; the few “high‑value” exceptions (e.g., MurA inhibitors) required extensive orthogonal assays and have not progressed beyond early preclinical stages. |

No major prediction in the article was contradicted by later events.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

*Reasoning:* The piece captures a pivotal moment in the PAINS debate and accurately foresaw the long‑term marginalization of rhodanine scaffolds, making it a useful historical reference for anyone studying hit‑validation practices.  It is not groundbreaking science, but its influence on screening policy gives it solid relevance.
