# The Boston DNA Encoded Library Conference (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article provides a conference report on the first Boston symposium on DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology from November 2015. DEL involves attaching unique DNA sequences to chemical compounds in screening libraries, leveraging molecular biology techniques (PCR, sequencing) to identify hits. The concept originated from a 1992 PNAS paper by Brenner and Lerner, proposing DNA as a coding technology for screening libraries.

The core advantage is scale: DEL enables screening of hundreds of millions to billions of compounds simultaneously, far exceeding traditional high-throughput screening (HTS) libraries. Different companies presented varying approaches: GSK/Praecis reported 745 million compounds; Roche crossed the billions-per-tube threshold; X-Chem created libraries from commercially available building blocks; Ensemble focused on macrocycles; and Nuevolution explored fragment dimers while testing a "completely crazy" 40 trillion compound tetramer library. The technology was positioned as particularly valuable for "break glass in case of emergency" targets—difficult proteins that traditional screening had failed against, including protein-protein interactions and enzymes like insulin-degrading enzyme where traditional libraries yielded poor results.

## 2. HISTORY

DNA-encoded library technology has become an established hit-finding platform in drug discovery since 2015, though adoption has been more measured than initially envisioned.

**Platform Development and Adoption:**
• Major pharmaceutical companies continued investing in DEL platforms. GSK acquired the Praecis DEL technology and expanded its use. By 2020-2022, DEL had become a standard tool alongside traditional HTS and fragment-based drug discovery in most large pharma companies.

• Several DEL-focused companies achieved significant milestones. **X-Chem** (mentioned presenting in 2015) became a major DEL service provider and was acquired by **Danaher Corporation** in 2020 for approximately $450 million, validating the commercial value of DEL platforms.

• **Nuevolution** (also presenting in 2015) continued developing its Chemetics platform and was acquired by **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** in 2019 for about $400 million. The company had advanced multiple programs into preclinical development using DEL-derived hits.

**Success in Identifying Drug Candidates:**
• DEL has successfully generated starting points for clinical development. GSK's **soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor GSK2256294** originated from DEL screening and advanced through multiple Phase 2 trials for diabetes and cardiovascular indications, representing one of the first DEL-derived drug candidates to reach clinical testing.

• Multiple pharmaceutical companies reported DEL-derived programs advancing to preclinical candidate stage across various therapeutic areas including oncology, inflammation, and rare diseases.

• However, **few DEL-derived drugs have reached FDA approval** as of 2024. The technology consistently produces chemical starting points but faces the same attrition rates as other drug discovery methods during lead optimization and clinical development.

**Scientific and Technical Evolution:**
• DEL libraries grew even larger post-2015, with some platforms exceeding 10-100 billion compounds, but focus shifted toward **library quality over sheer size**. Companies emphasized better chemical diversity, improved synthetic methodology for DNA-compatible chemistry, and machine learning integration for hit analysis.

• The technology proved particularly valuable for **protein-protein interaction targets**, where traditional small molecule screening often fails, confirming the 2015 predictions about "break glass" applications.

• Integration with **machine learning and AI** became a major development area, using DEL screening data to train models for virtual screening and library design—addressing the concern raised by multiple 2015 speakers about chemical space sampling.

• DNA-compatible chemistry expanded significantly, with published methods for hundreds of reaction types compatible with DEL synthesis, addressing earlier limitations.

**Limitations and Real-World Outcomes:**
• The "microscopic concentration" paradox noted by Neri in 2015 (compounds screened far below Kd) remains incompletely understood but hasn't prevented practical success.

• While DEL produces hits for difficult targets, **hit-to-candidate success rates** aren't dramatically higher than other methods—the main advantage is accessing targets previously considered "undruggable."

• **Cost-effectiveness** proved better than traditional HTS for certain applications, especially academic and smaller company settings, as predicted.

• The technology did **not entirely replace traditional HTS** as some speculated, but rather complemented existing platforms as an additional hit-finding tool.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions from the 2015 article and their outcomes:**

• **"High-throughput screening will become less of a factor"** and DNA-encoded libraries would democratize screening (Dario Neri)
  - **Partially accurate**: DEL became a valuable additional tool alongside HTS rather than replacing it. Large pharma companies still maintain extensive traditional HTS capabilities, though DEL proved particularly valuable for smaller companies and academic labs due to lower cost per screen.

• **DEL would excel at "break glass in case of emergency" targets** (protein-protein interactions, traditionally undruggable proteins)
  - **Accurate**: DEL has found most success against exactly these target classes. Multiple programs targeting PPIs and difficult enzymes originated from DEL screening, confirming this prediction.

• **Size matters: billion+ compound libraries would provide unprecedented access to chemical space** (Roche, GSK presentations)
  - **Partially accurate**: While massive libraries were created and did yield hits, the field recognized that **library quality and diversity** matter as much as size. Some of the most successful platforms use more focused, smaller libraries with better-designed chemistry.

• **Macrocycles would benefit from DEL approach** (Ensemble Therapeutics)
  - **Moderately accurate**: Macrocycle DEL libraries did produce interesting hits, but macrocycles remain challenging drug candidates due to permeability and synthetic complexity. No major macrocycle drugs clearly traceable to DEL have reached market approval yet.

• **Hit rates and tractability correlation** would help prioritize targets (GSK/Praecis)
  - **Accurate**: This became a practical application. Companies now routinely screen multiple targets against DEL libraries to assess druggability before committing extensive resources.

• **"DNA-encoded libraries don't make tough targets suddenly have good binding sites"** (Alex Satz, Roche)
  - **Accurate**: A dose of realism that proved correct. DEL provides chemical starting points but doesn't solve fundamental biophysical constraints of difficult targets.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 6**

This article captures a technology at an inflection point, documenting key players and approaches just as DEL was transitioning from experimental to mainstream adoption. While the technology didn't revolutionize drug discovery as some early hype suggested, it became a valuable tool that enabled targeting previously intractable proteins and demonstrated commercial viability through successful acquisitions and clinical candidates. The realistic assessment of strengths and limitations makes it a useful historical document for understanding how emerging technologies mature in pharmaceutical research.
