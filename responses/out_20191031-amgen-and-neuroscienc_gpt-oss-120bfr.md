# Amgen and Neuroscience (Oct 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 31 Oct 2019 commentary reported that Amgen was pulling the plug on its early‑stage neuroscience portfolio, laying off staff at its Cambridge research site.  The only remaining neuro asset was the CGRP‑targeting migraine monoclonal antibody **Aimovig** (erenumab), which would continue to be supported.  Amgen’s leadership argued that most neuroscience projects were aimed at “orphan or niche” diseases, whereas the company wanted to concentrate on larger‑impact areas—namely inflammation (e.g., Enbrel), cardiovascular disease, and oncology.  The author noted that Amgen had no plans to pursue Alzheimer’s research and suggested the move was a rational portfolio‑management decision rather than a sign that the whole field was being abandoned.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 developments at Amgen**

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **2020‑2021** | No new early‑stage neuroscience programs were announced. Amgen’s public pipeline listings continued to show only **Aimovig** (migraine) and a handful of late‑stage inflammation‑related projects that had some CNS relevance (e.g., an anti‑IL‑6 antibody for giant‑cell arteritis). | Confirmed the 2019 exit; the company did not rebuild a neuro pipeline. |
| **2022** | **Aimovig** received FDA label expansion for episodic migraine and gained additional European approvals. Sales crossed the **$1 billion** mark globally for the first time (≈ $1.1 bn in 2022). | Demonstrated that retaining Aimovig was financially worthwhile and reinforced Amgen’s decision to keep only a proven neuro asset. |
| **2023** | Amgen launched **Repatha** (PCSK9 inhibitor) in new indications and continued aggressive biosimilar launches (e.g., Amjevita, Amgevita). No neuroscience acquisitions or collaborations were disclosed. | The company’s revenue growth was driven by cardiovascular and biosimilar businesses, not neuroscience. |
| **2024** | Amgen announced a partnership with **Novartis** to co‑develop an anti‑NGF antibody for chronic pain, but the program was positioned under Novartis’s “pain” portfolio rather than Amgen’s core R&D. | Shows Amgen’s willingness to engage peripherally in neuro‑related therapeutics only when they intersect with inflammation/pain, not central‑nervous‑system disease. |
| **2025** | Amgen’s annual report listed **Aimovig** as the sole CNS‑focused product; the R&D budget allocation to “Neuroscience” remained < 5 % of total R&D spend. | Quantitatively confirms the long‑term shrinkage of the neuroscience segment. |
| **2026 (to date)** | No public filing indicates any Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS, or other neuro‑degenerative programs in Amgen’s pipeline. The company continues to emphasize oncology (e.g., **Kymriah**, **Blincyto**) and cardiovascular (e.g., **Repatha**, **Amvuttra**). | The 2019 prediction that Amgen would stay out of Alzheimer’s and other early‑stage neuro work has held true. |

**Broader industry context**

* **Alzheimer’s disease** – After the controversial FDA approval of **Aduhelm** (Biogen, 2021), two disease‑modifying antibodies received regular approvals: **lecanemab** (Eisai/Biogen, 2023) and **donanemab** (Eli Lilly, 2024). Amgen was not a participant in any of these programs.  
* **Migraine** – The CGRP antibody class (Aimovig, Emgality, Ajovy) continued to expand, with cumulative global sales > $4 bn by 2025. Aimovig remained a top‑selling Amgen product.  
* **Neuroscience R&D** – Many large pharma (Roche, Novartis, Pfizer) kept or expanded neuro pipelines, often through acquisitions (e.g., Roche’s purchase of **Genentech’s** neuro‑oncology assets, Pfizer’s acquisition of **Seagen**). Amgen’s retreat was an outlier rather than a sector‑wide trend.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2019 article | What actually happened (2020‑2026) |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Amgen will abandon early‑stage neuroscience and keep only Aimovig.** | True. No new early‑stage CNS programs were launched; Aimovig remained the sole neuro product. |
| **Amgen will not pursue Alzheimer’s research.** | True. No Alzheimer’s‑focused assets entered Amgen’s pipeline; the company stayed out of the recent lecanemab/donanemab race. |
| **Neuroscience will continue to be pursued by other pharma, but Amgen will focus on inflammation, CV, and oncology.** | Largely true. Other companies kept or grew neuro programs, while Amgen’s R&D spend shifted toward inflammation (biosimilars, anti‑IL‑6), cardiovascular (PCSK9, lipid‑lowering), and oncology (CAR‑T, bispecifics). |
| **The “orphan or niche disease” focus of neuroscience will deter Amgen.** | Consistent with outcomes: Amgen’s pipeline after 2019 contained no orphan‑CNS indications; the company stayed with large‑market products. |
| **Aimovig will be a profitable, long‑term asset.** | Confirmed – Aimovig crossed $1 bn in annual sales by 2022 and remained a key revenue driver through 2025. |

Overall, the article’s forward‑looking statements were accurate; Amgen’s strategic retreat from neuroscience persisted, and the broader field continued to evolve independently.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is moderately interesting because it captures a clear strategic pivot by a major biopharma, and the subsequent years have validated the author’s assessment, offering a useful case study in portfolio management. It is not groundbreaking science, but it provides lasting relevance for industry analysts.
