# Going After Ebola (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2018 Oxford University study that investigated how various approved drugs—including ibuprofen, toremifene, benzatropine, bepridil, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)—showed activity against Ebola virus infection. These compounds, despite having diverse mechanisms and structures as their primary indications, all bound to the Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GP) at the same binding pocket, though each formed different interactions within that site. The binding was relatively weak (micromolar range) and primarily hydrophobic, with no hydrogen bonding observed. Critically, the compounds demonstrated functional relevance: bepridil provided 100% protection in mouse models, while sertraline achieved 70% protection. The antiviral efficacy correlated well with thermal shift assay data, suggesting that destabilizing the GP's conformation was the mechanism of action. The study presented a promising path for drug development, offering a well-validated target, relevant biophysical assays, and X-ray crystallographic data to guide the design of optimized EBOV GP inhibitors.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2018 publication, the landscape of Ebola therapeutics evolved significantly, particularly through 2018–2020.

**Treatment Success and Failures:**
The most impactful subsequent development was the approval and real-world success of monoclonal antibody therapies. In 2019–2020, clinical trials (PALM trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo) demonstrated that two monoclonal antibody regimens—Inmazeb (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab) and Ebanga (ansuvimab)—were highly effective, reducing mortality from ~50–70% to approximately 30–35%. Inmazeb received FDA approval in October 2020, followed by Ebanga in December 2020. These therapies became the standard of care, not the small-molecule candidates.

**Small-Molecule Follow-Up:**
The promising small-molecule candidates mentioned in the 2018 article (like bepridil and sertraline), while scientifically interesting, did **not** directly translate into approved drugs or become widely adopted for Ebola treatment:
- **Bepridil:** Withdrawn from many markets due to cardiovascular risks (including QT prolongation and arrhythmias). It was not repurposed for Ebola.
- **Sertraline/Paroxetine:** Remained exclusively as antidepressants. Any potential Ebola-related development would have been impractical given their weak binding (micromolar) and the established superior efficacy and rapid deployment of antibody therapies in outbreaks.
- **Repurposing Difficulties:** The Ebola research community learned that while phenotypic screens identified hits, relatively non-potent, micromolar-level binding was insufficient for clinical translation, especially against a rapidly progressing and highly lethal virus.

**Clinical and Regulatory Trajectory:**
The success of Inmazeb and Ebanga effectively de-prioritized small-molecule Ebola drug development in favor of biomolecular approaches. The urgency of the 2018–2020 DRC outbreak accelerated trials and approvals for these antibody treatments, leaving less practical room for optimizing older drugs with weaker binding. No small-molecule drugs were FDA-approved specifically for Ebola virus disease.

**Business and Policy Impact:**
- **Business:** Regeneron (Inmazeb) and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics (Ebanga) benefited directly from Ebola therapeutic development. Interest and funding likely shifted away from repurposing candidates like bepridil.
- **Policy:** Emergency response protocols increasingly focus on rapid antibody deployment and ring vaccination (using the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, approved by FDA in 2019) rather than small-molecule options.
- **Scientific Community:** The research did highlight EBOV GP as a viable target (what the article correctly foresaw), but the conclusion was that high-affinity monoclonal antibodies were superior to low-affinity small-molecule hits.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"You'd have to think that an optimized EBOV GP binder could be very effective indeed, and this paper points the way to assembling such compounds."**
  - **Outcome:** While EBOV GP remained a verified target, effective "optimized" small-molecule EBOV GP binders did not materialize into clinical products or widespread therapeutic use. Instead, the "optimized EBOV GP binder" role was filled by highly potent monoclonal antibodies (Inmazeb and Ebanga), which dramatically reduced mortality. The structural insights from the 2018 study did not lead to small-molecule drugs with the predicted clinical effectiveness.

- **Implicit hope for repurposing existing drugs (e.g., bepridil, sertraline):**
  - **Outcome:** These specific candidates were **not** successfully repurposed. Bepridil remained off the market for its original indication, while sertraline stayed an antidepressant. Clinical pathways for these drugs against Ebola were not pursued, as the antibody therapies proved markedly superior in efficacy and speed to clinical success.

- **Prediction about fragment-based drug discovery approaches and leveraging X-ray structures:**
  - **Outcome:** Although this provided valuable academic insights, it did not lead to practical development. The urgency of Ebola outbreaks demanded therapies with established potency and safety profiles, for which antibodies already excelled, rather than initiating a long med-chem optimization journey from weak fragment-like leads.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captured scientifically important (but ultimately non-translational) early-stage Ebola drug discovery work. It correctly identified EBOV GP as a high-value target and highlighted the potential for repurposing, yet the follow-up landscape showed that alternative modalities (monoclonal antibodies) proved overwhelmingly superior, making the 2018 findings an academic insight rather than a practical therapeutic pathway.
