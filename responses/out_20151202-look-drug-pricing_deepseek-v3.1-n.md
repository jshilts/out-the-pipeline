# A Look At Drug Pricing (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the Wall Street Journal's examination of prescription drug pricing disparities between the United States and other countries like Canada, England, and Norway. The piece argues that higher U.S. drug prices essentially subsidize lower prices in other countries, as pharmaceutical companies accept reduced profits elsewhere because they can charge more in the largest single market. The article explains this system as a fundamental driver of the entire pharmaceutical industry ecosystem, including R&D funding, startup incentives, and acquisition dynamics. The author advocates for maintaining pricing power for innovative companies that take risks in drug discovery while expressing concern about companies that artificially inflate prices of generic drugs after patent expiration.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2015 article saw significant developments that both validated and challenged its framework:

**Continued Price Inflation**: Drug pricing remained a contentious issue, with prices for many established drugs continuing to rise substantially. The years 2016-2018 saw particularly aggressive price increases across both brand-name and generic drugs.

**Sociopolitical Response**: Public outcry over drug pricing intensified, leading to numerous congressional hearings and investigations. The Martin Shkreli/Turing Pharmaceuticals scandal became emblematic of the issues the article warned about with generic drug price manipulation.

**Regulatory and Legislative Attempts**: Various policy proposals emerged, though comprehensive reform proved elusive. Attempts to allow Medicare negotiation failed to gain sufficient political traction. The Trump administration's drug pricing proposals (2018-2020) had limited implementation success. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 eventually granted Medicare limited price negotiation authority for select drugs, representing a partial shift toward the Norwegian model.

**Industry Pattern Changes**: The pharmaceutical industry's R&D productivity challenges continued, with high drug development costs persisting. Some blockbuster drugs maintained high prices while facing increasing scrutiny. Patent cliff strategies remained central to major pharmaceutical companies' business models.

**International Developments**: Other countries continued their cost-effectiveness approach to drug assessment and price negotiation, while U.S. prices remained significantly higher than global averages throughout this decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article included several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Medicare negotiation would face resistance**: Accurate. Despite numerous proposals, substantial Medicare negotiation authority wasn't passed until 2022 and faced significant industry opposition.

• **System collapse risk from generic price manipulation**: Partially validated. While the overall system didn't collapse, generic price manipulation became a major scandal and policy focal point, though structural change was less dramatic than implied.

• **International price dynamics would remain tied to U.S. prices**: Continued through 2015-2022, though with gradual erosion of the price disparity.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article provides valuable insight into drug pricing mechanics, serving as a foundation for understanding subsequent political debates and policy evolution around pharmaceutical costs. Its identification of the international pricing dynamic and warnings about generic price manipulation proved prescient and relevant to major policy conversations.

---

**Overall Assessment**: The article successfully diagnosed key structural elements of U.S. drug pricing that remained central to policy debates for years afterward. Many of the core arguments about industry incentives and international price relationships held true, though actual policy changes occurred more slowly than predicted developments might have suggested.
