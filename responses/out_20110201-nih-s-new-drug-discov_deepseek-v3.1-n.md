# The NIH's New Drug Discovery Center: Heading Into the Swamp? (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary critiques the NIH's newly announced National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), expressing skepticism about its gene-centric approach to drug discovery under Francis Collins' leadership. The author questions whether the government can succeed where the pharmaceutical industry had already spent tens of billions of dollars on genetic research with limited therapeutic success.

The article highlights concerns about focusing on mental health drug discovery—a field with poor track records where major discoveries (lithium, Thorazine) were accidents, and where scientists still don't understand mechanisms of action. The author suggests alternative approaches, such as developing better phenotypic assays in realistic disease models rather than chasing individual genetic targets, but expresses doubt that this will happen. The piece concludes with a pessimistic prediction that the federal effort will add little to what private industry already failed to accomplish.

## 2. HISTORY

**NCATS Development and Outcomes**  
NCATS was officially established in December 2011 (months after the article) through the consolidation of NIH programs. It received $575 million in initial funding. Rather than becoming a direct drug discovery engine, NCATS has primarily functioned as a translational research facilitator, launching several signature initiatives:

- **Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program**: Continued funding academic medical centers for translational research infrastructure
- **Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND)**: Launched in 2009, incorporated into NCATS, focused on rare disease drug development
- **NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection**: A library of small molecules for screening
- **Tissue Chip Program**: 3D human tissue models for drug testing

**Drug Development Outcomes to Date**  
While NCATS has advanced many compounds through preclinical development, only a handful have reached commercialization. The most notable success involves **Spinraza**, a spinal muscular atrophy drug developed with academic partners that reached market. However, most NCATS partnerships remained in early development phases through the 2010s.

**Gene-Centric Drug Discovery Trends**  
The skepticism about purely genetic approaches proved well-founded. Throughout the 2010s, industry increasingly shifted toward phenotypic drug discovery and multi-target approaches, particularly for CNS disorders. Most major pharmaceutical companies had already reduced or eliminated psychiatric drug discovery programs by the mid-2010s.

**FDA Drug Approvals Context**  
During the 2011-2020 period, CNS drug approvals remained challenging. Novel psychiatric drugs were rare—most approvals represented incremental changes to existing mechanisms rather than breakthrough innovations based on genetic insights. For example, the late 2010s saw approvals of esketamine for depression and brexanolone for postpartum depression, but these built on existing knowledge rather than emerging from genomics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: The NIH center focused on genetic target-based discovery would add "very little more" given industry's previous failures**

- **Assessment**: **Mostly accurate**. NCATS has contributed infrastructure and rare disease research but failed to revolutionize drug discovery or validate the gene-to-target paradigm for complex diseases
- **Evidence**: Very few drugs developed under NCATS reached approval, and CNS drug discovery outcomes remained poor throughout the decade

**Implicit prediction: Genetic reductionism would continue to struggle in drug discovery**

- **Assessment**: **Accurate**. The 2010s saw continued challenges translating GWAS findings into drugs across most complex diseases
- **Evidence**: By 2020, many companies had shifted emphasis from single-gene targets to pathway-based and phenotypic approaches for complex diseases

**Implicit prediction: Alternative approaches (like phenotypic assays) would be more valuable**

- **Assessment**: **Accurate**. Industry and academic trends during the 2010s increasingly emphasized phenotypic screening, organoid models, and more physiologically relevant systems
- **Evidence**: Major pharma companies like Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche increased investment in phenotypic drug discovery platforms during this period

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article was prescient in recognizing fundamental problems with the gene-centric drug discovery paradigm that would persist throughout the decade. The critique accurately anticipated the challenges NCATS would face and identified alternative approaches that gained traction.
