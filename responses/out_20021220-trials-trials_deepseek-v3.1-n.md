# Trials of Trials (December 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses why drug trials comparing therapies head-to-head (e.g., different hypertension drugs) are rare despite their scientific and clinical value. The author distinguishes levels of testing: Phase I/II trials typically answer "Is Drug A safe and effective versus placebo?" while FDA approval rarely requires testing against existing active treatments or comparing mechanisms of action. Pharmaceutical companies often avoid head-to-head trials because the risk is high—failing to show superiority or revealing safety problems versus existing therapies can kill a drug's market potential. The author cites Bristol-Myers Squibb's Vanlev (omepatrilat), which failed against Vasotec (enalapril) and never reached market, taking the entire ACE/neutral endopeptidase inhibitor class with it. The piece argues for an NIH-led model (like the ALLHAT hypertension study) to conduct mechanism-comparison trials, as individual companies face too much business risk to volunteer for what amounts to an "all or nothing" game.

## 2. HISTORY

**Vanlev (omepatrilat):** Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued development in 2002 after the OCTAVE trial showed significantly higher rates of angioedema (a serious swelling reaction) versus enalapril. No ACE/NEP inhibitor has been FDA-approved for hypertension since, and the mechanism largely abandoned in this indication.

**ALLHAT Study (published 2002):** The *Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial* demonstrated that older, cheaper diuretics were as effective as newer ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers for most hypertensive patients. The findings led to updated hypertension guidelines and shifted prescribing patterns toward diuretics as first-line therapy, saving costs without compromising outcomes.

**FDA Policy Evolution:** Over the next two decades, head-to-head trials became more common, though mainly in areas with multiple approved options and strong payer pressure. Comparative effectiveness research gained institutional support, culminating in the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), established under the Affordable Care Act (2010), which funds comparative studies not tied to specific industry marketing goals.

**Industry Practice Changes:** Many companies still avoid high-risk head-to-head trials unless required or when confident of superiority. However, regulators and payers increasingly demand comparative data for reimbursement, especially for expensive new drugs. The landscape now includes more post-marketing comparative studies driven by health economics and payer demands rather than voluntary scientific inquiry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• "We're going to be seeing more and more FDA requests for these sorts of trials, which will definitely make life harder for drug development, but in a good cause."**
- **Outcome:** Mixed. FDA did increase requests for head-to-head data in certain contexts (e.g., diabetes drugs), but placebo-controlled trials remain common. The shift was driven more by payer demands and health technology assessments than FDA mandates. Hardships increased for manufacturers, but this has not consistently ensured superior treatments reach patients.

**• "Vanlev's never going to see the light of day, and neither is any other ACE/neutral endopeptidase inhibitor combination."**
- **Outcome:** Correct. Vanlev was discontinued, and no ACE/NEP inhibitor gained FDA approval for hypertension. A few ACE/NEP candidates were explored in other indications (e.g., heart failure) but failed to gain traction due to the angioedema risk profile.

**• "It'll be interesting to see if they get a general mandate (and funding) to do just that" (referring to NIH-led mechanism-comparison trials).**
- **Outcome:** Partial. While PCORI and other initiatives emerged to fund comparative effectiveness research, the scale and mandate never matched the author's suggestion. NIH funding grew for pragmatic trials, but the model remains supplementary rather than a comprehensive replacement for company-driven studies.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article identified meaningful structural flaws in pharmaceutical research incentives and predicted trends in comparative trial demand fairly accurately, yet its core proposal (NIH-driven mechanism trials) only partially materialized.
