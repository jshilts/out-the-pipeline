# Software Eats the World, But Biology Eats It (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary analyzes a Bruce Booth post about computational drug discovery, referencing his article "Four Decades of Hacking Biotech and Yet Biology Still Consumes Everything." The author agrees with Booth's thesis that despite decades of promises from computer-aided drug design (CADD), biology remains the dominant and often confounding factor in drug development. The article opens with a 1981 Discover magazine quote predicting that computers would revolutionize drug discovery by making it more rational and efficient—a promise the author notes still hadn't been fulfilled after 35+ years.

The author acknowledges that computational techniques are helpful and used in virtually every project, but they haven't delivered the transformative impact originally envisioned. Biology "overrules everything," and computational models cannot yet reliably predict which approaches will succeed. Several case examples illustrate this reality: ZAP70 kinase targeted since the mid-1990s with no approved drugs; MAPK/p38 programs with dozens of publications but a clinical "graveyard"; and renin inhibition programs that faced Phase III failures despite promising computational work.

Key recommendations emphasize integrating computational teams closely with chemists and biologists, avoiding overconfidence in ruling out compounds, and maintaining empirical validation through actual compound synthesis. The author warns against hype, particularly from Silicon Valley investors who may not appreciate biology's complexity, while acknowledging that computational methods continue advancing—just more slowly than predicted and not yet at the level needed for transformative impact.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2017, the biotech landscape has seen both continued challenges and notable advances in computational drug discovery, though biology's complexity remains a persistent theme.

**AI/ML in Drug Discovery Evolution**: Between 2017-2024, AI and machine learning have gained significant traction in pharmaceutical R&D. Major companies like DeepMind made groundbreaking advances with AlphaFold (2020-2021), solving protein folding problems that eluded scientists for decades. While this represented a computational triumph, translating these structural predictions into actual drugs has proven more challenging. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted AI tools for target identification, lead optimization, and clinical trial design, though the promised transformation of drug discovery timelines has remained elusive.

**Clinical Outcomes**: The fundamental challenge of high drug discovery failure rates persists, though with some notable successes. The 1-in-8,000 success rate cited in the original article (from 1981) has improved, with better screening and computational tools, yet clinical failure rates remain high. Between 2017-2024, computational approaches contributed to some FDA approvals, particularly in oncology and rare diseases, but the field has not seen the wholesale disruption once predicted.

**Target Validation**: The examples cited in 2017 illustrate ongoing challenges. ZAP70 inhibitors have remained elusive through 2024, with the target still being explored but no approved therapies. MAPK pathway inhibitors have seen mixed success—while some BRAF and MEK inhibitors achieved approval for specific cancers, p38 inhibitors specifically have largely failed in clinical development, confirming the article's assessment. The broader lesson about target biology trumping computational predictions has become clearer with time.

**Business Impact**: Venture investment in computational drug discovery grew significantly post-2017, with companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, and BenevolentAI raising substantial funding. However, by 2023-2024, some of these companies faced valuation pressures and struggled to demonstrate clear clinical superiority over traditional methods. While computational techniques are now standard in drug discovery, they typically supplement rather than replace experimental approaches.

**Public Policy and Regulatory**: FDA has increasingly engaged with AI/ML in drug development, issuing guidance documents and creating frameworks for AI-based submissions. However, regulatory acceptance has been cautious, focusing on validation and interpretability, reflecting continued concerns about over-reliance on computational predictions without adequate empirical evidence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Computational models would continue advancing but not deliver transformative disruption**: ✅ **Accurate**. Post-2017 developments showed steady but gradual improvements in computational tools (AlphaFold, better ML algorithms, larger datasets), but biology's complexity continued to dominate drug discovery outcomes. The field advanced incrementally rather than through revolutionary change.

- **Silicon Valley hype about biology would face reality checks**: ✅ **Accurate**. The 2017 warning about Silicon Valley "particularly vulnerable... because they don't know what biology is like" proved prescient. High-profile collaborations between tech companies and pharma produced mixed results, and by 2022-2024, some computational drug discovery companies faced valuation corrections and scrutiny about clinical evidence.

- **Integration between computational and experimental teams as crucial**: ⚠️ **Partially validated**. The pharmaceutical industry has moved toward greater integration of computational and experimental approaches, with more collaborative models becoming standard. However, the degree of integration varies significantly between organizations, and many still struggle to balance computational predictions with biological reality effectively.

- **Biology would continue "consuming everything"**: ✅ **Accurate**. Biological complexity has remained the dominant factor in drug discovery outcomes. Even with advanced AI/ML tools (2020-2024), unexpected biological mechanisms, side effects, and clinical trial failures have persisted, confirming that computational predictions alone cannot overcome fundamental biological uncertainties.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article demonstrates strong analytical insight and accurately identifies key tensions in computational drug discovery that remain highly relevant. While focused on biology and computing, its fundamental points about how complexity and uncertainty differ across domains directly connect to AI's broader challenges—when we can simulate with high fidelity versus when reality (biological or otherwise) resists reductionist modeling.
