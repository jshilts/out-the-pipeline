# Ariad in Limbo (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary notes that Ariad Pharmaceuticals has put on hold its planned move to a new headquarters in Kendall Square, Cambridge. The author passes the construction site frequently and observes that Cambridge is full of ongoing construction, implying the space would likely find another tenant if Ariad withdrew. The piece references a Boston Globe article for details and presents the halted move as an expected development given Ariad's "recent trouble."

## 2. HISTORY
Ariad's difficulties in late 2013 stemmed primarily from safety concerns with their leukemia drug Iclusig (ponatinib). In October 2013, the FDA requested that Ariad suspend marketing and enrollment in clinical trials due to serious blood-clot side effects. The company's stock plummeted, leading to layoffs and austerity measures including the paused headquarters move.

Following this crisis, Ariad worked with regulators and returned Iclusig to the market with a narrower indication and a black-box warning for specific patient populations. In 2017, Ariad was acquired by Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda for approximately $5.2 billion, effectively ending its existence as an independent company. The acquisition reflected Iclusig's continued importance as a treatment for certain forms of leukemia despite safety limitations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain specific predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical development. Rather, it made a passing observation that "someone else will find a use for the space" if Ariad backed out, which was essentially a commentary on Cambridge's robust real estate market rather than a biotech prediction.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
This amounts to a real-estate footnote about a company's temporary headquarters delay, with minimal technical depth or broader industry significance.
