# Reciprocal Approval of Drugs, According to Ted Cruz and Mike Lee (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines a 2015 bill introduced by Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee called the RESULT Act, which proposed reciprocal drug approval between the US and other developed countries. Under this legislation, any drug, device, or biologic approved in countries like those in the EU, Canada, Japan, Israel, or Australia would automatically receive FDA approval, provided it addresses an unmet medical need and isn't already banned by the FDA. The piece analyzes whether there's actually a significant number of effective drugs available abroad but not in the US, questioning whether the historical "drug lag" problem (where the US was more cautious than Europe in the 1960s-1970s) still persists. The author notes that contemporary data suggests the FDA actually approves most new drugs faster than the European Medicines Agency, with 87 of 100 recent priority review drugs being approved first by the FDA. The article also criticizes several provisions of the Cruz/Lee bill, including a 30-day approval deadline and especially a Congressional override provision that would allow Congress to reverse FDA denials of "life-saving" drugs via joint resolution, which the author calls "a flat-out moral hazard."

## 2. HISTORY

**Legislative Outcome**: The Cruz/Lee RESULT Act never became law. No reciprocal drug approval bill has been enacted in the US since 2015.

**Broader Context (2015-2024)**: The fundamental asymmetry has persisted—the US generally has higher drug prices, while other developed countries often get new drugs later. For example, from 2011-2018, the FDA's median approval time remained faster than the EMA's on average, and the US continued to approve drugs before Europe for the vast majority of innovative medicines. However, several drugs approved abroad still took years to reach the US market, and the issue became more complicated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines and treatments were authorized and approved through emergency pathways on similar timelines globally.

**Concrete Policy Developments**: 
- The FDA has expanded priority review pathways and user fee programs (PDUFA) with accelerated timelines, but the core approval framework has remained intact.
- The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and related initiatives have streamlined some FDA processes, though these focused on domestic development, not reciprocity.
- No country has implemented wholesale reciprocal acceptance of another regulator's drug approvals, although some regulatory cooperation agreements exist (e.g., FDA and EMA collaborate on orphan drug reviews, but each still decides independently).
- In medical devices, where regulatory divergence is greater than for drugs, the EU significantly reformed its device regulations following scandals, arguably moving closer to FDA standards—the opposite of mutual recognition.

**Business Impact**: Clinical and regulatory strategies continue to prioritize FDA approval first, with most US and global companies submitting new drug applications to the FDA before or simultaneously with EMA submissions. No major industry shift occurred toward "regulatory forum shopping" for reciprocal access to the US market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions identified in the article and their outcomes:**

- **Prediction**: The author predicted that "...this reciprocity idea...doesn't seem to me to be accurate...there are some potential unintended consequences that need to be thought about as well."
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated. The bill failed, and reciprocity was not adopted. However, the author's specific concern about a "race to the bottom" did not materialize because the policy was never implemented.

- **Prediction**: The author worried the Congressional override provision "...would instantly make things worse...invites - encourages - political grandstanding."
  - **Outcome**: Unable to assess. Since the bill was not enacted, this risk was never tested. Political pressure has indeed grown (e.g., advocacy for right-to-try laws and expanded access programs), but no direct Congressional override mechanism exists for FDA decisions.

- **Prediction**: The article suggested Japan's less stringent efficacy standards might be "one potential problem" for reciprocity.
  - **Outcome**: Never tested due to bill failure, but interest in Japan-approved drugs (and broader foreign approvals) for US use has remained very limited. No wave of advocacy emerged for reciprocal approval of Japanese drugs, nor were significant efficacy gaps identified as major safety or efficacy problems.

- **Prediction**: The author stated, "...I don't see a big wave of non-FDA-approved drugs out there that will finally wash over us if a reciprocity bill is passed."
  - **Outcome**: Essentially validated by subsequent history. Despite ongoing instances where drugs are approved abroad before the US, the overall number has remained small and focused on niche indications, and there's been no major push for reciprocal acceptance to fill unmet needs.

## 4. INTEREST

Score: 7

This article addresses a recurring policy debate about FDA drug approval timing and international regulatory cooperation, offering clear historical context and concrete data from the 2004-2013 period. While legislative efforts have repeatedly returned to reciprocity themes in various forms (though not Cruz/Lee's specific bill), the core issue remains current for policymakers and the biopharmaceutical industry.
