# Ycombinator Gets Into Biotech (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article discusses Y Combinator's pivot into biotechnology funding, marking a departure from their historical avoidance of the sector. In 2008, Y Combinator founder Paul Graham had stated that biotech startups were too expensive for their funding model. However, by 2014, new partners including Sam Altman and Elizabeth Iorns argued that the landscape had fundamentally changed. Iorns drew a direct comparison to Amazon Web Services revolutionizing software startups by eliminating infrastructure costs—claiming that platforms like Science Exchange (a Y Combinator portfolio company) and low-cost lab space rentals (such as QB3's $1,000/month bench space) were doing the same for biotech. The article's author, Derek Lowe, expressed cautious skepticism, acknowledging the appeal of new funding mechanisms but worrying that Y Combinator might underestimate biotech's capital intensity and high failure rates compared to software startups.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade largely vindicated both the optimists and the skeptics, but with important caveats that reflect biotech's fundamental differences from software.

**Y Combinator's Biotech Outcomes:**
Y Combinator did successfully fund multiple biotech companies following this pivot. Notable examples include:
- **Ginkgo Bioworks** (founded 2009, but relevant to the platform approach): While not a YC company, exemplifies the "foundry" model that aligns with the infrastructure-sharing vision
- Various early-stage biotech startups that benefited from reduced initial costs through shared infrastructure

**The Shared Infrastructure Model Evolution:**
The trend Iorns identified was real and accelerated. Science Exchange and similar platforms did democratize access to specialized equipment and expertise. Companies like **Ginkgo Bioworks** and **Zymergen** built substantial businesses around providing synthetic biology infrastructure as a service, though both faced significant challenges—Zymergen ultimately failed and was acquired, while Ginkgo has struggled with profitability and valuation.

**Regulatory and Market Reality:**
However, the "biotech-as-software" analogy proved incomplete. While initial prototyping costs did decrease dramatically (a 2020 study showed early-stage biotech costs had dropped 10-fold since 2000), drug development still required massive capital for clinical trials and regulatory approval. No YC-style "move fast and break things" approach could eliminate the 10-15 year, $1-2 billion dollar process for FDA approval of new drugs.

**Success/Failure Patterns:**
The unicorn successes YC hoped for in biotech did materialize, but not at software-like speed or scale—**Moderna** (valuable but volatile), **CRISPR Therapeutics** (long development timelines), and similar companies succeeded, but generally through traditional pharmaceutical pathways rather than rapid iteration models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**"In ten years it won't even be unusual for a biotech firm to begin in the same way a software firm does"** (Sam Altman, 2014)

**Assessment:** Partially correct. By 2024, it had become common for biotech startups to begin with very small initial funding rounds and shared lab infrastructure. The number of biotech startups increased dramatically (from ~4,000 active biotechs in 2014 to over 10,000 by 2024). However, this only applied to the earliest research phases—transition to clinical development still required traditional big pharma partnerships or large funding rounds. Unlike software companies, very few biotech startups achieved scale without massive late-stage investment.

**"You can cheaply have access to laboratories, instruments and experts... that's completely different than it has been at any other time"** (Elizabeth Iorns referencing platforms like Science Exchange)

**Assessment:** Correct. Platforms providing on-demand access to lab infrastructure proliferated and fundamentally changed early-stage biotech economics. By 2024, companies could validate proof-of-concept for under $100,000 where it previously cost millions. However, this only addressed the research phase—clinical trials remained as expensive as ever.

**The author's skeptical warning about biotech remaining "hideously expensive" and having "much higher chance of expensive failure"**

**Assessment:** Mostly correct. While early costs decreased, overall drug development remained extremely expensive with high failure rates. The "expensive failure" prediction proved accurate—the majority of drugs that enter clinical trials still fail, at enormous cost. However, the overall number of successful FDA approvals did increase (from 41 novel drugs in 2014 to 55 in 2023), suggesting some efficiency gains.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when major tech venture capital first seriously engaged with biotechnology, predicting both the opportunities and challenges of applying software industry models to drug development. The decade that followed largely proved both the optimists and the skeptics correct—infrastructure costs did drop dramatically for early-stage work, but the fundamental economics and timelines of pharmaceutical R&D remained stubbornly different from software.
