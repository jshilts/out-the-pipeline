# Amgen Cuts Hard (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This July 2014 commentary describes Amgen's announcement of major layoffs—over 2,500 jobs—and the complete shutdown of its large facilities in Washington state and Colorado. Paradoxically, Amgen's stock rose nearly 7% in a single day following the news, adding approximately $5 billion in market capitalization and reaching an all-time high.

The article frames this as emblematic of the biotechnology industry's priorities at the time, where shareholder pressure focused on cost-cutting and consolidation. While Amgen was closing facilities in some regions, it was simultaneously expanding its research presence in biotech hubs like Boston/Cambridge and the San Francisco Bay Area, aligning with industry consolidation trends in those locations.

The piece highlights analyst Geoffrey Porges' critical assessment of Amgen's R&D strategy: over the previous decade, the company had spent roughly $30 billion on R&D while generating only $15 billion in revenue from resulting drugs—a poor return on investment. Porges characterized Amgen's pipeline as excessively risky, with 80% consisting of "breakthrough" assets featuring unproven targets and unknown safety profiles. He argued this high-risk approach led to below-average returns and suggested restructuring the company to separate cash-cow legacy drugs from innovative but risky programs, claiming this would increase combined market value.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 restructuring, Amgen's subsequent developments reveal a more nuanced outcome:

**Regulatory success:** Repatha (evolocumab), one of Amgen's "breakthrough" pipeline assets mentioned in the 2014 era, received FDA approval in August 2015 for treating high cholesterol. However, its market uptake was initially slow due to payer restrictions, and the pricing/reimbursement challenges highlighted that scientific innovation alone doesn't guarantee commercial success.

**Biosimilars expansion:** Amgen significantly increased its biosimilars portfolio after 2014, launching biosimilar versions of established biologics like Avastin, Herceptin, and Humira. This balanced strategy leveraged Amgen's manufacturing expertise while providing less risky revenue streams than novel breakthrough drugs.

**Continued innovation:** The company maintained its commitment to innovative targets, but with improved financial performance. The restructuring ultimately succeeded in increasing efficiency—by 2019, Amgen was generating higher margins while continuing to advance its pipeline.

**2015 peak correction:** While the article noted an "all-time high" stock price following the layoffs, broader market volatility affected the biotech sector in 2015-2016, demonstrating that cost-cutting measures provide only temporary boosts without sustained operational improvement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Porges' prediction of restructuring creating more value:** While Amgen didn't fully split into the two companies he proposed, the 2014 restructuring did enhance shareholder value longer-term through improved operational efficiency. However, the idea of separating legacy drugs from risky R&D ventures didn't materialize as suggested, and Amgen maintained an integrated model.

**The architectural shift toward biotech hubs:** The trend toward concentration in Boston/Cambridge and San Francisco Bay Area has indeed continued and intensified since 2014, validating the observation that the industry was consolidating research in these hubs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an interesting moment demonstrating the tensions between innovation investment and shareholder pressure for returns, with a moderately insightful analyst perspective, though the broader themes are more noteworthy than the specific layoff announcement itself.
