# The Big Problems (December 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog addresses the recent protein folding news (likely AlphaFold2's breakthrough in late 2020) and puts it in context of drug discovery's fundamental challenges. The author argues that while improvements in protein structure prediction are welcome, they don't solve the "big problems" that cause most drug failures.

The article identifies three core difficulties: (1) **Wrong target selection** - many compounds fail in human trials because basic understanding of disease biology is insufficient (citing Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, depression, chronic pain, septic shock, and fibrosis as examples where disease mechanisms remain unclear); (2) **Inadequate disease models** - animal models often don't translate to humans (e.g., humans are the only species that gets Alzheimer's, pain compounds working in animals but failing in humans); and (3) **Insufficient toxicity prediction** - unexpected toxic effects derail many promising drugs, and current animal toxicity models don't fully capture human responses. The author emphasizes that even perfect medicinal chemistry can't overcome choosing the wrong biological target, making target validation and disease understanding the rate-limiting factors rather than drug optimization capabilities.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication, the biopharmaceutical landscape has largely validated the author's concerns while also showing some progress in addressing these challenges:

**Target Validation and Disease Understanding:**
- Alzheimer's disease continued its pattern of high-profile failures. The controversial 2021 FDA approval of Aduhelm (aducanumab) based on amyloid hypothesis showed the field's continued struggle - the drug had questionable efficacy and saw extremely limited patient uptake. By 2023, another anti-amyloid drug (lecanemab) showed modest cognitive benefit but with significant safety concerns. The fundamental uncertainty about amyloid's role that the article highlighted remains largely unresolved.
- Parkinson's disease research continued to focus on alpha-synuclein aggregation, but multiple clinical trials targeting this pathway failed or showed minimal benefit, confirming the article's point about uncertain disease mechanisms.
- Depression research saw some shift toward rapid-acting antidepressants (ketamine/esketamine) rather than traditional monoamine-based approaches, suggesting recognition that decades of targeting serotonin/norepinephrine systems had limited therapeutic advancement.
- Chronic pain research continued to struggle with translation from animal models to humans.

**Model Systems and Translation:**
- Organoid and organ-on-a-chip technologies gained traction as better human-relevant models, though widespread adoption in pharma decision-making remained limited.
- The industry increasingly recognized the poor predictivity of animal models, with some companies developing more sophisticated human cell-based assay systems.

**Toxicity Prediction:**
- AI/machine learning approaches for toxicity prediction proliferated, but definitive improvements in clinical success rates remained elusive.
- Several high-profile drug failures due to unexpected toxicity continued (e.g., various COVID-19 therapeutic candidates, oncology drugs with off-target effects).

The fundamental dynamics described - where target selection and disease understanding remain the primary bottlenecks rather than compound optimization - largely persisted through 2021-2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions and assessments were remarkably prescient:

• **Prediction**: Protein folding improvements (AlphaFold) would not solve drug discovery's fundamental problems because the bottlenecks are target selection and disease biology understanding, not structure prediction.  
**Reality**: **Accurate**. AlphaFold2's 2021 release revolutionized structural biology research and facilitated target identification for known proteins, but clinical drug development success rates didn't dramatically improve. The major failures in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, depression, and other areas continued through 2024, confirming that structure prediction alone doesn't address the core challenge of knowing which targets to pursue.

• **Prediction**: Alzheimer's research would continue struggling due to uncertain disease mechanisms and poor animal models.  
**Reality**: **Accurate**. The 2021-2024 period saw continued controversy around amyloid-targeting drugs, with Aduhelm's limited efficacy and safety concerns, and lecanemab showing only modest benefits. The field still lacks consensus on whether amyloid is the right target or merely a downstream marker.

• **Prediction**: Pain research would continue having poor translation from animal models to human trials.  
**Reality**: **Accurate**. The chronic pain therapeutic landscape remained challenging, with few breakthrough treatments and continued recognition that animal pain models don't adequately predict human responses.

• **Prediction**: Better compound optimization techniques would have limited impact if target selection remained flawed.  
**Reality**: **Accurate**. While AI drug discovery tools and computational methods improved dramatically (2021-2024), the fundamental issue remained: companies could design better compounds against targets, but still frequently chose wrong targets or encountered unexpected biology in human trials.

• **Implicit prediction**: No general solution to target validation would emerge quickly.  
**Reality**: **Accurate**. The 2021-2024 period showed continued reliance on empirical human trials to validate targets, with no magical solution emerging to predict which biological interventions would work in complex human diseases.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article was highly prescient in identifying the fundamental bottlenecks that would continue plaguing drug discovery regardless of computational advances. Its clear articulation of the target validation problem and skepticism about technological silver bullets proved accurate through subsequent years of continued clinical failures in the exact disease areas highlighted.
