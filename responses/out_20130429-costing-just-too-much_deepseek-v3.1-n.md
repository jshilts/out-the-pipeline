# Costing Just Too Much (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary addresses escalating cancer drug prices, noting that 11 of 12 cancer drugs approved in 2012 cost over $100,000. The article references Bernard Munos's critique of pharmaceutical industry economics, highlighting the tension between massive R&D spending ($135 billion annually) and poor productivity (only 25-35 new drugs per year). The author argues that the industry's pricing strategy resembles a "Martingale" betting system—continuously raising prices to offset inefficiencies until hitting external limits. Specific examples of R&D waste are cited, including Pfizer demolishing a 750,000-square-foot facility, Lilly abandoning and restarting insulin plant projects, and AstraZeneca closing UK labs while building new facilities. The central argument is that unsustainable pricing combined with inefficient spending practices is creating a reckoning for the industry.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in 2013 proved prescient and intensified over the subsequent decade:

**Pricing Trends**: Drug prices continued climbing dramatically. By 2022-2023, cancer drug launch prices routinely exceeded $200,000-$300,000 annually, with some gene therapies reaching $2-3 million per treatment (e.g., CAR-T therapies, hemophilia gene therapies). The $100,000 "floor" mentioned in 2013 became a baseline rather than ceiling.

**Industry Response and Backlash**: The pricing pressures led to several concrete developments:
- Major policy debates culminated in the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) in the US, which included Medicare drug price negotiation provisions targeting high-cost medications
- Value-based pricing frameworks gained traction, with outcomes-based contracts between manufacturers and payers
- ICER (Institute for Clinical and Economic Review) became increasingly influential in evaluating cost-effectiveness

**R&D Productivity**: The fundamental efficiency problem persisted. Industry R&D spending grew to over $200 billion annually by the early 2020s, while new drug approvals remained relatively flat (typically 40-60 annually). However, breakthrough therapies emerged in areas like immuno-oncology (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), CAR-T cells, and gene therapies, suggesting the high-cost model continued funding important innovations.

**Public and Political Reaction**: The "brewing anger" predicted materialized through widespread patient advocacy campaigns, state-level drug price transparency laws, and ongoing Congressional investigations into pricing practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictive elements, both explicit and implicit:

• **Price ceiling prediction**: The article warned that "there are limits to what we can charge, and we're starting to bang up against them" and that the industry was "badly misjudging the brewing anger."
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While prices continued rising far beyond 2013 levels, significant policy pushback emerged (Medicare negotiation, international reference pricing, state laws). However, the industry largely maintained pricing power through patent protection, orphan drug designations, and demonstrating clinical value.

• **Industry sustainability concerns**: The comparison to a Martingale betting system implied the pricing model would eventually collapse.
  - **Outcome**: Not realized as predicted. While individual companies faced challenges, the industry adapted through portfolio optimization, increased focus on rare diseases with premium pricing, and geographic expansion. Profit margins remained robust.

• **R&D waste continuation**: The examples of facility waste implied ongoing inefficiency.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. The fundamental economics of pharmaceutical R&D remained challenging, with continued high failure rates and expensive infrastructure decisions. However, innovation did accelerate in specific areas (biologics, targeted therapies, cell/gene therapy).

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article scores highly because it correctly identified the unsustainable economic tensions that would define pharmaceutical industry debates for the subsequent decade. It captured a pivotal moment when pricing practices began facing serious scrutiny, correctly predicting both the intensifying backlash and some of the eventual policy responses, while the core efficiency concerns it raised remained central to industry challenges.
