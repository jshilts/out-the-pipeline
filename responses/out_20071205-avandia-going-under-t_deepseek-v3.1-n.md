# Avandia: Going Under for the Third Time?
## 5 December 2007

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses mounting safety concerns around Avandia (rosiglitazone), a Type II diabetes drug, specifically regarding bone fractures. It references experimental work by Ron Evans at Salk showing that PPAR-gamma—the drug's molecular target—regulates the balance between bone formation and resorption.

Evans' tissue-specific mouse knockout revealed that deleting PPAR-gamma led to larger, denser bones (osteopetrosis) due to fewer osteoclasts. Administering rosiglitazone stimulated osteoclasts (bone-destroying cells) while also slowing osteoblast-driven bone formation—a "double mode of action" that could accelerate bone loss. 

Given pre-existing cardiovascular risk controversies, the author suggests that evidence tying long-term PPAR-gamma agonist use to osteoporosis could end the "glitazone" drug class. The article concludes that PPAR biology has proven too complex to safely target given insufficient mechanistic understanding.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's concerns proved prescient. Subsequent events unfolded along several axes:

- **Regulatory restrictions**: In 2010, the FDA restricted Avandia use due to cardiovascular risks, and the European Medicines Agency suspended it entirely. By 2011 the FDA mandated a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), effectively limiting Avandia to patients unresponsive to other therapies.
  
- **Fracture risk confirmation**: Clinical evidence accumulated showing increased fracture risk—particularly in women—linked to long-term PPAR-gamma agonist use. This contributed to diminished prescribing.

- **Market outcomes**: Avandia's market share collapsed. Actos (pioglitazone), the other major glitazone, also faced safety scrutiny (including bladder cancer concerns) but remained available with warnings. The glitazone class never recovered its early prominence, largely supplanted by newer diabetes medications with better safety profiles.

- **Mechanistic understanding deepened**: The dual effect on osteoblasts and osteoclasts became established, aligning with the Salk findings. PPAR-gamma's role in bone remodeling helped explain clinical observations and reinforced the challenge of selective nuclear receptor modulation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions identified**:
- **Prediction 1**: "...that may be it for the glitazones." (suggesting the drug class could end)
- **Prediction 2**: Implicit prediction that bone effects linked to PPAR biology would prove too complex for safe therapeutic targeting
- **Prediction 3**: That diabetic patients already burdened with complications wouldn't tolerate added cardiovascular and bone risks

**Outcomes**:
- The glitazone class did not disappear completely but suffered severe market contraction and regulatory restrictions. While some patients continued using these drugs under strict oversight, the heyday of widespread PPAR-gamma agonist use ended. The complexity of nuclear receptor biology, highlighted in the article, indeed made safe therapeutic targeting extremely challenging—a challenge that persists across drug discovery efforts targeting nuclear receptors. Subsequent diabetes drug development shifted toward mechanisms with better understood safety profiles.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrated strong scientific foresight, connecting mechanistic insights to clinical risks that later materialized. It captured a turning point in understanding the complexities of nuclear receptor drug targeting and accurately anticipated the decline of a once-promising drug class.
