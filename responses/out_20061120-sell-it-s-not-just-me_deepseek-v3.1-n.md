# Sell! (It's Not Just Me) (November 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2006 commentary argues for selling ImClone stock, citing multiple bearish factors. The author had shorted ImClone at around $29 and endorsed Gretchen Morgensen's New York Times piece making the same case. Key concerns included: patent litigation from Yeda over Erbitux; competition from Amgen's newly approved Vectibix; disappointing Phase II colorectal cancer trial results showing no survival benefit; and limited therapeutic utility of Erbitux itself. The author dismisses Carl Icahn's push for enhanced marketing, arguing that cancer drugs already see extensive off-label use and that pharmaceutical success depends more on clinical efficacy than consumer-style marketing campaigns. The piece frames Erbitux as a drug with modest effectiveness facing erosion from superior future treatments.

## 2. HISTORY
**Patent Disputes and Competition:** The Yeda patent litigation referenced in the article centered on fundamental EGFR antibody patents. In subsequent years, these IP challenges did enable biosimilar and alternative EGFR inhibitors to enter the market, though not immediately in 2006-2007.

**Erbitux Performance:** Erbitux (cetuximab) did secure expanded FDA approvals beyond its initial 2004 colorectal cancer indication, gaining head and neck cancer approval in 2006 and additional indications later. However, its uptake remained constrained by the biomarker-driven approach that emerged—the drug largely benefits patients with wild-type RAS tumors (approximately 40-60% of metastatic colorectal cancer patients), which became standard practice after 2008-2013. This stratification reduced eligible patient populations compared to early broad expectations.

**Vectibix Competition:** Amgen's Vectibix (panitumumab), approved in 2006, did become a direct competitor. Clinical evidence eventually showed comparable efficacy between the two anti-EGFR antibodies, leading to market share splitting rather than Vectibix dominance.

**Clinical Trial Outcomes:** Subsequent Phase III data did demonstrate survival benefits for Erbitux in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (the CRYSTAL trial, published 2009), contradicting the article's characterization of the drug as having only "fair-to-good" performance. That said, the incremental benefit over chemotherapy alone typically fell in the 2-4 month range, representing meaningful but modest clinical advance.

**Business Developments:** Bristol-Myers Squibb eventually increased its stake, and Eli Lilly acquired ImClone in 2008 for $6.5 billion ($70 per share), well above the author's short position. The acquisition reflected Erbitux's established revenue stream and pipeline potential rather than therapeutic disappointment. Erbitux generated approximately $1.5-2 billion annually during its peak years (2010s), demonstrating sustained commercial viability.

**Scientific Progress:** The author's broader assertion about incremental progress in oncology proved accurate—targeted therapies and later immunotherapy would reshape treatment paradigms, though these advances took longer than the 2006 article's immediate context suggested.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** ImClone stock would decline due to limited Erbitux utility and competitive pressure from Vectibix.  
**Reality:** ImClone shares did experience volatility, but Eli Lilly's 2008 acquisition at $70/share represented a premium valuation. Vectibix became a competitor but did not eliminate Erbitux from the market—both drugs found clinical niches.

• **Prediction:** Marketing efforts would have minimal impact because cancer drugs already see extensive off-label use and physicians try all available options regardless of labeling.  
**Reality:** This partially holds true, though pharmaceutical marketing evolved toward biomarker-based targeting and companion diagnostics, shifting focus from broad promotion to precision medicine approaches. Erbitux's eventual biomarker stratification (RAS testing) required educational campaigns to drive adoption.

• **Prediction:** "Every slightly better compound that comes along is going to capture a lot of market share."  
**Reality:** This proved directionally correct regarding oncology's competitive dynamics. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (approved starting 2014) and other targeted therapies did capture substantial market share, though Erbitux maintained relevance in specific biomarker-defined populations.

• **Implicit Prediction:** Erbitux's therapeutic limitations would prevent significant commercial success.  
**Reality:** While not a blockbuster across all cancers, Erbitux achieved multi-billion dollar annual revenues and remained an important component of metastatic colorectal cancer treatment for years, particularly after biomarker selection improved patient outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 5/10**  
This article demonstrates reasonable short-term trading analysis but underestimated Erbitux's longevity and the pharmaceutical industry's capacity to optimize drug use through biomarker selection. It captures an interesting historical moment in targeted therapy development and investment discourse, but its predictive accuracy was mixed and its broader commentary on cancer drug markets reflects common 2006 perspectives rather than enduring insights.
