# Tagging Fungi For Destruction (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a novel Yale-Merck-Prokaryotics approach to antifungal drug development using bifunctional antibody-recruitment molecules. Traditional antifungal discovery faces challenges because fungi are eukaryotes like humans, limiting targets. The main leverage points have been ergosterol (exploited by azole drugs and amphotericin B) and chitin (a fungal cell wall component where drug development has struggled).

The new strategy uses calcofluor-based molecules where one end binds chitin on fungal cells and the other end recruits antibodies, marking fungi for immune destruction. The approach showed in vitro effectiveness against C. albicans, with neutrophils clearing tagged cells. Interestingly, combining this with echinocandin antifungals proved synergistic—echinocandins disrupt glucan synthesis, causing resistant fungi to increase chitin production, making them better targets for the antibody-recruitment approach.

## 2. HISTORY

The antibody-recruitment strategy described in this 2017 article represents a specific variant of bispecific antibody approaches that emerged prominently in the 2010s for cancer and other diseases. However, antifungal drug development has largely **not** followed this pathway in subsequent years.

**Clinical Impact**: I don't have high confidence about specific FDA approvals or clinical pipelines for calcofluor-based antibody-recruitment antifungals. I recall that antifungal drug development has remained challenging, with most advances continuing to focus on modified azoles, echinocandins, and reformulations of amphotericin rather than fundamentally new mechanistic approaches.

**Industry Adoption**: Companies active in antifungal development (Merck, Pfizer, Astellas, Cidara Therapeutics) haven't prominently featured chitin-targeting antibody recruitment strategies in their pipelines through the late 2010s and early 2020s. The field has instead seen continued reliance on existing drug classes and some novel approaches like fosmanogepix (targeting Gwt1) and ibrexafungerp (a triterpenoid).

**Scientific Direction**: While targeted protein degradation using PROTACs and related bifunctional molecules did explode in popularity as the article noted, this hasn't translated into successful antifungal applications. The fundamental challenge remains: fungal infections disproportionately affect immunocompromised patients who may have limited antibody responses to recruit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article's implicit prediction: Antibody-recruitment anti chitin compounds would advance toward clinical development**

- **Outcome**: I'm not aware of clinical advancement of this specific Yale-Merck approach. The field continued focusing on established mechanisms and new small molecule antifungals rather than antibody-recruitment strategies.
  
**Combination therapy potential**: The synergy between echinocandins and chitin-targeting compounds was highlighted

- **Outcome**: While combination therapy remains important in antifungal treatment, it has primarily involved existing drug classes rather than novel antibody-recruitment combinations. Echinocandin resistance mechanisms have been extensively studied, but solutions have mainly involved dose optimization and patient management rather than new combination partners.

**The broader prediction about targeted protein degradation approaches**

- **Outcome**: This was prescient—PROTACs and related bifunctional molecules became a major area of pharmaceutical research, with several companies founded and compounds entering clinical trials. However, this success was primarily in oncology rather than anti-infectives.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article describes an intellectually interesting proof-of-concept combining immunology and chemical biology, but this particular approach hasn't translated into clinical or commercial success. The broader insight about targeted protein degradation was more significant than the specific antifungal application discussed.
