I notice you've asked me to analyze a 2014 Science Magazine blog post about the GSK/EMBL/Sanger Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation (CTTV), but I haven't received the actual article content yet. You mentioned "--- The article ---" but no text followed.

Could you please provide the complete article text? Once you share it, I'll conduct a thorough analysis covering:

1. **Summary** - Key claims and focus of the 2014 piece
2. **History** - What happened with CTTV and target validation approaches post-2014
3. **Predictions** - Which claims proved accurate versus overly optimistic
4. **Interest Score** (0-9) - Assessment of the article's long-term significance

I'm particularly interested in examining how this target validation initiative played out against the broader genomics/drug discovery landscape over the past decade, including the real-world impact of such collaborations versus the initial enthusiasm.
