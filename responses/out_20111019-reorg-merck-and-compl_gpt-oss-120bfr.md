# Reorg at Merck? (And a Complaint about Wall Street) (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short post notes a rumor that Merck (MSD) would soon announce a major R&D re‑organization.  The author links the rumor to a contemporaneous blog by former Pfizer executive John LaMattina, which argues that Wall Street analysts wield too much power over how much pharmaceutical companies spend on research.  The post’s stance is that R&D is the “engine” of a drug company, that it is inherently high‑risk and increasingly costly, and that rewarding firms for cutting R&D budgets is “absurd.”  The author wonders whether pharma is subject to more investor‑driven pressure than other industries.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Merck’s 2011‑12 R&D restructuring**  
- In October 2011 Merck announced a formal re‑organization of its research organization.  The 12 therapeutic‑area groups were collapsed into four “clusters” (Oncology; Cardiovascular & Metabolism; Infectious Disease & Vaccines; and Inflammation).  A new “Discovery” unit was created to centralize early‑stage science, and a “Development” unit was given tighter go/no‑go decision gates.  
- The plan called for roughly 1,500 R&D‑related job cuts over two years and a modest reduction in operating expenses (≈ $300 M).  The stated goals were faster decision‑making, reduced redundancy, and a clearer pipeline focus.  

**Impact on Merck’s pipeline**  
- The re‑organization coincided with a strategic pivot toward immuno‑oncology.  In 2014 Merck’s PD‑1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) received its first FDA approval for advanced melanoma.  Keytruda has since become a blockbuster (> $20 B cumulative sales by 2025) and a cornerstone of Merck’s growth.  
- Other notable products that reached market after the restructure include **Noxafil** (isavuconazole, 2015) and **Lenvima** (lenvatinib, 2016, co‑developed with Eisai).  The overall number of Phase III launches rose from 1–2 per year (pre‑2011) to 4–5 per year in the 2015‑2020 window.  

**R&D spending trends**  
- Merck’s R&D spend fell from $10.5 B in 2010 to $9.8 B in 2012 (≈ 7 % drop) following the restructuring.  From 2014 onward, spending climbed again, reaching $11.5 B in 2020, reflecting the larger oncology portfolio and the need to fund multiple Keytruda indications.  
- The company’s R&D intensity (R&D spend as % of revenue) moved from ~ 13 % in 2010 to a low of ~ 11 % in 2012, then back to ~ 13 % by 2020.  

**Wall‑Street influence**  
- Analyst coverage of Merck continued to stress “R&D efficiency” and “return on capital,” but the market rewarded the company’s willingness to invest heavily in immuno‑oncology.  Between 2011 and 2022 Merck’s market capitalization grew from ≈ $150 B to > $250 B, largely on the back of Keytruda’s success.  
- The broader industry saw a modest shift: while many firms (e.g., Amgen, Eli Lilly) still faced pressure to trim “non‑core” programs, the rise of high‑value immunotherapies gave investors a new tolerance for larger R&D budgets when the pipeline showed clear differentiation.  

**Policy and broader industry**  
- No major regulatory change directly tied to the Merck re‑org.  However, the FDA’s 2012 “Breakthrough Therapy” designation and the 2014 “Accelerated Approval” pathways helped speed the launch of immuno‑oncology drugs, indirectly validating Merck’s strategic focus.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The post itself did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** Wall Street would continue to pressure pharma companies to cut R&D spending.  
  - *Outcome:* Partially true.  Analyst emphasis on cost‑efficiency persisted, but the market also began to reward high‑impact, high‑cost programs (especially immuno‑oncology).  Merck’s own R&D budget rebounded after an initial dip, and investors accepted higher spend when the pipeline delivered blockbuster drugs.  

- **Prediction 2:** Companies that *maintain* robust R&D investment will outperform those that cut spend.  
  - *Outcome:* Largely borne out for Merck.  The 2011‑12 cuts were modest and quickly reversed; the subsequent focus on immuno‑oncology produced Keytruda, which drove revenue growth and shareholder value.  By contrast, peers that aggressively trimmed R&D (e.g., some mid‑size biotech firms) often saw stagnant pipelines and weaker market performance.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment—Merck’s 2011 R&D overhaul and the broader debate over investor influence—that foreshadowed the industry’s shift toward immuno‑oncology and the nuanced balance between cost discipline and strategic investment.  Its relevance is solid, though the piece is brief and speculative.
