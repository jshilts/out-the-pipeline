# Grit And Giving Up, Experience and Ignorance (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on a perennial dilemma in drug discovery: when to keep pushing a compound, series, or program versus when to cut losses. He warns against two cognitive traps—the sunk‑cost fallacy (holding on too long because of past investment) and the opposite “quit‑too‑early” bias. The piece argues that grit is necessary but not sufficient; disciplined, pre‑defined milestones and hard go/no‑go decision points are essential. He stresses that a “fail‑fast” approach only works when the assay or model used to make the call is trustworthy, and that experience can both help and mislead future decisions. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver a drug (or to re‑allocate resources to a more promising effort), not simply to keep a project alive for its own sake.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Portfolio‑level decision frameworks** – Since 2016, most large pharma and many mid‑size biotech firms have formalised go/no‑go gates that mirror the article’s “if by X date we haven’t hit Y, then rethink” language. Novartis published a 2018 internal guideline on “Milestone‑Based Portfolio Management,” and Roche’s 2020 R&D strategy explicitly references “hard endpoints” for early‑stage projects. These documents cite the same sunk‑cost concerns raised in the blog.

**Fail‑fast vs. fail‑smart** – The industry’s enthusiasm for “fail fast” has been tempered by real‑world experience. A 2019 analysis by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development showed that projects terminated after Phase I still contributed ~30 % of total R&D spend, indicating that early termination alone does not guarantee cost savings. Companies such as Gilead and Amgen have since introduced “decision‑quality” metrics that combine assay robustness, translational confidence, and predictive biomarkers before declaring a failure.

**Phenotypic screening** – The article’s caution about phenotypic projects lacking a clear mechanism proved prescient. Between 2016‑2024, phenotypic approaches have resurged (e.g., the discovery of the anti‑parasitic drug ivermectin’s antiviral activity), but successful translation now almost always requires a mechanistic follow‑up. The 2021 FDA approval of **selinexor** (a first‑in‑class nuclear export inhibitor discovered phenotypically) was accompanied by an extensive target‑validation program that addressed the very “leap‑of‑faith” risk the author described.

**High‑profile successes and failures** –  
* **Successes**: The rapid development of mRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer‑BioNTech) exemplifies disciplined milestone‑driven progression—each candidate had pre‑specified immunogenicity and safety benchmarks before advancing.  
* **Failures**: The 2022 FDA advisory committee rejection of **Biogen’s aducanumab** (Aduhelm) highlighted how perseverance on a marginally validated target can lead to costly regulatory setbacks and limited market uptake, despite massive sunk investment. Conversely, the 2020 termination of **Roche’s anti‑amyloid antibody gantenerumab** after Phase III demonstrated a willingness to cut losses when a hard efficacy endpoint was not met.

**Cultural shift** – Surveys of R&D leaders (e.g., 2023 Deloitte “Pharma 2025”) report that 68 % now view “objective, data‑driven go/no‑go criteria” as more important than “leadership intuition.” The language of “grit” has been replaced in internal communications by “portfolio optimisation” and “resource reallocation,” reflecting the article’s call for realistic goal‑setting.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The piece does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies several expectations. Below are the implied predictions and how they have played out:

| Implied prediction | Outcome (2024) |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Structured milestones will become standard practice** | True. Most large pharma now publish milestone‑based R&D roadmaps; many biotech firms embed “hard endpoints” in their IND‑enabling contracts. |
| **Fail‑fast will be adopted, but only with trustworthy assays** | Partially true. “Fail‑fast” remains a buzzword, but companies have added “assay validation” layers. The 2021 FDA guidance on “Biomarker‑Qualified Endpoints” reflects this shift. |
| **Phenotypic projects will need mechanistic follow‑up to succeed** | True. Successful phenotypic discoveries (e.g., selinexor, ribociclib) all underwent extensive target deconvolution before Phase II. |
| **Experience will both help and bias future decisions** | True. Industry literature (e.g., 2022 Nature Reviews Drug Discov. “Cognitive Bias in R&D”) documents ongoing efforts to counteract bias through decision‑science tools. |
| **Overall attrition rates will improve dramatically** | Not realized. Clinical failure rates have modestly declined (from ~90 % to ~85 % for Phase III oncology trials) but remain high; the fundamental biology challenges persist. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a timeless managerial dilemma with clear, relatable examples, making it useful for anyone involved in drug‑discovery portfolio management. It lacks concrete case studies or data, limiting its long‑term scholarly impact, but its themes have proven relevant to subsequent industry practice.
