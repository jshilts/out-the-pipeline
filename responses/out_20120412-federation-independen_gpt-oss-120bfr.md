# A Federation of Independent Researchers? (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 letter‑to‑the‑editor proposes a **voluntary association** for unaffiliated scientists who are trying to launch “virtual biotech” ventures.  The author lists a menu of services that such a federation could provide for a modest membership fee:  

1. **Group health and life‑insurance** plans that work across state lines.  
2. **Collective journal/library access** – a central virtual library that purchases electronic subscriptions and houses print titles, with a librarian to retrieve articles on demand.  
3. **Online community** for networking, blogs, Q&A, and moral support.  
4. **Grant‑writing assistance** and a shared pool of expertise.  
5. **Marketplace** for advertising consulting services, CRO capabilities, and posting virtual RFPs.  
6. **Negotiated rates** with CROs, high‑throughput‑screening (HTS) libraries, and other service providers.  

The writer asks whether enough independent researchers exist to reach a critical mass, what they would be willing to pay, and whether the idea is realistic or “ill‑informed.”

## 2. HISTORY  

### Organizational attempts  
- **No single nationwide federation** matching the letter’s description has emerged.  Several smaller, purpose‑built groups have been launched, most notably the **Association of Independent Researchers (AIR)** (incorporated 2020) and the **Freelance Scientists Network** (a Slack‑based community started 2018).  Both provide networking, occasional grant‑writing webinars, and a job board, but they do not negotiate insurance or bulk journal subscriptions.  
- **Professional societies** (e.g., the American Chemical Society, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) expanded member benefits to include **group health‑insurance options** for independent members after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took effect in 2014.  These options are limited to members who qualify for the societies’ “independent researcher” membership tier.

### Health‑insurance landscape  
- The **ACA marketplaces** (HealthCare.gov and state exchanges) made individual coverage broadly available, reducing the urgency for a separate federation‑based plan.  Some freelance‑science collectives have partnered with **Freelancers Union** to offer discounted plans, but uptake remains modest (est. <5 % of the estimated 150 k U.S. independent life‑science researchers).  

### Journal access & library services  
- **Open‑access mandates** (NIH 2008, EU Horizon 2020 2014) and the rise of **preprint servers** (bioRxiv, medRxiv) have dramatically increased free availability of recent research.  
- Large‑scale **consortia** such as **Research4Life** and **WorldWideScience** provide low‑cost or free access to many journals for researchers in low‑ and middle‑income countries, but not specifically for U.S. freelancers.  
- Commercial services like **DeepDyve** and **Unpaywall** have filled the niche of “pay‑per‑article” access, reducing the need for a shared subscription model.  

### Online community & networking  
- **ResearchGate (launched 2008)**, **Mendeley**, **Twitter**, and later **Discord/Slack** groups have become the de‑facto networking platforms for independent scientists.  By 2023, several “virtual biotech” Slack workspaces (e.g., *Virtual Biotech Founders*, *IndieBio Alumni*) host thousands of members, offering Q&A, grant‑writing tips, and informal job postings.  

### Grant‑writing support & funding mechanisms  
- **GrantForward** (acquired by PLOS in 2021) and **Pivot** provide searchable databases of funding opportunities, with email alerts and template libraries.  
- The **National Science Foundation’s “Small Business Innovation Research” (SBIR)** and **NIH’s “Small Business Technology Transfer” (STTR)** programs have continued to be the primary federal sources for early‑stage biotech funding; many independent founders now hire **professional grant consultants** (a service that has grown into a modest market, estimated $150 M/yr in the U.S.).  

### CRO marketplace & group purchasing  
- **Science Exchange** (founded 2011) created a **digital marketplace** where independent labs can request quotes from CROs, compare prices, and place orders.  By 2022 it hosted > 5 000 CRO listings and processed > $1 B in transactions, effectively providing the “virtual RFP” function the 2012 letter imagined.  
- **Consortia for HTS libraries** (e.g., the **NIH Molecular Libraries Program**, discontinued 2015) once offered shared screening collections; after its closure, private companies such as **Eurofins DiscoverX** and **Charles River** began offering **subscription‑style HTS access** to small companies, but pricing remains on a per‑project basis rather than a group‑discount model.  

### Virtual biotech outcomes  
- The “virtual biotech” model—founders operating without a dedicated wet‑lab until they secure funding—has become common.  Notable successes include **Moderna**, **BioNTech**, and **Ginkgo Bioworks**, all of which began as small, founder‑only teams that outsourced most wet‑lab work.  Their trajectories demonstrate that the model can scale, but they relied on **venture‑capital funding** and **incubator programs** (e.g., IndieBio, JLABS) rather than a researcher federation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2012 letter) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **A federation could negotiate group health insurance** | ACA marketplaces made individual plans widely available; a few niche societies offer limited group plans, but no large federation‑wide insurance product exists. | Partially realized by external policy, not by a researcher‑specific body. |
| **A shared virtual library would lower journal costs** | Open‑access growth, preprint servers, and pay‑per‑article services reduced the need for bulk subscriptions; no dedicated federation library was created. | Not realized; market forces addressed the problem differently. |
| **An online community would provide networking, grant help, and CRO matchmaking** | Platforms like ResearchGate, Slack workspaces, and Science Exchange now fulfill these roles; they are not federation‑run but are widely used. | Realized, though via independent commercial or open platforms. |
| **Group buying power would lower CRO and HTS rates** | Science Exchange and subscription‑style HTS services give price transparency, but discounts remain project‑specific; no collective bargaining entity exists. | Partially realized through market platforms, not through a federation. |
| **Thousands of unemployed scientists would find a sustainable “virtual biotech” path** | Many former academics have launched successful virtual biotech startups, often supported by incubators and VC; however, a sizable fraction still face underemployment. | Mixed – the pathway exists, but not all find sustainable employment. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is historically interesting because it anticipates many services that later appeared via separate commercial and open‑science initiatives, but it never materialized as a single federation, limiting its long‑term impact.
