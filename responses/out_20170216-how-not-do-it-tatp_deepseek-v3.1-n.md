# How Not to Do It: TATP

## 1. SUMMARY

This February 2017 article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses a safety incident at the University of Bristol where a chemistry student inadvertently synthesized a dangerous explosive compound, triacetone triperoxide (TATP). The student was attempting a chlorite oxidation reaction in acetone and kept adding hydrogen peroxide to consume yellow byproducts, eventually reaching about 50 mL of peroxide. This combination of acetone and hydrogen peroxide produced TATP, an extremely sensitive explosive that terrorists favor because it can be made from common chemicals. The compound is notoriously unstable and earned the nickname "Mother of Satan" in Arabic due to its tendency to detonate without warning. Fortunately, the student noticed unusual phase separation during workup and realized something was wrong. The bomb squad performed a controlled demolition of the approximately 40g theoretical yield of TATP. The article emphasizes that high-energy compounds like TATP are unforgiving and that acetone and hydrogen peroxide should never be casually mixed.

## 2. HISTORY

The Bristol TATP incident reflected broader ongoing safety challenges in academic chemistry that continued after 2017. The incident highlighted systematic issues with laboratory safety training and awareness of chemical incompatibilities. In subsequent years, chemistry departments worldwide continued reviewing safety protocols, with several institutions implementing more rigorous training requirements for peroxide-forming solvents and reactive chemistries. The incident reinforced awareness that even common chemicals can produce dangerous materials when combined inappropriately, leading to enhanced safety documentation in many academic labs regarding solvent incompatibilities and peroxide hazards. No major regulatory changes directly traceable to this specific incident appear to have occurred, though it contributed to ongoing discussions about safety culture in academic chemistry. The fundamental chemistry of TATP formation from acetone and hydrogen peroxide remains unchanged, and the compound continues to be synthesized both accidentally in lab incidents and deliberately by malicious actors due to precursor accessibility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It was primarily a safety commentary discussing an incident that had already occurred and emphasizing established knowledge about TATP's dangers.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article serves as an important but routine laboratory safety case study within the chemistry community. The incident was significant for highlighting chemical safety awareness gaps, but it represented a fairly standard type of academic laboratory near-miss rather than a transformative event in chemical safety or policy.
