# MELK Is Not A Cancer Target. Surprise! (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses MELK (Maternal Embryonic Leucine zipper Kinase), a protein that had been identified as a potential cancer target due to its elevated activity in various aggressive cancers including breast cancer, glioblastoma, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. Drug development had proceeded based on earlier studies showing that siRNA knockdown of MELK slowed cancer cell proliferation. OncoTherapy Science developed OTSSP167 as a MELK inhibitor that entered clinical trials.

The central revelation came from a Cold Spring Harbor study led by the Sheltzer group, which used CRISPR gene editing to completely knock out MELK in multiple cancer cell lines—and found no effect on cell growth. Additionally, the cells lacking MELK still responded to OTSSP167, confirming earlier suspicions that the compound worked through off-target mechanisms rather than MELK inhibition. This raised fundamental questions about the validity of the entire MELK cancer target approach and highlighted discrepancies between earlier siRNA studies and more definitive CRISPR results.

## 2. HISTORY
The Sheltzer group's CRISPR-based devalidation of MELK represented a turning point in cancer target validation methodology. Their 2017 eLife paper systematically demonstrated that complete MELK knockout failed to impair proliferation across multiple cancer types, contradicting earlier siRNA-based studies that likely produced false positives through off-target effects.

For OncoTherapy Science and OTSSP167, the revelations were particularly problematic. The company had advanced their compound into clinical development based on the premise of MELK inhibition, yet evidence now suggested the drug's activity derived entirely from other kinase targets. This disclosure significantly undermined the compound's mechanistic rationale and likely impacted investor confidence and clinical trial recruitment.

The broader scientific community responded by re-evaluating target validation standards, with CRISPR-based approaches gaining prominence over less specific RNA interference methods for definitive target validation. The MELK case became a cautionary tale about drug development programs proceeding on insufficient mechanistic evidence.

Major pharmaceutical programs targeting MELK were largely discontinued or repurposed following these findings, representing significant opportunity costs and R&D expenditure write-offs for companies invested in this target.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained implicit predictions about what would happen following these revelations:
- **Clinical program impact**: The article anticipated embarrassment for OncoTherapy Science and difficulty for their OTSSP167 program. **Outcome**: Accurate—the MELK inhibitor field largely collapsed post-2017, and no MELK-targeted therapies have achieved clinical success or approval.
- **Scientific methodology shift**: The article noted this as a "very good example of target (de)validation through CRISPR," predicting increased reliance on precise genetic editing over siRNA methods. **Outcome**: Accurate—CRISPR-based functional genomics became standard for target validation in pharmaceutical research.
- **MELK monotherapy viability**: The article concluded MELK monotherapy didn't look promising. **Outcome**: Accurate—subsequent research confirmed MELK knockout shows no therapeutic benefit; the field pivoted to understanding MELK's actual biological functions outside oncology.
- **Mechanistic confusion resolution**: The article questioned what was "going on with those earlier siRNA experiments." **Outcome**: Partially addressed—subsequent research confirmed siRNA off-target effects caused false positives, but understanding why some targets show such discrepancies remains an ongoing challenge in drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 8/10**

This article discusses a watershed moment in cancer target validation that fundamentally changed pharmaceutical research practices and prevented continued waste of resources on an invalid target, making it highly important for both scientific methodology and biopharmaceutical strategy.
