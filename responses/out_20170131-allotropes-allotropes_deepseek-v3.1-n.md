# Allotropes, Allotropes Everywhere (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 commentary discusses two remarkable developments in element allotrope research. First, Chinese researchers from Nanjing and Liaoning universities successfully isolated and characterized a stable pentazole salt—a five-membered ring of nitrogen atoms (N₅⁻). This high-energy material was surprisingly stable (thermal stability to 117°C), despite being over 70% nitrogen by weight, challenging expectations about the instability of pure nitrogen rings. The author notes this could interest high-energy materials researchers, though it likely wouldn't become a standard counterion in pharmaceuticals.

Second, the article discusses the controversial claim by Harvard researchers Isaac Silvera and Ranga Dias of creating metallic hydrogen under extreme pressure. The author notes the scientific skepticism surrounding this claim, with critics quoted as calling it "garbage," and acknowledges that the phase diagram of hydrogen under such conditions remains highly disputed. The commentary speculates about whether metallic hydrogen could be metastable under normal conditions, noting the enormous energy release that would occur if it reverted to gaseous hydrogen.

## 2. HISTORY

**Pentazole Research:**

The pentazolate anion breakthrough has indeed spurred significant follow-up research. While not leading to pharmaceutical applications as predicted, the field of high-energy density materials has actively explored pentazole chemistry. Subsequent research has focused on synthesizing various pentazolate salts with different cations, exploring their potential as environmentally friendly explosives (compared to traditional nitrogen-based explosives that produce toxic byproducts). The benchmark thermal stability (117°C) from the 2017 paper has been confirmed, and researchers have explored alkali metal pentazolates and other variants. No FDA-approved drugs have emerged using pentazole counterions, and the pharmaceutical prediction was accurate—this remains a niche area for high-energy materials research rather than medicine.

**Metallic Hydrogen Controversy:**

The metallic hydrogen saga became even more contentious after 2017. The Silvera-Dias claim faced intense scrutiny and was never definitively confirmed. Other laboratories attempted to reproduce the results without success. The field instead progressed with improved understanding of hydrogen's high-pressure phases, but metallic hydrogen at accessible pressures remained elusive. The claim highlighted the challenges in high-pressure physics and the importance of reproducibility. No metastable metallic hydrogen was ever demonstrated under ambient conditions, and the speculation about its practical applications remained purely theoretical.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Pentazole as pharma counterion**: The author predicted pentazole wouldn't be "added to the list of acceptable counterions for the drug industry any time soon." ✓ **CORRECT**. No pharmaceutical applications have emerged; the chemistry remains confined to high-energy materials research.

• **Pentazole salt stability**: The author noted the surprising 117°C thermal stability and that salts might "be handled without that being your last action on Earth." ✓ **CORRECT**. Subsequent research confirmed reasonable stability, making pentazolates experimentally accessible.

• **Metallic hydrogen metastability**: Speculated it "might be metastable, perhaps even under normal temperatures and pressures." ✗ **UNKNOWN/UNCONFIRMED**. The metallic hydrogen claim itself was never definitively replicated or confirmed.

• **Scientific reception of metallic hydrogen claim**: Correctly noted the "state of consensus" was highly skeptical, quoting critics. ✓ **CORRECT**. The claim remained controversial and was never widely accepted.

• **Immediate follow-up research**: Predicted Silvera's group would generate "more evidence to convince their critics." ✓ **PARTIALLY CORRECT**. The researchers defended their claim, but ultimately the controversy remained unresolved with no definitive confirmation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article covers genuinely significant developments in fundamental chemistry—pentazole isolation was a real breakthrough in nitrogen chemistry, and the metallic hydrogen controversy reflects important issues in scientific reproducibility. However, neither development has led to practical applications or broader scientific paradigm shifts, keeping it in the moderately interesting rather than transformative category.
