# Day Off (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief personal blog post from February 16, 2009, written by someone working in drug discovery. The author notes that it's a holiday at their workplace and describes spending the day at home performing mundane household tasks—breaking ice off the steps and cleaning their daughter's guinea pig cage. The post is essentially a placeholder indicating the author is taking a day off from blogging about drug discovery, with a casual promise to resume both work and blogging the following day. The tone is informal and personal rather than substantive content about biotechnology.

## 2. HISTORY

The blog has continued publishing regularly since 2009 and remains influential in the pharmaceutical and chemistry communities. Lowe's blog is known for its commentary on drug discovery, pharmaceutical industry news, and scientific topics.
