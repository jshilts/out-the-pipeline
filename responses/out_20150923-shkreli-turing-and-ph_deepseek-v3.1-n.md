# Shkreli, Turing, and PhRMA (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the unfolding controversy surrounding Martin Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceuticals after they acquired the drug Daraprim (pyrimethamine) and raised its price by approximately 50-fold. Shkreli had initially defended the price hike but later reversed course under public pressure, though without specifying the new price. The trade group PhRMA issued a weak statement distancing itself from Turing's actions, while BIO (Biotechnology Innovation Organization) took the stronger step of expelling Turing from its membership.

The author argues that Turing represents an "evil parody" of a legitimate pharmaceutical company—aggressively raising prices while claiming to need revenue for R&D, despite conducting zero research. The piece highlights the dilemma facing the broader industry: legitimate R&D-driven companies struggle to distinguish themselves from companies like Turing and Valeant that acquire existing drugs and dramatically increase prices without investing in innovation. The industry faces uncomfortable questions about pricing practices, R&D spending transparency, and how to justify the high costs of genuine drug development when bad actors can co-opt the same arguments for purely financial exploitation.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article's publication, several significant developments occurred through 2023:

**Martin Shkreli's Legal Troubles**: Shkreli was arrested in December 2015 for securities fraud related to his hedge funds and previous pharmaceutical company Retrophin, not directly for Turing's pricing practices. In 2017, he was convicted on three counts of securities fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2018. He was released in 2022 but subsequently banned from the pharmaceutical industry for life by a federal judge.

**Daraprim Pricing**: Despite Shkreli's promises to lower Daraprim's price, the drug remained expensive. Vyera Pharmaceuticals (formerly Turing, acquired by Phoenixus AG) maintained high pricing. In 2020, the FDA approved the first generic version of pyrimethamine from Cerovene, which helped increase competition and potentially lower prices. The Daraprim controversy became a symbol used in political debates about drug pricing reform, particularly during the 2016 presidential election campaigns.

**Drug Pricing Policy Changes**: The controversy contributed to broader scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. While no comprehensive federal legislation immediately followed, several states enacted drug transparency laws requiring companies to justify significant price increases. The issue became a persistent theme in healthcare policy discussions, eventually influencing elements of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which included provisions allowing Medicare to negotiate some drug prices.

**Industry Response**: The legitimate pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry faced sustained reputational damage from the Shkreli affair. Many companies increased transparency efforts around R&D spending and pricing justification. However, the fundamental tension between justifying high drug prices for genuine innovation while condemning predatory pricing practices remained challenging to navigate publicly.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations about industry dynamics:

- **Industry would struggle to distinguish legitimate companies from bad actors**: This proved accurate. The Shkreli controversy became a recurring reference point in policy debates, with politicians and advocacy groups frequently citing it as representative of pharmaceutical industry practices, despite industry efforts to distance itself.

- **Uncomfortable questions about pricing transparency would intensify**: Correct. The controversy amplified demands for pharmaceutical pricing transparency that continued through 2023, with multiple states enacting transparency legislation and ongoing federal debates about drug price regulation.

- **R&D-driven companies would need to be more forthcoming about costs and failures**: Partially accurate. Some companies increased transparency efforts, but the fundamental challenge of explaining high development costs and failure rates to the public remained largely unresolved, with pricing remaining a contentious political issue.

- **Companies like Turing and Valeant represented a problematic model**: This assessment proved prescient. Valeant Pharmaceuticals faced its own major crisis in 2015-2016, with its stock declining dramatically amid scrutiny of its pricing practices and business model, leading to leadership changes and significant restructuring.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article is highly relevant for understanding how a single controversial figure and pricing decision influenced broader perceptions of pharmaceutical pricing, contributed to policy debates that extended for years, and highlighted ongoing tensions in justifying drug costs.
