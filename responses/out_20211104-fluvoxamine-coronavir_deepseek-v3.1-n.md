# Fluvoxamine for Coronavirus (November 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2021 commentary discusses promising clinical trial results for fluvoxamine as a COVID-19 treatment. Fluvoxamine, an SSRI antidepressant used since the 1980s-90s, was being investigated for repurposing based on its sigma-1 receptor agonist activity, which research suggested could reduce systemic inflammation—a key driver of severe COVID-19 outcomes.

The article highlights the TOGETHER trial in Brazil, an adaptive-design platform study examining approximately 1,500 patients across 11 treatment centers. The trial was stopped early for superiority after showing that fluvoxamine (100mg twice daily for 10 days) significantly reduced the primary endpoint of hospitalization or urgent care visits: 79 events in the treatment group versus 119 in placebo. The author notes this as a rare success story among thousands of pandemic trials, many of which were small and underpowered, and emphasizes the need for better clinical trial infrastructure to avoid repeating mistakes in future pandemics.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the November 2021 publication, fluvoxamine's trajectory as a COVID-19 therapeutic has been marked by mixed adoption, subsequent research, and ongoing scientific debate rather than broad regulatory approval or clinical uptake.

**Regulatory and Guideline Outcomes:** Major public health organizations did not widely endorse fluvoxamine for COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a conditional recommendation against its use outside clinical trials in March 2022, citing insufficient evidence. Similarly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines did not recommend fluvoxamine for COVID-19 treatment. No major regulatory agency (FDA, EMA, etc.) granted Emergency Use Authorization or formal approval for this indication.

**Subsequent Research:** The largest confirmatory trial, COVID-OUT, published in 2022, found no significant benefit for fluvoxamine in preventing severe disease when compared to placebo. This multi-center, higher-quality study contradicted the TOGETHER trial results, contributing to the overall uncertainty. Meta-analyses conducted after 2021 have shown mixed results, with some suggesting modest benefits while others showing no significant effect.

**Clinical Practice Impact:** Despite the initial enthusiasm, fluvoxamine did not achieve widespread adoption in clinical practice for COVID-19 treatment. The emergence of more effective treatments, including oral antivirals like Paxlovid and improved understanding of COVID-19 management, further reduced interest in repurposed medications with uncertain benefit-risk profiles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Immediate Clinical Practice Impact Prediction:** The author stated "I hope that this news is immediately affecting clinical practice" and described fluvoxamine as showing "useful effects during the pandemic."

- **Outcome:** This did not materialize. Instead of immediate clinical adoption, fluvoxamine remained investigational and never achieved widespread clinical use for COVID-19. Regulatory bodies and professional societies largely declined to recommend it due to insufficient evidence.

**Repurposed Drug Success Narrative:** The article presented fluvoxamine as "a very rare example of a repurposed drug actually showing useful effects during the pandemic."

- **Outcome:** While fluvoxamine showed initial promise, subsequent larger trials (particularly COVID-OUT) failed to confirm significant benefits. The more impactful repurposed drug success stories included dexamethasone (which maintained its role) and certain monoclonal antibodies, though even some of those became less relevant as viral variants evolved.

**Pandemic Trial Infrastructure Reform:** The author emphasized that "we're going to have to take steps not to repeat these mistakes" regarding clinical trial infrastructure.

- **Outcome:** While there has been increased discussion about pandemic preparedness and clinical trial coordination, concrete systemic reforms have been limited. Platform trials and adaptive designs gained recognition, but fundamental challenges in rapid, coordinated clinical research during health emergencies persist largely unaddressed.

**Mechanism Hypothesis:** The article noted that "the sigma receptor anti-inflammation hypothesis is probably the explanation for these effects."

- **Outcome:** The mechanistic understanding remains uncertain. Later research continued to explore sigma-1 receptor modulation in inflammation, but definitive proof of this mechanism's clinical relevance in COVID-19 was not established, particularly given the contradictory trial results.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important moment in pandemic drug repurposing efforts and highlights legitimate concerns about clinical trial infrastructure, but its central optimism about fluvoxamine did not withstand subsequent research scrutiny.
