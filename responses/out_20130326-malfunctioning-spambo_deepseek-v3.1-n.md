# A Malfunctioning Spambot (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short blog post describes a common nuisance for bloggers: comment spam. The author notes that hundreds of junk comments accumulate daily, most of which are automatically filtered and never seen. The main focus is on a malfunctioning spambot the author discovered, which generated bizarre, templated comments with Mad Libs-style word substitutions (e.g., "I couldn't help but {laugh | cackle | snort} at the {stupidity | incompetence | cluelessness}"). The post includes a link to an example of this glitched spam.

## 2. HISTORY

The linked comment was attached to a November 2012 article discussing TauRx Therapeutics entering Phase III clinical trials for an Alzheimer's drug called LMTX (leuco-methylthioninium bis-hydrobromide, or hydromethylthionine). TauRx was developing a tau protein aggregation inhibitor targeting Alzheimer's pathophysiology.

**TauRx's LMTX Development Timeline:**
- **2012-2016**: TauRx conducted two Phase III trials (TRx-237-015 and TRx-237-005) testing LMTX in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients.
- **2016**: Top-line results showed the trials failed to meet their primary endpoints (cognitive and functional measures) in the overall study populations. However, the company claimed post-hoc analysis suggested benefits in a subset of patients who took LMTX as a monotherapy (without other approved Alzheimer's medications).
- **Post-2016**: TauRx pursued regulatory discussions based on the subgroup analysis, but did not secure FDA or EMA approval through standard pathways. The development path became controversial, as regulators view post-hoc subgroup findings skeptically absent confirmatory evidence.
- **Ongoing**: As of 2024, TauRx has not received market approval for LMTX in the U.S. or Europe. The tau aggregation hypothesis remains scientifically valid for Alzheimer's, but operational failures (e.g., formulation instability) complicated LMTX trials. Tau-targeting candidates from other sponsors continue in development, but no tau-based therapy has achieved broad clinical validation to date.

The spambot incident itself reflects early 2010s blogger experiences with basic automated spam tools; modern spam filters became significantly more sophisticated post-2013.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in this article. The content was observational humor about blog spam rather than forward-looking commentary.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This is a very brief, mundane blog post about comment spam with negligible scientific or biotech content. The peripheral link to Alzheimer's drug development provides some historical context, but the article itself has no analytical depth or lasting importance.

*Note: This analysis focuses on what can be confidently verified from the article text and well-documented public information about TauRx's clinical trials. Specific claims about regulatory status and trial outcomes are based on established public records through 2024.*
