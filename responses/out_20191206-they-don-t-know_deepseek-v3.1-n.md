# They Don't Know (December 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses Biogen's controversial decision to seek FDA approval for aducanumab, an anti-amyloid antibody for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The article was published shortly after Biogen released additional data from two halted Phase III trials (Engage and Emerge), where the company claimed that re-analysis showed one trial produced positive results.

The author argues that the evidence remains insufficient for approval, noting that both trials were stopped in March 2019 and that the post-hoc claims of efficacy rely on questionable data manipulation. Biogen contended that protocol changes allowing more patients to receive higher doses explained the different outcomes between the trials. However, the author finds this explanation unconvincing, pointing out that even low-dose patients showed improved responses after the protocol change, suggesting statistical artifacts rather than meaningful clinical effects.

The commentary emphasizes that the burden of proof remains on Biogen to conduct a proper confirmatory trial rather than seeking approval based on what the author considers "maybe-sorta-squint-hard data." The article also criticizes company statements claiming the drug is ready for approval as irresponsible, arguing that approving an expensive drug without clear evidence of efficacy would harm patients through side effects, waste healthcare resources, and provide false hope rather than genuine therapeutic benefit.

## 2. HISTORY

What actually happened following this December 2019 article is both remarkable and controversial in the history of drug development:

**Regulatory Pathway (2020-2021):**
Despite widespread skepticism from many experts, Biogen continued pursuing FDA approval. In November 2020, the company submitted its Biologics License Application. The FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee met in November 2020 and voted overwhelmingly against approval (10 no, 0 yes, 1 uncertain on whether the data provided strong evidence of effectiveness).

**FDA Approval (June 2021):**
In a highly controversial decision that went against its own advisory committee's recommendation, the FDA approved aducanumab (brand name Aduhelm) in June 2021 under the accelerated approval pathway. This marked the first new Alzheimer's drug approval in nearly two decades.

**Post-Approval Reality:**
The approval did not lead to widespread patient adoption as Biogen had hoped. Instead, it triggered several cascading effects:

- **Clinical Adoption Resistance:** Major medical centers including the Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai, and others declined to prescribe the drug due to insufficient evidence of benefit
- **Insurance Coverage:** Medicare issued a restrictive coverage decision requiring patients to be enrolled in clinical trials to receive coverage, severely limiting access
- **Economic Impact:** Despite projections of blockbuster sales, Aduhelm generated only $2.9 million in sales during Q1 2022, far below expectations
- **Manufacturing Issues:** Biogen eventually discontinued the drug and terminated the post-marketing confirmatory trial in 2024

**Broader Impact on Anti-Amyloid Approach:**
Aducanumab's controversial approval and subsequent commercial failure did not end research into amyloid-targeting antibodies. Notably, Eisai and Biogen's lecanemab (approved 2023) and Eli Lilly's donanemab have shown more convincing data with modest but clearer clinical benefits.

**Policy Consequences:**
The FDA's decision triggered congressional investigations, criticism from medical experts about regulatory standards erosion, and renewed debates about the appropriate evidence threshold for accelerated approval, especially for drugs targeting devastating diseases with limited treatment options.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The December 2019 article made several implicit and explicit predictions about aducanumab's trajectory:

- **Prediction: The data was insufficient for FDA approval and Biogen needed a confirmatory trial**
  - **Outcome:** Partially vindicated. The FDA's advisory committee overwhelmingly agreed the evidence was insufficient, but the FDA approved it anyway under controversial accelerated approval. The confirmatory trial was never completed successfully.
  
- **Prediction: If approved, the drug would become "one of the largest prescription expenditures in the country" burdening Medicare and VA systems**
  - **Outcome:** Incorrect. Due to weak efficacy data, provider resistance, and restrictive coverage policies, Aduhelm never achieved significant market penetration or financial impact.
  
- **Prediction: The drug likely doesn't work for Alzheimer's and could "do real harm to some people and do good to no one"**
  - **Outcome:** Mixed. The efficacy signal remained questionable throughout, with unclear clinical meaningfulness of the small cognitive benefits observed. However, subsequent anti-amyloid agents (lecanemab, donanemab) have shown clearer, though still modest, benefits, suggesting the amyloid hypothesis isn't entirely wrong but may have limited therapeutic potential.

- **Prediction: Biogen's claims of immediate readiness for approval were "irresponsible"**
  - **Outcome:** Validated. The drug's commercial failure, provider rejection, and eventual discontinuation support the argument that the evidence base was insufficient.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates prescient critical thinking about pharmaceutical development and regulatory standards. Its analysis of the aducanumab data proved more accurate than the FDA's eventual decision-making, and the case became a landmark example of debates over regulatory flexibility versus evidence standards in drug approval. The controversy highlighted ongoing tensions in balancing patient hope with scientific rigor, making it highly relevant for understanding evidence-based medicine and pharmaceutical regulation dilemmas.
