# Avastin Coverage, Amended (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2011 commentary presents a satirical "amended" version of New York Times coverage regarding the FDA's decision to revoke approval of Avastin (bevacizumab) for metastatic breast cancer. The article emphasizes that the FDA Commissioner, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, revoked the approval because clinical trials showed the drug did not significantly extend overall survival for breast cancer patients while exposing them to serious side effects like severe hypertension and hemorrhaging. The piece adopts a strongly critical tone toward continued off-label use, noting the drug's high cost (approximately $88,000 annually) and suggesting that evidence-based decision making should prevail over patient anecdotes or lobbying pressure. The commentary also mocks arguments that the drug "appears to work for some patients" by comparing this reasoning to accepting placebos or toxic substances.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the FDA's November 2011 decision to revoke Avastin's breast cancer indication, the drug remained available for other approved uses (colorectal, lung, kidney, brain, and ovarian cancers) where it demonstrated clinical benefit. Medicare and most private insurers eventually stopped covering Avastin for metastatic breast cancer, significantly reducing its use in this population. Subsequent research continued to investigate biomarkers that might identify breast cancer patient subpopulations who could benefit from Avastin, but no reliable predictive markers emerged for widespread clinical use.

The drug maintained its FDA approvals for other cancer types, generating billions in annual revenue for Genentech/Roche. In 2021, the FDA approved Avastin for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment in combination with atezolizumab. Research into angiogenesis inhibitors evolved to focus on combination therapies and patient selection strategies. For metastatic breast cancer specifically, treatment guidelines shifted toward other targeted therapies (CDK4/6 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors) and immunotherapy approaches, with Avastin no longer considered standard of care. The controversy contributed to ongoing debates about accelerated approval pathways and the evidentiary standards required for maintaining drug indications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this commentary article, which focused instead on satirical commentary about a regulatory decision that had already occurred. The piece advocated for evidence-based drug approval decisions but did not make forward-looking statements about specific future developments in biotechnology or oncology.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3/9**

This commentary addresses an important regulatory precedent in cancer drug approval, but its satirical format limits broader scientific or policy insight. The underlying issues about FDA evidentiary standards and patient access remain relevant to ongoing debates about drug approval pathways.
