# Bring Me More Cute Ring Systems (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe highlights a synthetic chemistry paper from the Carreira group at ETH in collaboration with Roche, describing new routes to synthesize small saturated nitrogen heterocycles fused to other ring systems. Lowe describes these as "cute functionalized ring systems" that medicinal chemists would find valuable because they represent novel molecular scaffolds not available in commercial catalogs or existing screening collections. The chemistry is characterized as practical and scalable rather than cutting-edge, focusing on delivering new molecular shapes that might serve as cores for future drug compounds. The author notes that while such work may not interest academic organic chemists focused on theoretical advances or natural products, it provides exactly what drug discovery chemists need: accessible routes to novel compounds worth screening.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2013 article appeared at a time when medicinal chemistry was shifting toward more sophisticated approaches in drug discovery. In general, while the focus on novel heterocycles has continued in drug development, the subsequent decade saw the biopharmaceutical industry face significant challenges with high clinical failure rates for new chemical entities. Many companies struggled with productivity despite having extensive compound libraries. 

The collaboration model between academic groups like Carreira's at ETH and pharmaceutical companies like Roche has remained an important pathway for early-stage drug discovery. However, the industry has also witnessed a continued emphasis on validated drug targets and mechanisms, rather than purely scaffold diversity. The search for "druggable" chemical space has continued, but increasingly complemented by computational approaches and structure-based drug design.

During this period, drug discovery methodologies evolved with greater emphasis on early ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) profiling and sophisticated screening technologies. While novel molecular scaffolds remained important, successful drug discovery increasingly required a combination of good chemical starting points and strong biological rationale.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions Identified:**

• **Novel scaffolds would be valuable for drug discovery**: The article suggests these heterocyclic ring systems could become the "core of a bunch of useful compounds." This prediction reflects the general hypothesis that expanding chemical diversity can lead to new drug candidates. However, the subsequent years showed that scaffold novelty alone doesn't guarantee success—most compounds still fail in clinical development regardless of structural novelty.

• **These compounds would fill gaps in screening collections**: The author implies these molecules would become screening candidates. Academic-industry collaborations indeed continued to generate new screening libraries, but the broader trend in drug discovery shifted toward more targeted approaches rather than purely broad screening campaigns.

• **Scaffold diversity as primary value**: The article positions new molecular shapes as sufficient justification for the research. The broader industry experience suggests that while diversity remains important, success increasingly depends on multiple factors including target validation, physicochemical properties, and biological testing, not just structural novelty.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This represents a niche methodological commentary rather than an article with broad long-term significance. While it captures an authentic perspective on medicinal chemistry practices from 2013, its relevance is limited to illustrating the ongoing search for novel chemical matter in drug discovery without addressing larger trends or breakthrough developments.
