# A Therapy Named After You?
## 27 March 2013

### 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Prof. Magnus Essand's oncolytic virus research and his unconventional funding approach. Unable to secure traditional financing for a 20-patient human trial of his cancer therapy, Essand and his colleagues offered to name the therapy after anyone who could provide the necessary funding. The author notes initial surprise but ultimately expresses no objection to this approach, viewing it as ultimately philanthropic since Essand believed the virus was unpatentable due to prior publication, making it more of a charitable contribution than a traditional angel investment opportunity. The author references earlier coverage of Essand's work and the significant media attention it had generated.

### 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 article, crowdfunding did not ultimately fund Essand's oncolytic virus trial. Oncolytic virus research continued developing substantially between 2013-2023. The most significant clinical success came from **talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC, brand name Imlygic)**, which received FDA approval in October 2015 for metastatic melanoma, making it the first FDA-approved oncolytic virus therapy. T-VEC demonstrated improved durable response rates and overall response rates compared to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone.

Other oncolytic viruses progressed through clinical trials. **DNX-2401** (tasadenoturev) showed activity in recurrent glioblastoma, with Phase II results demonstrating survival benefits in some patients. **Pelareorep** (reovirus) continued development across multiple solid tumors. The field benefited from the rise of immunotherapy, as oncolytic viruses can stimulate antitumor immune responses, making them attractive combination partners with checkpoint inhibitors.

However, the path to widespread clinical adoption has been slower than early enthusiasm suggested. T-VEC's commercial uptake has been modest rather than transformative, with market penetration limited by competition from newer immunotherapies. The technical challenges of manufacturing oncolytic viruses, ensuring consistent viral replication in tumors, and managing potential immune responses in patients remain significant hurdles. While research continues, these therapies have not become frontline standard-of-care for most cancers.

### 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Crowdfunding as viable funding mechanism for cancer therapy trials**: The article suggests that having wealthy individuals fund clinical trials through a "naming rights" arrangement could be a legitimate approach. **Outcome**: This model did not become established practice. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies, venture capital, and government grants remained the dominant funding sources for oncolytic virus trials through 2023. Crowdfunding could not address the extensive regulatory requirements or long development timelines.

• **Essand's specific virus getting into a 20-patient trial through this approach**: **Outcome**: Limited evidence indicates this specific crowdfunding campaign succeeded in advancing to clinical trials. Without a major backer, the therapy likely remained in preclinical development. The substantial costs, regulatory complexities, and time required for even small Phase I trials typically exceed what crowdfunding can practically raise.

• **General promise of oncolytic virus therapies**: While not explicitly predicting, the attention reflects optimism about the therapeutic potential. **Outcome**: Oncolytic viruses achieved regulatory approval and clinical use, but became one tool among many in oncology rather than transforming cancer treatment. Combination therapies and patient selection strategies evolved, while commercial uptake remained moderate.

### 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While highlighting an innovative but unsuccessful crowdfunding approach, the article touches upon a therapeutic modality that eventually achieved regulatory milestone but not widespread impact.
