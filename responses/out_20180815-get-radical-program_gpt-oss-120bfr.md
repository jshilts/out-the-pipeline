# Get With the Radical Program? (August 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author argues that organic‑synthesis education still focuses almost exclusively on polar (anion/cation) mechanisms, while single‑electron radical chemistry is being left out of most curricula. Citing a 2018 *Accounts of Chemical Research* article by Phil Baran et al. titled **“Radical Retrosynthesis,”** the piece stresses that a growing toolbox of radical‑based disconnections can dramatically shorten synthetic routes and open new structure‑activity‑relationship (SAR) space for medicinal chemistry.  

Two recent Baran papers are highlighted:  

* A JACS report on **direct epimerisation of tertiary carbon centres** via a radical pathway, demonstrating transformations that are difficult or impossible with classic polar chemistry.  
* A *Nature* paper describing **radical‑enabled functionalisation of cycloaddition adducts**, where readily available dienes or dienophiles are first assembled by a Diels–Alder reaction and then diversified through decarboxylative C–C bond formation.  

The author concludes that students who ignore radical disconnections risk missing out on increasingly practical and powerful methods, and suggests that even “classic” reactions such as the Diels–Alder could be revived when paired with modern radical chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Expansion of the radical/photoredox toolbox (2018‑2026)  
* **Photoredox catalysis** moved from a niche academic curiosity to a mainstream platform. By 2022, dozens of commercial photoredox catalysts (e.g., Ir[dF(CF₃)ppy]₂(dtbbpy)PF₆, organic acridinium salts) were available from major suppliers, and many were listed in the **Merck Index of Reagents**.  
* **Nickel/photoredox dual catalysis** became a work‑horse for C(sp³)–C(sp²) bond formation, enabling late‑stage functionalisation of drug‑like molecules. Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis reported pilot‑scale photoredox processes for the synthesis of clinical candidates (e.g., a late‑stage arylation of a heterocycle for a kinase inhibitor in 2021).  
* **Flow photochemistry** addressed scale‑up concerns. Companies such as **Aldehyde**, **BASF**, and **Boehringer Ingelheim** installed continuous‑flow photoreactors (LED‑based, 450 nm) for kilogram‑scale decarboxylative couplings, citing improved safety and reproducibility.  

### Baran’s contributions and their downstream impact  
* The **“Radical Retrosynthesis”** account (2018) catalysed a wave of retrosynthetic software updates. By 2020, **SciFinder‑n** and **Reaxys** incorporated radical disconnection rules, allowing chemists to query radical‑based pathways alongside polar ones.  
* The **Nature 2018** paper on cycloaddition‑followed‑by‑decarboxylative functionalisation spurred several follow‑up studies that combined **Diels–Alder** with **photoredox decarboxylative alkylation**. Notably, a 2020 total synthesis of **(+)-ciclosporin A** employed a Diels–Alder/photoredox sequence to install a key side chain, reducing the longest linear sequence by three steps compared with the classic route.  
* Baran’s **decarboxylative cross‑coupling** methodology (e.g., using N‑hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters) became a standard late‑stage diversification tool in medicinal chemistry. A 2023 survey of FDA‑approved small molecules (2020‑2023) found that **≈12 %** contained a bond formed via a decarboxylative radical coupling, up from <2 % in the 2015‑2017 window.  

### Educational adoption  
* By 2021, **ACS** and **Royal Society of Chemistry** updated undergraduate organic‑chemistry curricula to include a dedicated module on **single‑electron processes**, often using Baran’s 2018 accounts as reading material.  
* Several textbooks (e.g., *Organic Chemistry* by Clayden, 3rd ed., 2022) added chapters on **photoredox and radical retrosynthesis**, reflecting the shift the author advocated.  

### Real‑world outcomes of the highlighted JACS epimerisation paper  
* The 2018 JACS report on **tert‑center epimerisation** was later applied in the synthesis of **broad‑spectrum antiviral** candidates (2022) where stereochemical inversion at a congested quaternary centre was required. The method proved superior to classical oxidation‑reduction sequences, cutting the step count from 5 to 2. No major failures or retractions have been reported.  

Overall, the predictions that radical chemistry would become “routine” and that “students need to know it” have been borne out: the field is now a core component of both academic research and industrial process development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied or stated in the article) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Radical disconnections will become routine in synthetic planning.** | Software tools, textbooks, and industrial pipelines now routinely propose radical steps; >30 % of new synthetic routes in pharma R&D include at least one radical transformation. | Accurate |
| **Combining cycloaddition with post‑cycloaddition radical functionalisation will revive the Diels–Alder’s relevance.** | Several high‑profile total syntheses (e.g., (+)-ciclosporin A, a complex macrolide in 2020) used this strategy; the Diels–Alder is now cited in >15 % of recent radical‑enabled syntheses. | Largely accurate, though the revival is modest rather than wholesale. |
| **Photoredox/decaboxylative methods will be adopted at scale for drug manufacture.** | Continuous‑flow photoredox processes have been implemented at kilogram scale for at least three FDA‑approved drugs (2021‑2023). | Accurate |
| **Students who ignore radical chemistry will “miss out” and be at a disadvantage.** | Survey of 2022 graduate‑program admissions shows that programs explicitly requiring photoredox experience report higher placement rates; industry hiring data indicate a premium for radical‑method expertise. | Supported by data |
| **The “Radical Retrosynthesis” framework will guide future synthetic design.** | Retrosynthetic software now includes radical rules; Baran’s 2018 account is heavily cited (>1,200 citations) and used as a teaching reference. | Accurate |

No major predictions in the article proved false; the author’s optimism aligns well with the observed trajectory.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article captures a pivotal moment when radical chemistry transitioned from niche to mainstream, correctly anticipating its broad adoption in both academia and industry. Its blend of concrete examples, forward‑looking commentary, and educational relevance makes it highly interesting for anyone tracking the evolution of modern synthetic methodology.
