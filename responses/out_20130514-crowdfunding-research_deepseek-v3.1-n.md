# Crowdfunding Research (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the emergence of crowdfunding as a method for academic researchers to raise money, noting its rapid growth as traditional grant success rates declined. The piece highlights several platforms being used including Indiegogo, Kickstarter, RocketHub, FundaGeek, SciFund Challenge, and Microryza. The author expresses cautious optimism about crowdfunding's potential to connect the public with scientific research, but raises concerns about two main problems: the risk of a "tragedy of the commons" if researchers become too aggressive in fundraising appeals without building genuine audience relationships first (as warned by Jai Ranganathan), and the temptation for researchers to overpromise or exaggerate results to make their work more appealing to public donors. The article also contrasts academic research crowdfunding with biopharma startup funding, noting that academic projects must appeal to altruism and curiosity rather than profit motives, resulting in much smaller funding amounts.

## 2. HISTORY
In the decade following this 2013 article, science crowdfunding evolved significantly but remained a niche funding mechanism rather than becoming the transformative solution some envisioned. Key developments include:

**Platform Evolution**: Microryza transformed into Experiment.com in 2013 and continued operating as a dedicated science crowdfunding platform, funding thousands of research projects. However, general platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo remained more prominent, with science projects representing only a small fraction of their overall activity.

**Scale and Impact**: While successful individual campaigns raised meaningful amounts (typically $5,000-$50,000 range), crowdfunding never became a major replacement for traditional research funding. NIH budgets remained in the tens of billions annually, dwarfing all crowdfunding efforts combined. The most successful science crowdfunding campaigns tended to be applied research or conservation projects with clear public appeal.

**Scientific Outcomes**: There have been notable scientific publications resulting from crowdfunded research, particularly in fields like ecology, citizen science, and biomedical research. However, the concern about overpromising materialized in some cases, with researchers sometimes overselling preliminary findings to attract donors.

**Institutional Response**: Many universities developed policies regarding crowdfunding, often requiring institutional approval. Some established their own crowdfunding platforms or partnerships. The practice became more accepted but remained supplemental rather than primary funding.

**The "Hustle" Problem**: Ranganathan's concern about audience fatigue proved valid. The most successful crowdfunding researchers were those who had built genuine online communities and maintained ongoing public engagement beyond fundraising periods, rather than those who treated it as transactional.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

- **"Crowdfunding academic research might be changing from a near-stunt to a widely used method of filling gaps"**: **Partially correct.** Crowdfunding became an established niche method, particularly for early-career researchers, pilot studies, and projects with strong public appeal like environmental or health research. However, it never became "widely used" as a primary funding source or a major solution to the grant funding crisis.
  
- **Concern about overpromising and exaggeration**: **Validated.** This concern proved prescient, as many successful crowdfunding campaigns emphasized potential applications and immediate benefits over scientific rigor. Some campaigns made claims that were difficult to substantiate, though serious fraud appears to have been limited.
  
- **"The tragedy of the commons" problem with aggressive fundraising**: **Validated.** The issue of audience fatigue and researcher over-solicitation emerged as a real problem. Research showed that successful science crowdfunding required sustained community building, not just aggressive campaign promotion.
  
- **Implicit prediction that this could substantially supplement traditional funding**: **Overly optimistic.** While crowdfunding provided meaningful support for individual projects, it never approached the scale needed to significantly address the gap between research demand and traditional funding availability. The amounts raised remained modest compared to major grants.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article was prescient in identifying both the potential and the key challenges of science crowdfunding before the trend matured, particularly recognizing the "tragedy of the commons" risk and overpromising concerns that proved real. However, it was overly optimistic about the scale crowdfunding would achieve.
