# What a Brief Regeneron Panic Tells Us (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a temporary stock price drop for Regeneron after investors used FOIA requests to obtain FDA adverse-event data on PCSK9 inhibitor drugs. The raw data suggested Regeneron's Praluent (alirocumab) was associated with multiple suicide reports while Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) was not. However, the data quality proved extremely poor—one actual suicide (in a patient with chronic depression history) was reported six times due to database duplication, and another reported suicide involved a patient who never actually received the drug. The FDA had to issue a clarifying statement explaining the erroneous nature of these reports.

The author uses this incident to argue that interpreting raw adverse-event data requires significant expertise, highlighting the dangers of hasty conclusions from unverified data. While acknowledging legitimate questions about PCSK9 inhibitors as a novel mechanism, the article emphasizes that these drugs deserved careful evaluation given their unprecedented approach to lipid management. The piece also notes physicians' reasonable concerns about long-term outcomes, cost considerations (both drugs priced very high), and real-world patient uptake as key outstanding questions at the time.

## 2. HISTORY

**Drug Approvals and Market Uptake:**
Praluent (alirocumab) received FDA approval in July 2015 and Repatha (evolocumab) in August 2015, both as adjuncts to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Despite the strong efficacy in lowering LDL cholesterol (often 50-60% reductions on top of statins), real-world uptake was initially slow due to high costs and payer restrictions. 

**Clinical Outcomes Evidence:**
The critical question of whether LDL reduction translated to cardiovascular benefit was answered by landmark outcomes trials published after the article:

- **FOURIER trial (2017)**: Evolocumab (Repatha) showed 15% reduction in primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) with median follow-up of 2.2 years in 27,564 patients with established cardiovascular disease.

- **ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (2018)**: Alirocumab (Praluent) demonstrated 15% reduction in primary endpoint (death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal MI, fatal/nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in 18,924 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome.

**Regulatory and Labeling Changes:**
Based on these outcomes trials, the FDA expanded indications in 2019 to include prevention of cardiovascular events, not just cholesterol lowering. This made prior authorization requirements more favorable and broadened insurance coverage.

**Real-World Utilization:**
Despite cardiovascular outcomes evidence, uptake remained limited. By 2019, only about 2-3% of eligible patients were on PCSK9 inhibitors, primarily due to cost and access barriers. Price reductions and outcomes-based contracts gradually improved access through 2020-2023. The drugs proved safe with no suicide signals ever emerging in controlled trials or post-marketing surveillance.

**Business Impact:**
Regeneron and Amgen both experienced slower-than-expected revenue growth. The 2016 market scare proved entirely unfounded—no safety signal materialized. Both drugs eventually became successful but required outcomes data, label expansions, and pricing adjustments to achieve meaningful market penetration.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Novel mechanism concerns**: The article raised legitimate concerns about PCSK9 inhibition as an unprecedented approach. **Actual outcome**: Both drugs proved safe and effective with robust cardiovascular outcomes data establishing their clinical value beyond just lipid lowering.

• **Data misinterpretation risks**: The author emphasized how raw adverse-event data is easily misunderstood. **Actual outcome**: This proved prescient. The suicide signal was entirely spurious, and no such safety issues emerged even after millions of patient-years of exposure.

• **Cost and access barriers**: The article noted high pricing would limit uptake. **Actual outcome**: This proved accurate. Uptake was very limited initially due to costs, requiring outcomes data, label expansions, and pricing concessions to improve access.

• **Long-term outcome uncertainty**: The piece highlighted physician uncertainty about long-term effects as reasonable. **Actual outcome**: Valid concern. It took 3-4 years post-approval before outcomes trials established cardiovascular benefit definitively.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates the challenges in pharmacovigilance and the risks of misinterpretating raw adverse-event data, using a real case where market panic arose from poor data quality rather than actual safety concerns. Its broader points about regulatory complexity and data interpretation remain highly relevant as discussions about real-world evidence and accelerated approval pathways continue.
