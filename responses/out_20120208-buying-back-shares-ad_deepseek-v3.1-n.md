# Buying Back Shares: An Admission of Defeat (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 commentary critiques the practice of pharmaceutical companies (particularly AstraZeneca and Pfizer) conducting large stock buyback programs while simultaneously cutting costs and research spending. The author argues that buybacks serve primarily as signaling mechanisms—attempting to prop up stock prices and convey confidence—rather than sound financial investments. The piece contends that buyback money could be better spent on actual business operations and R&D, suggesting these repurchases represent an "admission of defeat" by companies that lack compelling internal investment opportunities. The article highlights William Lazonick's critique that buybacks function as market manipulation to reward executives compensated in stock options, citing pharmaceutical industry data showing companies like Amgen spending 99% as much on buybacks as on R&D from 1997-2009.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated the article's concerns, though the practice continued extensively:

**Pfizer's Trajectory**: The company continued aggressive buybacks while facing significant R&D challenges. Pfizer spent approximately $\$50-60$ billion on buybacks between 2011-2016, during which period they experienced numerous late-stage clinical failures and patent cliffs on major drugs like Lipitor. Their research productivity remained a persistent challenge, leading to the eventual acquisitions of Hospira ($2015), Medivation ($2016), and ultimately their massive $\$160$ billion merger with Allergan (later abandoned due to tax inversion rules) and final merger with Wyeth. The promised acquisition-driven growth strategy mentioned in 2011 largely failed to materialize as planned.

**AstraZeneca's Experience**: Following the 2012 restructuring, AstraZeneca faced continued patent cliffs and pipeline gaps, ultimately fending off a $\$118$ billion takeover attempt by Pfizer in 2014 while defending their research strategy. Their subsequent drug development had mixed results—some successes like Tagrisso and Lynparza emerged from their oncology pipeline, but overall research productivity improvements were moderate compared to buyback expenditures.

**Industry Patterns**: Stock buybacks remained prevalent across pharma through the 2010s. However, the sector increasingly embraced other value-return mechanisms, including dividend increases and strategic acquisitions. The correlation between massive buyback programs and subsequent stock underperformance noted in the article generally persisted, though companies with strong pipelines (like Merck with Keytruda) performed well regardless of buyback policies.

**Policy and Governance Impact**: The critique of buybacks gained broader traction after 2012. The 2017 tax reform temporarily boosted buyback activity across sectors. Academic research largely confirmed the article's concerns—studies showed that companies conducting large buybacks often underinvested in R&D and capital expenditure, with negative long-term implications for innovation and competitiveness.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Market signaling interpretation**: The prediction that buybacks signal lack of better investment opportunities proved largely accurate. Companies conducting large buybacks during 2012-2020 generally showed poorer subsequent revenue growth and R&D productivity compared to peers who reinvested excess cash.

• **Executive compensation motivation**: Lazonick's thesis about buybacks benefiting stock-option-compensated executives gained substantial supporting evidence. Numerous academic studies confirmed correlation between executive equity compensation and buyback decisions across the decade.

• **Shareholder value rhetoric**: The prediction that "shareholder value" justifications would continue proved correct, though institutional investor attitudes evolved. By the late 2010s, influential investors like BlackRock increasingly questioned short-term buyback strategies when they appeared to compromise long-term R&D investment.

• **Financial effectiveness concerns**: Research findings generally supported the article's skepticism about buyback efficacy. Studies (such as those from Fortuna Advisors mentioned) continued showing weak or negative correlation between buyback spending and shareholder returns, particularly in industries requiring sustained R&D investment like pharmaceuticals.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article proved prescient in identifying a structural issue in pharmaceutical industry capital allocation that persisted and even intensified through the subsequent decade. Its arguments were validated by both subsequent market performance and academic research.
