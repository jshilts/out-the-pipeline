# Valeant Sure Picks the Winners (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece discusses brodalumab, an anti‑IL‑17‑receptor monoclonal antibody originally being co‑developed by Amgen and AstraZeneca for psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases. After Phase III trials revealed several cases of suicidal ideation (four suicides in the psoriasis trial and two in other studies) and hints of cardiovascular risk, the partnership abandoned the program in 2015. Valeant (later Bausch Health) bought the worldwide rights for roughly $100 million, fully aware of the safety red flags. The author notes that the FDA advisory‑committee briefing documents released in July 2016 show a grim outlook—multiple black‑box‑type concerns and extensive risk‑management requirements—suggesting the drug might never receive approval because safer IL‑17 inhibitors (e.g., secukinumab, ixekizumab) were already on the market.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome** – The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee met on July 13‑14 2016. Despite the safety worries, the committee voted **13 in favor, 2 against** recommending approval, citing the unmet need for severe psoriasis and the availability of a risk‑evaluation‑and‑mitigation‑strategy (REMS). The FDA granted approval on **13 February 2017** under the brand name **Siliq** (brodalumab) for moderate‑to‑severe plaque psoriasis, with a REMS that required prescriber certification, patient counseling, and close monitoring for suicidal behavior.

**Post‑approval safety** – Post‑marketing surveillance has not identified a causal link between brodalumab and suicide, but the REMS remained in place throughout its US life. Cardiovascular signals have not materialized into regulatory action.

**Commercial performance** – Sales in the United States were modest (≈ $30 M in 2018) compared with competitors secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz), which together captured > 50 % of the biologic psoriasis market. The lingering safety stigma limited formulary acceptance.

**Business fate** – In **2020**, Bausch Health announced it would **withdraw Siliq from the US market** for commercial reasons, not because of new safety data. The drug continues to be marketed in a few other regions (e.g., Japan, where it was approved in 2017) but never achieved significant global market share.

**Industry impact** – The episode reinforced the FDA’s willingness to approve drugs with serious safety concerns if a robust REMS is in place, and it highlighted the risk of acquiring late‑stage assets with known liabilities. Valeant’s broader “buy‑and‑hold” strategy continued to draw criticism, and the company’s later rebranding to Bausch Health was partly an effort to distance itself from such high‑risk acquisitions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** *“Maybe we could save all this trouble by, you know, not approving it in the first place.”*  
  **Outcome:** The drug **was approved** (Feb 2017) despite the advisory‑committee’s concerns, so the prediction was **incorrect** regarding regulatory fate.

- **Implicit prediction:** *“There are other therapies with good efficacy data that don’t cause suicides; therefore brodalumab will struggle to find a market.”*  
  **Outcome:** The drug **did struggle**—sales remained low and the product was withdrawn from the US in 2020. This aspect of the prediction was **accurate**.

- **Implicit prediction about safety management:** *“Valeant would have to invest heavily in black‑box warnings, monitoring, and pharmacist education.”*  
  **Outcome:** A **REMS** was indeed required, imposing the described monitoring and education obligations. This prediction was **correct**.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment where a high‑profile safety controversy intersected with a controversial corporate acquisition strategy, offering lasting lessons for drug‑approval policy and biotech M&A.
