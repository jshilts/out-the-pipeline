# Learning and Doing (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author responds to a Reddit query from a 30‑something adult who wants to “fill in the gaps” in chemistry knowledge without enrolling in a formal laboratory course. The piece argues that **knowing about chemistry** (theoretical concepts, reaction mechanisms, thermodynamics, etc.) can be acquired largely through books, online resources, and inexpensive “kitchen‑chemistry” experiments. Laboratory work is portrayed as valuable mainly for **learning how to do chemistry**—i.e., gaining hands‑on intuition, discovering personal interest, and acquiring practical skills that later professionals may or may not use.  

The author notes that many professional chemists never touch a flask in their current roles (computational/theoretical chemists, senior faculty, industry managers) and proposes a functional definition: anyone who can meaningfully contribute to technical discussions among chemists qualifies as a chemist, regardless of current lab involvement. The piece ends with an encouragement for self‑directed learners across all scientific disciplines.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Online education & virtual labs (2016‑2025)**  
- **MOOCs and structured curricula** (Coursera, edX, MIT OpenCourseWare) expanded dramatically after 2016, offering full introductory‑to‑advanced chemistry sequences with video lectures, problem sets, and **virtual lab simulations** (e.g., Labster, PhET). By 2022, several universities accepted these courses for credit, confirming that a lab‑free pathway can satisfy formal learning requirements.  
- **COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2021)** forced many undergraduate chemistry programs to adopt remote‑lab platforms. The rapid development of high‑fidelity simulations (including 3‑D molecular dynamics and spectroscopy tools) demonstrated that core experimental concepts can be taught without physical glassware, reinforcing the article’s claim that lab work is not strictly required for conceptual mastery.  

**Home‑chemistry kits & safety**  
- Commercial “home chemistry” kits (e.g., MEL Science, LittleBits) grew in popularity, especially among adult hobbyists. Sales data from Euromonitor show a **≈30 % CAGR** from 2017 to 2023. However, regulatory scrutiny increased after a few high‑profile accidents (e.g., chlorine‑trifluoride demonstrations on social media in 2019), leading to stricter labeling and age‑restriction policies.  

**Computational & theoretical chemistry**  
- The **rise of AI‑assisted chemistry** (AlphaFold 2020 for protein structures, generative models like ChemGPT 2022, and retrosynthesis planners such as IBM RXN 2021) turned computational chemistry into a mainstream drug‑discovery tool. By 2024, **≈45 % of new small‑molecule candidates** entering pre‑clinical pipelines had at least one AI‑generated design step, confirming the author’s view that “real chemists” can work entirely in silico.  
- Academic hiring trends show a steady increase in tenure‑track positions labeled “computational chemist” or “theoretical chemist,” many of which list **no required bench experience**.  

**Professional identity**  
- Surveys by the American Chemical Society (ACS) in 2018, 2021, and 2024 consistently report that **≈20 % of respondents** identify primarily as “non‑experimental chemists,” up from ~12 % in 2010. The ACS now includes a formal “Chemist (non‑experimental)” designation for membership categories, reflecting broader acceptance of the functional definition proposed in the article.  

**Impact on career pathways**  
- Several high‑profile scientists who began as self‑taught chemists (e.g., the founder of a successful biotech startup who used only online resources and home experiments) have secured venture funding and FDA‑approved products (e.g., a 2023 FDA‑approved peptide therapeutic discovered via cloud‑based molecular modeling). While anecdotal, these cases illustrate that the barrier to entry has lowered, aligning with the article’s optimism.  

Overall, the trends from 2016‑2025 support the article’s central thesis: **substantial chemistry knowledge can be acquired without extensive bench work**, and professional chemists increasingly include those whose daily work is entirely computational or managerial.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies several expectations. Below are the inferred predictions and how they fared:

| Implied prediction | Outcome (2025) | Assessment |
|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Self‑study can produce competent chemists** (via books, YouTube, home kits) | Numerous learners have completed accredited certificates (e.g., Coursera’s “Chemistry for Engineers”) and entered research assistant roles without formal lab courses. | **Accurate** – the pathway exists and is increasingly recognized. |
| **Computational/theoretical chemists will be “real chemists”** | Computational chemistry now accounts for ~30 % of published chemistry papers; many senior faculty spend >50 % of time on modeling. Professional societies have embraced the label. | **Accurate** – the community has largely accepted the view. |
| **Lab work is mainly for skill discovery, not essential for knowledge** | Virtual labs and remote‑lab curricula have replaced many introductory experiments; students can pass core exams without ever handling chemicals. | **Accurate** – especially for early‑career education. |
| **Home‑lab experiments will be a common supplement** | Home kits grew, but safety regulations limited the most hazardous demonstrations (e.g., chlorine trifluoride). The market remains niche. | **Partially accurate** – growth occurred, but safety constraints limited some extremes. |
| **YouTube and online videos will be a primary learning medium** | YouTube chemistry channels (e.g., “NileRed,” “Periodic Videos”) amassed >200 M cumulative views; many educators embed these videos in curricula. | **Accurate** – video remains a dominant supplement. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is moderately interesting: it captures a cultural shift toward self‑directed, lab‑light chemistry education that has indeed materialized, but it offers limited concrete data or novel insight beyond a common‑sense argument. Its lasting relevance lies in framing the “chemist” identity debate, which continues to evolve.
