# Let the Healing Begin (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a short satirical article from *The Onion* titled “Pfizer Breaks Psychological Need To Always Seek FDA’s Approval.”  It jokes that Pfizer has somehow liberated itself from the industry‑wide obsession with obtaining FDA clearance for every new product, implying that the company will now pursue “healing” without regulatory oversight.  The article is written in the typical dead‑pan style of *The Onion* and contains no factual claims about Pfizer’s actual business strategy, pipeline, or regulatory behavior.  It is attributed to Derek Lowe only in the sense that his name appears on the *Science* website’s commentary feed; the satire itself is not a serious scientific commentary.

## 2. HISTORY  
Because the article is pure satire, there were no concrete downstream effects on Pfizer’s drug development, FDA policy, or the broader biotech industry.  Since 2011, Pfizer has continued to submit extensive New Drug Applications (NDAs) and biologics licensing submissions to the FDA, as required by law.  Notable milestones after 2011 include:

* **2015** – FDA approval of *Xalkori* (crizotinib) for ALK‑positive lung cancer (acquired from Pfizer’s partner).  
* **2019** – FDA approval of *Ibrance* (palbociclib) for breast cancer, a major commercial success.  
* **2020** – Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and later full approval (2022) of the *Comirnaty* COVID‑19 vaccine, developed in partnership with BioNTech.  

None of these events were influenced by the satirical claim that Pfizer “no longer needs FDA approval.”  Regulatory requirements have remained unchanged; the FDA continues to be the gatekeeper for safety and efficacy in the United States.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not contain any serious predictions.  Its only “forecast” is the tongue‑in‑cheek suggestion that Pfizer will abandon the FDA approval process altogether.  In reality:

* **Prediction (satirical):** Pfizer will stop seeking FDA approval.  
  *Outcome:* False. Pfizer still files NDAs and biologics license applications for every product it wishes to market in the U.S.  

No other forward‑looking statements are present.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10**  
The piece is a brief satire that offers no substantive insight into biotech science or industry trends; its interest lies solely in humor, which limits its relevance to serious analysis.
