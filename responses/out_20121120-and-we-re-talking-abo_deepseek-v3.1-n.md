# And Since We're Talking About Insider Trading (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post discusses a major SEC insider trading case involving hedge fund manager Mathew Martoma and Dr. Sidney Gilman, a University of Michigan neurologist who served as lead investigator for the bapineuzumab Alzheimer's drug trial. Gilman allegedly provided confidential trial results to Martoma before public disclosure, enabling illegal trading in Wyeth and Elan stock that accounted for approximately 20% of Elan's trading volume and at least 10% of Wyeth's. The author notes this case represented a dramatic return to large-scale insider trading cases, contrary to his previous observations about such cases becoming more small-time. An update references criticism of Gilman's poorly executed presentation of the bapineuzumab data at a 2008 conference.

## 2. HISTORY
The Martoma case indeed became one of the largest insider trading prosecutions in history. Martoma, who worked for SAC Capital Advisors (Steve Cohen's hedge fund), was convicted in 2014 and sentenced to 9 years in prison. The insider trading involved $276 million in alleged illegal profits and avoided losses from the bapineuzumab trial results. Dr. Gilman cooperated with prosecutors and testified against Martoma in exchange for a non-prosecution agreement. 

Bapineuzumab itself failed in clinical trials - the Phase III trials were terminated in 2012 after showing no efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease. This represented a major setback for the amyloid hypothesis approach to Alzheimer's treatment. Elan was eventually acquired by Perrigo in 2013, while Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer in 2009. 

The case was part of a broader wave of insider trading prosecutions by then-US Attorney Preet Bharara in the Southern District of New York, which resulted in over 80 convictions. SAC Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 2013 and paid a record $1.8 billion fine, later rebranding as Point72 Asset Management.
