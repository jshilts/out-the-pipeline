# Judah Folkman: Reflections on Angiogenesis and the Long Road to Impact (January 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2008 commentary reflects on the legacy of Judah Folkman following his death, highlighting his foundational role in establishing tumor angiogenesis—the process by which tumors recruit their own blood supply—as a therapeutic target. The article notes that while angiogenesis was observed as early as 1941 in transplanted animal tumors, Folkman's 1971 publications established the concept as a viable anti-cancer strategy, and he deserves credit for publishing the idea and persevering with it despite initial scientific skepticism. The author connects Folkman's death to the notorious 1998 New York Times front-page article by Gina Kolata that hyped Folkman's compounds (endostatin and angiostatin) and quoted James Watson predicting a cancer cure within two years, which became emblematic of biotechnology hype versus reality. The commentary emphasizes that while the angiogenesis concept was scientifically sound, the biology was complex, noting that VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) wasn't discovered until 1983 and its functions weren't clarified until 1989. The piece concludes with the reminder that cancer is not a single disease and won't have a single cure, implicitly contrasting the early hype with the more measured scientific reality that unfolded after 1998.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Successes and FDA Approvals:**
The most significant post-2008 development in angiogenesis inhibition was the continued clinical success of anti-VEGF therapies that had already been approved by 2008. Bevacizumab (Avastin) received FDA approval in 2004 for metastatic colorectal cancer and subsequently gained approvals for lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and certain ovarian cancers. While effective in combination with chemotherapy, bevacizumab's benefits have proven cancer-type specific, with notable successes in colorectal and lung cancers but more modest or controversial results in breast cancer (where the FDA revoked the accelerated approval for metastatic breast cancer in 2011). Multiple other anti-angiogenic agents were approved or expanded their indications between 2008-2020, including sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, and ramucirumab, largely for kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal cancers.

**Entremed's Compounds and Clinical Outcomes:**
The specific compounds mentioned in the 1998 hype—endostatin and angiostatin—had sobering clinical trajectories after 2008. Endostatin (Endostar in China) gained approval in China for non-small cell lung cancer in 2005 and saw limited use there, though it never achieved regulatory approval or significant market presence in the U.S. or Europe. Neither compound lived up to the revolutionary promise suggested in the 1998 reporting; rather, they remained niche therapies with limited adoption.

**Scientific Mechanism and Limitations:**
Research after 2008 identified a key limitation of angiogenesis inhibitors: tumors can develop evasive resistance through alternative pro-angiogenic signaling pathways, vessel co-option (using existing vasculature), or increased invasiveness. This partly explains why these drugs tend to extend survival by months rather than producing long-term remissions and why combinations with chemotherapy or immunotherapy became standard. Clinically, the agents provided meaningful benefit but fell short of the "cancer cure" narrative, demonstrating palliative benefits and progression-free survival improvements rather than transformational outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Angiogenesis inhibitors would revolutionize cancer treatment within two years** (James Watson, quoted 1998): This prediction clearly did not materialize. Anti-angiogenic drugs entered clinical practice and became part of standard care for several cancers, but they did not cure cancer or transform outcomes within the predicted timeframe.

• **Cancer treatment moving beyond a single-disease model**: The implicit thesis that cancer is not a single disease requiring multiple approaches has proven accurate. Precision oncology, immunotherapy, and molecular classification have reinforced this view.

• **The specific promise of Folkman's compounds (endostatin/angiostatin)**: These compounds failed to deliver on the revolutionary potential suggested in 1998, underscoring the gap between early-stage research and clinical translation.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This retrospective on Judah Folkman provides insight into scientific hype cycles and the maturation of angiogenesis research, with particular historical value in assessing how visionary concepts translate—or fail to translate—into clinical impact over decades.

## 5. ANALYSIS
The most significant long-term outcome is that while Folkman's core scientific insight—that tumors depend on angiogenesis—was validated and led to FDA-approved therapies, the narrative arc from revolutionary promise to clinical reality illustrates the complexity of drug development. The compounds mentioned in the 1998 article became case studies in managing expectations. Several anti-angiogenic therapies based on Folkman's concept achieved blockbuster status and are now standard of care, saving hundreds of thousands of lives through extended survival and improved quality of life, particularly in colorectal and lung cancers. However, the field settled into a more realistic understanding of anti-angiogenesis as an important but not sufficient strategy, with benefits typically measured in months of additional survival rather than complete remissions, and with notable limitations due to resistance mechanisms and tumor heterogeneity. Folkman's legacy is scientifically validated, even if the translation took decades and the clinical impact was less dramatic than the early hype suggested.
