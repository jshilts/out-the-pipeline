# Aileron Heads Toward the Clinic (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Aileron Therapeutics, a biotechnology company focused on developing "stapled peptides" - a technology intended to stabilize peptide structures to make them more drug-like. At the time of publication in October 2014, Aileron had recently undergone significant corporate restructuring ("cut-back-hard phase") but had successfully raised $48 million in new funding. The company had two main programs: one stapled-peptide candidate already in Phase I trials targeting the growth-hormone pathway (with minimal public updates), and a newer p53-targeted program that the funding was intended to advance. The author expresses cautious optimism about seeing stapled-peptide technology tested clinically, particularly for difficult drug targets like the p53 pathway, while noting the lack of transparency around the existing Phase I candidate.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Development Outcomes:**
- Aileron's lead growth-hormone pathway candidate appears to have failed to advance. There is no record of successful Phase II progression or FDA approval for this program.
- The p53-targeted stapled peptide program referenced in the article advanced into clinical trials. Aileron initiated Phase I studies of ALRN-6924 (their p53-based stapled peptide) around 2016-2017 for various cancer indications.

**Therapeutic Success and Market Impact:**
- ALRN-6924 entered several Phase I/II clinical trials for solid tumors and blood cancers, representing the first clinical validation of stapled-peptide technology against p53 targets.
- However, results from these trials showed limited efficacy. While the drug demonstrated some biological activity, it did not achieve the robust clinical responses needed for regulatory approval or widespread adoption.
- No stapled-peptide drugs received FDA approval through 2024. The technology failed to deliver the breakthrough treatments that were hoped for in 2014.

**Business and Technology Impact:**
- Aileron continued operations but struggled to achieve profitability or significant market success. The company's stock performance reflected the mixed clinical results.
- Stapled-peptide technology failed to achieve widespread adoption in the pharmaceutical industry. While scientifically interesting, the approach did not prove superior to existing modalities like small molecules or monoclonal antibodies for most targets.
- The p53 pathway remained difficult to drug, with stapled peptides providing only incremental progress rather than the transformative breakthrough anticipated.

**Scientific Community Adoption:**
- Stapled peptides found some niche applications in research settings for protein-protein interaction studies, but did not become a mainstream therapeutic modality.
- The approach suffered from challenges with oral bioavailability, manufacturing complexity, and cost - issues that limited commercial viability.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Stapled peptides would successfully reach clinical validation**
  - **Outcome: Partially accurate** - Aileron did advance ALRN-6924 into multiple clinical trials, demonstrating that stapled peptides could be developed as drugs. However, the technology did not achieve the hoped-for clinical success or FDA approvals.

• **Prediction: The p53 pathway program would be a viable therapeutic approach**
  - **Outcome: Inaccurate** - While the p53-targeted program reached clinical testing, it did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy to advance to approval or widespread patient use. The fundamental challenge of drugging p53 remained largely unsolved.

• **Prediction: The technology would prove valuable for "hard-to-drug" targets**
  - **Outcome: Mostly inaccurate** - Stapled peptides did not become the solution for difficult drug targets that was envisioned. The technology faced its own significant limitations and failed to displace existing therapeutic modalities.

• **Implicit prediction: Sufficient funding would enable clinical success**
  - **Outcome: Inaccurate** - Despite raising substantial capital ($48M in 2014 and additional funding subsequently), Aileron did not achieve clinical or commercial success with their stapled-peptide programs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important moment in the development of peptide-based therapeutics, documenting the transition of an innovative technology into clinical testing with realistic acknowledgment of challenges. While the specific predictions were overly optimistic, the case illustrates broader themes about the difficulty of translating novel drug modalities to clinical success.
