I notice that you've asked me to analyze this article, but there appears to be a significant issue: the piece you've provided is about **two historical chemists (Percy Julian and Dorothy Hodgkin)** and Google Doodles honoring them - **not about the biotechnology industry at all**.

This appears to be an incorrect article for the analysis you're requesting. The article focuses on:
- Google Doodles commemorating two pioneering chemists
- Their personal biographies and struggles against discrimination
- Historical context of steroid chemistry development
- Commentary on their scientific achievements and political views
- Thoughts on recognition and diversity in science

There is **no discussion of biotechnology industry trends, predictions, or commercial developments** that would allow for the kind of "benefit of hindsight" analysis you're seeking regarding biotech industry claims.

To properly conduct the analysis you've outlined (summary, history since publication, prediction accuracy, interest ranking), I would need **the actual Science Magazine article about the biotechnology industry** that you intended to provide.

Could you please share the correct article? I'd be happy to provide the thoughtful, critical analysis you're looking for once I have the right material about biotech industry claims and predictions.
