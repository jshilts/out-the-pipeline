# Darn Viruses (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The author begins by apologizing for reduced posting frequency due to being home sick with a viral illness during early January 2016. He describes experiencing symptoms including coughing and chills, and notes that while he felt temporarily better one afternoon, he woke during the night feeling severely unwell—"as if I'd been trampled by a hippo." The article is framed as a personal health update explaining his absence from regular work and blogging activities, with his wife providing chicken soup as care. The piece serves primarily as an explanatory note about the author's health status rather than a substantive discussion of virology or biotechnology.

## 2. HISTORY

This post was a personal health update from Derek Lowe, who writes the "In the Pipeline" blog hosted by Science magazine (originally by AAAS). Lowe is a pharmaceutical industry veteran and medicinal chemist who has maintained this influential blog for many years, providing insider commentary on drug discovery, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical research. The January 2016 period was part of his continued blog operation that has persisted through 2025. No broader developments emerged from this specific post, as it was purely a personal health announcement rather than a commentary on industry developments. The post did not trigger any policy changes, business developments, or scientific advances.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No predictions were made in this article.

## 4. INTEREST
