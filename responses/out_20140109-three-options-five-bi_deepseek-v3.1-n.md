# Three Options With Five Billion to Spend (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article presents a strategic investment dilemma facing pharmaceutical companies at the time: how to allocate $5 billion (the stated average R&D cost to develop one new drug) among three options. Option 1 involves investing in internal R&D using established approaches with declining ~5% ROI. Option 2 focuses on acquiring external product candidates at market prices in a competitive environment. Option 3 proposes funding 50 independent projects exploring completely new drug discovery approaches, each hypothetically offering a 2% chance of doubling future ROI indefinitely.

The author, Derek Lowe, analyzes these alternatives critically. He suggests Option 1 is the safest politically as it spreads accountability across the organization. Option 2 is deemed reasonable as a complement but "insane" as the sole strategy. Option 3 faces skepticism about the feasibility of finding 50 truly novel approaches and doubts about the claimed 2% success probability. Lowe concludes that a prudent CEO would pursue a hybrid approach: enough Option 1 for political cover, sufficient Option 2 to satisfy investors, and the remainder on Option 3.

## 2. HISTORY
In the decade following this 2014 commentary, the pharmaceutical industry landscape evolved significantly:

**R&D Costs and Productivity**: The $5 billion figure, originally sourced from controversial studies, became widely cited but was later challenged by industry analysts who noted that this number includes opportunity costs and varies significantly by therapeutic area. Actual out-of-pocket costs were often estimated at $1-2 billion per approved drug. R&D productivity remained a persistent challenge throughout 2014-2024, with success rates continuing to decline in some therapeutic areas while improving in others like oncology.

**Industry Strategy Evolution**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted hybrid approaches mirroring Lowe's recommendation. Major players like Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis maintained substantial internal R&D (Option 1) while aggressively pursuing external innovation through acquisitions (Option 2). The 2014-2024 period saw significant M&A activity, including Pfizer's $160 billion acquisition of Allergan (2016, later abandoned), Bristol-Myers Squibb's $74 billion acquisition of Celgene (2019), and AbbVie's $63 billion acquisition of Allergan (2020).

**External Innovation Models**: The period witnessed the growth of venture creation models, where companies like Third Rock Ventures, Atlas Venture, and Flagship Pioneering systematically generated new biotech companies (Option 3 approach). Companies increasingly relied on licensing and partnerships with smaller biotech firms rather than pure acquisitions. The biotech sector saw significant IPOs and funding growth, with 2020-2021 marking particularly strong years for biotech investment.

**Drug Discovery Innovation**: Truly novel approaches to drug discovery did emerge, though not at the scale of 50 fundamentally different paradigms. Key developments included CRISPR-based therapies, mRNA vaccine technology (proven decisively during COVID-19), CAR-T cell therapies, antibody-drug conjugates, and AI-driven drug discovery platforms. However, most innovation occurred within established therapeutic modalities rather than entirely new paradigms.

**Policy and Market Changes**: The 2012-2015 period's discussion of drug pricing intensification continued, leading to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which included Medicare drug price negotiation provisions. Payer pressures and reimbursement challenges mentioned in the original context remained central industry concerns throughout the decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's implicit and explicit predictions about industry behavior and innovation:

**Prediction**: That Option 1 (internal R&D) would remain the default "cover your backside" strategy while Option 2 (acquisitions) would be pursued to complement rather than replace internal efforts. **Outcome**: **Accurate**. The 2014-2024 period consistently showed major pharma companies maintaining internal R&D infrastructure while using strategic acquisitions to supplement pipelines, particularly in therapeutic areas where they lacked internal expertise or needed late-stage assets.

**Prediction**: That finding 50 "completely new and different" approaches to drug R&D was unrealistic. **Outcome**: **Accurate**. While significant scientific innovations occurred (CRISPR, mRNA vaccines, immuno-oncology), they did not represent 50 fundamentally distinct paradigms. Most advances built incrementally on existing platforms rather than creating wholly new discovery frameworks.

**Prediction**: That the claimed 2% success probability for novel approaches was overly optimistic. **Outcome**: **Broadly accurate**. Clinical success rates for novel mechanisms remained challenging. While some breakthrough therapies succeeded, many experimental approaches failed in clinical trials, consistent with historical industry patterns rather than dramatic improvements in success probabilities.

**Implicit Prediction**: That CEOs would maintain plausible deniability through diversified investment strategies. **Outcome**: **Consistent with observed behavior**. Pharmaceutical executives continued to balance multiple investment strategies, often emphasizing external partnerships and acquisitions in investor communications while maintaining internal discovery capabilities.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article represents a thoughtful and durable analysis of persistent pharmaceutical industry strategic challenges. It captures the fundamental tension between innovation risk and corporate accountability that has remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade, though the specific framing and some cost assumptions have aged.
