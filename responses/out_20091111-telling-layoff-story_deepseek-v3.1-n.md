# Telling the Layoff Story (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the wave of layoffs happening at major pharmaceutical companies, specifically focusing on Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. The author expresses concern about the fundamental changes occurring in how pharmaceutical research is conducted, suggesting that the traditional models and expectations for drug discovery are being disrupted. The piece was published in The Atlantic's Business section with the goal of reaching a broader audience beyond industry insiders. A key theme is that these layoffs represent more than routine corporate restructuring—they signal a systemic shift in the research paradigm that the author believes is still in its early stages, with potentially long-lasting implications for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2009-2012 period marked a significant transformation in Big Pharma. Pfizer, which had acquired Wyeth in 2009 for $68 billion, went through multiple rounds of layoffs affecting tens of thousands of employees as it consolidated operations and shifted away from traditional small-molecule research toward biologics and specialized therapies. Johnson & Johnson also restructured significantly during this period.

The subsequent decade (2010-2020) saw several concrete developments:

**Research Model Changes**: Many large pharmaceutical companies moved away from internal discovery-heavy models toward more external partnerships, in-licensing, and acquisitions of smaller biotech companies with promising pipelines. This "external innovation" strategy became predominant.

**Major Successes**: The period saw breakthrough approvals like Harvoni (2014) for hepatitis C, Keytruda (2014) for cancer immunotherapy, and multiple CAR-T therapies (2017+), demonstrating that innovation continued but often came from smaller biotechs later acquired or partnered.

**Pipeline Outcomes**: Many traditional research areas like cardiovascular drugs faced high failure rates, while oncology, rare diseases, and immunology became dominant therapeutic areas with higher success rates and pricing power.

**Industry Consolidation**: Continued M&A activity reshaped the landscape, with companies like Actelion, Pharmacyclics, and others being acquired for billions, validating the strategy of letting smaller companies bear early-stage risk.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Early stages of a long process"** - This prediction proved accurate. The 2010s saw continued restructuring across Big Pharma, with companies like AstraZeneca, Novartis, and others undergoing multiple rounds of site closures and workforce reductions. The traditional fully-integrated R&D model continued to decline.

• **Fundamental change in research expectations** - Validated. The industry shifted decisively toward external innovation models, with most major pharma companies now deriving 40-70% of their pipelines from external sources rather than internal discovery.

• **Pfizer's trajectory** - The company continued downsizing traditional research while making strategic shifts. Notably, Pfizer successfully acquired Hospira (2015), Medivation (2016), and eventually spun off its generics business as Viatris (2020), then acquired Array BioPharma (2019) and Trillium Therapeutics (2021), showing the predicted long-term strategic evolution.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article correctly identified a major structural shift in pharmaceutical R&D that continued to unfold over the subsequent decade. While the specific layoff news was timely, the broader insight about systemic change to research models made it more significant than typical business news.
