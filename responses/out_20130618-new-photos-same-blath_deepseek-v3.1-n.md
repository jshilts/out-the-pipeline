# New Photos, Same Blather (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This personal blog post from June 2013 features updated photographs of the author, replacing decade-old images on their website. The post includes nostalgic commentary about a progression through time, noting that some elements remain constant—the author's beard and a T.S. Eliot paperback visible in a 1983 photograph. The author also provides context about laboratory equipment in the old photo, mentioning an uncleaned flash column and TLC plates, and reflects on their past work in carbohydrate chemistry involving nitrone formation and cycloaddition reactions. The author notes they haven't performed nitrone reactions since that earlier period.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a personal blog post rather than a commentary about the biotechnology industry. The content focuses entirely on personal photographs and reminiscences about past laboratory work, with no substantive discussion of biotech industry topics, research developments, policy changes, or commercial activities. There is no biotechnology industry analysis, predictions, or substantive content to evaluate in terms of subsequent real-world developments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No predictions about biotechnology or scientific developments are made in this article. The content is purely retrospective and personal in nature.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article is completely off-topic for the requested biotechnology industry commentary analysis, as it contains no relevant industry content, scientific analysis, or research discussion.
