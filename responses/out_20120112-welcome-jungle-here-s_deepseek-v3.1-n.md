# Welcome To the Jungle! Here's Your Panther (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 blog post discusses the challenges of drug discovery through the lens of a failed research partnership between Eli Lilly and Indian pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila. The author notes that while companies were looking to India and China to cut drug development costs, the fundamental problem wasn't expenses but rather the intrinsic difficulty and low success rate of drug discovery itself.

The article argues that early-stage research costs are minimal compared to expensive Phase III clinical trials, making cost savings from offshore partnerships relatively insignificant. The real costs in drug discovery are opportunity costs—wrong target selection, pursuing the wrong lead compounds, or missing viable programs—which cannot be solved by geographic relocation. The author concludes that while cost savings might seem attractive, they don't address the core challenge of navigating the unpredictable "jungle" of drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following this 2012 article revealed several relevant developments in pharmaceutical outsourcing and drug discovery economics:

**Clinical Success Rates:** Academic studies confirmed the article's underlying premise about drug discovery difficulty. Research published in 2018 analyzing clinical development success rates from 2006-2015 showed overall likelihood of approval (LOA) from Phase I at approximately 9.6%, with even lower rates for certain therapeutic areas—validating that "the success rate has not been very high anywhere."

**Offshoring Evolution:** The prediction that cost advantages in India and China would diminish proved accurate. By the mid-2010s, labor costs in these regions had indeed risen significantly, narrowing the gap with Western countries. However, pharmaceutical outsourcing to these regions continued to grow, though it shifted toward more mature capabilities rather than just cost savings.

**R&D Cost Trends:** Contrary to hopes of cost reduction, drug development costs continued to escalate. Studies showed average R&D costs per approved drug exceeded $2.5 billion by the mid-2010s, with Phase III trials indeed representing the largest expense component as predicted.

**Notable Outcomes:** Several major pharmaceutical companies restructured their R&D operations during this period, often moving away from geographic cost arbitrage models toward capability-driven partnerships, supporting the article's skepticism about simple cost-cutting approaches to drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1:** That cost advantages in India and China would diminish over time  
**Outcome:** ✅ **Accurate** - Labor and operational costs in major Indian and Chinese pharmaceutical hubs did increase substantially through the 2010s, reducing the pure cost-arbitrage benefits.

**Prediction 2:** That success rates would remain low regardless of geographic location  
**Outcome:** ✅ **Accurate** - Clinical development success rates remained stubbornly low throughout the decade, with overall Phase I to approval rates staying under 10%.

**Prediction 3:** That early-stage research costs would remain small compared to clinical trials  
**Outcome:** ✅ **Accurate** - Phase III trials continued to dominate pharmaceutical R&D budgets, with early-stage research representing a smaller fraction of total development costs.

**Prediction 4:** That simply moving research offshore wouldn't solve fundamental drug discovery challenges  
**Outcome:** ✅ **Accurate** - The industry gradually recognized that successful drug discovery required capabilities and scientific judgment rather than geographic cost advantages, leading to more sophisticated partnership models.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrated prescient understanding of pharmaceutical economics and correctly identified that fundamental discovery challenges—not just costs—drive drug development outcomes. Its insights about opportunity costs and the limitations of geographic cost arbitrage proved remarkably durable and relevant as the industry evolved through the decade.
