# Biomarkers, Revisited. Unfortunately. (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article laments the gap between the early hype around genetic and molecular “biomarkers” and the modest, often disappointing reality that followed. It points to a 2011 JAMA meta‑analysis by John Ioannidis and Orestes Panagiotou, which examined the 35 most‑cited biomarker papers from the previous two decades. The analysis found that only one‑fifth of those markers achieved a ≥35 % increase in disease risk—a threshold the author deems necessary for clinical usefulness. In follow‑up studies, 29 of the 35 markers showed weaker associations, and the original highly‑cited reports were rarely the largest or most robust studies. The piece concludes that most highly‑cited biomarkers have little practical value and that scientists should treat new findings with healthy skepticism.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 validation landscape**  
- **Systematic replication efforts**: Large consortia (e.g., the International Cancer Biomarker Consortium, the NIH Biomarkers Consortium, and the UK Biobank) have deliberately re‑tested previously reported biomarkers in cohorts that are an order of magnitude larger than the original studies. The majority of single‑marker claims have failed to replicate, confirming Ioannidis’s conclusions.  
- **Regulatory response**: The U.S. FDA formalised its **Biomarker Qualification Program (BQP)** in 2014, explicitly requiring independent validation, predefined statistical thresholds, and a clear path to regulatory acceptance. Few of the 35 markers from the 2011 JAMA paper have entered the BQP pipeline; most have been abandoned or relegated to research use only.  
- **Shift to multi‑marker panels**: Recognising that single‑analyte effect sizes are typically modest, the industry moved toward **multivariate signatures** (e.g., proteomic panels for early‑stage ovarian cancer, metabolomic risk scores for cardiovascular disease). Some of these panels have achieved FDA clearance (e.g., the **Oncotype DX** breast‑cancer recurrence score, the **Prosigna** assay), but they are the exception rather than the rule.  
- **Genomics and polygenic risk scores (PRS)**: Genome‑wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of disease‑associated loci, but each contributes <10 % relative risk. PRS, which aggregate many loci, have shown modest predictive improvement for diseases such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Clinical adoption remains limited to niche settings (e.g., cardiology risk stratification in some health systems).  
- **Biomarker failures and market impact**: Companies that built pipelines around single‑gene or protein markers reported setbacks. Notable examples include the collapse of **Cymabay’s** hepatitis C biomarker program (later repurposed) and the withdrawal of several Alzheimer’s fluid‑biomarker candidates after phase‑III failures. Conversely, firms that invested early in rigorous validation (e.g., **Guardant Health** with circulating‑tumor‑DNA panels) have seen commercial success.  
- **Cultural change in publishing**: Journals have tightened statistical standards for biomarker claims (e.g., requiring larger discovery cohorts, external validation cohorts, and transparent reporting of effect sizes). Pre‑registration of biomarker studies and the use of **STARD** (Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy) guidelines have become more common.  

**Overall impact**: The 2011 critique helped accelerate a field‑wide move from “discover‑and‑publish” to “discover‑validate‑regulate.” While the number of *published* biomarker claims continues to rise, the proportion that reaches clinical implementation has remained low (estimates <5 % of reported markers).  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article**: “Only a small fraction of highly‑cited biomarkers will prove useful in practice; most will not replicate in larger studies.”  
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Follow‑up meta‑analyses (e.g., 2015 – 2020 systematic reviews of cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative biomarkers) report replication rates of 10‑20 % for single‑marker claims.  
- **Implicit prediction**: “The field needs better validation before biomarkers can influence trial design, regulation, or marketing.”  
  - **Outcome**: Realised. The FDA BQP, NIH consortia, and industry‑wide adoption of large, prospective validation cohorts have become standard practice.  
- **Implicit prediction**: “Biomarker hype will wane and be replaced by more rigorous, often multi‑parameter approaches.”  
  - **Outcome**: Largely true. Multi‑omics panels and PRS have supplanted many single‑analyte pursuits, though hype cycles still occur (e.g., circulating‑tumor‑DNA in early‑cancer screening).  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **8/10**  
The article is a concise, prescient critique that anticipated a major shift toward reproducibility and regulatory rigor in biomarker science—a shift that has shaped research funding, drug development, and clinical diagnostics over the past decade.
