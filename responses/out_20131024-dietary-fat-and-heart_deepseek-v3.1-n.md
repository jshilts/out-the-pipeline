# Dietary Fat and Heart Disease (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a controversial BMJ commentary by Aseem Malhotra challenging the long-standing consensus that saturated fat causes heart disease. The author notes that lipidology is complex and our understanding is still evolving, despite decades of research. Malhotra argues that saturated fat has been "demonized" since Ancel Keys's influential "seven countries" study in 1970, which showed correlation but not causation. The article highlights that reducing saturated fat intake primarily affects large, buoyant LDL particles rather than the small, dense LDL particles that are more strongly implicated in cardiovascular disease. The role of statin drugs is also questioned—while they show proven benefit in secondary prevention (post-heart attack) with an NNT of 83 over five years for mortality, their benefit in primary prevention is more modest (NNT of 345 to prevent one cardiovascular event per year in low-risk patients). The article raises concerns about whether the benefits of statins come from their cholesterol-lowering effects or other "pleiotropic" mechanisms like anti-inflammatory properties, especially since other cholesterol-lowering drugs haven't shown mortality benefits.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following this 2013 article saw significant evolution in dietary fat recommendations and cardiovascular research:

**Dietary Guidelines Changes**: By 2015-2020, major dietary guidelines began softening their stance on saturated fat. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans removed the strict cap on total fat intake (previously 30% of calories) and the specific saturated fat limit of 10%. They instead emphasized overall dietary patterns rather than isolated macronutrients. This shift reflected growing evidence that the source of saturated fat matters more than total amount.

**Continued Statin Success**: Statins remained the cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention throughout this period. New guidelines expanded their use for primary prevention, and real-world evidence continued supporting their effectiveness. However, the mechanism debate persisted—although subsequent research suggested both cholesterol-lowering and pleiotropic effects contribute to their benefits.

**HDL Research Setbacks**: The article's concerns about HDL-raising therapies proved prescient. Multiple large trials of HDL-raising drugs failed to show cardiovascular benefits, including the 2013 AIM-HIGH trial (with niacin added to statins) and 2017 ACCELERATE trial of evacetrapib. These failures reinforced the critique that simply changing lipid numbers doesn't guarantee health outcomes.

**Continued LDL Particle Research**: Research on different LDL particle sizes advanced, with studies generally confirming that small dense LDL particles are more atherogenic. However, routine clinical measurement of LDL particle subfractions did not become standard practice due to cost and interpretation complexity, though specialized testing grew in certain contexts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made no explicit numerical predictions about specific outcomes, timelines, or adoption pathways, so this section cannot be formally evaluated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article is highly interesting because it presaged a major shift in dietary guidelines and highlighted important tensions in how cardiovascular risk is understood and managed. It identified real uncertainties that subsequently played out in clinical practice and public health recommendations, making it more insightful than most contemporary commentary.
