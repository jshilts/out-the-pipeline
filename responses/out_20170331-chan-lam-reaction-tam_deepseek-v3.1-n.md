# The Chan-Lam Reaction, Tamed At Last (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 article discusses a breakthrough in understanding and optimizing the Chan-Lam reaction, a copper-catalyzed coupling reaction used in organic synthesis to form carbon-nitrogen bonds between organoboronic acids/esters and amines. The reaction had been notoriously unreliable and temperamental, often failing unpredictably when reaction conditions or starting materials were varied even slightly.

The article describes a systematic mechanistic study from the Watson group at Strathclyde University in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline, building on earlier work by Shannon Stahl's group. The research revealed that the reaction's unreliability stemmed from several factors: the equilibrium involving copper acetate paddlewheel dimers that must dissociate to form active monocopper species, inhibition by pinacol (released from boronate esters), and the critical role of Cu(I) re-oxidation to Cu(II) using molecular oxygen. The key breakthrough was the discovery that adding triethylamine and boric acid as additives could solve most of these problems—triethylamine helps regenerate active copper species while boric acid complexes with inhibitory pinacol.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2017 publication, the Chan-Lam reaction gained significantly improved reliability and broader adoption in synthetic chemistry applications. The mechanistic insights and practical conditions reported in this work have been widely adopted by synthetic chemists in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials research.

The Watson/GSK protocol has been incorporated into numerous subsequent synthetic methodologies and has appeared in hundreds of research publications. Pharmaceutical companies have benefited from more predictable C-N bond formation, particularly in drug discovery programs where the complementary reactivity of Chan-Lam compared to palladium-catalyzed couplings is valuable. Several drug candidates in clinical development have utilized Chan-Lam couplings in their synthetic routes.

The reaction has also been extended beyond amination to include etherification and thioetherification processes using similar mechanistic insights. The improved reliability has made Chan-Lam couplings more attractive for automated synthesis platforms and flow chemistry applications.
