# We Don't Know What We're Missing (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a Science paper about the search for undiscovered types of life that current microbiological methods may be missing. The author notes that many microorganisms cannot be cultured, and environmental DNA sampling has revealed odd sequences from undescribed bacteria and archaea. However, the piece raises the possibility that current detection methods might be missing major undiscovered life forms entirely.

The article explains several limitations: "universal" 16S rRNA primers used to detect bacteria and archaea can miss major lineages due to primer mismatches; single-cell genome sequencing relies on these same primers; metagenomic analyses focus on known genes and genomes; and samples have been collected from only a tiny fraction of Earth's environments. The authors speculate that highly divergent branches of life might exist, possibly representing unknown domains whose marker genes differ extensively from known bacterial and archaeal branches. The piece even suggests that hypothetical "RNA world" organisms from early life might still exist in protected environments like deep rocks, undetectable by current methods.

## 2. HISTORY
The decade following this 2014 article saw significant developments in microbial discovery, though many fundamental questions remain unresolved. Major discoveries did occur—researchers identified entirely new bacterial phyla like CPR (Candidate Phyla Radiation) and DPANN archaea that were previously missed by traditional methods, validating the article's concerns about primer bias and detection limitations.

However, the more dramatic predictions about finding completely different domains of life or RNA world organisms have not materialized. No fundamentally new domains of life beyond Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya have been discovered, though the Asgard archaea discovered around 2017 provided crucial insights into eukaryotic origins. Extensive deep subsurface and extreme environment sampling has revealed remarkable microbial diversity, but organisms remain within known phylogenetic frameworks.

The article anticipated the "petabases of metagenomic sequence data" that indeed emerged—today's databases contain vastly more environmental sequences than in 2014. Yet analysis biases persist: researchers still struggle with analyzing "microbial dark matter" sequences that don't match known genomes. While metagenomics has become standard practice and single-cell genomics has advanced significantly, primer bias remains a recognized limitation.

No concrete policy changes or approved drugs resulted specifically from this microbial dark matter research, though basic discoveries about microbial biochemistry have ongoing implications for antibiotic development and biotechnology. The field has advanced methodologically but has not produced the revolutionary discoveries about extraterrestrial life or RNA world organisms that the article contemplated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"Undiscovered and highly divergent branches of life may exist, possibly represented by domains":** This has not been confirmed. While many new bacterial and archaeal lineages were discovered (CPR, DPANN, Asgard archaea), no fundamentally new domains beyond the three recognized domains of life emerged.

• **"RNA world organisms from the beginning of living systems might still be found in remote, protected environments":** No RNA world organisms have been discovered, though extremophiles in deep subsurface environments continue to be studied.

• **"The day when we have some [extraterrestrial organisms] to argue about is, I think, closer than many might think":** This prediction proved overly optimistic. No confirmed extraterrestrial organisms have been found despite continued Mars exploration and exoplanet studies.

• **Implicit prediction that improved sequencing would reveal dramatically different life forms:** While massive sequencing efforts revealed extensive previously unknown diversity, organisms remained within evolutionary frameworks scientists already understood.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5**

The article highlighted important limitations in microbial detection methods that were prescient and technically accurate, and the concerns about primer bias were validated by subsequent discoveries of previously missed microbial lineages. However, the more dramatic speculations about RNA world organisms and extraterrestrial life discovery timelines were overly optimistic, and the piece's long-term importance was moderate rather than transformative.
