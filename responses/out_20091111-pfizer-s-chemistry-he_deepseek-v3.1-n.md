# Pfizer's Chemistry Head Count - Really? (Nov 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article presents internal figures on Pfizer's chemistry staffing changes following its 2009 merger with Wyeth. Pre-merger Pfizer had approximately 900 chemists, and Wyeth brought roughly 350, leading observers to expect a combined department around 1,000 chemists. However, the actual post-merger chemistry headcount was reportedly headed to about 850—smaller than Pfizer alone before the merger. The author speculates this reduction reflects increased reliance on outsourced chemistry, questioning whether Pfizer can realistically become a larger company with a smaller internal research staff. The cuts were reportedly more severe than expected, particularly surprising to Wyeth personnel.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2009 Pfizer-Wyeth merger occurred during a broader pharmaceutical industry trend toward outsourcing and restructuring R&D operations. In subsequent years, major pharma companies continued shifting chemistry and manufacturing services to contract research organizations (CROs) and external partners, particularly for early-stage discovery work.

Pfizer implemented significant R&D restructuring in 2010-2011, including closing several research sites. However, the company maintained substantial internal chemistry capabilities for core therapeutic areas. The industry-wide shift toward externalized drug discovery accelerated through the 2010s, with CROs like WuXi AppTec, Charles River Laboratories, and Covance expanding rapidly to meet demand.

By the late 2010s, most major pharmaceutical companies had adopted hybrid models combining internal discovery teams with extensive external partnerships. Pfizer's strategy evolved to maintain smaller, more focused internal chemistry groups while leveraging external providers for specific capabilities or capacity needs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about internal research staff capabilities**: The article questioned whether a larger company could succeed with a smaller research staff. **Outcome**: Major pharma companies indeed became larger with smaller permanent research staffs through extensive outsourcing to CROs and academic partnerships.

• **Implicit assumption about outsourcing as the solution**: The author speculated that outsourced chemistry was making up the deficit. **Outcome**: This proved largely accurate. The CRO industry grew substantially in 2010-2020, handling significant portions of pharmaceutical chemistry work.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **4/10**

This article captures an important strategic shift in pharmaceutical R&D organization, but focuses on staffing numbers rather than scientific or clinical implications, limiting its broader significance.
