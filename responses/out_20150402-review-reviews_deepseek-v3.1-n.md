# Review of Reviews (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This short article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog provides brief commentary on five recent review papers across different biotechnology areas of interest in 2015. The covered topics include: therapeutic applications of stapled peptides, therapeutic human genome editing, late-stage modifications to complex drug structures, pharmacokinetic strategies for altering volume of drug distribution, and progress in organ-on-a-chip models. The author presents these as recent literature highlights for researchers to catch up on, with a humorous closing reference to a George Booth cartoon suggesting the constant churn of new scientific publications.

## 2. HISTORY

**Stapled Peptides**: After 2015, stapled peptides saw continued research but with mixed therapeutic success. While promising preclinically for targets like BCL-2 family proteins in cancer, no stapled peptide drugs received FDA approval through 2020-2023. The technology has shown utility in basic research and target validation, but has faced challenges with tissue penetration, stability, and manufacturing scalability for widespread clinical adoption. Some candidates advanced through Phase I/II trials but failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy and safety margins, and have largely remained a niche research tool with limited late-stage clinical pipeline presence.

**Therapeutic Human Genome Editing**: This field experienced revolutionary growth following 2015, catalyzed by the maturation of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The first FDA-approved gene therapy in the US came in 2017 (Luxturna for inherited retinal disease), followed by approvals for Zolgensma (2019, SMA), and others. Gene editing approaches using CRISPR entered clinical trials around 2018-2019 for blood disorders like sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, with early promising results. Casgevy (CTX001), the first CRISPR-based therapy, received approval in the UK and US in late 2023/early 2024 for these conditions. However, significant challenges around cost (>$2M for some therapies), delivery, manufacturing, and off-target effects have limited broader adoption. The field has also grown to encompass base editing and prime editing approaches. Applications expanded beyond rare diseases to cancer immunotherapy (CAR-T cells) and metabolic diseases, though remains primarily focused on rare genetic disorders.

**Late-stage Drug Modifications**: Post-2015, late-stage modification strategies have become increasingly important tools for optimizing drug properties, especially for complex molecules like peptides, oligonucleotides, and antibody-drug conjugates. Approaches like PEGylation, lipidation, and conjugation have enabled improved pharmacokinetics, targeted delivery, and extended half-life for various therapeutics. Technologies for site-specific modifications, click chemistry applications, and novel linker chemistries have advanced significantly, becoming standard tools for drug optimization programs. Many approved biologics now incorporate such strategies, indicating good research utility, though no distinct approvals have single-handedly transformed pharmaceutical development paradigms.

**Organ-on-a-Chip Models**: This technology has seen substantial investment and gradual advancement since 2015, with companies like Emulate developing commercial systems. These models have demonstrated clinical predictive potential in certain areas, particularly for liver toxicity, gut permeability, and kidney injury studies. FDA has begun incorporating organ-chip data into regulatory decision-making, including as alternatives to animal testing in certain contexts. Adoption remains partial in industry, with applications mainly confined to preclinical validation and specific mechanistic studies rather than full replacement of animal models. The technology has shown promising results for personalized medicine applications and complex disease modeling, but scalability and standardization challenges have limited widespread routine use in drug development pipelines through the early 2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made no explicit predictions about future developments—it was structured as a summary of recent literature rather than a prognostic piece.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **4/10**
The article serves primarily as a brief literature roundup with minimal original analysis or forward-looking insight, reducing its long-term importance compared to more substantial reviews despite covering topics of significant future impact.
