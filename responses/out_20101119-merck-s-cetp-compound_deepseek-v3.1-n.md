# Merck's CETP Compound: Still Alive, But The Big Fun Awaits (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2010 commentary discusses Merck's CETP inhibitor anacetrapib following the release of new clinical trial data. Four years after Pfizer's torcetrapib failed in Phase III trials due to increased mortality despite raising HDL cholesterol, Merck's compound showed promising results in reducing LDL and raising HDL when added to statin therapy. The author notes that while these lipid effects are expected based on the CETP mechanism, the real concern remains whether the drug would improve actual cardiovascular outcomes and avoid the off-target effects that plagued torcetrapib. The article highlights that the mechanism behind torcetrapib's failure was still not fully understood, and while Merck's compound appeared to avoid the blood pressure elevation seen with torcetrapib, only a large Phase III trial measuring real-world cardiovascular outcomes could determine if the drug would succeed. The completion of such a trial was not expected until 2015 at the earliest.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent history of anacetrapib and the CETP inhibitor class largely validated the article's cautious tone. Merck's large Phase III REVEAL trial (Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib through Lipid-modification), involving over 30,000 patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, finally completed in 2017. The results showed that while anacetrapib modestly reduced the risk of major coronary events compared to placebo (10.8% vs 11.8% over 4 years), the absolute benefit was small. More importantly, while not showing the same concerning mortality signals as torcetrapib, anacetrapib did demonstrate significant accumulation in adipose tissue, raising long-term safety concerns.

Despite these results, Merck ultimately decided not to pursue FDA approval for anacetrapib, instead choosing to focus resources on other cardiovascular drugs in their pipeline. This marked the effective end of the CETP inhibitor class as a viable therapeutic approach, as other companies had already abandoned their programs following earlier failures.

The broader field learned that simply raising HDL cholesterol levels through CETP inhibition does not necessarily translate into meaningful cardiovascular benefits, challenging the longstanding "HDL-good" hypothesis and suggesting the complexity of lipid metabolism exceeds simple HDL-raising strategies. This episode contributed to the field's evolving understanding that HDL functionality and composition may be more important than absolute HDL levels.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article, published in November 2010, contained several predictions and expectations:

- **Predicted outcome timeline**: The author stated that results from the big Phase III trial measuring real-world cardiovascular outcomes would not be available "until 2015 at the earliest." 
  - **Reality**: This prediction was accurate. The REVEAL trial results were published in September 2017, somewhat later than the earliest estimate but within the expected timeframe.

- **Predicted binary outcome scenarios**: The author suggested the compound would either "help a lot of people" or "tell us something really significant that we didn't know about human lipid handling."
  - **Reality**: The drug fell somewhere in between—it showed a modest benefit but raised additional concerns about long-term tissue accumulation, ultimately not meeting the threshold for commercial development.

- **Expected interim monitoring**: The author noted that unexpected bad news would likely emerge earlier through interim monitoring.
  - **Reality**: No major safety signals emerged during the interim periods that halted the trial, suggesting Merck avoided torcetrapib's specific toxicity issues.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article demonstrates solid scientific hindsight value by accurately anticipating the key challenges that would ultimately determine the fate of CETP inhibitors. The author's cautious, evidence-based approach to evaluating the gap between biomarker effects and clinical outcomes proved prescient. While not the most dramatic drug failure in pharmaceutical history, the CETP inhibitor saga represents an important case study in cardiovascular drug development and the limitations of oversimplified biological hypotheses.
