# Novocure's RF Device Shows Efficacy (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Novocure's unconventional Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain cancer. Initially skeptical due to the electromagnetic field approach often associated with questionable medical claims, the author acknowledges the device's clinical limitations in treatment-resistant patients, where all therapies perform poorly. The significant development reported is that Novocure's EF-14 Phase III trial in newly diagnosed GBM patients was terminated early due to efficacy, showing improved progression-free and overall survival when combining the device with standard temozolomide chemotherapy. The proposed mechanism involves RF fields disrupting cellular structures during mitosis. Following these positive results, Novocure announced plans for an IPO.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Validation and FDA Approvals:**
- **2015 (October):** FDA approved the NovoTTF-100A System for newly diagnosed GBM based on the EF-14 trial results
- **2011:** The device had previously received FDA approval for recurrent GBM

**Trial Data Publication:**
The full EF-14 trial results were published, demonstrating in newly diagnosed GBM patients:
- Median overall survival: 20.9 months (TTFields + temozolomide) vs 16.0 months (temozolomide alone)
- Progression-free survival: 6.7 months vs 4.0 months
- Five-year survival rates of approximately 13% vs 5%

**Commercial Development:**
- Novocure successfully completed its IPO and became a publicly traded company
- The company expanded into multiple solid tumor types beyond GBM
- Optune became the brand name for the commercial device

**Clinical Adoption:**
- Optune devices were integrated into treatment protocols at major cancer centers
- National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines included TTFields as a treatment option for GBM
- Insurance coverage expanded, including Medicare

**Pipeline Expansion:**
Novocure initiated clinical trials investigating TTFields in:
- Mesothelioma (EF-31/LUNAR trials)
- Non-small cell lung cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Ovarian cancer
- Other solid tumors

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's predictions/implicit expectations:**
- **Would want to see publication of trial data** → ✓ *Fulfilled: Full trial results were published in peer-reviewed journals, allowing medical community evaluation*
- **Survival benefits were real but modest** → ✓ *Accurate: The survival improvements were statistically significant but still represented incremental rather than transformational advances for GBM*
- **Not a glioblastoma cure** → ✓ *Accurate: TTFields extended survival but did not provide curative treatment*

**Broader implications evaluation:**

**Drug/Device Outcomes:**
- The TTFields approach delivered on the EF-14 trial promise, leading to FDA approval and clinical adoption
- Real-world patient uptake occurred, with devices used in clinical practice
- Cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life considerations became part of treatment discussions

**Technology/Mechanism Success:**
The underlying TTFields concept gained scientific credibility:
- Multiple clinical trials were initiated across different tumor types
- Mechanistic studies continued investigating the anti-mitotic effects
- The approach became established as a viable physical cancer treatment modality

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article covered a significant development in cancer therapy where an unconventional physical treatment approach achieved clinical validation. The topic ranks highly due to the successful translation from skepticism to FDA-approved therapy that reached patients, representing a rare new modality in oncology treatment.
