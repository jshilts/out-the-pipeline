# The Smallest Drugs (27 Aug 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article presents a curated list of "smallest drugs" by setting an arbitrary molecular weight cutoff at aspirin's 180 Da. The author applies several filters: excluding inhaled anesthetics, limiting to organic compounds, and requiring current use across multiple countries (which excludes withdrawn drugs like pemoline). The piece observes that this small-molecule space is dominated by carboxylic acids, phenols, and more sulfur-containing compounds than typical drug discovery would expect, with most compounds being highly polar—necessary for making strong interactions when working in fragment-sized chemical space.

The author notes that some compounds are highly specialized (e.g., pralidoxime for nerve gas exposure), while others like metformin represent blockbuster drugs that defy modern medicinal chemistry prejudices about drug-likeness. The article frames these small molecules as the "bedrock layer" of fragment-based drug discovery and counsels medicinal chemists to keep an open mind about fragment-sized compounds, as they can indeed become successful drugs.

## 2. HISTORY

Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), which these small drugs represent the extreme end of, has continued to mature significantly since 2014. The field has evolved from an academic curiosity to an established drug discovery approach.

Several fragment-derived drugs have advanced through development and gained regulatory approval. Most notably, **venetoclax** (Venclexta), a BCL-2 inhibitor for certain leukemias, was approved by the FDA in 2016 and represented a major success for FBDD—though it's significantly larger than the sub-180 compounds discussed in the article. The approach has proven particularly valuable for challenging targets like protein-protein interactions, where traditional small molecules often struggle.

However, the very smallest compounds (sub-200 MW) have remained challenging for new drug development. The approved drugs in this category remain dominated by older compounds discovered through phenotypic screening rather than target-based approaches. Metformin remains the most important example, continuing as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes with expanded applications studied.

The field of FBDD has shifted emphasis from simply finding fragments to developing robust strategies for fragment-to-lead expansion—the critical step of growing fragments into drug-sized molecules while maintaining favorable properties.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's key implied predictions and their outcomes:

• **Fragment-based drug discovery would mature into productive drug discovery**: ✓ **Correct**. FBDD has become an established methodology with approved drugs (venetoclax being the flagship example) and numerous candidates in clinical development across pharmaceutical companies.

• **Small fragments can be "real drugs"**: ✓ **Correct but limited**. The smallest compounds (sub-180 MW) continue to be mostly older drugs discovered historically, with very few new sub-200 compounds entering the market since 2014. The sweet spot for new drugs remains typically 300-500 MW.

• **Polarity and hydrogen bonding groups essential for small fragments**: ✓ **Correct**. The observation about carboxylic acids and phenols aligns with established FBDD principles—fragments need strong polar interactions to achieve meaningful binding when lacking the mass of typical drugs.

• **Metformin as exemplar defying medicinal chemistry prejudices**: ✓ **Correct and ongoing**. Metformin's continued use and expanded research (including anti-aging applications) reinforces the author's point. However, no new blockbuster drugs of similar unconventional structure have emerged in this smallest size range.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an interesting chemical perspective on the smallest successful drugs, but its scope is too limited to capture major trends in drug discovery. It served primarily as a thought-provoking exercise about drug-likeness assumptions rather than a forward-looking analysis of biotechnology industry developments. The connection to fragment-based drug discovery adds relevance, though the field has evolved considerably beyond these simplest examples.
