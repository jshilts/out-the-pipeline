# Meeting Logistics for MIT Food Truck Gathering in Cambridge (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This appears to be a logistical planning post from October 7, 2013, written to coordinate a meetup in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The organizer is proposing Thursday, October 10th at 12 noon as the meeting time, and is soliciting input on venue options. The discussion centers around the MIT food truck area and alternatives, weighing factors like seating capacity, food options, and crowd management. The proposed locations include the food truck area proper, an indoor food court for rain backup, and a canal-side plaza near kayak facilities with more open space but limited food service capacity.

## 2. HISTORY
As this is an event logistics coordination post rather than an article about biotechnology, scientific research, or industry commentary, there is no subsequent biotech industry history to analyze. This appears to be a scheduling and venue planning discussion among individuals organizing a local gathering, possibly related to some professional or academic interest group in the Cambridge/MIT area.
