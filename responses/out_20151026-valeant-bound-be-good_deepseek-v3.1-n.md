# Valeant: Bound to be a Good Explanation, Right? (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from October 2015 describes the unfolding scandal around Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a company facing allegations of fraudulent practices through its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services. The author cites investigative reports from Bronte Capital, SIRF, and the Wall Street Journal revealing that Valeant used Philidor as a hidden channel to inflate revenue figures. Evidence included shared phone numbers and websites between supposedly unrelated companies, prescriptions being mailed to states where Philidor wasn't licensed to operate, employees using aliases of comic-book superheroes, and Valeant staff physically working at Philidor while concealing their identities.

The article discusses Valeant's scheduled press conference with an 88-slide PowerPoint presentation attempting to explain these practices, predicting the stock would "hit the floor again like a frozen turkey." The author criticizes Valeant's entire business model of taking on debt to acquire companies, stripping out R&D spending, and funding operations through steep drug price increases. The piece suggests this "free-riding" approach had natural size limits and that Valeant had likely exceeded them, leading to the "creatively aggressive tactics" being uncovered.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in October 2015, Valeant's crisis intensified dramatically. Within months, the company's stock plummeted from over \$200 per share to under \$20 by early 2016, losing approximately 90% of its market value. CEO Michael Pearson and CFO Howard Schiller were forced to testify before the U.S. Senate in April 2016 regarding the company's drug pricing practices.

In 2016, Valeant cut ties with Philidor and restated \$58 million in earnings after admitting to improper revenue recognition. The company faced multiple investigations from the SEC, Department of Justice, and numerous state attorneys general. By 2017, Valeant had replaced its entire senior management team, bringing in new CEO Joseph Papa.

The company's business model collapsed completely. Valeant was forced to sell off \$2 billion worth of assets in 2016-2017 to manage its \$30 billion debt load. Rather than continuing as an acquisition-driven company, the new management pivoted to traditional pharmaceutical R&D and began rebuilding the company's reputation. In 2018, Valeant changed its name to Bausch Health Companies, attempting to distance itself from the scandal. The company struggled for years with debt repayment and restoring investor confidence, never returning to its previous market prominence.

Several key executives faced legal consequences, though criminal prosecutions were limited. The scandal contributed to increased scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices industry-wide and led to greater transparency requirements for pharmacy benefit managers and specialty pharmacies. PhilidorRx filed for bankruptcy in November 2015, shortly after Valeant severed ties.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "I expect the stock to hit the floor again like a frozen turkey" regarding Valeant's upcoming press conference.  
**Reality**: The stock did indeed collapse catastrophically within months, falling from over \$200 to under \$20, validating this prediction completely.

• **Prediction**: Valeant's business model of debt-fueled acquisitions without internal R&D couldn't work at large scale, with the company exceeding its natural size limits.  
**Reality**: The business model proved unsustainable, forcing the company into massive asset sales, management replacement, and a complete strategic pivot away from acquisition-driven growth.

• **Prediction**: The "creatively aggressive tactics" were necessary because the underlying business model couldn't sustain itself otherwise.  
**Reality**: This was borne out by subsequent investigations revealing systematic revenue inflation, leading to restated earnings and widespread regulatory scrutiny.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 8/9**
