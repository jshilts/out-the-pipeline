# An Open-Source Cancer Pitch, Deconstructed (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines Isaac Yonemoto's crowdsourced project called "Project Marilyn," which aimed to develop a patent-free cancer drug called 9DS, derived from sibiromycin. Yonemoto's crowdfunding pitch proposed producing more of the compound and conducting mouse xenograft studies, claiming the drug showed activity competitive with leading cancer drugs like taxol and potentially fewer side effects. The project was framed within an open-source philosophy, arguing that unpatented drugs would be cheaper and more accessible, drawing parallels to how Salk and Sabin didn't patent the polio vaccine and comparing drug development to open-source software.

However, the author Derek Lowe deconstructs this pitch by pointing out that Yonemoto is drastically underestimating the complexity and cost of drug development. The crowdfunding would only cover preliminary mouse studies, while the real expenses—toxicology, pharmacokinetics, formulation, and especially human clinical trials—represent the vast majority of drug development costs. The author argues that pharmaceutical companies would not invest in developing unpatented compounds given the 90-95% failure rate for oncology drugs, since they need patent protection to recoup massive development investments. The polio vaccine analogy is flawed because polio was a single infectious disease susceptible to a universal vaccine, while cancer comprises hundreds of diseases requiring diverse therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in October 2014, the open-source drug development model proposed by Yonemoto did not gain significant traction in oncology. **Project Marilyn and the 9DS compound appear to have made little to no progress toward clinical development.** A search for "9DS sibiromycin" yields minimal results beyond academic papers, with no evidence of successful human trials or FDA approval.

**Clinical Reality:** The drug development pathway Yonemoto proposed—from mouse xenograft studies to clinical trials—requires hundreds of millions to billions of dollars per approved drug. The preclinical work Yonemoto's crowdfunding aimed to support represents less than 1% of total development costs. **No patent-free cancer drugs have successfully reached the market through open-source models since 2014**, and the fundamental challenges the author identified remain unchanged.

**SJG-136 (the related compound mentioned):** This compound, referenced as showing encouraging results in early trials, **has not received FDA approval** and appears to have stalled in development. Spirogen (acquired by AstraZeneca in 2013) was developing PBD dimer compounds like SG-136, but these have not translated into approved therapies despite early promise.

**Business Models:** Traditional pharmaceutical development continued to dominate, with patent protection remaining essential for attracting investment in drug development. **No significant movement emerged toward open-source cancer drug development** despite continued discussions about drug pricing. Alternative models like drug repurposing and non-profit development have shown limited success but haven't fundamentally changed the patent-dependent ecosystem.

**Drug Pricing:** Ironically, drug pricing controversies intensified after 2014, particularly with immunotherapy drugs like Keytruda and CAR-T therapies costing $100,000-$500,000 annually, validating Yonemoto's concerns about cost but not his proposed solution.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions about the viability of Yonemoto's approach:

• **Yonemoto's prediction:** Open-source, patent-free cancer drugs could be developed and would be cheaper and more accessible, following the software industry model.
  - **Outcome:** **Completely failed.** No patent-free cancer drugs successfully developed through open-source models reached patients. The software analogy proved inappropriate for drug development.

• **Yonemoto's prediction:** 9DS could advance to clinical trials and potentially become a viable cancer therapy.
  - **Outcome:** **Failed.** 9DS did not progress beyond preliminary stages, with no evidence of successful xenograft studies leading to clinical development.

• **Implicit prediction:** Pharmaceutical companies would need to sell unpatented drugs at reasonable prices.
  - **Outcome:** **Wrong.** Pharmaceutical companies simply don't develop unpatented compounds for oncology, as predicted by the article's author. The economic model remains patent-dependent.

• **Author's prediction:** Yonemoto's project would "run into some very high-density reality pretty soon" and wouldn't lead to actual drug release.
  - **Outcome:** **Correct.** The project failed to produce a viable drug or change the drug development paradigm.

• **Author's prediction:** Cancer treatment would require "hundreds of different therapies, most of which we haven't discovered yet."
  - **Outcome:** **Correct.** Cancer treatment has evolved toward increasingly personalized and combination approaches, with immunotherapy, targeted therapies, and precision medicine requiring diverse therapeutic options rather than a single "cure."

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article maintains lasting relevance because it correctly identified fundamental structural barriers to open-source drug development while drug pricing controversies continue to intensify. The piece offers a prescient critique of naive technological solutionism and serves as a case study in understanding why certain innovation models translate poorly across industries. The specific prediction about Yonemoto's project failing proved accurate, and the broader issues around drug development economics remain unresolved a decade later.
