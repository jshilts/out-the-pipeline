# Taking the Ax to the Scientists Is Probably a Mistake (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Forbes commentary (originally by Matthew Herper and reposted by Derek Lowe) argues that the wave of laboratory closures and large‑scale layoffs at big‑pharma companies in the early 2010s reflects a dangerous misunderstanding of where value is created in drug discovery. The author contends that an “ideal” drug company would keep a sizable pool of scientists, pursue many early‑stage ideas, and only advance those that show a clear biomarker‑driven chance of success. He points to Novartis as a rare example of a firm that has tried to preserve scientific talent while tightening its portfolio. By contrast, he cites Merck’s sale of the former Organon sites and Pfizer’s shutdown of the Michigan labs that produced Lipitor as evidence that many firms are “taking the ax to the scientists,” a move he believes will ultimately hurt innovation. The piece ends on a note of uncertainty, acknowledging the unsustainable cost structures of modern R&D while admitting that no obvious alternative solution is apparent.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Big‑pharma R&D restructuring (2012‑2026)**  
- **Continued lab closures and staff reductions** – From 2012 through the mid‑2020s, the major U.S. and European pharma companies (Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, etc.) repeatedly announced reductions in internal discovery staff, often citing “lean‑innovation” or “externalization” strategies. Pfizer’s Ann Arbor site (the Lipitor origin) was shuttered in 2011, and the company later closed additional U.S. chemistry labs in 2014 and 2019. Merck sold its historic Organon research sites to a private‑equity consortium in 2021, spinning off Organon as an independent specialty‑pharma company.  
- **Shift toward external innovation** – The “open‑innovation” model accelerated. Big pharma increased out‑licensing, strategic alliances, and acquisition of biotech firms. Between 2012 and 2025, the number of biotech acquisitions by the top ten pharma companies more than doubled (from ~15 to >35 deals), with a total spend rising from roughly $30 bn to >$70 bn.  
- **R&D spending trends** – Global pharma R&D expenditure grew from about $140 bn in 2012 to a peak of $170 bn around 2015, then plateaued. The cost per new molecular entity (NME) remained high (≈$2.5–3 bn), reinforcing pressure to cut internal programs.  
- **Novartis’ “NIBR” model** – Novartis continued to invest in its Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), expanding its internal scientist headcount modestly while also launching the “Novartis Biome” partnership platform. The company launched several high‑impact drugs (e.g., Cosentyx, Entresto, Kesimpta) and maintained a strong pipeline, suggesting that a hybrid model of internal science plus external collaborations can work.  
- **Rise of biotech and “virtual” drug discovery** – Companies such as Moderna, BioNTech, and many AI‑driven startups proved that small, highly focused scientific teams can deliver breakthrough products (e.g., mRNA COVID‑19 vaccines). This reinforced the view that scientific talent is a critical asset, even if the organization is not a traditional large‑scale lab complex.  
- **Policy and regulatory environment** – The FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” and “Accelerated Approval” pathways, introduced before 2012, have been used increasingly (≈30 % of approvals in 2020‑2024). This has reduced the need for massive Phase III trials in some cases, but it has not eliminated the importance of robust early‑stage science.  

**Overall impact** – The industry’s “lean‑lab” moves did not halt drug approvals; the number of NMEs approved annually in the U.S. stayed roughly steady (≈40–45 per year) from 2012 to 2025. However, many of the most lucrative launches (e.g., the COVID‑19 mRNA vaccines, CAR‑T therapies) originated from smaller, science‑focused firms that were later acquired or partnered with big pharma. The trend has been toward **fewer internal discovery labs but higher‑value collaborations**, rather than a wholesale abandonment of scientific talent.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts. They are rendered here as bullet points with the observed outcomes.

- **Prediction:** Cutting large internal labs (e.g., Merck’s Organon sites, Pfizer’s Michigan labs) will weaken the companies’ ability to generate breakthrough drugs.  
  **Outcome:** Mixed. Pfizer still delivered blockbuster products (e.g., the COVID‑19 vaccine, Ibrance) largely through external partnerships and acquisitions rather than internal chemistry. Merck’s post‑Organon pipeline has produced notable assets (e.g., Keytruda, though developed before the sale). The loss of internal discovery capacity has been partially offset by external sourcing, but many analysts argue that the depth of early‑stage innovation has narrowed.

- **Prediction:** Companies that retain a strong internal scientific workforce (e.g., Novartis) will be better positioned for long‑term success.  
  **Outcome:** Largely true. Novartis’ continued investment in NIBR coincided with a strong pipeline and several high‑revenue launches (Cosentyx, Entresto, Kesimpta). Its market‑cap growth outperformed many peers from 2015‑2023, suggesting that a balanced internal‑external model can be advantageous.

- **Prediction:** The disconnect between the “financial” and “scientific” lobes of R&D will worsen, leading to more tension and possibly slower innovation.  
  **Outcome:** The disconnect remains a frequent topic in industry surveys, but the rise of “venture‑style” internal units (e.g., Roche’s “Venturing & Emerging Science”) and the integration of data‑science teams have mitigated the gap in many firms. Nonetheless, periodic public disputes over R&D budgets (e.g., AstraZeneca’s 2020 “R&D reset”) show the tension persists.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The high cost of drug development will force companies to rely on biomarker‑driven, smaller trials.  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Biomarker‑guided oncology trials and adaptive designs have become standard, and the proportion of approvals based on companion diagnostics rose from ~10 % in 2012 to >25 % in 2024.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal debate about the organization of pharmaceutical R&D that continues to shape industry strategy, making it highly relevant for understanding current biotech‑pharma dynamics.
