# Vaccine Possibilities (November 2020)

## 1. Summary

This November 2020 commentary by Derek Lowe analyzes the emerging data on COVID-19 vaccines as initial trial results were being reported. The article addresses five key questions about vaccine development and deployment: duration of immunity, vaccine effectiveness, viral mutations, efficacy in different populations, and safety profiles. At the time, Pfizer had just reported 95% efficacy for their mRNA vaccine, with Moderna showing similar results. The author examines immunological studies showing that natural infection produced lasting immunity (90% of patients remained seropositive at 6-8 months), and argues this bodes well for vaccine-induced immunity. The article addresses concerns about viral escape mutations, concluding that influenza-like evasion was unlikely. The piece also discusses rollout logistics, noting that manufacturing had begun "at risk" with 20 million doses anticipated by year-end, prioritizing healthcare workers in December 2020.

## 2. History

The predictions and assessments in this article proved remarkably accurate across multiple dimensions. Within weeks of publication, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for both Pfizer-BioNTech (December 11, 2020) and Moderna (December 18, 2020) vaccines. The rollout indeed prioritized healthcare workers starting in mid-December 2020, followed by elderly populations in early 2021. 

Vaccine effectiveness held up well initially, with real-world studies confirming 90-95% effectiveness against symptomatic infection. However, the emergence of variants changed this landscape significantly. The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) showed reduced but still substantial effectiveness. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) in mid-2021 further eroded effectiveness, particularly against infection (though protection against severe disease remained strong). The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) in late 2021 caused dramatic drops in effectiveness against infection, necessitating boosters and updated vaccines.

The duration of immunity prediction was partially correct. While immunity did prove lasting against severe disease (consistent with the article's assessment), protection against infection waned substantially after 6-12 months, leading to multiple booster recommendations. This became evident in 2021-2022, as breakthrough infections became increasingly common despite vaccination.

Manufacturing and distribution scaled successfully. By mid-2021, the US had administered over 300 million doses. However, vaccine hesitancy proved a significant barrier. The concern about rare side effects materialized in April 2021 when the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused due to rare blood clotting events, and in 2021-2022 when myocarditis was identified as a rare side effect of mRNA vaccines in young males.

The mink "Cluster 5" variant mentioned in the article did not become a major escape variant, but other variants did emerge with concerning mutations. The accumulation of mutations in variants like Beta, Gamma, Delta, and especially Omicron demonstrated that while the virus couldn't undergo influenza-like antigenic shift, stepwise evolution did enable substantial immune escape.

## 3. Predictions

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions, with the following outcomes:

- **Prediction**: Vaccines would show lasting immunity comparable to natural infection based on immunological memory lasting years.
- **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While immunity to severe disease proved durable, protection against infection waned significantly within 6-12 months, leading to widespread breakthrough infections and the need for boosters.

- **Prediction**: Efficacy of 95% would be maintained across age groups, including those 65+, and would prove "epidemic-breaking if we can get sufficient numbers of people vaccinated."
- **Outcome**: The high efficacy held initially, but variants substantially reduced effectiveness against infection. The epidemic was contained where vaccination rates were high combined with other measures, but breakthrough transmission remained significant.

- **Prediction**: Viral mutations would not pose major problems for vaccine effectiveness, as coronavirus lacks influenza's antigenic shift mechanism.
- **Outcome**: Incorrect. While influenza's reassortment mechanism is unique, SARS-CoV-2's stepwise evolution through variants (Alpha, Delta, Omicron) caused substantial immune escape and reduced vaccine effectiveness, particularly against infection.

- **Prediction**: Side effects would be manageable, with severe reactions being rare enough to represent acceptable public health tradeoffs.
- **Outcome**: Largely accurate. Vaccines proved safe overall, though rare side effects like myocarditis and the J&J blood clotting events did emerge post-authorization.

- **Prediction**: Rollout would begin in December 2020 with healthcare workers first, followed by broader distribution.
- **Outcome**: Accurate. The timeline and prioritization strategy played out exactly as described.

- **Prediction**: 20 million doses would be available by end of 2020.
- **Outcome**: Achievement was delayed. By December 31, 2020, approximately 14 million doses had been distributed and 2.8 million administered, falling short of the 20 million dose goal, though distribution accelerated dramatically in early 2021.

## 4. Interest

Rating: **8/10**

This article represents an exceptionally well-reasoned contemporaneous analysis of the emerging vaccine data during a pivotal moment in the pandemic. While some predictions about variant escape proved too optimistic, the piece correctly anticipated many key developments and provided clear-eyed assessment of remaining uncertainties. It demonstrated strong scientific literacy and avoided both unwarranted pessimism and hype. The article's enduring value lies in its demonstration of how to evaluate complex clinical data during an evolving public health crisis.
