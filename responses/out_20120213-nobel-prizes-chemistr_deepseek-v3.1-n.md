# Nobel Prizes in Chemistry For People Who Aren't Chemists (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 commentary discusses Nobel laureate Roald Hoffmann's critique of a perceived trend: Chemistry Nobel Prizes increasingly being awarded to researchers who aren't traditional chemists. Hoffmann noted that in the previous decade, only four out of ten chemistry Nobels went to work "comfortably ensconced in chemistry departments," while five had a "definite biological tinge." Rather than protesting this trend, Hoffmann argued that the Nobel committee was pursuing a broader, more appropriate definition of chemistry, and that the historical split between chemistry and biochemistry was a mistake. Hoffmann advocated embracing interdisciplinary work at chemistry's boundaries—including potential breakthroughs in graphene-based photosynthesis mimics, nanotechnology, room-temperature superconductors, battery technology, and protein/antibody engineering—rather than maintaining rigid disciplinary purity.

## 2. HISTORY

The trend Hoffmann identified in 2012 has largely continued and even accelerated in the subsequent 12+ years. From 2013-2024, chemistry Nobels have consistently rewarded interdisciplinary work:

- **2013**: Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, and Arieh Warshel won for "development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems"—work spanning chemistry, biology, and computational science
- **2014**: Eric Betzig, Stefan Hell, and William Moerner for super-resolved fluorescence microscopy—heavily biological applications
- **2015**: Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich, and Aziz Sancar for mechanistic studies of DNA repair—clearly biochemistry
- **2016**: Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Fraser Stoddart, and Bernard Feringa for molecular machines—nanotechnology at chemistry's interface
- **2017**: Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, and Richard Henderson for cryo-electron microscopy—structural biology
- **2018**: Frances Arnold (directed evolution), George Smith, and Gregory Winter (phage display)—protein engineering with massive biological applications
- **2020**: Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna for CRISPR-Cas9—gene editing revolutionizing biology
- **2022**: Carolyn Bertozzi, Morten Meldal, and Barry Sharpless for click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry—spanning chemistry and biology

The pattern clearly continues: only a minority of recent chemistry Nobels reward what Hoffmann would call "pure" chemistry. This reflects the reality that major chemical advances increasingly occur at disciplinary interfaces. No significant policy changes occurred at the Nobel committee level—they continued their established pattern of recognizing impactful science regardless of traditional departmental boundaries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit predictions about future directions have proven largely accurate:

- **Prediction: Biological chemistry would continue dominating Nobel recognition**
  - **Reality**: ✅ Correct. Since 2012, over two-thirds of chemistry Nobels have had significant biological components, confirming Hoffmann's observation of a sustained trend.

- **Prediction: Interdisciplinary breakthroughs (nanotechnology, energy tech, protein engineering) would be recognized as chemistry**
  - **Reality**: ✅ Correct. The 2016 molecular machines Nobel, 2018 directed evolution prize, and 2022 click chemistry award all exemplify boundary-spanning work being celebrated as chemistry.

- **Prediction: Rigid disciplinary boundaries would become increasingly counterproductive**
  - **Reality**: ✅ Correct. The past decade has seen even traditionally pure chemistry departments expand into chemical biology, materials chemistry, and computational chemistry, with many top programs explicitly embracing interdisciplinary approaches.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a persistent and important trend in how major scientific recognition operates, and Hoffmann's argument about the arbitrariness of disciplinary boundaries remains relevant as science becomes increasingly interdisciplinary. However, the phenomenon was already well-established by 2012, limiting the article's novelty.
