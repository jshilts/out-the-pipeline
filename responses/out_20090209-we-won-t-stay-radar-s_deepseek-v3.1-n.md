# We Won't Stay Off The Radar Screen For Long, Y'Know (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article, written shortly after the Obama administration took office in early 2009, speculates about upcoming healthcare policy changes affecting the pharmaceutical industry. The author predicts that once the economic stimulus legislation is resolved, the new administration will turn attention to healthcare reform. Key questions raised include whether Medicare will negotiate drug prices directly, whether drug reimportation policies will be implemented to address price differences with other countries, and who will be appointed as FDA Commissioner to signal the administration's regulatory approach.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, several major developments reshaped the pharmaceutical landscape:

The **Affordable Care Act (ACA)** was passed in March 2010, fundamentally transforming healthcare coverage and creating new mechanisms affecting drug pricing through the creation of health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion, though it did not include the direct Medicare drug price negotiation that many had anticipated.

**FDA leadership** saw Dr. Margaret Hamburg confirmed as Commissioner in May 2009, serving until April 2015. Her tenure emphasized patient safety and evidence-based regulation, with notable focus on post-market surveillance and risk management.

Regarding **drug price negotiations**, Medicare Part D continued to operate through private insurers rather than direct government negotiation, despite ongoing political debate about this approach.

On **drug reimportation**, legislative efforts were discussed but did not result in comprehensive federal policy changes allowing widespread importation from other countries, though some limited state-level initiatives emerged later.

The **biotechnology sector** experienced continued consolidation, with major pharmaceutical companies acquiring biotech firms to bolster pipelines as patent cliffs approached for blockbuster drugs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's speculative questions and later outcomes:

• **Medicare drug price negotiation**: The author asked whether this would occur. **Outcome**: This did not materialize in the ACA or subsequent major legislation. Medicare Part D continued to rely on private plan negotiations rather than direct federal price setting.

• **Drug reimportation policies**: The author questioned whether reimportation would address U.S.-international price differences. **Outcome**: No comprehensive federal reimportation policy was established, though the issue remained politically active with some state-level initiatives emerging years later.

• **FDA Commissioner appointment**: The article noted uncertainty about leadership. **Outcome**: Dr. Margaret Hamburg was confirmed, bringing a focus on regulatory science, safety, and innovation balance that shaped FDA policy through 2015.

• **Healthcare reform timing**: Implicit prediction that healthcare would move up the agenda. **Outcome**: Correct - the ACA became law in March 2010, though the legislative process was more protracted than initially expected.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures the historical moment when healthcare reform's direction was uncertain, and its questions about drug pricing and regulatory policy remained relevant for years afterward, though it is more notable as a period piece than for lasting analytical insights.
