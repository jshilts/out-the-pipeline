# On Vitamin C, And On Linus Pauling (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2014 commentary examines newly emerging research on vitamin C and cancer, appearing shortly after studies suggested antioxidant supplements could be harmful to cancer patients. The article discusses a Science Translational Medicine study showing that high-dose intravenous vitamin C—unlike oral supplements—could actually promote reactive oxygen species (specifically hydrogen peroxide) that damage ovarian cancer cells. At the millimolar blood concentrations achieved only through IV administration, vitamin C appeared to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness in mouse models, contrasting sharply with Linus Pauling's earlier advocacy of oral megadoses for cancer prevention. The author analyzes this apparent paradox while reflecting on Pauling's remarkable scientific legacy in chemistry and molecular biology, contrasted with what the author characterizes as his later "messianic" (and scientifically flawed) advocacy of vitamin C.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent decade saw continued exploration of high-dose IV vitamin C in cancer treatment, with mixed but largely disappointing results. Multiple clinical trials were conducted, including several phase I and II studies, but no phase III trials demonstrated sufficient efficacy to lead to FDA approval of IV vitamin C as a cancer therapy. The University of Kansas group (Drisko and Chen) mentioned in the article continued their research, publishing additional studies on IV vitamin C's pro-oxidant effects. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses (including Cochrane reviews) concluded that evidence remained insufficient to support routine clinical use of IV vitamin C for cancer treatment. Some institutions offered it as an alternative or complementary therapy, but it never became standard of care in mainstream oncology. Meanwhile, the scientific understanding of reactive oxygen species in cancer became more nuanced—ROS can promote or suppress tumors depending on context, concentration, and cell type. Pauling's legacy evaluation remained largely as described: celebrated for his foundational chemistry work while his vitamin C advocacy is viewed as a cautionary example of how even brilliant scientists can become attached to unsubstantiated claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in the article. The author's main implicit expectation was that IV vitamin C research based on the pro-oxidant mechanism deserved serious investigation—which did occur, though without leading to clinically validated cancer treatments by current standards.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 6/10**

The article represents a thoughtful intersection of scientific history and contemporary research, offering nuanced commentary on both Pauling's legacy and the ongoing vitamin C research. However, it focuses on what was already becoming a somewhat niche area of cancer research rather than a transformative breakthrough.

## 5. ASSESSMENT
The author's balanced historical perspective and honest appraisal of Pauling's contradictory legacy—acknowledging both his extraordinary scientific contributions and his problematic later advocacy—demonstrates appropriate intellectual nuance. The central scientific point remains sound: the pro-oxidant mechanism for IV vitamin C was mechanistically interesting and deserved investigation, even though it ultimately failed to translate into clinically successful cancer therapies. The broader cautionary lesson about scientists becoming overly attached to unproven hypotheses remains highly relevant.
