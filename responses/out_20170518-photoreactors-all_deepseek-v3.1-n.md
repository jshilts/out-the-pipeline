# Photoreactors For All (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article highlights the development of a new standardized photoreactor for photoredox chemistry, jointly created by the MacMillan group at Princeton and researchers at Merck. The equipment features higher-power LEDs and an optimized reaction chamber designed to significantly improve reaction times and yields compared to typical homemade setups. Examples cited include dramatic improvements such as 3 minutes versus 1 hour, and 20 minutes versus 3 hours for various transformations including N-arylations, alkyl decarboxylative coupling, fluorination, and trifluoromethylation.

The authors note that while most reactions benefit, one specific reaction (cross-electrophile coupling of alkyl and aryl halides) initially performed worse until the team identified that HBr generation outpaced the base neutralization capacity. This was resolved by switching to a soluble base and reducing lamp intensity. The ACS Pharma Roundtable endorsed the system for improving reproducibility, and commercialization was undertaken by Penn Optical Coatings with Sigma-Aldrich also planned as a distributor.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication, photoredox catalysis continued its rapid growth in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical applications. The standardization of equipment like the described reactor helped accelerate adoption of photoredox methodologies in medicinal chemistry and process chemistry settings. While I cannot provide specific details about this particular commercial reactor's market performance, photoredox chemistry itself became established as a routine tool in drug discovery programs.

The field saw continued methodological development through the late 2010s with numerous new transformations and mechanistic insights. The accessibility of standardized equipment likely contributed to more reproducible published procedures and broader experimentation. Merck's involvement in the original development reflects the pharmaceutical industry's early recognition of photoredox's potential for accessing challenging molecular architectures relevant to drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the field's trajectory:

• **That inexpensive, standardized photoreactors would lead to more experimentation and reaction discovery**: The subsequent years saw substantial growth in photoredox methodology publications, suggesting this prediction was largely born out as researchers gained access to reliable equipment.

• **That the reactor would enable bond formations in new ways**: The late 2010s and early 2020s did see continued expansion of photoredox transformations applied to complex molecule synthesis.

• **That commercial availability through multiple vendors would support broad adoption**: While I cannot verify the specific commercial performance of this reactor, photoredox equipment did become more widely available.

• **That the ACS endorsement would improve reproducibility**: Standardization efforts in photoredox procedures did help address reproducibility challenges that had been noted in the field.

The underlying premise - that lowering barriers to conducting photoredox chemistry would accelerate its development - appears to have been correct based on the sustained methodological advances in the field post-2017.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addressed an important practical bottleneck for an emerging field during a critical growth period. While the specific technology described is niche equipment, it represented a broader trend toward standardization that enabled photoredox chemistry's expansion into mainstream pharmaceutical applications.
