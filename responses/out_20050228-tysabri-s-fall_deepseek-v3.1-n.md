# Tysabri's Fall (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Biogen/Idec and Elan's decision to voluntarily withdraw Tysabri (natalizumab) from the market in February 2005. The withdrawal came after a small number of multiple sclerosis patients receiving Tysabri alongside Biogen's existing drug Avonex (beta-interferon) developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but serious brain infection caused by reactivation of the JC polyomavirus. 

Tysabri was a monoclonal antibody treatment positioned as a promising new therapy for multiple sclerosis, and the article notes that Biogen/Idec had been celebrated as the best-returning stock of the previous decade, with an 80% gain in the prior year largely driven by Tysabri optimism. The author observes that even if the drug returned to market, it would never achieve its original projected success, and anticipates legal challenges from "ambulance chasers" capitalizing on the adverse events.

## 2. HISTORY

Tysabri's story post-2005 represents one of the most significant drug withdrawal and reintroduction cases in pharmaceutical history:

**Return to Market**: After extensive safety review and risk-benefit analysis, the FDA approved Tysabri's return to the U.S. market in June 2006 under a restricted distribution program called the TOUCH Prescribing Program. The European Medicines Agency followed with reapproval in June 2006 as well.

**Clinical Impact**: Tysabri proved to be one of the most effective MS treatments available, demonstrating superior efficacy in reducing relapse rates and disability progression compared to many existing therapies. It became an important treatment option, particularly for aggressive forms of relapsing-remitting MS.

**PML Complications**: The drug's success remained shadowed by PML risk. As of 2014-2015 data, the incidence of PML was approximately 1 in 1000 patients overall, though risk increased significantly with treatment duration, prior immunosuppressant use, and presence of anti-JC virus antibodies. Over 200 PML cases had been reported by 2011.

**Market Performance**: Despite safety concerns, Tysabri achieved substantial commercial success, generating over $1 billion annually for Biogen Idec by 2011 and reaching approximately $2 billion in peak annual sales. It maintained a significant market presence alongside newer oral MS therapies that emerged in subsequent years.

**Regulatory Evolution**: Tysabri's experience led to strengthened pharmacovigilance requirements and influenced regulatory approaches to risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) for high-risk medications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author stated "I can't see how it can ever be what it was going to be" regarding Tysabri's market potential after the withdrawal.  
**Reality**: Tysabri achieved blockbuster status with peak sales around $2 billion annually, becoming one of Biogen's most important products despite safety restrictions. The prediction underestimated the drug's clinical value and the MS community's willingness to accept risk-benefit trade-offs for effective treatment.

• **Prediction**: "There will be more lawyers than victims, and not for the first time" referring to legal actions following adverse events.  
**Reality**: Significant litigation did occur, with Biogen and Elan facing numerous lawsuits from patients who developed PML. However, the legal outcomes were mixed, and the companies continued to market the drug successfully with enhanced monitoring requirements, suggesting legal challenges, while substantial, did not prevent the drug's commercial viability.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical history where a promising breakthrough therapy faced life-threatening safety issues, prompting questions about drug development risk management, regulatory oversight, and the complex risk-benefit calculations inherent in treating serious chronic diseases. The Tysabri case became a landmark example of how effective drugs with serious but manageable risks can still achieve significant clinical and commercial success through careful risk mitigation strategies, fundamentally influencing pharmaceutical regulation and patient care approaches in MS and beyond.
