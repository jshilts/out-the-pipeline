# Allergan (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes how Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a company known for acquiring other firms and then slashing their R&D budgets, was attempting a hostile takeover of Allergan in 2014. Valeant CEO Michael Pearson repeatedly cited Allergan's supposed golf course as an example of wasteful spending that he intended to cut immediately after the acquisition. However, the article reveals that Allergan did not actually own a golf course, exposing Pearson's claims as factually incorrect or based on misinformation. The article notes that Allergan was actively seeking alternative buyers to avoid being acquired by Valeant, highlighting the contentious nature of the takeover attempt and the cultural clash between Valeant's cost-cutting approach and traditional pharmaceutical R&D models.

## 2. HISTORY

The Valeant-Allergan takeover saga became one of the most dramatic pharmaceutical industry battles of the decade:

**The Acquisition Battle (2014-2015):**
- Valeant, partnered with activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, launched a hostile $53 billion bid for Allergan
- Allergan repeatedly rejected Valeant's offers, citing concerns about Valeant's business model and R&D cuts
- The battle involved multiple legal challenges, shareholder meetings, and public relations campaigns
- In November 2014, Allergan found an alternative buyer and agreed to be acquired by Actavis for $66 billion, successfully fending off Valeant

**Valeant's Downfall (2015-2018):**
- Valeant's aggressive acquisition strategy and drug price increases drew intense scrutiny
- In 2015-2016, Valeant faced multiple investigations over drug pricing practices and relationships with specialty pharmacies
- The company's stock plummeted from over $260 per share in 2015 to under $20 by 2016
- CEO Michael Pearson was eventually replaced in 2016 amid widespread criticism of the company's business practices

**Allergan's Post-Acquisition Path:**
- After being acquired by Actavis (which then took the Allergan name), the company continued operating with a more traditional pharmaceutical R&D approach
- Allergan maintained its focus on branded pharmaceuticals, particularly in aesthetics (Botox), eye care, and central nervous system disorders
- In 2019, AbbVie acquired Allergan for $63 billion, marking the end of Allergan as an independent company

**Industry Impact:**
The Valeant-Allergan battle highlighted the broader tension between traditional R&D-focused pharmaceutical companies and the "roll-up" acquisition model. Valeant's subsequent collapse served as a cautionary tale about overreliance on price increases and aggressive cost-cutting without sufficient investment in innovation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about the future, but it did express skepticism and concerns about Valeant's business model and its potential impact on Allergan. While not framed as formal predictions, several implied outcomes can be evaluated:

- **Valeant's approach to Allergan**: The article strongly suggested that Valeant would gut Allergan's R&D if the acquisition succeeded, following their established pattern with other companies. **Outcome**: This prediction never came to be tested, as Allergan successfully avoided being acquired by Valeant, instead being bought by Actavis which maintained a more R&D-focused approach.

- **Allergan's search for alternatives**: The article noted that Allergan was "ringing doorbells" looking for alternative buyers. **Outcome**: This proved accurate—Allergan actively sought and found an alternative buyer in Actavis, which ultimately acquired the company for significantly more money than Valeant's initial offer, demonstrating the accuracy of the article's assessment that Allergan would do "anything but Valeant."

- **Valeant's business model sustainability**: While not explicitly predicted, the article's tone suggested skepticism about Valeant's approach of cutting R&D while pursuing aggressive acquisitions. **Outcome**: Valeant's business model ultimately proved unsustainable, as evidenced by their dramatic collapse in 2015-2016, validating the article's implicit concerns about the long-term viability of their strategy.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article provides valuable insight into a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical industry history, capturing the cultural clash between different business models and accurately identifying the risks of Valeant's approach at a time when the company was still highly regarded by many investors. The factual error about the golf course served as an early red flag that proved prescient in retrospect.
