# Find That Pattern (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short blog post references a satirical article from the Times of London responding to pseudoscientific claims in the British press. The press had reported that ancient historical sites formed "uncanny triangular formations," suggesting some mysterious or deliberate pattern. The Times responded with a tongue-in-cheek piece demonstrating that Woolworths stores (a defunct British retail chain) also appeared to follow similar "chilling" geometrical patterns, thereby exposing the absurdity of such pattern-finding exercises through reductio ad absurdum.

The article essentially critiques unfounded pattern recognition in archaeology and conspiracy theories by showing how easy it is to find apparent patterns in random distributions, highlighting the importance of statistical rigor over anecdotal "discoveries."

## 2. HISTORY

The methodological critique presented in this article reflects broader developments in scientific skepticism and statistical literacy that continued to evolve after 2010:

- **Pattern Recognition Pitfalls**: The statistical principle illustrated (that random distributions often appear to form patterns to the human eye) became increasingly relevant as big data analytics expanded throughout the 2010s. The concept of "apophenia" (seeing patterns in random data) gained wider recognition in both scientific and public discourse.

- **Archaeological Skepticism**: The decade following this article saw continued debunking of pseudoscientific archaeological claims, including Ancient Aliens theories and various "mysterious geometrical pattern" narratives. Professional archaeologists increasingly used statistical methods and peer review to counter such claims.

- **Data Science Development**: The broader lesson about spurious correlations became foundational in the emerging data science field, where distinguishing signal from noise became a central challenge. The "Woolworths stores" example joined other classic illustrations like the correlation between ice cream sales and drowning deaths.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There were no explicit predictions in this short commentary article. It was purely a reaction to contemporary pseudoscientific reporting and an endorsement of rigorous statistical thinking.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

While the underlying statistical principle is important and broadly applicable, the article itself is a brief commentary on a temporary media phenomenon rather than addressing substantive scientific developments in biotechnology or other fields. It serves as a useful methodological reminder but doesn't provide significant depth or long-term scientific insight beyond reinforcing fundamental statistical principles that were already well-established by 2010.

**Note**: This response may not align perfectly with the template's focus on biotechnology industry commentary, as the linked article appears to be about statistical methodology and archaeological skepticism rather than biotechnology. There may have been an error in the URL or article selection.
