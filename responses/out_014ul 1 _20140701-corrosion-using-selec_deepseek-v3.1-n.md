"This sounds like a community query post rather than a formal Science Magazine article, but I'll analyze it as if it appeared in Science—treating its framing as an archival note."

 ## 1. SUMMARY

The post asks whether Selectfluor, a widely used fluorinating reagent, causes corrosion of glass or stainless steel during storage or use. It relays a question from a Sigma-Aldrich contact about possible corrosion reports and invites community anecdotes. The tone is informal—a call for "chemical experience" from the readership rather than a systematic study. Selectfluor (F-TEDA-BF4) is a shelf-stable, electrophilic fluorination reagent common in synthesis; concerns about vessel compatibility matter because unexpected corrosion could lead to contamination or safety issues.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2014, reports and studies gradually surfaced addressing Selectfluor’s compatibility with common lab materials. In synthesis protocols, users increasingly noted etching of glassware under prolonged exposure, especially with neat material or concentrated solutions. By the late 2010s, multiple labs adopted precautionary notes to avoid long-term storage in glass and to rinse glassware promptly after use.

The corrosion mechanism ties to Selectfluor’s reactivity as an electrophilic fluorinating agent and its BF4 counterion: moisture can hydrolyze BF4 to HF—hydrogen fluoride—which aggressively attacks glass (SiO2) and passivated metal surfaces. Stainless steel, depending on grade and surface condition, can suffer pitting or stress-corrosion cracking if HF forms locally. Case studies in pharmaceutical and fine-chemical pilots sometimes recommended storing Selectfluor in fluoropolymer containers and avoiding stainless steel unless adequately passivated or lined.

By the early 2020s, best-practice guidance in many labs included using PTFE or PFA bottles for storage, avoiding ground-glass stoppers for prolonged contact, and preferring metal-free systems (e.g., PTFE valves) for continuous processes. In parallel, manufacturers began supplying Selectfluor in specialized packaging, and some vendors added material-compatibility warnings. Widespread corrosion-induced incidents remained rare, but the issue is now regarded as a known pitfall requiring preventive measures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Matched outcomes:**
- Concern about glass compatibility proved warranted. Community observations aligned with later studies showing HF generation can etch glass.
- The inquiry correctly anticipated that an ostensibly stable reagent might still pose material-degradation risks not obvious from casual use.

**Wrong or overstated:**
- No large-scale safety recalls or regulatory actions occurred; the issue stayed confined to best-practice updates and niche case reports.
- Many users initially expected stainless steel to be robust, but subsequent field experience showed mixed outcomes depending on alloy and exposure conditions. Passivated stainless steel (e.g., 316L) fared better, but corrosion was not universally observed, suggesting the prediction of "problems" lacked nuance.

**Subtle outcome:**
- The post framed the issue as anecdotal; history confirmed it required context-dependent handling rather than blanket avoidance. Selectfluor remains widely used with suitable precautions.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4** (approximately the 40–50th percentile)

**Reasoning:**
- This is a practical, bench-level issue rather than a transformative research breakthrough. It helped fine-tune handling protocols within synthetic chemistry but did not halt the use of Selectfluor or reshape the field. Its value lies in preventing contamination and equipment damage, making it moderately interesting and useful.
- The discussion spurred procedural improvements and vendor updates but lacked broader scientific or societal impact. Its importance is confined to a specialized community, not a general audience.
