# Whack-A-Mole (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2014 blog post comparing homemade "all-natural" herbicide (salt, vinegar, and soap) with glyphosate, the active ingredient in commercial herbicides like Roundup. The analysis found that while the salt-vinegar mixture does work on small weeds, it is more persistent in soil and has higher mammalian toxicity than glyphosate—the opposite of what people promoting "natural" alternatives typically expect. The author laments that such evidence-based analysis often gets dismissed as "Monsanto shill propaganda" by those who prefer anecdotal claims over scientific data like LD50 values. The piece also includes a related example about an actress promoting eating clay for detoxification based on pseudoscientific claims about "negative isotopes" and heavy metal removal, illustrating the broader challenge of combating misinformation about chemicals and natural products.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2014 article, several significant developments occurred:

**Glyphosate Safety and Regulation:**
- In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2A), creating controversy and conflicting with regulatory agencies in many countries.
- The EPA, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and other regulatory bodies continued to maintain that glyphosate is safe when used according to label directions, though some countries implemented restrictions or bans.
- Major litigation emerged, particularly the 2018 Dewayne Johnson case where Monsanto (acquired by Bayer in 2016) was ordered to pay substantial damages, though the science behind causation claims remains contested.
- Glyphosate remains one of the most widely used herbicides globally, with hundreds of products containing it still on the market.

**Public Perception and Misinformation:**
- The tension between scientific evidence and public perception that the article described has persisted and arguably intensified, with glyphosate becoming a focus for anti-GMO and environmental advocacy campaigns.
- "Natural" product marketing continued to grow substantially, with the global organic market expanding significantly.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article appeared to make implicit predictions about patterns that would continue rather than specific temporal predictions. Evaluating these general expectations:

- **Expected continued misinformation about glyphosate vs. natural alternatives**: This proved accurate. The glyphosate controversy grew substantially post-2014, with expanded media coverage, litigation, and public debate despite minimal change in scientific consensus about acute toxicity.

- **Anticipated difficulty convincing people with LD50 data**: This was prescient. The gap between toxicological data and public perception has remained or widened, with glyphosate becoming a cultural symbol regardless of scientific evidence.

- **Implicit suggestion that "natural fallacy" thinking would persist**: Confirmed. Marketing of "natural," "non-toxic," and "chemical-free" products has grown substantially despite questionable scientific bases.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a brief blog-style commentary that touches on an enduring problem (science communication about chemicals) but is primarily anecdotal and doesn't present substantial original analysis. While the topic of glyphosate safety became highly significant post-2014, the article itself is a short observational piece rather than in-depth journalism or analysis, limiting its lasting importance.
