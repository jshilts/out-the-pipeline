# Now Novartis-Emeryville? (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" column reported on apparent restructuring and job cuts at Novartis's Emeryville, California site. The author noted that while Novartis had already announced some cuts, comments and direct communications indicated something "even more serious" was underway. The post also mentioned the recent Novartis Horsham closure and criticized the company's communication strategy, observing that many employees learned about site closures through blogs and grapevine channels rather than internal company announcements. Lowe questioned why companies in 2013 would rely on informal communication when press releases could provide clarity, given how quickly information spreads through modern communication channels. The post referenced a Boston Globe article for additional context on Novartis's worldwide research job restructuring.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 Novartis restructuring was part of a broader pharmaceutical industry trend towards research site consolidation and strategic repositioning. Novartis continued its shift toward concentrating research operations in major hubs, particularly Cambridge, Massachusetts. In the years following this article, Novartis significantly scaled back or closed several legacy research sites while expanding capacity at strategic locations. The company maintained a presence in the Bay Area but consolidated operations and reduced overall footprint in California. This pattern reflected broader pharmaceutical industry dynamics from 2013-2020, where major companies centralized R&D operations, often favoring translational research centers co-located with academic institutions over geographically dispersed legacy sites.
