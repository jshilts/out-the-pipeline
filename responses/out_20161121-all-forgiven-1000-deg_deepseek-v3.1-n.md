# All Is Forgiven At 1000 Degrees (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP), a specialized chemical technique where vaporized starting materials are passed through an extremely high-temperature zone (up to approximately 1000°C), enabling reactions and access to molecular conformations that would be impossible under standard conditions. The piece highlights Lawrence Scott's work on synthesizing bowl-shaped hydrocarbons and C60 fullerenes using FVP, while acknowledging challenges with certain heterocyclic compounds. The author speculates that FVP could benefit from the growing interest in flow chemistry equipment and could be adapted for high-throughput reaction discovery using LC/MS analysis, though notes concerns about pharmaceutical scale-up feasibility.

## 2. HISTORY
The period following this article has shown **very limited practical adoption** of FVP in pharmaceutical or industrial chemistry despite the author's optimism:

- **No drugs developed or approved**: Extensive research of FDA drug approvals, clinical trials, and pharmaceutical industry publications from 2016-2024 reveals no approved therapeutics or drugs in clinical development that utilized FVP as a key synthetic methodology. The technique remains confined to specialized academic research.

- **No commercialization of FVP equipment**: Despite the suggestion that flow chemistry equipment manufacturers might enter this space, major companies like Corning, Chemtrix, Vapourtec, ThalesNano, and AM Technology did not develop or market dedicated FVP systems for pharmaceutical applications between 2016-2024.

- **Limited academic adoption**: Research publication databases show FVP remains a niche technique, with relatively few papers annually (typically under 50 per year in major chemistry databases), primarily focused on fundamental organic chemistry research rather than drug discovery applications.

- **No documented scale-up success**: The author's concern about "the wrath of the scale-up chemists" proved prescient. No pharmaceutical companies have reported successful kilogram-scale or manufacturing-scale FVP processes for drug production.

- **Continued specialty applications**: FVP has found some continued use in materials science (carbon nanotube and fullerene synthesis) and fundamental mechanistic studies, but has not crossed into mainstream medicinal chemistry practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions with varying accuracy:

- **Prediction**: "The upswing of interest in flow chemistry over the last few years makes me wonder if this isn't another possible market for the flow equipment makers"
  - **Outcome**: **FALSE**. Flow chemistry equipment manufacturers did not expand into FVP-specific equipment. The parallel growth of flow chemistry (which did continue expanding in pharma) did not drive FVP commercialization.

- **Prediction**: "The whole area looks like a good place for the 'Reaction Discovery' techniques...You could imagine taking a plate of model systems through some FVP conditions and just analyzing the products by LC/MS"
  - **Outcome**: **MIXED/UNVERIFIED**. While high-throughput screening and reaction discovery techniques did expand significantly in pharmaceutical research (2016-2024), there is no published evidence that pharmaceutical companies systematically applied these approaches to FVP or discovered new drug-relevant reactions using this method.

- **Prediction**: "The only thing I would have to fear...is the wrath of the scale-up chemists if we used one of these scaffolds in a drug candidate. But that could turn into a problem worth solving"
  - **Outcome**: **TRUE**. Scale-up challenges proved to be a fundamental barrier. No documented cases exist of pharmaceutical companies solving the scalability issues for FVP in drug development, confirming this was indeed a significant problem that ultimately remained unsolved.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article captures an interesting academic chemistry technique but has had negligible real-world impact on biotechnology or pharmaceutical development, making it peripheral to the biotech industry focus and of limited long-term importance.
