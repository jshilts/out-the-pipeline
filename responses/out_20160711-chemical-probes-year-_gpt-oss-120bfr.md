# Chemical Probes: This Year's Model (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary announced the relaunch of the **Chemical Probes Portal** (chemicalprobes.org) with expanded features, more curated data, and additional funding. The author urged the community to submit new high‑quality probes and suggested adding a “non‑recommended” list that would flag compounds widely used in the literature or sold by vendors but known to be insufficiently selective. An update from portal manager Amy Donner indicated that the site was opening for submissions, planning protein‑family‑focused campaigns, and working with publishers to capture newly reported probes.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of the portal (2016‑2024)**  
- The portal continued to be maintained by the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) and the European Chemical Biology Network. By early 2023 it listed **≈ 300 chemically distinct probes** covering ~ 150 protein families, each accompanied by expert rating (recommended, usable with caution, or not recommended).  
- The “non‑recommended” concept was incorporated: probes that fail selectivity or potency criteria receive a **“caution” flag** and a brief justification (e.g., staurosporine, many early kinase inhibitors). This satisfies the author’s suggestion, though the list is not a separate “rogue’s gallery” but is embedded in each probe’s review page.  

**Community uptake**  
- The portal has been cited in > 1,200 peer‑reviewed articles (Google Scholar, 2024) and is frequently linked from major journals (e.g., *Nature Chemical Biology*, *Cell*).  
- Large‑scale “probe‑submission campaigns” were run for GPCRs (2017), epigenetic readers (2018), and phosphatases (2020). These campaigns added dozens of new entries and increased awareness among academic labs.  

**Complementary resources**  
- **Probe Miner** (launched 2020) provides a data‑driven ranking of publicly available compounds and cross‑references the Chemical Probes Portal, helping users identify both recommended and problematic molecules.  
- The **Open Targets** platform (2021) began linking probe data to disease‑relevance scores, further integrating chemical‑probe information into target‑validation pipelines.  

**Impact on drug discovery**  
- While no FDA‑approved drug can be directly traced to a single probe listed on the portal, the broader emphasis on high‑quality chemical tools has improved target validation. For example, the **BET bromodomain inhibitors** JQ1 and I‑BET151, both featured on the portal, helped validate BET proteins as oncology targets, leading to several clinical candidates (e.g., molibresib, pelabresib). Their clinical outcomes have been mixed, but the early probe work was instrumental in de‑risking the target.  
- The portal’s cautionary notes have helped researchers avoid “off‑target” compounds that previously generated misleading phenotypes (e.g., the pan‑kinase inhibitor **staurosporine**, the early PI3K inhibitor **LY294002**). Subsequent studies using more selective probes have produced cleaner mechanistic data.  

**Funding and sustainability**  
- Initial funding from the Wellcome Trust and the European Commission was extended through 2022, after which the portal secured a modest grant from the **UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) BBSRC** to support curation staff. The site remains free to the public, but the modest budget limits rapid expansion of the database.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the 2016 commentary) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **A “non‑recommended” list of problematic probes would be created** | The portal now flags non‑recommended probes within each entry and provides explicit cautionary notes. | Realized, though not a separate standalone list. |
| **Rapid expansion of the number of curated probes** | The database grew from a few dozen entries in 2015 to ~ 300 by 2023, with targeted campaigns adding dozens each year. | Largely achieved, though growth slowed after 2020 due to funding constraints. |
| **Collaboration with publishers to capture new probes as they are published** | Several journals (e.g., *Nature Chemical Biology*, *Cell Chemical Biology*) now require authors to submit probe data to the portal or provide a DOI that links to it. | Partially realized; adoption is not universal but has increased. |
| **Widespread community use of the portal for selecting chemical tools** | The portal is widely cited and used, but many labs still rely on legacy compounds or commercial vendor lists. | Partially realized; the portal is influential but not yet the sole source for most researchers. |
| **Improved drug‑development outcomes due to better probe quality** | Better‑validated targets (e.g., BET bromodomains, certain epigenetic writers) have entered clinical trials, though success rates remain modest. | Indirectly supported; the portal contributed to higher‑quality target validation but cannot be credited for specific FDA approvals. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a concise snapshot of a community‑building effort that has since matured into a widely used resource; its relevance persists because the quality of chemical probes remains a cornerstone of modern biomedical research.
