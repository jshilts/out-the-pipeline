# Merck's Thrombin Antagonist In Trouble (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on clinical trial setbacks for Merck's thrombin receptor antagonist vorapaxar (formerly SCH 530348). A data monitoring board halted two key clinical trials after finding the drug "not appropriate for stroke patients" and removed it from studies involving patients with mild heart attacks. The author speculates that bleeding complications were the likely cause, given the drug's mechanism in the clotting pathway.

At the time of publication, vorapaxar represented a significant asset from Merck's acquisition of Schering-Plough, and the trial troubles resulted in an immediate 6% stock price decline for Merck. The article notes this development's impact on patients, researchers, and investors, while acknowledging that while vorapaxar wasn't the sole justification for the Schering-Plough acquisition, it represented a meaningful component of the deal's value proposition.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2011 trial suspensions, Merck continued developing vorapaxar with a revised strategy. The company completed the TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 trial in patients with previous myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease, excluding stroke patients. In May 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter requesting additional data. Merck conducted further analyses from the TRACER trial, which had shown excessive bleeding in the acute coronary syndrome population.

The FDA eventually approved vorapaxar under the brand name **Zontivity** in May 2014 for reducing thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with previous heart attack or peripheral artery disease, with specific warnings against use in patients with history of stroke, TIA, or intracranial hemorrhage. The drug launched with a black box warning about bleeding risk and requirements for careful patient selection.

Despite approval, Zontivity achieved only modest commercial success. Annual sales peaked around \$100-150 million, far below initial blockbuster expectations of \$1-2 billion. The drug faced competition from established antithrombotic agents and newer oral anticoagulants. By 2019, Merck announced it would discontinue Zontivity due to limited market uptake, with the drug eventually being withdrawn from the US market.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and assessments:

• **Bleeding complications suspected**: The author correctly speculated that bleeding was the likely cause of trial suspensions, which was later confirmed as excessive intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding events.

• **Significant commercial impact**: The prediction of substantial consequences for Merck's investment proved accurate - while the drug eventually gained approval, it generated only a fraction of projected revenues and was ultimately discontinued.

• **Trial populations affected market potential**: The identification that trouble in stroke and heart attack populations would limit commercial viability was prescient - FDA approval specifically excluded stroke patients, severely restricting the eligible patient population.

• **Merck's Schering-Plough acquisition risk**: The concern about the acquisition's value proposition was partially validated, as vorapaxar failed to deliver the anticipated blockbuster returns despite eventual regulatory approval.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates accurate early identification of serious drug development challenges that ultimately defined vorapaxar's limited commercial trajectory, despite eventual FDA approval and market launch.
