# Two Types of Risk (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the 2015 ASCO meeting abstracts and identifies two dominant therapeutic approaches: HER2/EGFR family (mature, heavily researched) and PD-1 (emerging immuno-oncology). The author contrasts these pathways—HER2 representing established tyrosine kinase inhibitor territory with decades of accumulated work, and PD-1 representing the new wave of immunotherapy generating significant excitement from strong clinical efficacy signals.

The central argument centers on **risk duality**: oncology drug development involves balancing scientific/biological risk against commercial/competitive risk. Targeting underserved cancers (glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer) minimizes commercial competition but faces higher scientific risk because these diseases remain difficult due to fundamental biological barriers. Conversely, entering crowded spaces like HER2 or PD-1/PD-L1 reduces scientific uncertainty but creates intense commercial risk as multiple companies race for the same indications with similar mechanisms. The author notes these risks exist along a conservation principle—reducing one typically increases the other—with the most challenging scenario being long-shot attempts to duplicate existing therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

**HER2/EGFR Landscape Evolution (2015-2020s):** The HER2 space did indeed remain intensely competitive. Multiple next-generation HER2 inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) advanced, including fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu), which showed strong efficacy in breast cancer and gastric cancer. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) had already launched in 2013 and continued expanding. Rather than moving away from HER2, the field saw continued refinement: new ADCs, pan-HER inhibitors (neratinib), and HER2-targeting in additional tumor types beyond breast cancer (gastric, lung, colorectal). This persistent activity validates the article's observation about the dense competitive landscape.

**PD-1/PD-L1 Immuno-Oncology Explosion:** The prediction about piling into immuno-oncology proved dramatically correct. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo) had both received initial approvals by 2014-2015 and subsequently expanded across dozens of tumor types. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), durvalumab (Imfinzi), and avelumab (Bavencio) followed. By 2020, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors became across-the-board standard of care for many cancers. However, severe competitive pressure emerged—by 2018-2019 there were multiple PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on the market or in late development, leading to price competition and challenging differentiation. Combination trials (PD-1 + CTLA-4, PD-1 + chemotherapy, PD-1 + novel immunotherapy agents) drove differentiation through unique combination strategies.

**Differentiation Outcomes:** In practice, differentiation occurred through several paths. Some PD-1/PD-L1 programs focused on novel combinations or niche biomarkers. Others pursued next-generation checkpoint inhibitors (LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT), though results there have been more mixed. For EGFR/HER2, continued investment in ADCs and bispecific antibodies did create meaningful differentiation.

**Underserved Cancers:** The hard-reality challenges of glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer largely persisted through 2024, validating the high scientific risk. Glioblastoma continued with limited therapeutic advances beyond temozolomide, though tumor-treating fields (Optune) gained some traction. Pancreatic cancer saw incremental improvements with modified chemotherapy regimens and specialized adjuvant approaches, but transformative breakthroughs remained elusive—illustrating the difficulty of converting biological understanding into clinical success.

Scientific risk vs commercial risk appears to have held as a durable framework for oncology strategy decisions through the late 2010s and early 2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

1. **Prediction:** Intense competition in PD-1/PD-1 space would create commercial/competitive differentiation challenges rather than purely scientific barriers.
   - **Outcome:** **Accurate.** The late 2010s did see enormous competition in PD-1/PD-L1 development, with 6+ approved agents by 2019, heavy investment in combination studies, and increasing focus on biomarker-defined subsets and regulatory strategies to differentiate products. Settling differentiation required extensive clinical data.

2. **Prediction:** HER2/EGFR area would remain heavily populated despite being considered "old news," with sustained high activity.
   - **Outcome:** **Accurate.** Continued innovation (next-generation TKIs, novel ADCs, combinations) kept HER2 a very active area. Enhertu's success actually reinvigorated interest. The field did not abandon established pathways but rather refined them.

3. **Prediction:** "Conservation law" where dialing down one type of risk probably dials up the other, with targeted therapies against underserved cancers minimizing commercial risk but maximizing scientific risk.
   - **Outcome:** **Largely accurate.** The fundamental trade-off did sustain. Aggressive investment in breakthrough approaches for glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer often faced high failure rates due to biology. Commercial differentiation remained difficult in PD-1/PD-L1. However, there were examples where both risks were high (truly novel targets) and examples where both were manageable (well-selected cancer subset with strong preliminary data).

4. **"Unicorn quadrant"** prediction for high-likelihood-of-success approaches targeting neglected areas.
   - **Outcome:** **Mixed.** Some successes occurred in rare cancers with defined genetics, but broad breakthroughs in historically intractable cancers remained rare. KRAS inhibitors (approved in 2021 for specific mutations) exemplify some of this, but those successes resulted from decades of difficult effort.

5. **Prediction:** Differentiation would require careful positioning to avoid crowded landing spots in the clinic.
   - **Outcome:** **Accurate.** Successful programs did employ distinct strategies: biomarker-defined subsets, novel combinations, selection of different tumor types, prioritizing speed to registration. Differentiation became central to both regulatory and commercial success.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provided an insightful strategic framework that largely predicted the competitive dynamics and risk balancing that oncology drug developers would face over the subsequent decade. It correctly identified emerging patterns before they became widely acknowledged, and the core risk duality concept proved durable. However, it didn't predict all specific pathways or address how genomics/computational advances might change the landscape.
