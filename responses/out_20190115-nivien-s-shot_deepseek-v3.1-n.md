# Nivien's Shot (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the failure of Nivien Therapeutics, a Harvard startup working on overcoming chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer by targeting the Hippo signaling pathway, specifically the YAP/TAZ/TEAD transcription factors. The company's approach appeared promising based on research suggesting that the YAP pathway regulates general drug resistance in tumor cells. However, while inhibition of this pathway proved technically possible, it was not sufficient to provide therapeutic benefit for cancer patients.

The article uses Nivien's failure (which occurred before human trials) as a case study illustrating the harsh realities of drug development, where most ideas and mechanisms fail despite promising preclinical data. It highlights the tension between the need for "irrational optimism" to secure funding and recruitment, versus the ethical imperative for transparency with investors, employees, and especially patients. The piece references essays by founder Nathaniel Horwitz and industry veteran John LaMattina to underscore how common such failures are in biotechnology, even when targeting genuine unmet medical needs like resistant pancreatic cancer.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the January 2019 publication, the Hippo/YAP pathway continued to be actively investigated as a cancer therapeutic target, though with mixed and complex outcomes that largely validated the article's cautionary tone.

**Continued Research but Limited Clinical Success:**
The scientific community maintained interest in Hippo pathway modulation, with numerous academic and industry groups pursuing YAP/TAZ inhibition strategies. However, by the mid-2020s, no Hippo pathway-targeting drugs had achieved FDA approval for cancer treatment. Most efforts remained in preclinical or early clinical stages.

**Pancreatic Cancer Landscape Evolution:**
While Hippo pathway drugs didn't break through, other advances occurred in pancreatic cancer treatment. Immunotherapy combinations, targeted therapies for specific genetic subtypes, and improved chemotherapy regimens showed incremental progress. However, pancreatic cancer remained one of the most challenging solid tumors, with overall survival improvements measured in months rather than transformative breakthroughs.

**Industry Pattern Validation:**
The failure rate the article described continued to characterize biotech investments. Preclinical failure rates remained high across oncology drug development, with mechanisms that showed promise in cell culture and animal models frequently failing to translate to human efficacy. This pattern persisted throughout 2019-2024 across multiple therapeutic modalities.

**Hippo Pathway Research Diversification:**
Research expanded beyond oncology, exploring Hippo pathway roles in tissue regeneration, fibrosis, and other diseases. Some of this work suggested potential therapeutic applications outside cancer, though clinical validation remained limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Most ideas for new drugs, and new modes of action for drugs, don't work out"** - This prediction reflected established industry reality and proved accurate. Clinical success rates for novel mechanisms remain low across the pharmaceutical industry. Hippo pathway drugs specifically have not achieved breakthrough status, though research continues.

• **Implicit prediction about Hippo pathway's limited therapeutic utility** - The article suggested that YAP pathway inhibition, while technically feasible, might not provide meaningful benefit to cancer patients. This proved largely correct; no Hippo-targeting drugs have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in cancer treatment, though research continues in academic settings.

• **Continued tension between hype and reality in biotech** - The article predicted that the field would remain "absolutely drenched with that oversold potential." This proved accurate, with biotech investment cycles continuing to show patterns of optimism preceding clinical data, followed by recalibration when mechanisms fail to deliver.

• **Pattern of preclinical failure preceding clinical failure** - The article's implicit message that preclinical success doesn't guarantee clinical utility remained highly relevant. Manymechanisms continued to show promise in early studies but failed in human trials, validating the article's cautionary stance.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article provides valuable insight into biotech failure modes and represents a realistic case study, but focuses on a relatively narrow therapeutic target rather than broader industry transformation. While well-written and educational, the specific Hippo pathway story hasn't proven to have the long-term importance that would warrant a higher score.
