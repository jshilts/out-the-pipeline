# Right To Try: Here We Go (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses newly enacted "Right To Try" laws, starting with Colorado, which aimed to allow terminally ill patients to access experimental therapies that had completed Phase I safety trials and were actively in Phase II. Proponents positioned this as compassionate access outside the traditional clinical trial pathway when approved therapies were exhausted and insurance was not required to cover costs nor companies mandated to provide drugs.

The author raises substantial skepticism, citing concerns from medical commentators that these laws may create false hope without materially expanding access beyond existing FDA compassionate use pathways. Key worries included potential exploitation by unscrupulous operators who might conduct minimal Phase I studies then profit from desperate patients during prolonged Phase II trials, particularly under provisions allowing companies to charge for therapies (Colorado permitted at-cost, while Arizona's proposed law gave companies discretion). The author references physicians like David Kroll and David Gorski who argued these laws assuaged political concerns more than addressing real barriers, noting that most clinical failures and significant toxicity emerge after Phase I.

The piece closes by noting Neuralstem Inc. already planned to offer its experimental neural stem cell therapy for ALS in Colorado under the new law, without FDA oversight, illustrating real-world implementation of the controversial approach.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 Colorado law, Right To Try legislation rapidly expanded across the United States. By 2018, forty-one states had enacted similar laws. This state-level momentum culminated in the federal Right to Try Act, signed into law by President Trump in May 2018, creating a national framework for accessing investigational drugs outside clinical trials for terminally ill patients who had exhausted approved treatments and could not participate in trials.

However, the practical impact of these laws proved more limited than advocates hoped. Contrary to the article's concern about widespread exploitation, the more significant outcome was disappointing utilization rates. Federal Right To Try required FDA notification but allowed companies to provide drugs without following traditional expanded access procedures. Despite this, most pharmaceutical companies remained hesitant due to liability concerns, manufacturing capacity limitations, and fears that adverse events outside controlled trials could jeopardize drug development programs. Data suggests few patients successfully accessed treatments through Right To Try pathways in the years following enactment.

Neuralstem, the company specifically mentioned in the article, faced difficulties in its ALS program. While the company continued stem cell research, the broader ALS field experienced continued challenges translating experimental therapies into proven treatments through the 2010s and early 2020s. Right To Try did not substantially accelerate access to effective ALS therapies, as the bottleneck remained scientific discovery rather than regulatory barriers.

The laws did not lead to the widespread quackery feared in the article, though isolated incidents of problematic stem cell clinics and unproven therapies continued to operate through other regulatory gaps. The more enduring policy legacy has been continued debate about balancing patient autonomy, safety oversight, and incentives for evidence-based drug development rather than fundamental transformation of access to experimental medicines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions about the trajectory of Right To Try laws and their consequences:

- **Prediction that Right To Try would enable unscrupulous operators to exploit desperate patients through minimal Phase I studies then prolonged profiteering**: **Partially incorrect**. While problematic stem cell clinics and unproven therapies persisted, widespread systematic exploitation under Right To Try provisions did not materialize as feared. The major issue became underutilization rather than predatory commercialization, as legitimate pharmaceutical companies largely avoided the pathway due to liability and complexity concerns.

- **Prediction that these laws would create "false hope" without expanding real access beyond FDA compassionate use**: **Largely correct**. Federal Right To Try did not significantly increase actual patient access compared to existing expanded access pathways. The FDA's compassionate use programs continued to be the primary route for investigational drugs, with Right To Try having minimal practical impact on patient outcomes.

- **Prediction that allowing companies to charge for therapies would incentivize questionable practices, particularly with creative interpretations of "at cost"**: **Moderately correct in principle, but limited in scale**. The charging provisions did create problematic incentives, but the small number of companies willing to participate under Right To Try limited the scope of abuse compared to projections. Most legitimate companies avoided both charging and participation due to reputational and legal risks.

- **Implicit prediction that most clinical failures and safety issues occurring after Phase I would make early access pathways problematic**: **Remained accurate**. Post-2014 evidence reinforced that Phase I safety does not predict therapeutic efficacy or comprehensive safety profiles. The high failure rate of drugs in Phase II and III trials continued, validating concerns that early access would expose patients to ineffective or harmful treatments without meaningful benefit.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates considerable prescience about the practical limitations and potential risks of Right To Try legislation while capturing an important moment in healthcare policy. The piece thoughtfully balances complex considerations around patient autonomy, regulatory oversight, and scientific evidence, accurately identifying that the fundamental challenge in drug development is discovery rather than bureaucracy. The author's nuanced position between false hope rhetoric and genuine compassion remains relevant as debates over accelerated access continue in oncology and rare diseases. The piece warrants attention for its clear-eyed analysis of policy intentions versus likely outcomes, though the dramatic expansion of state-level laws followed by federal enactment adds historical significance that exceeded the article's immediate scope.

The article missed some important details about existing FDA expanded access pathways and could have better distinguished between state and federal regulatory authority, but its core skepticism about Right To Try's practical impact proved largely justified by subsequent events, making it more insightful than typical industry commentary.
