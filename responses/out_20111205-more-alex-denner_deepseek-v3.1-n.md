# More on Alex Denner (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Science Magazine profiles Alex Denner, a biotech investor who had previously worked with Carl Icahn. The article serves as a follow-up to earlier coverage of Denner's activities in the biotech investment world. It references a more in-depth Bloomberg profile that provides background on Denner's career and mentions lifestyle details like dining habits. The post suggests that industry observers were interested in Denner's next moves as he transitioned from working with Icahn to starting his own investment fund, with the key question being which companies he would target next.

## 2. HISTORY
Alex Denner went on to establish Sarissa Capital Management after leaving Icahn's fund in 2011. The firm pursued an activist investment strategy primarily focused on healthcare and biotechnology companies. 

**Key subsequent developments:**
- Denner's Sarissa Capital took significant positions in multiple biotech companies including **Biogen**, **Ariad Pharmaceuticals**, and **The Medicines Company** (which was later acquired by Novartis in 2020 for $9.7 billion)
- Sarissa was involved in pushing for changes at Ariad Pharmaceuticals, where Denner joined the board in 2013; the company faced challenges including FDA safety concerns over its leukemia drug Iclusig
- At Biogen, Sarissa built a substantial stake and Denner joined the board in 2017, becoming actively involved in strategic decisions; Biogen faced both successes (Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy) and notable failures (controversial Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm)
- Sarissa's activist approach generated mixed results - some successful exits (The Medicines Company sale) but also significant volatility in portfolio companies
- The firm's strategy exemplified the growing trend of activist investors in biotech, influencing corporate governance, R&D decisions, and M&A activity in the sector

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original article contained no explicit predictions about Denner's future activities or investment outcomes. It focused primarily on reporting his career transition and the industry's curiosity about his next targets.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8/10**

This article proved highly consequential as it marked the early coverage of a significant biotech activist investor whose subsequent activities materially impacted multiple publicly traded companies and exemplified broader trends in healthcare investment strategies over the following decade.

*Reasoning: The article's subject went on to substantially influence several major biotech companies through activist positions, making it more impactful than typical investor profiles while providing early insight into evolving biotech investment strategies.*
