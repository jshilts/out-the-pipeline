# I Don't See How This Qualifies As Bliss (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from November 23, 2004 is primarily a logistical update about the author's blogging schedule, noting that there would be a post the following day and then a break until Monday. The author recommends readers check out a post on Uncertain Principles blog related to "public discussions of drug discovery and safety." The post also mentions that the author is rebuilding their blogroll and encourages readers to explore unfamiliar sites, with plans to add medical and pharmaceutical links. The title reference to "bliss" appears connected to the recommended reading about drug discovery discussions.

## 2. HISTORY

The linked post at Uncertain Principles (from the steelypips.org domain) discussed principles relevant to public understanding of drug discovery and safety debates. Unfortunately, the specific link provided in the 2004 post is no longer accessible, so the exact content and arguments cannot be verified. The post appears to have been part of ongoing discussions in the mid-2000s about pharmaceutical industry practices, drug safety controversies (such as those surrounding COX-2 inhibitors like Vioxx, which was withdrawn in September 2004), and public communication about medical research. The author's blogging activity represented the growing influence of science bloggers in discussing pharmaceutical and medical topics during this period, when blogging was becoming an increasingly important platform for scientific discourse outside traditional academic channels.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This post does not contain predictions about future biotechnology developments. It is primarily a short administrative update about blogging schedule and recommended reading, rather than a substantive analytical piece making forward-looking statements about the industry.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 1/10**

This is essentially a blog housekeeping post with minimal substantive content about biotechnology, serving mainly as a redirect to another reading without providing original analysis or commentary on the industry.
