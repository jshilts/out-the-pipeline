# Kurt Deshayes At The Challenges in Chemical Biology Conference (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 conference commentary describes Kurt Deshayes of Genentech discussing challenges in developing protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. The article highlights two key issues: (1) The apparent contradiction that large molecules like ABT-199 (approximately 1000 molecular weight) can achieve oral bioavailability despite conventional wisdom favoring smaller molecules (~300 MW), questioning established dogma about what makes drugs orally available. (2) Genentech's experience with XIAP inhibitor development revealed unexpected biological activities that couldn't have been predicted theoretically, emphasizing the complexity of biological systems. The author notes that success requires empirical testing - "get in and mess with the system" rather than relying solely on rational design.

## 2. HISTORY
**ABT-199 (venetoclax):** The drug went on to become one of the most successful PPI inhibitors ever developed. It received FDA approval in 2016 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with 17p deletion, representing the first FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor. It has since gained additional approvals for various hematologic malignancies and become a standard of care. Kinoshita et al. (2016) reported its molecular weight as 868.4, validating Deshayes' point about larger molecules achieving oral bioavailability.

**PPI drug development reality:** While venetoclax succeeded, the broader PPI field proved challenging. A 2022 review (Arkin et al.) noted that PPI drugs remain rare despite advances, with most approved PPI inhibitors targeting intracellular complexes failing in development. However, several additional PPI drugs have reached market including sotorasib (KRAS inhibitor, 2021) and brexucabtagene autoleucel (CAR-T therapy).

**XIAP research trajectory:** XIAP inhibitors have not translated into clinical success. Multiple companies pursued XIAP antagonists for cancer therapy, including Genentech and TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals, but clinical trials showed limited efficacy. No XIAP inhibitor has received FDA approval, indicating Genentech's caution about unpredictable biology was prescient.

**Scientific impact:** Deshayes' point about empirical testing became increasingly relevant as chemical biology embraced phenotypic screening and CRISPR-based functional genomics, acknowledging the limitations of purely target-based drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction: Large oral PPI drugs can work** ✓ LARGELY VALIDATED
  - ABT-199 proved this correct with major clinical and commercial success, though it remains one of few examples

• **Explicit concern: "How often?" can large PPI drugs succeed** ✓ REMAINS VALID
  - Subsequent history showed it's possible but not common - PPI drugs remain challenging and rare, especially for intracellular targets

• **Implicit: XIAP research might not translate despite strong biology** ✓ PRESCIENT
  - XIAP inhibitors failed in clinical development, validating the "unpredictable biology" concern

• **General principle: Empiricism over rational design** ✓ WELL-ESTABLISHED
  - Drug discovery increasingly embraced phenotypic screening and mechanistic agnostic approaches, validating the hands-on experimental philosophy

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article identified key challenges before PPI drug development's successes and failures were apparent, including discussing ABT-199 pre-approval and correctly anticipating that complex biology often defies prediction.
