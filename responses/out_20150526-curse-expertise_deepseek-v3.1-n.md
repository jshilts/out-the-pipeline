# The Curse of Expertise (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reflects on an editorial by David Sackett, the epidemiologist who pioneered evidence-based medicine, who had recently passed away. Sackett identified what he called the "sins of expertness": first, experts' prestige gives their opinions undue persuasive power that discourages challenges and impairs scientific progress; second, peer reviewers evaluating grant applications and manuscripts tend to accept or reject new ideas based on whether they align with established expert consensus rather than purely on scientific merit. 

As a proposed solution, Sackett suggested the "systematic retirement of experts" — encouraging established experts to move into entirely new problem areas where, having shed their prestige and prior positions, they could evaluate evidence and ideas on their merits alone. The article's author notes that while some experts do transition to administrative roles or retire, there remain "far more experts around than is healthy for the advancement of science."

## 2. HISTORY

In the years since this article's publication, the issues Sackett identified have gained increased recognition across scientific fields, though systematic solutions remain elusive.

The **reproducibility crisis** that became widely discussed in the mid-2010s reinforced many of Sackett's concerns, as numerous high-profile findings — particularly in psychology, cancer biology, and preclinical drug discovery — failed to replicate. Meta-research revealed that expert consensus and prestigious authorship often correlated with papers that were later found to be irreproducible.

**Structural responses** have emerged: journals increasingly require pre-registration of studies, data sharing, and statistical review; funding agencies have implemented policies incentivizing replication studies and robustness checks. However, these address methodological quality more than the social dynamics of expertise that Sackett highlighted.

In **biomedical research specifically**, the 2010s saw continued tension between established paradigms and disruptive approaches. Notably, the field grappled with failures of the amyloid hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease drug development — where decades of expert consensus guided research toward targets that produced numerous clinical failures. Similarly, debates over cancer research priorities (whether focusing on targeted therapies, immunotherapy, or alternative approaches) often reflected Sackett's observation about expert consensus shaping funding decisions.

**The COVID-19 pandemic** starkly illustrated both the value and the dangers of expert authority. Scientific expertise was essential for vaccine development and public health guidance, but expert disagreements and evolving recommendations also generated public confusion and eroded trust. The pandemic revealed how expert prestige can amplify correct information but also solidify premature conclusions that later require revision.

Contemporary discussions around **diversity in science** also connect to Sackett's themes, as broadening participation challenges the demographic and intellectual homogeneity of traditional expert communities that may inadvertently reinforce consensus positions.

However, there has been **no widespread "systematic retirement" movement** as Sackett envisioned. Academic career structures, funding mechanisms, and peer review continue to rely heavily on established experts. While some prominent scientists do pivot to new fields, this remains the exception rather than a systematic practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific testable predictions about biotechnology or science. However, several implicit expectations can be evaluated:

- **Implicit expectation**: That the problems Sackett identified would persist without intervention.
  - **Outcome**: Despite increased awareness of these issues, the core dynamics Sackett described remain largely unchanged in academic science. The reproducibility crisis and continued challenges in peer review and grant funding validate his concerns, but no transformative structural changes have occurred.

- **Implicit expectation**: That systematic retirement of experts might gain traction as a solution.
  - **Outcome**: This has not materialized. Academic institutions, funding agencies, and scientific communities have not adopted systematic retirement practices. Experts continue to dominate review processes and shape research priorities throughout their careers.

- **Implicit expectation**: That the tension between expert consensus and scientific progress would remain problematic.
  - **Outcome**: This has been validated across multiple domains. Examples include continued debates over Alzheimer's research directions, nutrition science controversies, and the challenges of paradigm shifts in various fields. The dynamics Sackett described remain highly relevant.

The broader **meta-prediction** — that expertise brings systematic costs to scientific advancement — has found support in subsequent research on groupthink, publication bias, and the sociology of scientific communities.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addresses enduring structural problems in scientific communities that remain highly relevant. While it doesn't focus on biotechnology breakthroughs or drug development per se, it identifies foundational issues affecting how biomedical research progresses — or fails to progress. The themes have proven prescient given later developments around reproducibility and scientific reform.
