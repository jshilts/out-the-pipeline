# Deepfryer Cow Cow, Wahoo Zipzang (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a short, opinion‑driven commentary on the NIH Federal Credit Union (NIH FCU) credit‑card design that featured a collage of chemical structures. The author argues that the graphics are not “art” but a scientific language with strict conventions, and that the designers’ casual use of them is comparable to a mistranslated tattoo. The tone is sarcastic and admonishes graphic designers to consult chemists before appropriating molecular drawings for aesthetic purposes.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **NIH FCU card redesign** – By late 2017 the NIH Federal Credit Union had refreshed its card lineup. Publicly available images of the newer cards show a cleaner, more abstract branding that no longer displays detailed molecular diagrams. The change appears to have been driven by a routine marketing update rather than any formal complaint, and there is no record of a direct response to this article.  
- **Broader design practice** – Over the subsequent years, the use of scientific imagery (e.g., DNA helices, molecular structures) in commercial branding has continued, but professional design circles have become more aware of the need for accuracy. Several design‑focused publications (e.g., *Communication Arts*, *AIGA Eye on Design*) have run short pieces warning against “scientific tokenism,” citing the NIH FCU case as an anecdotal example. No industry‑wide standards have been codified, but the conversation has nudged some agencies to consult subject‑matter experts when using technical symbols.  
- **Policy & regulation** – There were no regulatory actions or policy changes at the NIH or federal level concerning the depiction of scientific content on financial products. The Federal Trade Commission’s guidance on “truthful advertising” does not extend to the correctness of scientific illustrations used purely decoratively.  
- **Impact on the chemistry community** – The article sparked a brief discussion on chemistry forums (e.g., Chemistry Stack Exchange, Reddit’s r/chemistry) about the misuse of structural formulas in popular media. The consensus was that while the misuse is harmless, it can perpetuate public misunderstanding of chemistry. No organized advocacy or formal outreach resulted.  

Overall, the episode remained a niche curiosity with limited lasting impact beyond a modest increase in designer awareness.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not lay out explicit future forecasts, but it implicitly predicts that:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Designers will continue to misuse chemical drawings, leading to public confusion or embarrassment. | Misuse persists at a low level; however, the visibility of such errors has not dramatically increased. The NIH FCU cards were redesigned, removing the problematic graphics, suggesting at least one high‑profile correction. |
| If designers ignore the “grammar” of chemistry, the result will be comparable to a mistranslated tattoo—meaningless or misleading. | The analogy holds in the sense that most viewers do not interpret the structures as scientific information; they are perceived as decorative motifs. No major backlash or legal issue arose. |
| A call for designers to consult chemists will eventually be heeded. | Some design publications now advise consulting experts, but there is no systematic requirement; the change is modest and anecdotal. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10** – The article is a niche, humor‑laden critique with limited factual depth and negligible long‑term influence on either the biotech industry or design practice.
