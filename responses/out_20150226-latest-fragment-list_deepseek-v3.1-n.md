# The Latest Fragment List (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from Science Magazine's "In the Pipeline" blog highlights an updated list of over thirty drugs that had entered clinical development using fragment-based drug design (FBDD) as of early 2015. The author, Derek Lowe, took the occasion to note that while FBDD isn't a "magic wand" for drug discovery, it had become a legitimate part of the medicinal chemistry toolkit, thus answering skeptics who questioned whether the approach had produced anything concrete. The post did not provide the entire list of fragment-derived clinical candidates, but pointed readers to the Practical Fragments blog for the detailed compilation.

## 2. HISTORY

Fragment-based drug design continued to mature after 2015, with fragment-to-lead campaigns and fragment-derived clinical assets growing steadily. A number of FDA-approved drugs that began with fragments reached patients, including vemurafenib (Zelboraf) for BRAF+ melanoma, venetoclax (Venclexta) for certain leukemias, and pexidartinib (Turalio) for tenosynovial giant cell tumor. Academically, FBDD became widely taught and practiced, and biopharma organizations built dedicated fragment screening platforms, often pairing them with high-throughput crystallography, NMR, and surface plasmon resonance. While FBDD did not displace high-throughput screening, it became a standard complementary approach for difficult or "undruggable" targets, and fragment screening libraries grew in chemical diversity and quality. Commercial fragment libraries and biophysical screening services expanded, enabling smaller companies and academic labs to use FBDD without massive infrastructure investment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit: FBDD would continue to produce clinical candidates.** This proved accurate. Since 2015, fragment-screening origins were reported for additional approved drugs (e.g., sotorasib/Lumakras for KRAS G12C+ NSCLC) and numerous clinical-stage programs targeting kinases, protein–protein interactions, and other challenging target classes.
- **Fragments would remain a "legitimate part of the toolkit" rather than a universal panacea.** FBDD became a mainstream medicinal chemistry strategy, often combined with structure-based design, but did not become the sole discovery paradigm. It is commonly used when targets lack pharmacophores suitable for HTS or when high-resolution structural data enable rapid fragment-to-lead growth.
- **The "magic wand" remark suggests the author expected continued, incremental validation rather than sudden breakthroughs.** That view matched subsequent reality: FBDD delivered real drugs and tools, but mostly followed established optimization paths rather than revolutionizing timelines or success rates in drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The post serves as a brief progress update and signpost with limited original analysis, so its long-term importance is modest compared with deeper reviews or primary reports of fragment-derived drug approvals. It is, however, a useful historical marker showing FBDD's growing acceptance around 2015.
