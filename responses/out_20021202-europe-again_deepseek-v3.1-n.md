# Europe, Again
**December 2002**

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article addresses the lack of scientific and technological innovation in Europe compared to the United States, focusing specifically on the pharmaceutical industry. The author references Stephen den Beste's analysis of Europe as a "high-tech disaster area" with only a few bright spots, notably the Swiss pharmaceutical industry (Roche, Novartis).

The central observation is that despite Europe having capable pharmaceutical companies, the most innovative drug discovery research has shifted to the United States. Foreign companies like Novartis are expanding research operations not in their home countries but in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while Roche's HIV drug T-20 is being produced in Colorado rather than Basel. The article notes that major European pharmaceutical companies (GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Aventis) maintain substantial US research operations.

The author attributes American dominance in pharmaceutical research to cultural factors: tolerance for risk-taking, willingness to try unconventional ideas, persistence in problem-solving, and an informal, non-deferential attitude—illustrated through a story about an American child freely greeting an adult stranger and the author's own experience improvising lab equipment using a pet store aquarium pump during postdoctoral work in Germany.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decades confirmed and amplified the trends identified in this 2002 article. The geographic shift of pharmaceutical R&D to the United States accelerated significantly:

**Industry Consolidation and Relocation:** Major European pharmaceutical companies substantially expanded their US research presence throughout the 2000s and 2010s. Novartis's Cambridge facility became a major research hub, and the company shifted significant operations to Massachusetts. Similar patterns occurred with Roche (which expanded in California and other US locations), AstraZeneca (which established major operations in Boston and other US cities), and GSK.

**Clinical Research Migration:** By the 2010s, the US dominated clinical trial activity, conducting roughly 40-50% of global clinical trials, with Europe following at around 25-35%. Major drug approvals increasingly relied on US-based research infrastructure.

**T-20 (Fuzeon/Enfuvirtide) Outcome:** The Roche HIV drug mentioned in the article was approved by the FDA in March 2003, shortly after this article was published. It became the first fusion inhibitor for HIV treatment but had limited patient uptake due to requiring twice-daily injections. While innovative, it was largely superseded by more convenient oral medications, consistent with the author's skeptical comment about it being "a little too innovative."

The cultural factors the author identified—risk tolerance and decentralized decision-making—continued to differentiate US pharmaceutical research. However, growing regulatory complexity and industry consolidation gradually affected both US and European innovation in later years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions about pharmaceutical research trends:

• **European companies requiring substantial US research presence to remain competitive**: **VERIFIED**. Major European pharmaceutical companies increasingly relied on US-based research operations throughout the 2000s-2020s. Companies like Novartis, Roche, GSK, and AstraZeneca maintained and expanded US facilities as essential to their innovation strategies.

• **US maintaining dominance in innovative drug discovery research**: **MOSTLY VERIFIED**. The US continued to lead in new drug approvals and innovative research through 2020, though the gap narrowed somewhat with globalization and increased investment in some European countries. The US typically accounted for 40-60% of global new molecular entity approvals annually.

• **Roche's T-20 potentially being "too innovative" for commercial success**: **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**. T-20 was indeed approved but had limited adoption due to delivery challenges (injections rather than oral medication), validating the author's caution while still demonstrating technical innovation.

• **Cultural factors (American risk tolerance and informality) driving continued research success**: **DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY**. While the US maintained research leadership, methodological and cultural changes in science make this prediction harder to evaluate definitively, particularly as European countries and Asia increased biotech investment and innovation.

• **Germany and France remaining secondary to Britain and Switzerland in pharmaceuticals**: **VERIFIED WITH NUANCE**. Britain and Switzerland maintained strong pharmaceutical industries, while Germany's Bayer and France's Aventis (later part of Sanofi) remained significant but generally secondary to US-UK-Swiss leadership through the period.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article demonstrates prescient understanding of important geographic shifts in pharmaceutical research and identifies cultural factors that proved durable over decades. However, it primarily describes an existing trend rather than predicting major new developments, limiting its forward-looking impact.
