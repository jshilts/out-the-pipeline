# Get the Science Out of Your Yogurt (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article criticizes a yogurt company (Chobani) for using the slogan "Nature got us to 100 calories. Not scientists. #howmatters," arguing this represents an anti-science marketing strategy. The author contends this slogan is hypocritical and cynical because Chobani relies heavily on food science and industrial processes for shelf stability, fermentation, sterilization, and distribution. The piece highlights how this marketing appeals to consumers who believe "science = icky" and that companies intentionally mislead customers with natural/false narratives to sell products, despite using industrial-scale manufacturing with stainless steel equipment and fleets of trucks.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this article, this type of "clean label" and "natural" marketing strategy proved highly successful for food companies. Chobani continued growing: by 2016 it was America's top-selling Greek yogurt brand with over $1.4 billion in revenue. The company maintained marketing emphasizing simple, natural ingredients while expanding its industrial production capacity - opening a massive 1 million square foot facility in Idaho in 2016.

The broader food industry adopted similar "anti-science" messaging as an effective marketing tool, with terms like "no artificial ingredients," "no added chemicals," and "natural" becoming standard across brands. This coincided with increased consumer interest in "clean eating" and skepticism toward industrial food production, despite food science actually enabling safer, more consistent products. Companies like Chobani benefited financially from this paradox - using science extensively while marketing against it. No major regulatory changes occurred specifically about this type of marketing, though FDA continues to provide voluntary guidance on "natural" labeling claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction**: The cynical marketing strategy would continue being effective on gullible consumers.

• **Implicit prediction**: Companies would keep profiting from anti-science messaging while relying heavily on food science.

• **Implicit prediction**: The disconnect between science-based production and anti-science marketing would persist in the food industry.

All three implicit predictions proved accurate. The food industry has largely maintained this approach, with natural/clean labeling remaining a dominant marketing strategy through the present day. The same consumer base remains valuable for these brands, and there's no indication this marketing paradigm has diminished in effectiveness or profitability.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
The article touches on enduring patterns in food marketing, but deals with relatively minor consumer culture issues rather than substantive scientific developments or policy questions. It has some contextual interest as commentary on anti-science consumer attitudes.
