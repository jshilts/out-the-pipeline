# Read, And Read the Odd Stuff (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary by Derek Lowe advocates for scientists to read scientific literature broadly and outside their immediate subdisciplinary specialty. The author explains that he reads widely to prepare himself for unexpected opportunities and discoveries, driven by the fear of missing important connections. He acknowledges that while the literature has grown substantially over the years, tools like RSS feeds and graphical abstracts help with navigation. The piece emphasizes actively following reference chains to explore unfamiliar journals and topics. Lowe notes that effective reading requires energy, time, and mental organization—skills that can be learned and practiced. The article also highlights that disciplinary silos create opportunities: scientists who cross boundaries can make novel connections that others miss. The core message is that broad reading habits develop valuable research skills and increase the chances of innovative insights.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2017 article, several developments have shaped how scientists access and engage with scientific literature:

**Technological and Platform Changes:**
- Growing prominence of preprint servers, particularly bioRxiv (launched 2013 but expanded significantly post-2017) and medRxiv (launched 2019), making early-stage research accessible
- Increased use of AI-powered literature discovery tools like Semantic Scholar and tools with automated recommendation engines
- Expansion of open-access publishing and Plan S initiatives, affecting accessibility of scientific papers
- Development of more sophisticated literature management and annotation tools

**Information Landscape and Practices:**
- COVID-19 (2020-2023) accelerated preprint culture as rapid information sharing became essential, though this also heightened concerns about misinformation and quality control
- The literature continued expanding exponentially, making selective reading strategies more critical
- Interdisciplinary research gained institutional support through funding initiatives, validating merit in cross-boundary scientific exploration

**Business and Industry Evolution:**
- Increased commercialization of literature databases and discovery platforms, with continued dominance of major academic publishers
- Development of paid tools specifically for competitive intelligence and patent research in biotechnology sectors

Concrete changes in the biotechnology drug development sector include continued heavy reliance on both narrow specialization and cross-disciplinary collaboration, particularly as new modalities like gene therapies, CRISPR-based therapeutics, and immuno-oncology became prominent. The value of cross-domain connections Lowe advocated became especially evident as these novel technologies required integration of knowledge from molecular biology, chemistry, immunology, and computational approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions but rather offered observations and advice about effective scientific practice.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This piece addresses a genuine challenge that scientists faced then and continue to face today, but it provides general guidance rather than novel insights or actionable tools to manage the growing literature burden.
