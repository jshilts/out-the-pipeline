# What's An Important Paper? Take the JACS Challenge! (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short blog post describes an empirical challenge designed to test whether scientists can predict which papers will become important at the time of publication. The author references ScienceGeist's "JACS Challenge," which asks participants to review a ten-year-old issue of the *Journal of the American Chemical Society* (Volume 125, Issue 31) and predict which papers have had the most impact. The challenge explicitly asks participants not to look up citation counts or other metrics—instead relying on their "mighty scientific intuition." The author planned to participate and expressed interest in seeing the collective results, framing this as a test of the scientific community's ability to identify significant work when it first appears.

## 2. HISTORY

The JACS Challenge appears to have been part of broader efforts to understand how scientific impact can be predicted and measured. The explicit "don't cheat" instruction—avoiding citation counts—suggests the challenge was testing intuitive judgment against bibliometric reality. However, I cannot access the actual survey results, participant data, or subsequent analyses from this specific challenge. Without the ability to search for follow-up studies or published outcomes, I cannot report concrete findings about whether participants successfully identified high-impact papers or what factors predicted their accuracy. The underlying question—whether scientists can distinguish important work at publication—remains actively studied in scientometrics and the sociology of science, but the empirical results from *this particular challenge* are not accessible to me.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions appear in the article. The piece describes an ongoing challenge rather than forecasting future outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article is a brief blog post about a niche empirical challenge rather than a substantive analysis of biotechnology or scientific impact. Its primary value is methodological curiosity rather than long-term importance to the biotech industry.
