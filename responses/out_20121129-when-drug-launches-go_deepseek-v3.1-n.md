# When Drug Launches Go Bad (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2012 blog post references a FiercePharma list of the "worst drug launches of recent years," highlighting three specific examples: Benlysta (belimumab) for lupus, Provenge (sipuleucel-T) for prostate cancer, and Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) for preterm birth prevention. The post also mentions Krystexxa (pegloticase) for chronic gout, noting ironically that the unusual name might have contributed to its commercial struggles. The article serves as a cautionary commentary on the challenges drugs can face even after regulatory approval, emphasizing that clinical success does not guarantee market success.

## 2. HISTORY

**Benlysta (belimumab)** - Approved by FDA in March 2011 for systemic lupus erythematosus, Benlysta did indeed struggle commercially after launch. Sales were initially disappointing, with 2012 revenues of only $116 million from GSK, far below expectations. However, the drug eventually found its footing with 2023 global sales reaching approximately $1.8 billion, demonstrating that slow starts don't necessarily predict long-term failure. The drug has since received additional approvals and remains an important treatment option for lupus patients.

**Provenge (sipuleucel-T)** - This prostate cancer immunotherapy faced catastrophic commercial failure. Despite FDA approval in April 2010 and initial enthusiasm about its novel mechanism, Provenge struggled with its $93,000 price tag, complex manufacturing and administration process, and competition from cheaper oral therapies. Dendreon, the manufacturer, filed for bankruptcy in November 2014, just four years after launch. The drug was eventually acquired by Valeant (now Bausch Health) in 2015 and later Sanpower Group in 2017, but never achieved meaningful market penetration.

**Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate)** - This preterm birth prevention drug became embroiled in a major pricing controversy. After FDA approval in February 2011, KV Pharmaceutical raised the price from around $10-20 per injection to approximately $1,500, drawing widespread criticism. The FDA subsequently allowed compounded versions to remain available, undermining Makena's market exclusivity. In April 2023, FDA officially withdrew approval for Makena after post-marketing studies failed to confirm efficacy, marking one of the few instances of a drug being removed from the market due to lack of confirmed clinical benefit.

**Krystexxa (pegloticase)** - Approved in September 2010 for chronic gout refractory to conventional treatment, Krystexxa initially underperformed commercially due to limited patient population and infusion requirements. However, the drug has seen steady growth, particularly after FDA approval in 2022 for use in combination with methotrexate to improve response rates and reduce immunogenicity. Sales reached approximately $600 million in 2023, demonstrating successful adaptation to market challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made no explicit predictions about future drug launches or market dynamics. It was primarily descriptive rather than predictive in nature.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This brief article proved surprisingly prescient in highlighting the diverse challenges that can derail drug launches, with the cited examples following very different long-term trajectories that illustrate the complexity of pharmaceutical commercialization. The cases demonstrated that pricing, administration complexity, manufacturing challenges, and reimbursement issues can be as important as clinical efficacy in determining commercial success.
