# That Academic-Industrial Collaboration Panel (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief blog post from February 2012 by Derek Lowe (writing for Science Magazine's "In the Pipeline" blog) announcing the availability of streaming video from a panel discussion on academic-industrial collaboration that took place at the SLAS2012 conference. The SLAS conference (Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening) brought together researchers interested in drug discovery technologies and methodologies. The panel focused on how academic researchers and industrial pharmaceutical/biotech companies can work together more effectively. Lowe provides a direct link to the video stream and a self-deprecating comment about viewers potentially wanting to fast-forward or pause him during the presentation, suggesting the recording preserves a real-time conference session for on-demand viewing.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at the broader context of academic-industrial collaboration in drug discovery since 2012, several concrete developments occurred:

**Continued Growth in Partnerships**: Academic-industry partnerships in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals intensified throughout the 2010s. Major initiatives like the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), launched in 2011, gained momentum and by 2016-2020 had facilitated numerous academic-industry partnerships for drug development. The Structural Genomics Consortium expanded academic-industrial partnerships in early-stage drug discovery.

**Specific Collaborative Outcomes**: Between 2012-2022, numerous FDA-approved drugs emerged from academic-industry collaborations. Examples include cancer therapies developed through partnerships between academic centers and pharmaceutical companies, as well as gene therapies where academic research (often at universities like UPenn for CAR-T cells) was commercialized through industry partnerships. CAR-T therapy Kymriah (approved 2017) exemplifies successful academic-industrial collaboration leading to clinical translation.

**SLAS Conference Evolution**: The SLAS conference continued to be a major venue for discussions about academic-industrial collaboration. Attendance at SLAS conferences grew through the 2010s, reaching over 6,000 attendees annually at the peak, with academic-industrial partnership sessions remaining a staple. The organization expanded internationally with European conferences and continued publishing the Journal of Biomolecular Screening (now SLAS Discovery).

**Technology Transfer Infrastructure**: Universities strengthened their technology transfer offices throughout this period. By 2018-2020, major research universities were reporting hundreds of millions in licensing revenue from academic discoveries commercialized through industry partnerships.

**Challenges Persisted**: Despite successes, many collaborations continued to face challenges around intellectual property rights, publication restrictions, and misaligned timelines between academic research speed and industry development cycles—issues that panels like the 2012 SLAS session would have addressed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The blog post itself doesn't make explicit predictions about the future, as it's primarily an announcement about the availability of conference video content. It doesn't forecast specific outcomes or trends in academic-industrial collaboration, instead serving as documentation of a contemporary discussion. The implicit suggestion is that academic-industrial collaboration would remain an important topic for the drug discovery community, which proved accurate as these partnerships continued expanding through the decade.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The content primarily serves as a historical announcement of conference proceedings rather than substantive analysis of the actual panel discussion or its implications. While the topic of academic-industrial collaboration was indeed important and remained relevant, the blog post itself doesn't provide analytical insight—it's simply a vehicle for sharing conference video content, making it of limited lasting interest or importance.
