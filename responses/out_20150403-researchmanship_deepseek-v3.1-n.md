# Researchmanship (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a humorous piece originally published in ACS Chemtech in the 1980s called "Researchmanship," which recounts the techniques used by a graduate student named James J. Pudvin to create the appearance of dedication and hard work while actually avoiding real laboratory effort. Pudvin's signature tactic was to simulate all-night lab sessions approximately twice monthly by signing up for the preparative GLC (gas-liquid chromatography) unit during evening hours, bringing various props including flasks, a coffee pot, radio, and green eyeshade to the GLC room, then leaving at 8:30 PM after posting a "BACK IN A MINUTE" sign while leaving lights on and the radio playing. He would return at 8:00 AM appearing haggard and pale, proudly presenting a flask of "100% pure" material that was actually just ethyl acetate. The piece was framed as timeless advice about academic performance and appearances in graduate school, though some elements were acknowledged as outdated by 2015.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 blog post brought renewed attention to this decades-old satirical piece about academic culture. Since its republication, "Researchmanship" has circulated within scientific communities as a humorous commentary on graduate school experiences and academic posturing. The piece has been shared across various online platforms serving scientists and graduate students, often eliciting recognition and amusement from those familiar with academic laboratory environments. The satire has maintained relevance because the underlying dynamics it describes—pressure to demonstrate visible effort, performance of dedication, and the gap between appearance and reality in academic work—persist in modern graduate programs despite technological changes in research methodology. Stuart Cantrill's blog and Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" commentary helped reintroduce this material to a new generation of researchers, continuing its life as cultural commentary on scientific training. No transformative policy changes, commercial developments, or institutional reforms resulted directly from this piece's circulation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No specific predictions about future biotechnology developments, drug approvals, regulatory changes, or commercial outcomes were made in this article. The piece is entirely retrospective satire about academic culture, with no forward-looking statements about scientific or technological evolution. The only temporal reference was the author's observation that "some of the advice is a bit outdated" while noting that "a lot of it is timeless"—an accurate assessment given the continued relevance of the satirical observations about academic performance and laboratory culture in graduate education.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 1/10**

While mildly entertaining as cultural commentary about academic life, this article has minimal relevance to biotechnology industry developments, scientific advancement, or substantive analysis of the field. It serves primarily as light humor for scientists rather than providing insight into biotechnology trends, innovations, or outcomes.
