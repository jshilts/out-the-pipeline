# Reasons to Be Different (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article explores analogies between the pharmaceutical industry and other sectors, ultimately arguing that drug discovery has unique characteristics that make it fundamentally different. The author compares pharma to Hollywood film production, oil wildcatting, and other industries, but finds critical distinctions. Key differentiators identified include: the variability of drug products versus standardized commodities like oil; patent-based pricing models with sharp cliff-like drops after expiration; the "wasting asset" nature of patents counting down to value loss; and stringent regulatory oversight from agencies like the FDA that can kill products and companies—unlike industries such as semiconductor manufacturing which face no equivalent "Federal Chip Administration." The article concludes that pharma combines the uncertainty of exploration, product uniqueness, life-or-death safety requirements, and time-limited intellectual property protection in ways that defy easy comparison to other sectors.

## 2. HISTORY

The core challenges identified in this 2007 article have persisted and in some cases intensified over the subsequent 17 years. The pharmaceutical industry's regulatory burden remains stringent, with FDA approval processes continuing to gate drug commercialization. Notable developments include:

**Regulatory Evolution**: The FDA has maintained its rigorous approval standards, with drug approval rates remaining relatively stable. However, new pathways have emerged, including accelerated approval mechanisms, breakthrough therapy designations (established in 2012), and expanded use of real-world evidence. These have provided some flexibility while maintaining safety requirements.

**Patent Cliff Concerns Realized**: The "ticking clock" problem described in 2007 has played out dramatically. Between 2010-2015, major blockbuster drugs like Lipitor, Plavix, and Singulair lost patent protection, causing revenue drops of billions for their manufacturers. This validated the author's concern about "wasting assets."

**Exubera's Failure Confirmed**: The article's reference to Exubera proved prescient. Pfizer's inhaled insulin product, approved in 2006, was withdrawn in 2007 due to poor sales, costing the company approximately $2.8 billion. This exemplified the "find exactly what we're looking for and still lose our shirts" dynamic the author described.

**Continued R&D Productivity Challenges**: The fundamental economics haven't changed dramatically. R&D costs have continued rising, with estimates of over $2.5 billion per approved drug, maintaining the high-risk, high-cost dynamics the article identified.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations:

• **Patent cliffs would continue creating discontinuous value loss**: This proved accurate. The 2010-2015 period saw major revenue drops for companies like Pfizer (Lipitor losing $10+ billion annually), Bristol-Myers Squibb (Plavix), and others as patents expired.

• **Regulatory burden would remain uniquely burdensome for pharma vs. tech**: Confirmed. No equivalent to FDA approval emerged for technology products. The closest analogy in subsequent years might be GDPR for data privacy, but this doesn't approach the life-or-death stakes and multi-year approval cycles of drug regulation.

• **Product variability would continue complicating pharma vs. commodity industries**: Accurate. The biopharma landscape has become even more fragmented with personalized medicine, biologics, and gene therapies, making direct competition even more complex than the commodity oil market.

• **Competition dynamics would remain different from direct commodity markets**: Confirmed. Pharma competition involves not just efficacy but also formulary placement, payer negotiations, and physician preference—far more complex than commodity price competition.

• **Safety/regulatory failures could still destroy companies**: Validated. Multiple companies have faced existential threats from regulatory issues, though the specific examples weren't predictable in 2007.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates enduring insight into the structural characteristics that make pharmaceutical industry dynamics distinct and persistent. While not flashy, it identified fundamental constraints that have remained relevant for nearly two decades, making it more prescient than many contemporaneous analyses.
