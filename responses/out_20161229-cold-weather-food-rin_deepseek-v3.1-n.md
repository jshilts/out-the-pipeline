# Cold-Weather Food: Rindsrouladen (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is not about the biotechnology industry at all, but rather a German beef rouladen recipe post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog on Science.org. The author shares a traditional German dish called rindsrouladen (beef rolls), which his father used to make. The recipe involves thin-sliced beef (top round or similar cuts) spread with mustard, topped with chopped onions, bacon, and a pickle, then rolled up and secured with twine or toothpicks. The rolls are browned in a pan and then simmered for about an hour. The dish is finished with a gravy made from the cooking liquid thickened with flour, and traditionally served with potatoes and red cabbage.

## 2. HISTORY
This recipe post appeared in December 2016 and represents one of several cooking-related entries in Lowe's blog over the years. After publication, the post remained available as archived content on the Science.org website. No subsequent biotechnology developments, pharmaceutical approvals, regulatory changes, or scientific research outcomes stemmed from this article, as it was purely a cooking recipe unrelated to biotechnology or pharmaceutical topics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There were no predictions about the biotechnology industry or future scientific developments contained in this article, as it was exclusively a recipe post.
