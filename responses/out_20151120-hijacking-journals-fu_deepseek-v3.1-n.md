# Hijacking Journals for Fun and Profit. Mostly Profit. (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article describes a new and alarming form of academic fraud: criminals were hijacking legitimate scientific journal domains and either redirecting traffic to scam websites or using the stolen domains to collect publication fees and subscriptions. The author highlights a trend where low-life operators were:

- Taking advantage of poor website administration by scholarly publishers
- Registering expired domains and keeping the traffic that was coming in from indexes like Thomson Reuters' Web of Science
- Redirecting visitors to sites promoting baldness cures and payday loans

The article was prompted by John Bohannon's investigative report showing how these hijacked domains were being exploited for profit. It references Mehdi Dadkhah, an IT researcher who documented the problem after being scammed himself. The sheer scale of academic publishing – 2 million articles from 20,000 journals generating $10 billion annually – made these domains attractive targets. The piece notes that even the DOI system experienced a major outage earlier that year due to a domain registration issue.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following the article's publication:

- **Ongoing but evolving threat**: Between 2015 and 2018, hijacked journal domains and "clone journals" targeting Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe remained a significant problem.
- **Increased institutional action**: Major publishers like Elsevier and Springer Nature began implementing domain monitoring services and better security protocols.
- **Regulatory and policy evolution**: In many countries, domain registrars started offering additional security features. The practice of journal hijacking, however, largely evolved rather than disappeared.
- **Publishers' security improvements**: Many reputable journals implemented stricter cybersecurity measures, domain-locking services, and monitoring systems for publication fees.
- **Related trends**: The phenomenon of "predatory journals" became better documented in the late 2010s – though hijacked legitimate domains remained less common than fake journals created from scratch.
- **Current status**: As of 2024, many of the top-tier journals have good security, but smaller journals in developing countries remain vulnerable. The issue persists but has become more targeted rather than widespread.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1**: The article implied that this would become a growing problem given the $250 million gold open-access market that was "on course to double in a few years." 
- **Outcome**: Partially accurate. The open-access market did grow significantly (to over $1 billion by 2020), and fraud continued, though journal hijacking specifically did not become a dominant problem relative to the proliferation of completely fake predatory journals.

**Prediction 2**: Implicit prediction that domain watching and renewals would remain a vulnerability leading to "very bad indeed" consequences.
- **Outcome**: Accurate. Major incidents continued occurring sporadically, with notable cases of domain expirations affecting academic institutions through 2019-2022, though awareness and protective measures improved over time.

**Prediction 3**: Hinted that the problem might continue until publishers improved their website management and cybersecurity.
- **Outcome**: Accurate. Larger publishers did significantly improve their security by the late 2010s, though smaller journals continue to struggle with adequate protection even in 2024.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6**

This article highlighted an important cybersecurity vulnerability in academia that was just emerging in 2015. While the specific tactic of domain hijacking evolved rather than exploding, the piece correctly identified larger trends about academic publishing security weaknesses that remained relevant through the 2020s. The prediction about open-access growth creating more targets proved accurate, even if the exact method of exploitation shifted.
