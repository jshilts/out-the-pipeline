# Comment Trouble (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a brief technical service announcement from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog hosted on Science.org. The author reported that user comments had stopped appearing on blog posts around noon EST on January 23, 2012. Lowe indicated that technical troubleshooting was in progress to diagnose and resolve the issue, expressing hope that the comment functionality could be restored.

## 2. HISTORY
This article represents a routine technical maintenance announcement rather than a commentary on biotechnology. Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog has continued operating successfully since 2012, covering pharmaceutical research, drug discovery, and biotechnology topics. The blog remains active as of 2024, with Lowe continuing to write about pharmaceutical industry developments, clinical trials, and scientific research.

The comment system appears to have been successfully restored, as subsequent posts on the blog continued to accept and display user comments. No long-term impact on the blog's operations, readership, or influence resulted from this brief technical interruption.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The author expressed hope that "things can be rescued" regarding the comment functionality. This technical issue was indeed resolved, and comment functionality was restored to the blog. No other predictions about biotechnology science or policy were made in this brief service announcement.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **0/10**

This article is a technical service notice about blog commenting functionality, not a commentary about the biotechnology industry. It is completely off-topic relative to the stated purpose of analyzing biotechnology industry commentary and therefore receives a score of 0.
