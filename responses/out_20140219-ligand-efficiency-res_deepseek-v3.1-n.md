# Ligand Efficiency: A Response to Shultz (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 blog post responded to criticisms of ligand efficiency (LE) metrics in drug discovery raised by Shultz. The article defended LE calculations—particularly the formula ΔG/HA (binding energy per heavy atom)—against three main objections: (1) that metrics create problematic psychological effects on scientist thinking; (2) that dividing a logarithmic quantity (ΔG) by an integer (heavy atom count) is mathematically flawed; and (3) that successful drugs exist which violate LE guidelines. The author, referencing J&J researcher Chuck Reynolds, countered that LE is simply a ratio of potency per atom, the logarithmic nature of ΔG does not invalidate the calculation mathematically, and that the non-linear behavior of LE across different heavy atom counts was already well-documented in prior literature. The post emphasized that ligand efficiency metrics should be treated as helpful guideposts rather than rigid rules, and warned against using them as substitutes for scientific judgment.

## 2. HISTORY

Over the decade following this 2014 exchange, ligand efficiency metrics continued to be widely adopted across pharmaceutical and biotechnology drug discovery programs, becoming standard tools in medicinal chemistry workflows. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), which heavily relies on LE metrics to evaluate fragment hits, has successfully produced multiple FDA-approved drugs including venetoclax (Venclexta) approved in 2016 for leukemia and erdafitinib (Balversa) approved in 2019 for bladder cancer. Both drugs progressed through optimization programs where LE metrics guided fragment-to-lead expansion strategies.

The debate over LE's mathematical foundations largely subsided, with the scientific consensus accepting these metrics as empirically useful despite their limitations. Major pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca, Novartis, and Pfizer continued publishing research papers throughout 2015-2025 that utilized LE, lipophilic efficiency (LLE), and related metrics like binding efficiency index (BEI) and surface efficiency index (SEI) to guide compound optimization. Academic studies showed that optimizing for LE during lead development correlated with improved success rates in clinical trials, particularly for drugs targeting intracellular protein-protein interactions where cell penetration is challenging.

However, the limitations highlighted by Shultz also manifested over time. Large molecules targeting extracellular or membrane proteins continued to reach approval, with notable examples like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) Sanofi's Sarclisa (isatuximab) approved in 2020 and AstraZeneca's Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) approved in 2019, both with molecular weights well over 1000 Daltons. The biotech industry increasingly recognized that optimal LE ranges depend heavily on target class and therapeutic modality, leading to more nuanced applications of these metrics rather than universal cutoffs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not make specific forward-looking predictions about ligand efficiency metrics, but rather argued for their continued utility and proper application. Shultz's criticisms in the referenced paper likely predicted that over-reliance on LE would lead to missed opportunities and inappropriate rejection of potentially successful drugs. In retrospect:

- **The concern that LE would become too rigidly applied as "rules"** proved partially justified, as the pharmaceutical industry did develop internal LE thresholds and guidelines, though these became increasingly sophisticated and target-specific rather than universally restrictive.
- **The prediction that large molecules would continue to succeed** was validated by continued approvals of biologics, ADCs, and large small-molecule drugs, though these typically targeted extracellular proteins where cell permeability concerns were less relevant.
- **The mathematical objections largely faded from mainstream discourse**, with the community adopting LE metrics as pragmatic tools whose limitations were well-understood rather than fundamental flaws.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an important moment in the evolution of medicinal chemistry practice, addressing fundamental questions about how to optimize molecular properties during drug discovery. While focused on a specific methodological debate, it touches on broader themes of metric-driven decision-making and the tension between simple heuristics and complex reality in pharmaceutical research. The issues discussed remain highly relevant to contemporary drug discovery, though the specific mathematical disputes have largely settled into professional consensus.
