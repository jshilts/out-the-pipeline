# Things I Won't Work With: Ozonides (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the chemistry of ozonides—highly energetic five-membered ring compounds formed when ozone attacks carbon-carbon double bonds. The author expresses personal reluctance to work with ozonides due to their explosive nature, particularly those with multiple consecutive oxygen atoms. The process of ozonolysis, while useful for cleaving double bonds into two carbonyl compounds, is described as increasingly rare in modern chemical practice, with ozone generators gathering dust in many chemistry departments. Despite the hazards, some researchers like Prof. Pat Dussault have built careers studying oxygen-oxygen bonds and ozonide chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2004, ozonolysis did not disappear but evolved in several key directions:

**Continued Use in Synthesis and Industry**: Ozonolysis remains a valuable tool in both laboratory synthesis and industrial processes, particularly for the production of fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals where clean double-bond cleavage is required. However, its use is more selective and safety-focused than in previous decades. Many laboratories continue to maintain ozonolysis capabilities, contrary to the article's suggestion of obsolescence.

**Safety Improvements and Alternative Methods**: The hazardous nature of ozonides led to continued development of safer ozonolysis protocols and alternative methods. Flow chemistry approaches, continuous processing, and improved analytical techniques have made ozonolysis safer and more reliable when properly implemented.

**Ozone Applications Beyond Chemistry**: Ozone found expanding applications in water treatment, air purification, and more recently in medical applications (ozone therapy), though the medical uses remain controversial and are not FDA-approved for most indications.

**Prof. Dussault's Continued Research**: Pat Dussault continued his research career at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, maintaining his focus on reactive oxygen species and synthetic methodologies involving peroxides and ozonides, contributing to the understanding of these challenging but important compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Ozonolysis passing into chemical history"**: **Partially incorrect.** While ozonolysis usage has become more specialized and safety-conscious, the technique has not disappeared. It remains an important tool for specific synthetic applications, particularly in natural product synthesis and industrial chemistry where its advantages outweigh the hazards.

• **"Chemistry departments mostly have gathering dust ozone gizmos"**: **Mixed accuracy.** While some departments did reduce ozonolysis training, many maintained the capability, recognizing its unique synthetic value. The trend was more toward modernization than abandonment—safer equipment, better monitoring, and more targeted instruction.

• **"Couldn't pay me to isolate intermediate ozonides"**: **Largely holds true.** Isolation and handling of concentrated ozonides indeed remains rare and hazardous. The field has moved toward in situ generation and immediate workup rather than isolation of these explosive intermediates.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article provides an engaging personal perspective on ozonolysis chemistry and captures a moment of transition in synthetic practice post-2004. While it did not predict the field's evolution perfectly, it accurately identified genuine safety concerns that drove subsequent methodological improvements and more selective application of ozonolysis.
