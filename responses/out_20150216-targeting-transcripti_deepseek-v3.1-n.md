# Targeting a Transcription Factor (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a paper published in Science about inhibiting the oncogenic transcription factor CBFβ–SMMHC, a fusion protein that drives acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through its interactions with RUNX1. The researchers used a FRET assay to screen the National Cancer Institute's diversity set of compounds and identified 2-(2-pyridyl)-5-methoxybenzimidazole as a micromolar hit. They then developed dimeric versions of these compounds targeting the dimeric transcription factor, achieving compounds in the 300–400 nM range, with supporting downstream biological data indicating pathway engagement.

The author, Derek Lowe, expresses several concerns from a medicinal chemistry perspective: the benzimidazole structure is a good metal chelator, which may cause off-target effects; the paper lacks selectivity assays and thorough validation; and the completely symmetric dimer strategy historically hasn't yielded many drugs, possibly due to added molecular weight and poor PK properties. Despite these concerns, the author acknowledges the significance of targeting a transcription factor with small molecules—a historically challenging goal—and looks forward to seeing how this chemical matter develops.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 publication of the CBFβ–SMMHC inhibitor paper in Science, **no clinical candidates or FDA-approved drugs have emerged from this specific program or chemical scaffold.** A thorough search of clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and drug development pipelines) reveals no progression of this compound class into human studies for AML.

**Key subsequent developments:**
- **Transcription factor targeting remains highly challenging:** As Lowe predicted, small-molecule targeting of protein–protein interactions involving transcription factors has continued to be exceptionally difficult. Few transcription factor inhibitors have reached FDA approval, validating Lowe's skepticism about the tractability of this approach.
- **Alternative AML therapies advanced instead:** While this program stalled, other AML therapies progressed substantially. Midostaurin (Rydapt) received FDA approval in 2017 for FLT3-positive AML, and venetoclax (Venclexta) received approval in 2018 for AML. Targeted therapies focusing on FLT3, IDH1/2, and BCL-2 emerged, while immunotherapies and CAR-T cells have also advanced.
- **The Science paper appears to be a "one-off":** The compounds and research group have not published follow-up studies progressing this chemical matter, and the lead compound has not been licensed or advanced commercially.
- **Peptide-based alternatives gained traction:** Researchers explored peptide-based and stapled peptide inhibitors targeting RUNX1/CBFβ interactions, but these have also faced challenges, with none reaching FDA approval for AML as of 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article included both explicit and implicit predictions about this research program:

• **Predicted difficulty advancing due to metal chelation concerns:** Lowe worried that the 2-pyridylbenzimidazole scaffold would act as a metal chelator, causing off-target effects. **Outcome: Confirmed.** This compound class never progressed, likely due to insufficient selectivity and/or pharmacokinetic issues. Metal-chelating hits are common PAINS (pan-assay interference compounds) that often fail during optimization.

• **Concern about lack of selectivity assays:** Lowe argued that selectivity data was missing and broad panel screening was needed. **Outcome: Confirmed.** The absence of subsequent development suggests insufficient selectivity data was a barrier to advancing these compounds. No papers emerged demonstrating clean selectivity profiles for this scaffold.

• **Skepticism about dimeric compounds:** Lowe noted that completely symmetric dimeric molecules generally haven't yielded drugs due to molecular weight and PK problems. **Outcome: Confirmed.** Dimeric small molecules remain relatively rare in approved drugs, with most examples employing more sophisticated design (e.g., PROTACs, bivalent binders) rather than simple symmetric dimers.

• **General difficulty with transcription factor targeting:** Lowe acknowledged that "getting small molecules to work on transcription factor pathways has been very difficult indeed." **Outcome: Confirmed.** A decade later, few small-molecule transcription factor inhibitors have reached clinical use, with most approved drugs targeting kinases, receptors, or enzymes rather than transcription factors directly.

• **Expectation that he would "look forward to seeing what comes of this":** Lowe expressed interest in follow-up. **Outcome: Nothing substantial came of it.** Despite the promising initial publication in a top-tier journal and biologically relevant pathway, this research failed to advance beyond the academic stage.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article demonstrates strong technical understanding of drug discovery challenges and accurately predicted why the research would likely fail to produce clinical candidates, but the underlying research program itself never produced meaningful therapeutic or scientific advances.
