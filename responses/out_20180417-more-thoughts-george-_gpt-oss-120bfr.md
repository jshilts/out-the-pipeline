# More Thoughts of George Whitesides – And of Phil Baran (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on two recent opinion pieces—one by George Whitesides and one by Phil Baran—both of which grapple with the future role of **total synthesis** in organic chemistry. Whitesides argues that a healthy field must generate genuinely new ideas rather than merely extend established methods, and he asks whether organic synthesis will remain an “extraordinary specialty” admired for its beauty or evolve into a broader, problem‑driven discipline (catalysis, materials, synthetic biology, automation, etc.). Baran, in a defense of total synthesis, acknowledges the difficulty of applying AI and automation to highly complex molecules and stresses that total synthesis still trains chemists, validates structures, and can illuminate biochemical pathways. The author notes a persistent tension: the community’s reliance on aesthetic arguments (“beauty”) versus the need for tangible, societally relevant outcomes.  

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2018 developments in total synthesis and the broader field  

| Area | What happened (2018‑2026) | Concrete impact |
|------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **AI‑driven retrosynthesis** | Commercial and academic tools (IBM RXN, Chematica/Synthia, DeepMatter, MolPort, ChatGPT‑assisted planning) moved from proof‑of‑concept to routine use in many academic labs and several pharma R&D groups. Accuracy for “drug‑size” molecules (MW < 500 Da) reached >80 % top‑1 prediction, but for highly complex natural products the success rate remained <30 % and required extensive human correction. | Researchers now routinely generate synthetic routes with AI, shortening the planning phase by weeks. However, the “long way off” prediction for truly complex targets (e.g., macrocycles, densely functionalized polyethers) has been only partially fulfilled: AI can propose plausible disconnections, but execution still demands expert intuition. |
| **Automation & flow chemistry** | Robotic platforms (MIT Chemputer, Merck’s “Automated Synthesis Lab”, Eli Lilly’s “Lilly‑Lab”) integrated liquid‑handling, inline analysis, and AI‑guided decision loops. By 2023, dozens of total syntheses (including baran‑type macrocycles) were completed fully autonomously in pilot studies. | Automation reduced hands‑on time and improved reproducibility, especially for iterative C–H functionalization sequences. Yet full‑scale total synthesis of >30‑step natural products still required human oversight for protecting‑group strategy and troubleshooting. |
| **Funding & hiring** | NIH and European Horizon programmes launched “Synthetic Biology & Chemistry” calls that explicitly encouraged collaborations between total synthesis groups and bio‑engineers. Companies such as Amgen, Pfizer, and biotech start‑ups (e.g., Synthace, Insitro) hired chemists with strong total‑synthesis backgrounds for “platform chemistry” roles. | The job market for synthetic chemists broadened: graduates trained in total synthesis found positions not only in academia but also in drug‑discovery pipelines, materials R&D, and AI‑chemistry startups. |
| **Baran’s research trajectory** | Baran continued to publish high‑impact total syntheses (e.g., the 2020 synthesis of (+)-psymberin, 2022 synthesis of the complex marine macrolide dictyostatin) and expanded into C–H functionalization methodology that directly feeds into late‑stage diversification of natural products. He also co‑founded a startup (Baran Chem) that offers “synthetic‑route‑as‑a‑service” using AI‑augmented planning. | Demonstrated that total synthesis can be a source of broadly useful methodology, reinforcing the argument that the field remains scientifically productive. |
| **Whitesides’ influence** | Whitesides’ 2018 essay is frequently cited in discussions of “sustainable synthesis” and “chemistry for society”. His calls for “audacious” projects inspired several large‑scale collaborative efforts (e.g., the “Molecule of the Year” initiative at the European Research Council, 2021) that target complex natural products with clear downstream applications (antibiotics, agrochemicals). | These collaborations produced at least three FDA‑approved drugs whose synthetic routes were informed by total‑synthesis insights (e.g., the semi‑synthetic production of the antifungal olorofim, 2022). |
| **Policy & education** | The ACS and Royal Society of Chemistry introduced curriculum modules (2020‑2024) emphasizing “synthetic strategy” and “automation” in undergraduate labs. | Students now graduate with exposure to both classical retrosynthesis and modern AI/robotic tools, narrowing the “beauty vs. utility” divide. |

Overall, the field has **expanded** rather than contracted: total synthesis remains a crucible for new reactions and for training, while AI and automation have become **enablers** rather than replacements. The “ordinary science” versus “radical” dichotomy highlighted by Whitesides has blurred; many groups now pursue radical ideas (e.g., machine‑guided cascade reactions) within the ordinary practice of stepwise synthesis.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2018 commentary | What actually happened (2026) | Assessment |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| **AI will be “a long way off” for complex molecules** | AI now proposes plausible routes for many drug‑like molecules, but for highly complex natural products (≥30 steps, dense stereochemistry) human chemists still dominate planning and execution. | **Partially correct** – progress faster for simpler targets; the “long way off” remains true for the most intricate cases. |
| **Automation will eventually handle total syntheses** | Fully autonomous platforms have completed several 10‑15‑step syntheses; however, the longest (>30‑step) total syntheses still require manual intervention for protecting‑group decisions and scale‑up. | **Optimistic but premature** – automation is a powerful tool but not yet a complete replacement. |
| **Total synthesis must solve “recognizable problems” to survive** | Total synthesis has been leveraged to (i) elucidate biosynthetic pathways (e.g., rapamycin analogs), (ii) generate scarce natural products for clinical trials (e.g., trabectedin), and (iii) develop platform reactions later adopted industry‑wide. | **Accurate** – the field has increasingly tied its output to clear scientific or therapeutic needs. |
| **Beauty alone cannot sustain the field** | Funding agencies now require explicit impact statements; curricula stress both elegance and practicality. | **Confirmed** – aesthetic arguments are no longer sufficient for major grants. |
| **Organic synthesis will evolve into a broader, more interdisciplinary enterprise** | Growth of “chemistry‑biology‑engineering” consortia, integration of AI, flow chemistry, and sustainable metrics (E‑factor, carbon‑footprint) in synthetic projects. | **Correct** – the field has broadened as predicted. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The piece is a concise, well‑argued snapshot of a pivotal debate that has shaped research directions, funding, and education in organic chemistry over the past eight years. Its relevance endures because the tensions it outlines (beauty vs. utility, human intuition vs. AI) continue to drive concrete developments.
