# Things People Won't Listen To? (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post by Derek Lowe serves as a brief announcement for a podcast interview he participated in with "Science For the People" (formerly "Skeptically Speaking"). The interview focused on Lowe's popular "Things I Won't Work With" series, which humorously discusses extremely dangerous, toxic, or reactive chemical compounds that chemists avoid. The podcast also featured other science communicators including Scicurious and ZeFrank, with Lowe's segment beginning around the 38-minute mark. The post provides links to both the podcast episode and the other contributors' work, serving primarily as promotional content for the radio show rather than a substantive article about biotechnology industry developments.

## 2. HISTORY
The "Things I Won't Work With" series by Derek Lowe, featured in this podcast interview, continued to grow in popularity after 2013 and became one of the most recognized chemistry blog series in the scientific community. Lowe maintained his "In the Pipeline" blog at Science Translational Medicine (and later at his own hosted site) and continued writing these humorous yet educational posts about dangerous chemicals through the present day. The series has been widely cited in chemistry education and safety discussions, and Lowe's accessible writing style helped popularize chemistry safety awareness beyond academic circles. The podcast "Science For the People" continued operating and has produced hundreds of episodes since this 2013 appearance, though the hosts and format have evolved. Derek Lowe himself continued his long-running career as a pharmaceutical industry researcher and science writer, maintaining one of the most influential blogs in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This post did not contain predictions about future biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry developments. It was promotional content for a podcast appearance.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

This post ranks in the 20-29th percentile for interest. While Derek Lowe's work is generally highly regarded in medicinal chemistry circles, this particular post was simply a brief podcast announcement with minimal original content, serving primarily as promotional material rather than substantive scientific analysis or commentary.
