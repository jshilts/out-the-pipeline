# Kinase Inhibitors: Doomed From the Start?
## 12 February 2006

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2006 commentary discusses a controversial paper by Gilbert Rishton titled "Failure and Success in Modern Drug Discovery." The article focuses on Rishton's critique that drug discovery efforts were "seriously overweighted in kinase inhibitors," with the contention that such compounds would likely prove "intrinsically toxic via general signal transduction inhibition in non-target organs."

The author expresses partial agreement, suggesting the real problem may be insufficient understanding of biochemical pathway details rather than inherent toxicity. When researchers target key kinases, compensatory mechanisms often render inhibition ineffective, and the lack of selective compounds makes it difficult to determine which kinase inhibition causes specific in vivo effects. The commentary reflects the uncertainty and debate within the pharmaceutical industry about kinase inhibitor drug discovery strategies in the mid-2000s.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent two decades demonstrated that kinase inhibitors became one of the most successful classes of targeted cancer therapeutics, directly contradicting the pessimistic predictions in the 2006 article.

**Clinical Success**: Multiple kinase inhibitors achieved FDA approval and became standard-of-care treatments. Imatinib (Gleevec), approved in 2001 for chronic myeloid leukemia, showed durable efficacy with manageable toxicity, establishing proof-of-concept. Subsequent approvals included erlotinib and gefitinib (EGFR inhibitors for lung cancer), trastuzumab (HER2 inhibitor for breast cancer), and numerous others targeting various kinases including BRAF, ALK, JAK, BTK, and CDK4/6.

**Market Impact**: By the 2010s, kinase inhibitors represented a multi-billion dollar market segment with widespread patient uptake. Imatinib became a blockbuster drug, and numerous kinase inhibitors joined formularies worldwide with substantial patient populations.

**Scientific Validation**: Research revealed that selectivity was achievable through structural optimization, and toxicity profiles proved manageable for many targets. The feared "general signal transduction inhibition in non-target organs" did not universally prevent therapeutic utility, though it required careful target selection and dosing.

**Pipeline Growth**: Rather than abandoning kinase inhibitors, pharmaceutical companies expanded their kinase inhibitor pipelines, with hundreds entering clinical trials targeting various cancers and inflammatory diseases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: Kinase inhibitors would be "intrinsically toxic via general signal transduction inhibition in non-target organs"
- **Reality**: While some kinase inhibitors do have toxicity profiles, many proved clinically viable with manageable side effects. Toxicity was target- and compound-dependent rather than universal.

**Prediction**: Drug discovery efforts were "seriously overweighted in kinase inhibitors" (implying this focus was misplaced)
- **Reality**: The kinase inhibitor focus proved highly successful, yielding dozens of approved drugs that revolutionized cancer treatment paradigms. The investment was justified by clinical outcomes.

**Implicit Prediction**: Insufficient pathway understanding would prevent effective kinase inhibition due to compensatory mechanisms
- **Reality**: While pathway complexity remains challenging, selective inhibition of key driver kinases proved therapeutically effective for many cancers where those kinases were central oncogenic drivers, such as BCR-ABL in CML and EGFR mutations in lung cancer.

**Author's Uncertainty**: The author wasn't sure about the toxicity argument but worried about pathway complexity
- **Reality**: Pathway complexity proved surmountable when targeting genuine driver mutations, marking one of the most successful eras in targeted cancer therapy.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment when kinase inhibitor skepticism was common, making it historically significant as a contrast to one of oncology's most successful therapeutic classes. It demonstrates how expert opinion can diverge dramatically from future reality in drug development.
