# Maybe It Really Is That Hard? (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Wall Street Journal blog post (re‑posted by Derek Lowe) reports that Elias Zerhouni – former NIH director who championed “translational research” (moving basic‑science discoveries straight to the clinic) – now heads R&D at Sanofi‑Aventis and admits that the bench‑to‑bedside pipeline is far tougher than he imagined.  Zerhouni is pushing an “open‑innovation” model: Sanofi will look for ideas both inside and outside the company, and will start by “understanding a disease” before hunting for tools to treat it, rather than the reverse.  The commentary notes that this disease‑first stance echoes what other big pharma (e.g., Novartis) have been saying, and questions whether such a strategy can ever overcome the historically low success rates of drug development.  The author also hints at the broader debate about R&D costs, citing critics such as Marcia Angell and Donald Light, and wonders how Zerhouni’s view aligns with Francis Collins’s plan for a new NIH translational institute.

## 2. HISTORY  

### NIH & Translational Infrastructure  
* **NCATS launch (2011).**  In February 2011 Francis Collins announced the creation of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).  Since then NCATS has funded > 2,000 translational projects, created the **Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP)** (2014) with multiple pharma partners, and built resources such as the **Drug Repurposing Hub** and **Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) network**.  These programs have modestly increased the number of early‑phase candidates entering the clinic but have not dramatically lifted overall approval rates.  

### Sanofi’s Open‑Innovation & Disease‑First Strategy  
* **Open Innovation Platform (2011‑2013).**  Sanofi rolled out an external‑collaboration portal, partnered with academic centers, and created **Sanofi Ventures** (2011) to invest in biotech start‑ups.  The “disease‑first” organization was formalised in a 2012 R&D restructuring that grouped projects by therapeutic area (e.g., diabetes, oncology, immunology).  
* **Pipeline outcomes.**  The disease‑first approach coincided with several notable approvals:  
  * **Dupilumab (Dupixent)** – co‑developed with Regeneron, approved 2017 for atopic dermatitis and later for asthma.  
  * **Sarilumab (Kevzara)** – approved 2017 for rheumatoid arthritis.  
  * **Lixisenatide (Adlyxin)** – approved 2016 for type‑2 diabetes (originally from Zealand).  
  * **Aducanumab** – not a Sanofi product; illustrates that disease‑first, target‑centric approaches still face high failure risk.  
* **Commercial performance.**  While these drugs added to Sanofi’s revenue, the company’s overall R&D productivity remained average for the industry (≈ 10 % success from Phase I to approval).  Sanofi’s open‑innovation model has become a standard practice across pharma, but the bulk of new molecular entities still arise from internal chemistry programs.  

### Broader Industry Trends  
* **Open innovation diffusion.**  By the mid‑2010s, most large pharma had formal external‑collaboration units (e.g., Pfizer’s “Centaur” platform, Roche’s “Open Innovation”).  Crowdsourced challenges, pre‑competitive consortia, and venture‑funding arms are now routine.  
* **Translational success rates.**  Analyses published in 2018‑2022 (e.g., by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development) show a slight rise in Phase II‑to‑Approval success (≈ 30 % in 2020 vs. ≈ 25 % in 2010) but the overall “bench‑to‑bedside” conversion remains low (~ 10 %).  The difficulty Zerhouni highlighted persists.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the 2011 article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Translational research is harder than expected.** | Confirmed.  Even with NCATS, AMP, and massive public‑private investment, the attrition curve for drug candidates has improved only modestly. |
| **Open‑innovation will become a key R&D model for Sanofi.** | Largely true.  Sanofi built an external‑collaboration portal, a venture arm, and disease‑focused teams; the model is now commonplace industry‑wide. |
| **Starting with disease understanding rather than tool‑first will speed progress.** | Partially true.  Disease‑focused organization helped Sanofi bring several biologics (Dupilumab, Sarilumab) to market, but many projects still stall in early discovery; the “slow‑to‑understand” diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s) remain largely unsolved. |
| **Sanofi’s R&D productivity will markedly improve.** | Not realized to the extent implied.  Sanofi’s approval rate stayed near the industry average; revenue growth was modest and the company later cut R&D headcount in 2020‑2022. |
| **Critics like Angell/Light will dominate the conversation on R&D costs.** | Their arguments about high “drug‑development cost” have been tempered by newer analyses showing lower cash‑flow‑adjusted costs, but the debate continues. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment when a leading NIH figure publicly questioned the feasibility of translational research and introduced open‑innovation thinking, topics that have shaped pharma strategy for the subsequent decade.  Its relevance endures, though the article itself is brief and lacks detailed data.
