# Short Items: Viral NMR, Alarming Rings, Cheap Reading, Etc. (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a collection of brief scientific curiosities from January 2009. The main highlight is an NMR-based imaging breakthrough from IBM researchers published in PNAS that achieved virus-scale imaging resolution—a 100-million-fold improvement in volume resolution over conventional NMR, opening possibilities like single-cell MRI. The author also mentions a dangerous six-membered ring compound (two carbons, four oxygens) from Pat Dussault's lab, an "off-road" version of James Tour's molecular nanocar, and a humorous note about a specialty book on silicon isotope magnetic resonance priced at $8,539 with amusing Amazon reviews.

## 2. HISTORY

**NMR Virus Imaging:** The IBM PNAS work (2009) demonstrated detection of individual virus particles using magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM), achieving ~$4 \text{ nm}$ magnetic resonance imaging resolution. While scientifically significant, this did not translate into widespread clinical adoption or mainstream MRI improvements. Clinical MRI resolution remained limited to millimeter-to-micrometer scales. The technique required specialized equipment and extreme conditions. No major diagnostic platforms or FDA-approved medical devices emerged from this specific approach by the mid-2010s onward. Research continued in specialized labs but did not revolutionize routine medical imaging.

**Cyclic Peroxides/Hazardous Materials:** Dussault's lab and others continued research on reactive oxygen-containing rings and peroxides. Such compounds remained specialized research tools rather than finding therapeutic applications, due to their instability and reactivity. Safety practices in handling reactive compounds evolved, but no major policy changes occurred specifically around these compounds. The "Things I Won't Work With" theme became a popular blog series highlighting dangerous chemicals, reflecting ongoing awareness of laboratory safety.

**Molecular Nanocars:** James Tour's nanocar research evolved into broader molecular machine research. By 2016, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for molecular machines (Sauvage, Stoddart, Feringa), validating the field's significance. However, practical applications remained limited through the 2010s. No commercial molecular nanotechnology products emerged from Tour's nanocars specifically, though research continued in molecular electronics and nanoscale devices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Single-cell MRI prediction:** The author predicted "look for all kinds of variations on it" including single-cell MRI based on the 100-million-fold NMR resolution improvement.
  - **Outcome:** This did not materialize in clinical practice. While research MRI has achieved cellular resolution in specialized contexts, routine clinical MRI remained orders of magnitude away from single-cell resolution. No widespread single-cell MRI diagnostic platforms emerged from this specific IBM technique.

• **NMR technique variations:** Predicted "all kinds of variations on it over the next few years, as is the way of NMR techniques."
  - **Outcome:** The specific MRFM technique for virus imaging did not spawn major commercial variations. NMR continued evolving in other directions (hyperpolarization, portable NMR, metabolomics), but not primarily through virus-scale imaging breakthroughs.

• **General advancement of extreme NMR capabilities:**
  - **Outcome:** While NMR spectroscopy continued advancing, the revolutionary leap in volume resolution reported did not translate into routine practice. The technique remained specialized rather than broadly adopted.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The NMR breakthrough initially seemed revolutionary but had limited real-world impact. The collection's scientific curiosity value remains moderate, with one Nobel-relevant area (molecular machines) but mostly specialized research with practical limitations. The article captures the enthusiasm for technical novelty that doesn't always translate to practical advances.
