# Eat It, Breath It, Soak in It? (January 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the failure of Pfizer’s Exubera inhaled-insulin product and the subsequent withdrawal of Novo Nordisk/Aradigm from inhaled insulin development. It highlights the broader challenges of finding alternative drug delivery routes, contrasting the potential of pulmonary delivery with its risks.

The author explains why inhaled delivery seemed promising: the lungs offer a large surface area for absorption and bypass first-pass liver metabolism. However, significant downsides include safety concerns about chronic lung damage, variable patient lung function, and the narrow therapeutic window for insulin. The author also notes limitations of transdermal patches for rapid or high-dose delivery, concluding that most alternative routes involve injections, which patients tolerate only when necessary.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article’s publication, the inhaled insulin space saw continued failures and eventual abandonment:
- **MannKind’s Afrezza**: Received FDA approval in June 2014 (after earlier rejections and a Complete Response Letter in 2010), but achieved only limited commercial uptake. Adherence remained low due to device/burden issues, dosing variability, and concerns about pulmonary safety requiring baseline and periodic lung-function testing.
- **Eli Lilly/Alkermes**: Their AIR Insulin program was terminated in March 2008, shortly after this article was published.
- **Novo Nordisk/Aradigm**: Ended their inhaled insulin collaboration as the article describes, and pivoted toward other inhaled proteins, though broad adoption did not materialize for those programs either.
- **Exubera (Pfizer)**: Officially withdrawn in October 2007; post-market experience confirmed weak sales, device usability issues, and lingering pulmonary safety concerns, validating the article’s framing.
- **General pulmonary outcomes**: The drug class did not meaningfully displace subcutaneous insulin or improve adherence at scale. Long-term safety monitoring requirements and patient/physician hesitation limited adoption even after approval.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article’s core expectations and implicit predictions proved broadly accurate:
- **Prandial inhaled insulin would not succeed commercially**: Correct. Exubera’s withdrawal was followed by Lilly/Alkermes termination (2008), and while Afrezza ultimately gained FDA approval (2014), it did not achieve significant market penetration. The broader inhaled-insulin category failed to meaningfully displace injections.
- **Lung-delivered peptide drugs would face chronic safety concerns and high variability**: Largely correct. Afrezza’s label includes a boxed warning about acute bronchospasm in patients with asthma/COPD and requires spirometry before starting and periodically during therapy; dosing variability across patients and pulmonary function states persisted as practical issues.
- **Alternative routes (e.g., transdermal) remain constrained for rapid/high-dose delivery**: This has remained true. No epinephrine patch exists for anaphylaxis (EpiPen and autoinjectors dominate), and transdermal delivery is still mostly limited to low-dose, lipophilic molecules with slow-release profiles.
- **Novo’s pivot to inhaled GLP-1 or basal insulin would face difficulty**: Though not explicitly called a failure here, subsequent development and uptake for these alternatives did not scale. Inhaled GLP-1 did not displace injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, dulaglutide), and the field’s focus stayed on subcutaneous/oral routes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This was a sharp, well-reasoned commentary that correctly anticipated systemic hurdles for inhaled peptides and alternative delivery routes, and it captured the post-Exubera reckoning. Its insights into absorption/barrier physiology and real-world variability remain durable.
