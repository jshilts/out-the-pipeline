# Too Big to Be True (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the concept of effect size through the lens of a widely-cited 2011 PNAS study about "hungry judges"—purportedly showing that judges hand down harsher sentences before lunch due to hunger and mental depletion. The author argues that the reported effect size is implausibly large for a psychological phenomenon. If such a dramatic effect truly existed, society would have already organized around it (avoiding surgeries, teaching, or driving before lunch), and we wouldn't need scientific studies to discover it. The article suggests alternative explanations like courtroom scheduling patterns and warns researchers to be skeptical of surprising results with enormous apparent effects, emphasizing that both positive and negative startling findings need rigorous interrogation in biomedical research.

## 2. HISTORY
The "hungry judges" study has been thoroughly scrutinized and largely debunked since 2017:

**Replication and Criticism**: The original 2011 PNAS study faced significant methodological criticism. Reanalysis revealed that the effect was likely driven by case scheduling patterns rather than judge hunger—routine cases (plea bargains, mandatory minimums) clustered before lunch while complex cases were scheduled earlier.

**Continued Propagation**: Despite these critiques, the "hungry judges" story continued circulating in popular media and academic citations as an intriguing psychological finding, though with diminishing credibility in scientific circles.

**Statistical Awareness**: The controversy contributed to broader discussions about effect size interpretation and replication crises in psychology, influencing how researchers report and evaluate statistical significance versus practical significance.

**Broader Impact**: This case became part of the larger reproducibility movement in social sciences, leading to improved statistical practices, pre-registration of studies, and more cautious interpretation of surprising psychological findings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction that society doesn't organize around lunchtime effects**: **Confirmed**. No evidence of widespread behavioral changes (surgery schedules, teaching times, driving restrictions) based on pre-lunch mental depletion concerns.
- **Prediction that courtroom scheduling explains findings**: **Confirmed**. Multiple reanalyses supported that case complexity and scheduling patterns, not judge hunger, drive the apparent effect.
- **Prediction that astonishing findings need extra scrutiny**: **Confirmed**. The hungry judges case became a textbook example of why surprising results require rigorous verification before acceptance.
- **Prediction that the study would continue being cited despite problems**: **Partially confirmed**. While still occasionally referenced, the study is now more commonly cited as a cautionary tale about methodological issues and replication failures rather than as solid evidence for the hunger-sentencing link.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important methodological issue using an engaging case study, but focuses on a somewhat niche topic in statistical methodology rather than transformative scientific discovery or clinical/biomedical advancement with direct patient impact.
