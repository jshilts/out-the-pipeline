# That's Just Too Colorful (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary article by Derek Lowe describes his experience synthesizing an "eyewateringly fluorescent orange compound" that defied his medicinal chemistry instincts. The compound was exceptionally colorful—comparing it to nasturtiums—which triggered his professional bias that such brightly colored molecules cannot be biologically useful. Despite his skepticism, the compound proved to be clean and was intended as a probe or tool compound. The article captures the tension between ingrained chemical intuition (that highly colored compounds are problematic) and the reality that this particular molecule behaved appropriately for its intended use.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a personal anecdotal piece from Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog rather than a substantive industry analysis. Derek Lowe is a respected medicinal chemist and pharmaceutical industry commentator who has written extensively about drug discovery challenges.

The article itself doesn't discuss broader biotechnology developments, specific companies, or therapeutic areas that could be tracked for subsequent impact. It's a reflective piece about chemical intuition rather than a forward-looking industry commentary. No specific drugs, methods, or policy initiatives are mentioned that would allow for concrete historical follow-up.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no explicit predictions about future biotechnology developments, drug approvals, or industry trends. It's a personal reflection on chemical synthesis and the occasional disconnect between chemical intuition and experimental reality.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While entertaining for chemists, this article lacks the substantive industry analysis, forward-looking insights, or concrete developments that would make it valuable for retrospective analysis of biotechnology trends and predictions.
