# Daiichi Sankyo Will Pay You A Million Dollars (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2014 blog post highlighted Daiichi Sankyo's crowdsourcing initiative through NineSigma, offering up to $1 million for anti-obesity drug discovery ideas. The company sought novel drug candidates or targets with superior efficacy or better safety profiles than existing drugs (phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, orlistat). The author expressed skepticism about the financial incentive, noting that $1 million was insufficient for genuine therapeutic compounds, suggesting any valuable obesity treatment would be worth far more. The post raised questions about whether this incentive structure would attract meaningful submissions.

## 2. HISTORY
The timing of this crowdsourcing effort coincided with significant challenges in obesity drug development. Several developments emerged in subsequent years:

**Market Failures and Challenges:**
- Belviq (lorcaserin), one of the referenced comparators, showed disappointing real-world weight loss (3-4% over placebo) and was voluntarily withdrawn in 2020 due to cancer concerns
- Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate) achieved only modest market penetration despite approval, with safety concerns limiting adoption
- The obesity drug market remained challenging, with safety issues, reimbursement hurdles, and patient adherence problems

**GLP-1 Revolution:**
- Beginning around 2017-2018, semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) demonstrated unprecedented 15-20% weight loss
- Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) later achieved even greater efficacy
- These GLP-1 agonists fundamentally transformed obesity treatment, making the 2014-era comparator drugs obsolete

**Daiichi Sankyo's Position:**
- The company did not emerge as a major player in obesity therapeutics
- No breakthrough obesity drug from Daiichi Sankyo entered mainstream use
- The crowdsourcing approach does not appear to have yielded notable commercial success in this therapeutic area

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction (implied):** That $1 million was insufficient incentive - **ACCURATE**. This proved correct, as genuinely valuable obesity drug candidates would command significantly higher valuation
- **Prediction (implied):** That existing comparator drugs were underwhelming benchmarks - **ACCURATE**. Within several years, these drugs proved commercially disappointing and were overshadowed by GLP-1 therapies
- **Prediction (implied):** That crowdsourcing was unlikely to yield breakthrough innovation - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**. While the specific initiative appears not to have succeeded, crowdsourcing and open innovation have produced notable successes elsewhere in drug discovery

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 4/9**

The article captured an interesting moment in pharmaceutical innovation strategy, but the subsequent GLP-1 revolution made these discussions largely historical rather than forward-looking.
