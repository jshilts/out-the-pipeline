# Type 2 Diabetes May Be a Protein Misfolding Disease (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a study showing that type 2 diabetes might involve prion-like mechanisms through the misfolding of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Researchers found that injecting pancreatic homogenate containing IAPP aggregates or synthetic IAPP into transgenic mice expressing human IAPP caused rapid protein deposition and diabetes-like symptoms, including elevated glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and beta-cell changes. This challenged the conventional view that amyloid formation was merely a byproduct of diabetes rather than a potential cause.

The author acknowledges the widely accepted role of insulin resistance but suggests a two-stage process: insulin resistance triggers insulin overproduction, which increases IAPP synthesis, allowing aggregation to amplify damage. While expressing skepticism about person-to-person transmission as a major driver of diabetes epidemiology (given clear obesity trends), the author considers the findings significant for understanding how pathology might spread within an individual and calls for further investigation.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2017 study described was published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine by researchers showing that IAPP aggregates could induce misfolding in vivo, suggesting potential prion-like spread within pancreatic tissue.

**Scientific developments since 2017:**
- Multiple subsequent studies confirmed and extended these findings, demonstrating that synthetic IAPP fibrils can seed aggregation in cultured cells and animal models
- Research in the 2010s-2020s explored whether IAPP aggregation contributes to beta-cell dysfunction and death in type 2 diabetes
- Clinical studies examined correlations between IAPP deposition patterns and diabetes progression

**Current status and limitations:**
- IAPP aggregation is recognized as a common pathological feature in type 2 diabetes, found in approximately 60-90% of patients post-mortem
- However, debate continues about whether it's a primary cause or secondary consequence
- No anti-amyloid therapies targeting IAPP have reached clinical use for diabetes treatment
- The field remains primarily at the basic research stage, with no FDA-approved drugs targeting IAPP aggregation in diabetes
- The prion-like transmission hypothesis remains speculative for diabetes, without clear evidence of inter-individual transmission in humans

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article's predictions and outcomes:**

- **Prediction that this mechanism might explain how diabetic pathology spreads within individuals**: Ongoing research continues to explore this, with evidence that IAPP aggregates can template misfolding in experimental systems. However, this remains a research area rather than established clinical fact.

- **Skepticism about person-to-person transmission**: This skepticism appears warranted. No convincing evidence has emerged for transmission of type 2 diabetes between humans via prion-like mechanisms in the general population. The obesity epidemic and lifestyle factors remain the dominant explanatory framework.

- **Prediction that findings "definitely need more investigation"**: Accurate assessment. Research has continued throughout 2017-2024, but with no breakthrough therapeutic applications yet. The IAPP aggregation hypothesis remains investigated but unproven as a primary causal mechanism.

- **Implication that environmental and genetic factors are sufficient explanation**: Supported by continued evidence. Type 2 diabetes epidemiology remains best explained by known risk factors (obesity, genetics, lifestyle), not mysterious transmission mechanisms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlights an intriguing scientific hypothesis about diabetes pathophysiology that connects to broader prion biology. While the specific transmission mechanism remains speculative, the work stimulated ongoing research into protein misfolding beyond classical neurodegenerative diseases. The reasonable tone and appropriate skepticism make it more valuable than typical hyped science reporting.
