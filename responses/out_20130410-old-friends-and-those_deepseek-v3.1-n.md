# Old Friends, And Those Other Guys (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal reflection essay by a medicinal chemist about the emotional relationships that laboratory researchers develop with chemical reagents over years of work. The author describes how certain compounds become "friends" after successfully solving difficult reaction problems—such as potassium hexamethyldisilazide (K-HMDS), which helped achieve a dramatic yield improvement from 0% to 90% during graduate school work. The author also discusses reagents viewed with dislike or frustration based on negative experiences, such as trimethyl phosphite (due to its odor and unsuccessful results), mercuric oxide (toxicity and failed desulfurization attempts), and higher-order cuprates with copper cyanide. The piece captures how sensory experiences (colors, smells) and memories become deeply associated with specific chemicals, creating lasting positive or negative biases that persist throughout a career.

## 2. HISTORY

K-HMDS (potassium hexamethyldisilazide) remained a widely used strong non-nucleophilic base in organic synthesis throughout the 2010s and beyond. The reagent continued to find applications in deprotonation reactions, particularly for sensitive substrates where selectivity is crucial. Publications from 2015-2023 consistently reference K-HMDS for reactions requiring strong bases with minimal nucleophilic interference.

The broader trend in synthetic chemistry moved toward developing "designer" bases with tailored properties—such as phosphazene bases and modified amide bases—but K-HMDS maintained its position as a workhorse reagent. The compound's commercial availability from major suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, TCI, etc.) ensured continued use in both academic and industrial settings.

Environmental and safety considerations led to increased scrutiny of mercury compounds like mercuric oxide mentioned in the article. Many institutions restricted or eliminated mercury-based reagents during the 2010s due to toxicity concerns and waste disposal challenges, accelerating the development of alternative desulfurization methods.

The article was published on Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which Science magazine acquired and continued hosting through 2017, maintaining its status as one of the most widely-read chemistry blogs in the pharmaceutical industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical development. It was a retrospective personal essay reflecting on the author's experiences with chemical reagents, rather than a predictive analysis of future trends.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a well-written personal essay with some charming insights into the psychology of laboratory work, but it lacks technical depth, empirical data, or broader implications relevant to biotechnology industry developments. While it captures authentic aspects of chemistry practice, it doesn't address significant scientific advances, drug development outcomes, or policy changes that would make it highly relevant for understanding the biotech landscape.
