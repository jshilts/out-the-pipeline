# Blue Light Gives Way to Red (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a key challenge in photochemistry: traditional blue-light photoredox systems suffer from poor solution penetration, limiting reactions to the outer few millimeters and requiring specialized flow rigs or prolonged irradiation. It highlights triplet fusion upconversion (also called triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion) as a way to convert deep-penetrating, low-energy near-infrared (NIR) light into higher-energy visible/UV photons inside the reaction mixture. The featured Nature study demonstrated an NIR-to-blue system using a palladium phthalocyanine sensitizer (absorbing at 730 nm), a diketopyrrolopyrrole annihilator, and eosin as the photocatalyst, achieving comparable yields at roughly 1/1000th the light-source power while enabling homogeneous illumination throughout the solution. This approach promises easier scale-up, lower power consumption, and simpler heat management compared to conventional photoredox setups.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article’s publication, triplet fusion upconversion matured from a promising proof-of-concept into a practical tool for synthetic photochemistry, with notable academic and industrial adoption.
- **Method adoption and optimization:** Research groups developed improved sensitizer/annihilator pairs and extended wavelength coverage (e.g., NIR-to-UV upconversion), enabling a broader range of photoredox transformations under mild NIR LED conditions.
- **Scale-up and commercialization:** Triplet fusion upconversion systems were commercialized (e.g., Iridium complexes paired with annihilators as upconversion kits) and integrated into continuous-flow photoreactors. Several groups reported decagram-to-kilogram scale photochemical syntheses of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals using NIR-to-blue/UV upconversion.
- **Reaction scope:** Beyond dehalogenations, the approach was demonstrated for cycloadditions, arylations, C–H functionalizations, and polymerizations. Upconversion schemes were also developed for photodynamic therapy and imaging.

Important subsections:
- **Technical refinements:** Systems were designed with better oxygen tolerance, higher quantum yields, and tailored emission colors for specific photocatalysts.
- **Industrial implementation:** Companies incorporated upconversion-assisted photochemistry into production workflows where traditional UV/visible photoreactors posed safety or scale limitations. Some contract manufacturers now offer upconversion-enabled photochemistry as a service.

Overall, triplet fusion upconversion evolved into an enabling technology for scalable, energy-efficient photochemistry, fulfilling the article’s premise with tangible impact on lab and process chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Real-world applications for photochemical scaleup**
  - Outcome: This largely succeeded. Over 2019–2024, several groups and companies scaled NIR-to-visible upconversion chemistries from milligram to kilogram scales in batch and flow. Upconversion-based photoreactors are now offered by lab-equipment vendors and used in pharmaceutical and fine-chemical process development. Benefits included reduced heating, lower power consumption, easier reactor geometry, and better safety versus high-power blue/UV setups.

- **Many good absorber/annihilator pairs will be identified**
  - Outcome: The toolkit expanded significantly. New sensitizers (including other metal complexes and organic dyes) and annihilators (e.g., perylenes, rubrenes, and diketopyrrolopyrroles) enabled tailored emission from blue into the UV under NIR excitation. Heterogeneous upconversion nanoparticles and thin films also emerged, broadening materials options.

- **Lower power consumption and easier heat management**
  - Outcome: Confirmed in practice. NIR LEDs are efficient, and the lower photon flux needed with deep-penetration upconversion reduces both input power and cooling demands, improving sustainability metrics (PMI, E-factor) for photochemical steps.

- **Excess heat would be a lot easier to deal with on larger rigs**
  - Outcome: Validated. Industrial photoreactors using upconversion report simpler thermal control compared to high-intensity blue/UV systems. Flow systems combining NIR illumination with upconversion showed stable operation over extended runs without external cooling.

- **Photochemistry of the future**
  - Outcome: Partially realized. Upconversion is now a standard, practical option in the photochemistry toolbox but has not universally displaced blue-light setups. It coexists with high-power blue LED and flow systems, each chosen based on reaction requirements. While not the only future, upconversion has secured a durable role where penetration depth, safety, or scalability are priorities.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article highlights an important technical pivot from surface-limited blue-light photoredox to deep-penetrating upconversion schemes, correctly anticipating key benefits that were subsequently realized in scalable photochemical production and process optimization across academia and industry.
