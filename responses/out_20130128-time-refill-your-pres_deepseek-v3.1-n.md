# Time to Refill Your Prescription For Zxygjfb (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the increasingly odd and unpronounceable brand names for newly approved pharmaceutical drugs, particularly noting the contrast between 2004 drug names (Vidaza, Avostin, Cymbalta, etc.) and 2012 names (Fulyzaq, Xeljanz, Iclusig, Xalkori, etc.). The author attributes this trend to several factors: the prevalence of oncology drugs that don't require mass-market consumer appeal, FDA requirements for distinct names to prevent prescription errors, and legal needs for names that cannot be easily confused with existing medications. The piece notes that regulators prefer names with "lots of pen strokes up and down" featuring letters like Z and X, making them more unique and readable in handwriting, even if they're difficult to pronounce. The author illustrates this with the example of denosumab, sold as Xgeva in oncology but marketed under the more consumer-friendly name Prolia for postmenopausal women.

## 2. HISTORY

The trend toward complex, consonant-heavy drug names has continued and intensified since 2013, particularly as the pharmaceutical industry has expanded into specialized therapies. Between 2013-2024, numerous additional drugs with similar naming patterns have been approved by the FDA, including cancer drugs like Imbruvica (2013), Zydelig (2014), Tagrisso (2015), Venclexta (2016), Calquence (2017), Vitrakvi (2018), Rozlytrek (2019), Trodelvy (2020), Lumakras (2021), and others featuring similar linguistic patterns with x, z, q, and unusual consonant clusters.

The FDA's planned name review process has become more systematic, requiring submitted names to undergo rigorous testing for confusion potential, sound-alike issues, and handwriting misinterpretation. This regulatory requirement has indeed driven the creation of intentionally complex names, particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices or those used in critical care settings where prescription errors could be life-threatening.

The oncology market has continued to dominate specialty pharmaceutical approvals, with most cancer drugs following the complex naming conventions noted in the article. This aligns with the article's observation about drugs not requiring mass-market consumer advertising—the majority of cancer therapies are prescribed by specialists and don't need consumer-friendly branding.

However, the pharmaceutical industry has also maintained a dual approach: drugs intended for both specialty and primary care markets often receive different brand names for different indications, as exemplified by denosumab/Xgeva/Prolia, with Xgeva used in oncology and Prolia in osteoporosis treatment. This strategy has become more common for drugs with multiple approved indications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that oncology drugs would continue to have complex names due to lack of mass-market advertising**: This prediction proved accurate. The vast majority of cancer drugs approved since 2013 have maintained complex, consonant-heavy names.

• **Prediction that FDA requirements for distinct names would drive naming complexity**: Also accurate. The FDA's increasingly stringent requirements to prevent medication errors have continued to push manufacturers toward creating names with distinctive letter patterns.

• **Observation that pronunciation would be less important than uniqueness**: This trend has held true. Many recently approved drugs remain difficult to pronounce for laypeople and even some healthcare professionals, with the primary emphasis remaining on error prevention rather than phonetic accessibility.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article identified and explained an authentic, ongoing trend in pharmaceutical naming conventions that has continued for over a decade. While the topic is somewhat specialized, the article accurately captured a real phenomenon with lasting implications for drug safety and marketing practices.
