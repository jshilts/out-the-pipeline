# Budgets and Revenues (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2012 commentary discusses the potential impact of the looming "Fiscal Cliff" budget sequestration on biomedical research funding for the NIH and FDA. The author notes that sequestration would trigger automatic spending cuts affecting new NIH grants and slowing FDA drug approval processes. The article also examines revenue-raising proposals targeting the pharmaceutical industry, particularly measures that had been previously negotiated away during the Affordable Care Act passage, including imposing Medicare Part D rebates for dual-eligibles and reducing biologics exclusivity from 12 to 7 years. Additionally, the piece mentions upcoming 2014 requirements for essential health benefits that would mandate minimum drug coverage levels determined state-by-state.

## 2. HISTORY
The sequester did take effect in March 2013, resulting in approximately 5% cuts to NIH funding ($1.55 billion reduction) and FDA budget reductions, though both agencies avoided the most catastrophic scenarios initially feared. NIH grant success rates fell to historic lows around 16-17% in subsequent years, with significant disruption to research programs.

However, the specific pharmaceutical revenue measures mentioned largely did not materialize as predicted. The 12-year biologics exclusivity period remained intact and was not reduced to 7 years. The dual-eligibles rebate proposal faced strong industry opposition and did not pass in the form described. The pharmaceutical industry largely succeeded in protecting the concessions gained during the ACA negotiations.

The essential health benefits requirement did go into effect in 2014 as planned, establishing minimum coverage standards under the ACA, though the implementation varied significantly by state and did not operate under the strict "one drug per class" mandate initially suggested by HHS.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Sequester impact**: Correctly predicted that sequestration would hit NIH grants and slow FDA approvals, which did occur
• **Dual-eligibles rebates**: Predicted these would be implemented to generate revenue - this did not happen as proposed
• **Biologics exclusivity reduction**: Predicted 12-year period would be cut to 7 years - this did not occur
• **"Everything off the table is back"**: This prediction about previously negotiated concessions being re-opened proved largely incorrect for pharmaceutical industry provisions

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

The article captured an important moment in science policy discussions during a period of genuine budget uncertainty, but its predictions about pharmaceutical industry concessions were largely incorrect, limiting its long-term analytical value.
