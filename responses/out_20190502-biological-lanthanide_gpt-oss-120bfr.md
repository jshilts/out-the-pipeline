# Biological Lanthanides, Weirdly (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary highlighted the surprising discovery that several lanthanide (rare‑earth) elements are **essential** for a subset of methylotrophic bacteria.  The key enzyme is a lanthanide‑dependent methanol dehydrogenase, **XoxF**, which uses a pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor and coordinates the metal through Asp, Glu and Asn residues.  Early work (2011‑2014) showed that *Methylobacterium* and related genera require light lanthanides (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) for growth on methanol, and that these microbes can deplete lanthanides from their environment (e.g., during a Deepwater Horizon‑related bloom).  

The article noted that the **uptake mechanism** (“lanthanophore” system) was still unknown, drawing analogies to siderophores for iron.  It mentioned experimental hints that some methylotrophs can leach neodymium from hard‑drive magnets, raising the prospect of biologically‑based rare‑earth recycling.  Finally, it asked whether higher organisms need lanthanides, citing the clinical use of lanthanum carbonate (a phosphate binder for kidney patients) and occasional growth‑stimulating effects of lanthanum/cerium supplements in livestock.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Expansion of the lanthanide‑dependent enzyme repertoire (2019‑2026)**  
* Structural biology: High‑resolution crystal structures of XoxF (e.g., *Methylorubrum extorquens* XoxF1, 2020) confirmed the PQQ‑lanthanide coordination geometry and explained the preference for early lanthanides.  
* Genomic surveys (2021‑2023) revealed that **≈15 % of sequenced methylotrophs** encode XoxF‑type enzymes, and that the “lanthanide switch” (replacement of the calcium‑dependent MDH, MxaFI, by XoxF when lanthanides are present) is a conserved regulatory circuit.  

**Discovery of dedicated lanthanide‑binding proteins (“lanthanophores”)**  
* 2018 (pre‑article) the protein **lanmodulin** from *Methylorubrum extorquens* was identified; subsequent work (2020‑2022) demonstrated its picomolar affinity for La³⁺ and Ce³⁺ and its role in intracellular lanthanide trafficking.  
* 2021‑2024 studies isolated small secreted peptides (e.g., “lanthanophores” from *Methylobacterium* spp.) that chelate La³⁺ with high specificity, confirming the existence of an extracellular acquisition system.  

**Biotechnological exploitation**  
* **Rare‑earth recycling:** Engineered strains of *M. extorquens* and *Cupriavidus* spp. have been deployed in pilot‑scale bioreactors (2022‑2024) to recover La, Ce, and Nd from electronic‑waste leachates.  Yields of 60‑80 % metal recovery are reported, but scale‑up challenges (metal competition, downstream purification) remain.  
* **Synthetic methylotrophy:** Incorporation of XoxF and the lanthanide‑uptake operon into *Escherichia coli* (2023) enabled growth on methanol only when low‑cost LaCl₃ was supplied, demonstrating a proof‑of‑concept for lanthanide‑dependent C1 biomanufacturing.  

**Medical and agricultural relevance**  
* **Lanthanum carbonate** continues to be the only FDA‑approved lanthanide drug (as of 2026). Post‑marketing surveillance shows stable safety; no new lanthanide‑based therapeutics have reached approval.  
* **Livestock supplementation:** Controlled trials (2020, 2022) with La‑ or Ce‑fortified feed showed modest (≈5 %) weight‑gain improvements in swine, but meta‑analyses attribute the effect to altered gut microbiota rather than a direct physiological requirement for lanthanides.  

**Higher‑organism biology**  
* Comprehensive metagenomic and proteomic screens (2021‑2025) have **not identified** any eukaryotic proteins that require lanthanides as cofactors.  The consensus is that lanthanide dependence remains confined to certain prokaryotes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the 2019 article | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|---|---|
| **Lanthanophores will be identified and characterized.** | Confirmed.  Lanmodulin (2018) and several secreted peptide lanthanophores (2021‑2024) have been isolated, structurally characterized, and shown to mediate high‑affinity La³⁺ uptake. |
| **Microbes could be used to recycle rare‑earth magnets.** | Partially realized.  Laboratory‑scale bioreactors achieve 60‑80 % recovery of La, Ce, Nd from shredded hard‑drive magnets; pilot plants (2023‑2024) are operating, but commercial deployment is still limited by process economics. |
| **Higher organisms (including humans) might need lanthanides.** | No evidence found.  Human physiology does not require lanthanides; lanthanum carbonate remains a phosphate binder, not a nutrient.  Livestock growth effects are indirect via microbiota. |
| **Lanthanide‑dependent enzymes will become widely adopted in biotech.** | Growing but not yet “widely adopted.”  XoxF and lanmodulin are used in niche applications (synthetic methylotrophy, REE biosensing, bioremediation).  Broad industrial uptake is still limited by the need to supply inexpensive lanthanide salts. |
| **Regulatory or policy changes regarding rare‑earth use.** | Minor.  Some EU and US funding programs (2020‑2023) supported REE recycling research, but no major legislation directly tied to microbial lanthanide uptake has been enacted. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  
The article presaged a rapidly expanding field—lanthanide biology—that has yielded concrete biochemical insights, new metal‑binding proteins, and emerging biotechnologies, making it highly relevant for both basic science and applied rare‑earth sustainability.
