# GSK's Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses GlaxoSmithKline's initiative to make 367 kinase inhibitor compounds publicly available to academic researchers studying kinases. The program, led by GSK scientists David Drewry and William Zuercher, provides these compounds free to academic investigators on the condition that research results be made publicly available through databases like ChEMBL.

The motivation behind this open-source approach was to accelerate kinase research by enabling broader scientific collaboration. Given the vast scope of chemical biology work needed in the kinase field, GSK recognized that no single organization could tackle everything alone. By 2013, approximately 80 collaborations had already been established, spanning from broad phenotypic screening to targeted studies against rare cancers. The initiative represented an early industry example of data and compound sharing, with plans to expand the collection and potentially create open networks for developing new chemical probes.

## 2. HISTORY

**Program Continuation and Evolution**: The GSK Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) initiative continued and expanded following the 2013 article. The collection grew beyond the initial 367 compounds, and GSK published comprehensive characterization data including kinase profiling, cellular activity, and structural information.

**Scientific Impact**: The PKIS compounds became widely used chemical probes in academic kinase research. These compounds enabled studies across diverse biology including cancer, inflammation, metabolism, and neuroscience. The public availability of well-characterized kinase inhibitors helped researchers validate kinase targets and understand signaling pathways without the delays and costs of compound acquisition.

**Impact on Drug Discovery**: While the PKIS compounds themselves were research tools rather than drug candidates, they contributed to target validation efforts that informed drug discovery programs. Academic research using these compounds identified new biological roles for specific kinases and validated therapeutic hypotheses.

**Regulatory and Industry Changes**: The initiative's timing coincided with broader shifts toward open innovation and precompetitive collaborations in pharmaceutical research. Other companies, including Novartis and Pfizer, subsequently launched similar compound-sharing programs, indicating industry recognition of collaborative chemistry's value.

**Mechanistic Insights and Publications**: Over time, research using PKIS compounds generated mechanistic insights into kinase biology, leading to high-impact publications and better understanding of kinase-related diseases. The compounds filled a critical gap in chemical biology by making available selective inhibitors for previously understudied kinases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not contain explicit dated predictions about future outcomes. Instead, it identifies opportunities and possibilities at that moment, which can be assessed against subsequent developments.

**Seeding discovery in the field**
- The article suggested that making compounds available would accelerate kinase field development. This proved accurate—the compounds saw widespread adoption and enabled diverse research that might not have occurred without accessible chemical tools. The program demonstrated that precompetitive sharing can advance science broadly.

**Future compound additions**
- The article mentioned plans to "continue to firm up the collection" and "add more compounds." This expansion occurred as intended, with GSK and later academic consortiums adding new compounds with varied selectivity profiles and chemotypes beyond the original set.

**Academic uptake**
- The author encouraged academic researchers to "take a look at this compound set." This adoption occurred and sustained strong academic engagement with the compounds becoming standard tools in kinase research laboratories.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article is of notable interest because it documented an important early example of pharmaceutical open innovation that influenced broader industry practices. While the specific compounds were research tools rather than breakthrough medicines, the initiative's success helped establish the viability of precompetitive data sharing in drug discovery.
