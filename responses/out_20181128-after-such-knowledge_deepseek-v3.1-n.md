# After Such Knowledge (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article responds to He Jiankui's announcement at the International Human Genome Summit in Hong Kong about creating the world's first CRISPR-edited human babies. The author describes how He Jiankui had focused extensively on publicity—including months of filming and YouTube videos—while the actual scientific work appeared deeply flawed. 

Of 31 embryos from eight couples injected with CRISPR reagents, 70% showed DNA editing, but the results were problematic: one twin girl was mosaic for the intended 32-amino acid CCR5 deletion, while the other was heterozygous for a different five amino acid deletion. Neither achieved the desired genetic modification. The article strongly condemns the experiment as reckless human experimentation, noting that the parents signed consent forms describing it as an "HIV vaccine research project," potentially without adequate understanding of the gene-editing procedure. The work was widely criticized by leading scientists including David Liu and Alta Charo, who called it "misguided, premature, unnecessary and largely useless."

## 2. HISTORY

Following the November 2018 disclosure, He Jiankui faced immediate international condemnation and was subsequently investigated by Chinese authorities. In December 2019, he was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 3 million yuan for illegal medical practice. The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, where He was affiliated, fired him, and China quickly moved to strengthen regulations governing human gene-editing research.

The scientific community responded by calling for moratoria on human germline editing, leading to the WHO's establishment of a global registry for human genome editing research and the development of international governance frameworks. Major scientific organizations, including the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the UK's Royal Society, issued updated guidance emphasizing that clinical applications of heritable human genome editing remain premature and require much more extensive research.

Contrary to fears that this would open floodgates for similar rogue experiments, the case actually served as a cautionary tale that strengthened oversight. No other documented cases of CRISPR babies have emerged publicly since, suggesting the international regulatory response was effective in preventing immediate copycat attempts.

Regarding the CCR5-Δ32 approach itself, subsequent research has shown more complexity than initially understood. While the natural CCR5-Δ32 mutation does provide HIV resistance, it may also increase susceptibility to West Nile virus and potentially influenza. The specific mutations created in He's experiment were novel, and their long-term health effects remain unknown and unstudied in human populations.

The Chinese government's rapid response—prosecuting He and implementing stricter regulations—demonstrated that even in jurisdictions with relatively permissive research environments, there were clear red lines against premature human germline editing experiments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction of opening floodgates**: While the author expressed concern about the precedent this would set, the actual outcome was increased regulation and caution rather than proliferation of similar experiments.

• **Predicted harm to the field's reputation**: This proved accurate—the case generated lasting negative public perception of human gene editing and made researchers more cautious about public communication of gene-editing research, though it didn't halt the field's scientific progress in legitimate applications.

• **Predicted monitoring and long-term consequences**: The girls are indeed being monitored (as mandated by Chinese authorities), but no public information about their health status has been released, consistent with privacy protections. The "third pregnancy" mentioned appears to have been addressed through Chinese regulatory intervention.

• **The author's characterization of this as "criminal" proved prescient**: He Jiankui was indeed prosecuted and imprisoned, validating the author's assessment that this crossed legal and ethical boundaries.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article captured a watershed moment in bioethics and gene-editing governance with long-term implications for both scientific research oversight and public trust in biotechnology.
