# Bacteria Behind Yet Another Disease (Nov 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a landmark study published in Nature that identified Enterococcus faecalis bacteria as a causative agent in alcoholic liver disease, particularly alcoholic hepatitis. The research from a large multinational team found that the presence of E. faecalis and specifically its cytolysin toxin in human stool samples was strongly correlated with severe alcoholic hepatitis. The mortality data was striking: 89% of patients with cytolysin-positive stool samples died within 180 days of hospitalization, compared to only 3% of patients without cytolysin. The researchers replicated these findings in multiple mouse models, showing that alcohol consumption creates conditions where cytolysin-producing E. faecalis can cause liver damage. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that bacteriophage therapy targeting these specific bacteria reduced liver damage in infected animals, suggesting potential new treatment avenues for this severe form of liver disease.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the publication of this 2019 research, the findings have had significant impact on hepatology and our understanding of alcohol-related liver disease. The study fundamentally shifted the paradigm from viewing alcoholic hepatitis solely as direct ethanol toxicity to recognizing the critical role of gut-liver axis dysfunction and specific pathogenic bacteria.

In the years since, additional research has validated and extended these findings. Multiple studies have confirmed that Enterococcus faecalis and its cytolysin play important roles in the severity of alcoholic hepatitis across different populations. The gut microbiome has emerged as a key therapeutic target in liver disease research, with numerous clinical trials investigating microbiome modulation through probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.

However, the translation to clinical practice has been slower. While bacteriophage therapy showed promising results in the mouse models described in the paper, clinical applications of phage therapy for alcoholic hepatitis remain limited and mostly experimental. Standard treatment for alcoholic hepatitis still primarily involves corticosteroids and nutritional support, with liver transplantation as the definitive treatment for eligible patients with severe disease. Several clinical trials have investigated antibiotics (particularly targeting gut bacteria) as adjunctive therapy, with some showing modest benefits in specific subgroups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about future developments:

• **Bacteriophage therapy as a treatment approach**: The paper demonstrated successful phage therapy in mouse models, suggesting this could translate to human treatment. However, while research continues, phage therapy has not become a standard or widely available treatment for alcoholic hepatitis as of now. Regulatory and manufacturing challenges have limited clinical implementation.

• **Adding alcoholic hepatitis to bacterial disease list**: The article predicted this condition would be recognized as having a bacterial cause. This prediction was largely accurate - the bacterial contribution to alcoholic hepatitis pathogenesis is now widely accepted in the hepatology community, and gut-targeted therapies are being actively investigated.

• **Immediate treatment possibilities**: The research suggested immediate therapeutic implications. While this led to increased research activity and clinical trials, the "immediate" translation proved more complex. Standard treatment protocols evolved to consider gut microbiome aspects, but dramatic treatment breakthroughs have not materialized as quickly as hoped.

• **Personal hope for addiction treatment advances**: The author expressed personal motivation for advancing addiction and consequences treatment. While microbiome research has expanded into other areas of addiction medicine, the specific applications to alcohol use disorder treatment have remained more limited than broader liver disease applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an important paradigm shift in understanding alcoholic liver disease - moving beyond simple hepatotoxicity to recognize the complex interplay between alcohol, gut microbiome, and specific bacterial virulence factors. The research has had substantial impact on hepatology research and opened new therapeutic avenues, even if clinical translation has been more gradual than initially hoped.
