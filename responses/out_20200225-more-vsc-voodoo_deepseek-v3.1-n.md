# More VSC Voodoo (February 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2020 article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses emerging research on vibrational strong coupling (VSC)—a quantum mechanical phenomenon where hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) form when molecules with strong IR absorption are placed in confined optical cavities. The article highlights two recent experimental studies: one showing that coupling to water's OH stretching vibration slowed pepsin enzyme activity by nearly five-fold, and another demonstrating that coupling to carbonyl stretching vibrations slowed the Prins reaction by up to 70%. Both effects appeared to result from subtle changes in bond polarity rather than major mechanistic pathway alterations. The author emphasizes that while VSC represented a novel tool for manipulating and investigating chemical reactions at the time, it had no practical applications yet.

## 2. HISTORY

Since February 2020, vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has continued to develop as an active research area in physical chemistry, though practical applications remain limited and predominantly in the research phase.

**Research Advances**: The field has expanded beyond model organic reactions to more complex systems. Research groups have investigated VSC effects on various chemical transformations, including fullerene reactions, polymerization processes, and additional biocatalytic systems. However, the fundamental understanding remains incomplete—the "reshaping of reaction potential energy landscapes" mechanism noted in 2020 is still the dominant explanation, but predictive design of VSC effects is not yet possible.

**Technical Development**: Experimental setups have become more sophisticated with better control over cavity parameters and vibrational mode targeting. Some progress has been made in understanding which vibrational modes are most effective for coupling and how cavity design influences the magnitude of rate modifications.

**Practical Applications**: VSC has not achieved widespread adoption in industrial chemistry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, or biotechnology. There are no FDA-approved drugs or industrial processes that utilize VSC for rate control or selectivity enhancement. The technique remains primarily a tool for fundamental mechanistic studies rather than practical synthesis or manufacturing.

**Business/Commercial Impact**: No major biotechnology or chemical companies have commercialized VSC technology. The research remains academic, with most publications coming from university laboratories. No significant startup activity has emerged around VSC applications.

**Scientific Understanding**: While the quantum mechanical basis of polariton formation is well-established, the translation of these effects into predictable control over complex organic reactions remains challenging. Researchers can reproducibly observe rate modifications, but cannot yet design systems to achieve specific desired outcomes reliably.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Prediction 1 - VSC as a tool for changing reaction dynamics**: The article suggested VSC would become "a tool for both changing reaction dynamics and investigating reaction mechanisms that we've never really investigated before." 
- **Outcome**: Partial success. VSC has indeed proven valuable for mechanistic investigation, revealing subtle details about bond polarity and transition states in ways that complement traditional techniques. However, its utility for *practical* reaction rate control has not materialized—there are no routine applications of VSC for synthesis optimization or manufacturing.

**Implicit Prediction 2 - Development of practical applications**: The author's interest in "what comes of VSC" implied potential for practical development.
- **Outcome**: Not realized. VSC remains a specialized research technique rather than a practical synthetic tool. The lack of predictable control and the technical complexity of cavity setups have prevented translation to industrial applications. The fundamental challenge identified in 2020—that "a clear picture of the effect of VSC on organic chemistry is still lacking"—has not been fully resolved.

**Implicit Prediction 3 - Understanding of mechanistic selectivity**: The pepsin results showed that different vibrational modes (OH stretch vs. bend) had dramatically different effects, suggesting VSC could reveal mechanistic details.
- **Outcome**: Continued success. VSC has proven useful for mechanistic studies, but this has not translated into practical drug discovery applications or enzyme engineering tools. The promise of revealing mechanistic insights has been fulfilled for research purposes, but not for biotechnology applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an interesting niche development in physical organic chemistry with genuine novelty in reaction control mechanisms. However, it has had minimal practical impact on biotechnology, drug development, or industrial chemistry, remaining primarily of academic interest with limited broader relevance to the field.
