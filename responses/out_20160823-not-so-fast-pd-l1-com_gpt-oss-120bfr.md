# Not So Fast on the PD‑L1 Comparisons (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary warned that head‑to‑head comparisons of the PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies — Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) — were fundamentally flawed because each sponsor used its own proprietary immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to measure PD‑L1 expression. The author highlighted the CheckMate‑026 trial, in which nivolumab failed to improve outcomes versus chemotherapy in first‑line non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC) when patients were selected with a ≥ 5 % PD‑L1 cutoff. He argued that the lack of a common assay, differing scoring algorithms, and the absence of a prospective trial that evaluates all assays together made any “generic” PD‑L1 cutoff unreliable. The piece also mentioned the Blueprint Project, a collaborative effort among industry, diagnostics, and regulators to compare assays, and noted that Merck KGaA/Pfizer were not participating.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Clinical development and approvals (2016‑2025)  
* **Nivolumab (Opdivo)** – After the negative CheckMate‑026 result, Bristol‑Myers Squibb pursued other indications and combination regimens. CheckMate‑227 (published 2019) demonstrated overall survival benefit of nivolumab + ipilimumab in first‑line NSCLC **irrespective of PD‑L1 status**, leading to FDA approval in 2020 for that combination without a PD‑L1 requirement. Nivolumab also received approvals in later‑line settings for a range of solid tumours, many of which do not mandate PD‑L1 testing.  

* **Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)** – KEYNOTE‑024 (2016) showed a dramatic survival advantage for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in first‑line NSCLC with **PD‑L1 ≥ 50 %**, prompting FDA approval with that cutoff. Subsequent trials (KEYNOTE‑042, 2019) expanded the label to include patients with **PD‑L1 ≥ 1 %**, albeit with a smaller magnitude of benefit.  

* **Other PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies** – Atezolizumab (Roche/Genentech), durvalumab (AstraZeneca), and cemiplimab (Regeneron/Sanofi) all obtained FDA approvals in NSCLC and other cancers, each paired with its own companion/complementary assay (SP142, SP263, 73‑10, etc.).  

### Diagnostic assay landscape  
* **FDA‑cleared assays** – By 2020 the FDA had cleared **four** PD‑L1 IHC assays as **complementary** diagnostics for pembrolizumab (22C3, 28‑8, SP263, and 73‑10). The SP142 assay, used for atezolizumab, remained a **companion** diagnostic for certain indications because of its lower sensitivity.  

* **Blueprint Project results** – The Blueprint PD‑L1 IHC Assay Comparison Project (first published 2017, updated 2019) performed head‑to‑head testing of the major commercial assays on the same NSCLC specimens. The studies found **high analytical concordance** for the proportion of tumor cells staining ≥1 % and ≥50 %, but **systematic differences** in scoring immune‑cell staining (especially with SP142). The work demonstrated that, for most clinical decisions, any FDA‑cleared assay could be used interchangeably for pembrolizumab, but it also confirmed that assay‑specific cutoffs remain necessary.  

* **Guideline evolution** – The 2021 NCCN and ASCO guidelines explicitly state that **any FDA‑cleared PD‑L1 assay may be used** for pembrolizumab eligibility, provided the appropriate scoring algorithm is applied. This reflects the practical outcome of the Blueprint harmonization effort.  

### Business and policy impact  
* **Market growth** – Despite the early confusion, PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors have become the dominant class in oncology, generating **> $30 billion** in global sales by 2024. The initial “PD‑L1‑negative” patient concerns proved largely unfounded as combination regimens and broader indications expanded the treatable population.  

* **Regulatory stance** – The FDA has continued to approve **multiple, assay‑specific companion/complementary diagnostics** rather than a single universal test, acknowledging the technical differences highlighted in the article.  

* **Merck KGaA/Pfizer** – The partnership referenced in 2016 never produced a marketed PD‑L1 inhibitor; Pfizer later discontinued its PD‑1 program in 2018, and Merck KGaA shifted focus to other immuno‑oncology targets.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| *A generic PD‑L1 cutoff that predicts benefit across all PD‑1/PD‑L1 drugs is unlikely without a prospective, multi‑assay trial.* | The Blueprint Project (2017‑2019) provided the needed multi‑assay comparison, confirming analytical concordance but also preserving assay‑specific cutoffs for some drugs. No single universal cutoff has been adopted; instead, each drug retains its own validated threshold. | **Accurate** – the prediction was correct; the field moved toward assay‑specific, not universal, cutoffs. |
| *Physicians cannot reliably swap assays (e.g., use a Merck assay to decide on Opdivo). * | By 2022 NCCN/ASCO guidelines allowed any FDA‑cleared assay for pembrolizumab, but for nivolumab the 28‑8 assay remains the reference. In practice, many centers use the assay that is most readily available, accepting minor differences. | **Partially correct** – cross‑use is now common for pembrolizumab, but not universally accepted for all agents. |
| *The Blueprint Project will eventually resolve clinical equivalence between drugs.* | Blueprint delivered analytical comparison data but stopped short of establishing **clinical equivalence**; head‑to‑head trials (e.g., CheckMate 227 vs. KEYNOTE‑189) remain the gold standard for efficacy comparisons. | **Not fulfilled** – analytical harmonization achieved, but clinical equivalence still requires direct trials. |
| *PD‑L1 negative patients derive little benefit from PD‑1 blockade.* | Subsequent trials (CheckMate‑227, IMpower110) showed **survival benefit even in PD‑L1‑negative** cohorts, especially when drugs are combined with chemotherapy or CTLA‑4 blockade. | **Incorrect** – real‑world data disproved the notion of negligible benefit. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal technical and regulatory challenge that shaped how immunotherapy diagnostics are used today; its relevance persists, though the specific “mess” it described has been partially resolved.
