# Overly Honest Experimental Methods (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short article highlights the popular Twitter hashtag #OverlyHonestMethods that emerged in early 2013, where researchers began anonymously confessing to questionable practices and shortcuts taken in their scientific work. The piece provides several examples of candid admissions from scientists, such as cherry-picking favorable data points (reporting a 95% result when most trials yielded 43%), choosing methods based on popularity rather than scientific merit, using modified protocols because exact replication was difficult, and hiding inadequate documentation in supplementary materials. The article frames these confessions as "sins" that many researchers recognize from their own experience, acknowledging the gap between idealized scientific practice and real-world research behavior.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 article captured a moment in what would become a major movement toward transparency in scientific research. Several concrete developments followed:

**Replication Crisis Recognition**: Between 2013-2015, prominent papers revealed widespread failures to replicate findings across multiple fields, particularly psychology and biomedical research, bringing experimental rigor issues into mainstream scientific discourse.

**Open Science Framework Growth**: The Center for Open Science, founded in 2013, expanded rapidly with initiatives promoting study pre-registration, open data, and transparent reporting standards, receiving substantial funding and institutional support.

**Methodological Reforms**: Major journals (including *Science*, *Nature*, and *PLOS*) implemented stricter requirements for methods reporting, statistical analysis transparency, and mandatory data availability statements between 2013-2016.

**Policy Changes**: Funding agencies like NIH and NSF increasingly required data management plans and open access policies post-2014, with some mandating pre-registration for clinical trials.

**Registered Reports Expansion**: The format where journals peer-review and accept studies before data collection began grew from a niche practice to widespread adoption across dozens of journals, addressing many issues highlighted by the #OverlyHonestMethods confessions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself made no explicit predictions, instead serving as observational commentary on existing researcher behavior. It captured a moment when scientists anonymously acknowledged questionable practices, but did not forecast how these issues would be addressed or whether transparency would improve.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlights researcher practices that contributed to documented replication difficulties, particularly relevant given subsequent methodological reforms and transparency initiatives in scientific publishing.
