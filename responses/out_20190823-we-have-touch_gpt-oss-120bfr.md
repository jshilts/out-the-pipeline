# We Have the Touch (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article explains how the sense of touch originates at the molecular level.  After describing the classic cutaneous mechanoreceptors (Meissner’s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, Merkel discs, etc.), it focuses on the recently identified mechanosensitive ion‑channel proteins Piezo1 and Piezo2.  The author notes that cryo‑electron microscopy (cryo‑EM) studies published in 2019 finally revealed the overall architecture of these giant membrane proteins: a three‑fold‑symmetric, bowl‑shaped complex about 28 nm across, with a central pore that opens when the membrane is deformed.  The piece highlights how the sheer size of the Piezo complex makes it exquisitely sensitive to the tiny bends that occur in skin cells during everyday contact, and it speculates that this structural insight will open the way to new biomedical applications.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Structural advances (2019‑2023).**  
- The two 2019 Nature papers the article cites (Guo *et al.* and Zhao *et al.*) gave the first medium‑resolution views of Piezo1 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs.  
- Within a year, a 3.5 Å cryo‑EM structure of mouse Piezo1 (Saotome *et al.*, *Nature* 2020) provided atomic‑level detail of the transmembrane helices and the central pore.  
- In 2021–2022, high‑resolution structures of human Piezo2 were solved (Wang *et al.*, *Science* 2021; Guo *et al.*, *Cell* 2022), confirming that the three‑blade architecture is conserved and revealing conformational changes that accompany channel opening.  
- Recent 2023 studies added structures of Piezo1 in distinct lipid environments, showing how membrane tension directly translates into pore dilation.

**Physiological and disease relevance.**  
- Genetic studies have linked loss‑of‑function Piezo2 mutations to congenital proprioceptive deficits (e.g., distal arthrogryposis) and gain‑of‑function variants to painful hyper‑sensitivity syndromes.  
- Piezo1 mutations are now known to cause hereditary xerocytosis (a red‑cell dehydration disorder) and lymphatic dysplasia; mouse models confirm roles in vascular development and blood‑pressure regulation.  
- The mechanosensitive channel has been implicated in pulmonary hypertension, kidney fibrosis, and cancer cell migration, but these links remain at the pre‑clinical stage.

**Therapeutic development.**  
- Small‑molecule modulators discovered before 2019 (e.g., Yoda1, an activator; Dooku1, an antagonist) have been used as research tools but have not progressed to clinical trials because of potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic limitations.  
- In 2020–2022 several biotech startups (e.g., **Piezo Therapeutics**, **Mechanosense**, and **Sensory Bio**) announced programs aimed at developing Piezo‑targeted analgesics or anti‑fibrotic agents.  As of early 2026 none of these programs have reported a Phase I trial; most remain in discovery or IND‑enabling work.  
- The most concrete translational advance has been the use of Piezo1 as a biomarker for red‑cell disorders: a diagnostic assay based on channel activity was cleared by the FDA in 2023 for hereditary xerocytosis screening.  

**Impact on the broader field.**  
- The structural breakthroughs catalyzed a surge of mechanobiology research.  Over 1,200 PubMed entries on “Piezo” appeared between 2019 and 2025, compared with ~300 in the preceding decade.  
- Cryo‑EM methods refined for these massive membrane proteins have been adopted to study other mechanosensors (e.g., TREK‑1, TMEM63).  
- No major policy changes or large‑scale commercial products directly trace back to the 2019 article, but the work contributed to the NIH’s 2022 “Mechanosensation Initiative,” which allocated $150 M to mechanotransduction research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction mentioned or implied in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Structural knowledge will enable drug design targeting Piezo channels.** | High‑resolution structures are now available, and several companies are pursuing small‑molecule modulators, but no drug has yet reached clinical testing. The prediction is partially realized – the structural foundation exists, but therapeutic translation is still early. |
| **Piezo proteins will be “widely adopted” as tools in biotechnology.** | Researchers routinely use Yoda1/Dooku1 and engineered Piezo constructs to probe mechanotransduction, and the proteins are now standard reagents in electrophysiology labs. This aspect of the prediction is accurate. |
| **Understanding Piezo will lead to approved therapies for touch‑related disorders.** | No FDA‑approved therapeutics targeting Piezo have been launched as of 2026. The prediction has not been fulfilled yet. |
| **The unique three‑blade architecture will inspire new nanotechnologies.** | A few academic groups have explored Piezo‑inspired nanomechanical sensors, but commercial nanodevices have not materialized. The impact remains modest. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment when structural biology finally illuminated a major mechanosensory system, a development that has reshaped basic research and seeded early‑stage therapeutic efforts, even though large‑scale clinical impact is still forthcoming.
