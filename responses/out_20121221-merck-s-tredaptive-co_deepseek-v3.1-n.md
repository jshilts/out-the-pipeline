# Merck's Tredaptive Comes to a Halt (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the troubled history of Merck's Tredaptive, a combination drug containing niacin and laropiprant (the latter intended to reduce niacin's flushing side effects). The drug had been rejected by the FDA in 2008 but was approved in Europe. Merck was running a large 25,000-patient trial combining Tredaptive with statin therapy after the FDA requested more data. The article reports that the European Medicines Agency had begun a safety and efficacy review due to preliminary trial results showing that adding Tredaptive to statins did not reduce major vascular events compared to statin therapy alone, and actually increased non-fatal serious side effects.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments confirmed and expanded upon these initial concerns:

**Regulatory Actions**: In January 2013, Merck announced it would halt the HPS2-THRIVE (Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) trial early due to lack of efficacy and increased adverse events. The company withdrew Tredaptive from all markets globally. The European Medicines Agency formally withdrew the drug's marketing authorization in 2013, recommending that patients discontinue use.

**Clinical Evidence**: The full HPS2-THRIVE results, eventually published in the New England Journal of Medicine (2014), showed definitively that adding extended-release niacin-laropiprant to statin therapy provided no additional cardiovascular benefit. The trial involved over 25,000 patients and found no significant reduction in major vascular events compared to statin treatment alone. The combination actually increased serious adverse events, including disturbances in diabetes control, gastrointestinal issues, and infections.

**Scientific Impact**: HPS2-THRIVE essentially ended the therapeutic hypothesis that adding niacin to statins would provide additional cardiovascular protection through HDL cholesterol manipulation. This represented a significant setback for the HDL hypothesis in cardiovascular disease treatment, complementing earlier negative results from other HDL-targeting drugs like torcetrapib (CETP inhibitors) and the AIM-HIGH niacin trial stopped by the NIH in 2011.

**Business Impact**: Merck wrote off its investment in Tredaptive, which had been hoped to become a blockbuster drug. The failure contributed to the broader pharmaceutical industry reassessment of cardiovascular combination therapies and the biological complexity of lipid metabolism.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction that Tredaptive was essentially finished**: The article stated "So much for Tredaptive, and (I'd say) so much for the idea of taking niacin and statins together." This prediction proved accurate - Merck discontinued the drug globally within months, and the niacin-plus-statin therapeutic approach was largely abandoned in clinical practice.

**• Prediction that the FDA's 2008 demand for more evidence was justified**: The article noted that "the FDA was on target here when they asked for more evidence from Merck." This proved prescient, as the subsequent large trial indeed showed no benefit and significant harm, validating the FDA's caution.

**• Implicit prediction about human lipid biology complexity**: The article's closing statement about human lipid biology being "very complicated indeed" and statins being "outliers" predicted the continued difficulties in developing successful cardiovascular drugs beyond statins. This proved accurate as subsequent CETP inhibitors and other novel approaches largely failed in trials.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article captured a pivotal moment in cardiovascular drug development, documenting the definitive failure of a major therapeutic approach while highlighting the FDA's evidence-based regulatory process. The broader context of persistently challenging lipid biology research gives this analysis lasting relevance.
