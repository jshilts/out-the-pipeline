# Toxicolottery (February 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes how most drug development projects fail, with a special focus on toxicity as a major bottleneck. It indicates that while the public often hears about clinical trial failures (Phase I due to toxicity, and Phase II due to lack of efficacy), the greatest number of project failures actually occur earlier, during preclinical toxicity studies. The author characterizes toxicity testing as long, expensive, and a "complete black box" where non-mechanistic toxicity can unexpectedly derail a project regardless of its mechanism.
