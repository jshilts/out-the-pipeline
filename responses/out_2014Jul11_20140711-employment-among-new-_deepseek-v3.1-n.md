# Analysis: "Employment Among New Chemistry PhDs" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's 2014 article presented a critical analysis challenging the prevailing narrative of a STEM shortage in the United States, specifically focusing on employment outcomes for new chemistry PhDs. Drawing on federal NIH/NSF survey data analyzed by Jordan Weissmann at Slate, the piece demonstrated that employment rates for new STEM doctorates had been stagnant or declining across major disciplines for the preceding 20 years. 

The article highlighted several troubling indicators: persistently high postdoc populations, employment rates for new doctorates failing to return to late-1990s levels, and the striking revelation that unemployed new chemistry PhD holders outnumbered those with non-postdoc jobs—a situation Lowe suggested might be unprecedented. While acknowledging a recent slight uptick in computer science and engineering employment data for 2011-2012, Lowe remained skeptical about whether this represented a meaningful trend, arguing that the overall data contradicted corporate claims of inability to find qualified candidates.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) revealed a complex and sector-dependent reality that partially validated Lowe's concerns while also demonstrating the limitations of his analysis. The employment landscape for chemistry PhDs underwent significant transformation, but not always in the directions predicted:

**Academic Sector Stagnation**: Post-2014 data largely confirmed Lowe's pessimistic assessment of academia. The number of tenure-track positions continued to decline, postdoc terms lengthened, and adjunctification accelerated. The 2016-2020 period saw continued flat or declining federal research funding in real terms, exacerbating the academic job crisis that Lowe documented.

**Industry Sector Divergence**: However, the industrial landscape proved more nuanced. While traditional pharmaceutical and chemical companies did experience consolidation and layoffs (particularly during the 2015-2017 period with major mergers like Pfizer-Allergan), new opportunities emerged in unexpected areas. The biotech boom from 2014-2021, accelerated by COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic development, created substantial demand for PhD chemists in areas like process development, analytical chemistry, and formulation science.

**Geographic and Skillset Shifts**: The 2014-2024 period revealed that Lowe's analysis, while accurate for traditional chemistry employment pathways, missed emerging trends. The rise of computational chemistry, machine learning applications in drug discovery, and the growth of contract research organizations (CROs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) created new employment categories that weren't well-captured in 2014 data.

**Policy and Economic Factors**: Several major developments affected the landscape: the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act initially encouraged some pharmaceutical repatriation and investment, the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 boosted materials chemistry opportunities, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 created new incentives for green chemistry and sustainable manufacturing. These policy shifts created pockets of demand that weren't visible in 2014.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Matched Reality**:
- The continued weakness in academic job markets for chemistry PhDs
- The problematic nature of relying on STEM shortage narratives without addressing structural employment issues
- The oversupply of PhDs relative to traditional academic positions
- The persistence of postdoctoral positions as a holding pattern rather than a career step

**Predictions That Were Wrong or Incomplete**:
- Lowe's implicit assumption that industrial employment would follow similar patterns to academia proved incorrect. The 2014-2024 period saw significant growth in biotech, materials science, and computational chemistry roles that weren't adequately captured in the 2014 analysis.
- The article's focus on unemployment rates missed the more complex story of underemployment, skills mismatches, and geographic mobility. Many chemistry PhDs found employment in related fields (patent law, consulting, science writing, regulatory affairs) that weren't classified as "chemistry jobs" in traditional surveys.
- The analysis underestimated the impact of emerging technologies and industries. Fields like battery chemistry, nanomaterials, and synthetic biology created substantial demand that wasn't visible in 2014.
- Lowe's skepticism about the 2011-2012 uptick proved too pessimistic—these improvements continued and accelerated in certain sectors, particularly after 2016.

**Complex Outcomes**:
The most significant blind spot was the failure to anticipate how chemistry PhD skills would translate into adjacent fields. The rise of data science, the growth of the cannabis industry, regulatory chemistry for environmental compliance, and forensic chemistry all absorbed significant numbers of chemistry PhDs in ways that traditional employment surveys didn't capture.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4-5**

This article falls in the middle deciles of interest (40th-60th percentile) from our 2024 perspective, reflecting its mixed legacy as both prescient and limited.

**Strengths**: The article correctly identified fundamental structural problems in PhD training and employment that remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade. Lowe's skepticism toward corporate "shortage" narratives proved well-founded, as subsequent research showed that employer complaints often reflected unwillingness to pay market rates or invest in training rather than actual scarcity.

**Limitations**: The analysis suffered from several important blind spots that reduced its long-term relevance. It relied heavily on traditional employment categories that became increasingly obsolete as interdisciplinary work grew. The focus on snapshot unemployment data missed the more nuanced story of career trajectories, skills transferability, and the emergence of entirely new industries that value chemistry training.

**Historical Importance**: While not among the most impactful science policy articles of its era, this piece contributed to an important ongoing conversation about PhD overproduction, training reform, and the disconnect between educational supply and economic demand. Its critical perspective helped inform subsequent debates about graduate education reform, though ultimately the structural issues it identified persisted largely unchanged.

The article's moderate interest score reflects its accurate diagnosis of immediate problems combined with limited ability to anticipate the complex transformations that would reshape chemistry employment in the subsequent decade.
