# It Went Up Instead of Down (November 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a surprising discovery in RNA interference (RNAi) research, where a UCSF group found that certain small double-stranded RNAs could *stimulate* transcription of targeted genes rather than silencing them. The author notes that this finding was completely unexpected in a field that was just beginning to settle into established patterns. The mechanism wasn't fully understood at publication, though the researchers claimed to have identified rules about which genes would respond this way. The discovery threatened to complicate RNAi research significantly while potentially opening therapeutic possibilities for gene upregulation, which had previously been difficult to achieve.

## 2. HISTORY

This discovery marked the early characterization of what became known as **RNA activation (RNAa)**. Subsequent research confirmed that small double-stranded RNAs could indeed activate gene expression through mechanisms involving transcriptional regulation, rather than post-transcriptional silencing typical of RNAi.

In the years following, RNAa was shown to involve:
- **dsRNAs targeting gene promoters** (not coding sequences)
- Recruitment of **Argonaute proteins** to promoter regions
- Epigenetic modifications that **enhance transcription**
- Effects on **histone methylation patterns**

From a **commercial and therapeutic perspective**:
- While RNAi led to FDA-approved drugs (patisiran in 2018, inclisiran in 2021), **no RNAa-based therapies have reached clinical approval** as of 2025
- RNAa remains primarily a **research tool** rather than a therapeutic modality
- The technical challenges mentioned in the article proved prescient - delivery, specificity, and off-target effects remain significant hurdles
- Academic interest peaked around 2010-2015 but has since been **eclipsed by CRISPR-based activation systems** (CRISPRa) which offer more precise and robust gene activation

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions made in the article:**

• **"Open a door to some really unusual experiments"** - ✓ **Partially correct**. RNAa enabled novel experiments in promoter biology and transcriptional regulation, but adoption remained limited compared to other tools.

• **"Therapeutic possibilities"** - ✓ **Overly optimistic**. Despite theoretical potential, no practical therapies emerged from RNAa. CRISPRa has proven far more promising for therapeutic gene activation.

• **"Complicate the RNAi field a great deal"** - ✓ **Accurate**. RNAa added significant complexity to understanding small RNA functions and highlighted context-dependent effects of RNA molecules.

• **"Potential Nobel for the discoverers"** - ✗ **Did not materialize**. While interesting, RNAa didn't reach the transformative impact needed for Nobel recognition. The 2006 Nobel went to Fire and Mambo for RNAi itself.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captured an important moment when the simplistic view of RNAi was being complicated by counterintuitive findings. While RNAa didn't revolutionize medicine as hoped, it exemplified how scientific fields evolve through surprising discoveries that challenge established paradigms. The caution about therapeutic applications proved well-founded, making this a sober case study in biotechnology hype cycles.
