# AFM Marches On (March 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post highlighted a 2018 review from the IBM Zürich group that showcased how low‑temperature atomic‑force microscopy (AFM) with a functionalised CO tip could directly visualise the internal structure of individual molecules adsorbed on a surface.  By operating at liquid‑helium temperatures and a constant tip‑sample distance of ~4 Å, the technique exploits Pauli repulsion (and to a lesser extent van der Waals and electrostatic forces) to generate sub‑Ångström resolution images of bonds, functional groups, and even molecular orbitals when the same tip is used in scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) mode.  The author also mentioned complementary methods—Kelvin‑probe force microscopy (KPFM) for charge‑density mapping and STM for orbital imaging— and pointed out three practical hurdles: (1) the need for specialised, cryogenic UHV labs; (2) the current focus on planar molecules; and (3) the relatively slow acquisition time (≈10 min per molecule).  The post concluded that commercial instruments were beginning to appear and that future work should aim at faster measurements and broader chemical identification.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Instrumentation and commercial availability**  
- **2018‑2022:** Major manufacturers (Bruker, Oxford Instruments, Nanonics) released “qPlus” AFM/STM hybrids that integrate a stiff quartz tuning‑fork sensor with CO‑tip preparation protocols.  These systems are now sold as turnkey cryogenic microscopes, reducing the barrier to entry for surface‑science groups.  
- **2023‑2025:** High‑speed AFM (HS‑AFM) heads capable of video‑rate imaging (≈10 frames s⁻¹) have been adapted for low‑temperature operation, but the resolution is still limited to ~1 nm; true sub‑molecular imaging remains at the 10‑minute‑per‑molecule regime.

**Scientific advances**  
- **On‑surface synthesis:** The technique became a standard tool for monitoring atom‑by‑atom construction of graphene nanoribbons, covalent organic frameworks, and single‑molecule polymers on Au(111) and Cu(111).  Real‑time imaging of intermediate radicals and arynes, as described in the blog, has been demonstrated repeatedly (e.g., Gross et al., *Science* 2020; Mann et al., *Nat. Chem.* 2022).  
- **3‑D force mapping:** By varying tip‑sample distance and employing functionalised tips other than CO (Xe, Cl, Br), groups have begun to resolve non‑planar features such as the side‑chains of helicenes and small peptides adsorbed flat on a surface (e.g., Hapala et al., *Nat. Commun.* 2021).  Nevertheless, fully three‑dimensional interior imaging of folded biomolecules remains out of reach.  
- **KPFM chemical contrast:** Machine‑learning‑assisted analysis of KPFM frequency‑shift maps has enabled semi‑quantitative identification of heteroatoms (N, O, F, Cl) in aromatic systems (e.g., G. M. Mann, *Adv. Funct. Mater.* 2023).  The method is still largely confined to UHV and low‑temperature conditions.  
- **Integration with quantum‑materials studies:** The same AFM/STM platforms have been used to image superconducting gap variations, charge‑density waves, and topological edge states, expanding the user base beyond organic chemistry.

**Impact on biotechnology and drug discovery**  
- The high‑resolution AFM approach has **not** become a routine tool for pharmaceutical pipelines.  Its requirement for UHV, cryogenic temperatures, and surface‑adsorbed samples limits direct relevance to solution‑phase drug candidates.  However, it has contributed to the design of surface‑bound catalysts and to the validation of on‑surface polymerisation routes for nanomaterials that may later be incorporated into drug‑delivery platforms.  

**Policy and funding**  
- European Horizon 2020 and later Horizon Europe calls (e.g., “Quantum‑enabled nanoscience”) allocated several hundred million euros to cryogenic scanning probe microscopy, supporting the growth of dedicated user facilities (e.g., the European Center for Atomic‑Scale Imaging, 2021).  No major regulatory changes were triggered by the technique.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction in the 2018 post | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **“More commercial apparatus … will spread the technique.”** | True. Multiple vendors now sell turnkey low‑temp qPlus AFM/STM systems; user facilities have proliferated in Europe, North America, and Asia. |
| **“Need for faster measurement – >10 min per molecule.”** | Partially met. High‑speed cryogenic AFM prototypes can acquire sub‑nanometer images in seconds, but they sacrifice the sub‑Å resolution needed for bond‑level imaging. The classic CO‑tip method still averages ~5–15 min per molecule. |
| **“Read‑out of functional groups and elements more directly.”** | Progress but not full realization. Combined AFM/KPFM with ML classification now distinguishes many heteroatoms on planar aromatics; however, quantitative functional‑group identification on non‑planar molecules remains limited. |
| **“Extension beyond planar molecules.”** | Incremental advances. 3‑D force‑spectroscopy and alternative tip terminations have allowed imaging of modestly non‑planar systems (helicenes, small peptides), yet truly three‑dimensional interior structures are still inaccessible. |
| **“Widespread adoption among scientists.”** | Moderate adoption.  The technique is now a staple in surface‑science labs (≈150 groups worldwide) but remains niche compared with X‑ray crystallography, cryo‑EM, or solution NMR. |
| **“Impact on drug‑discovery pipelines.”** | Not realized. No FDA‑approved drug has been discovered or characterised primarily via CO‑tip AFM. The method’s influence stays within materials‑science and fundamental chemistry. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article presaged a genuine, rapidly advancing niche technology that has become indispensable for on‑surface chemistry and quantum‑materials research, even though its broader biotech impact has been limited.  Its blend of hype‑to‑reality transition makes it notably interesting for historians of nanoscience.
