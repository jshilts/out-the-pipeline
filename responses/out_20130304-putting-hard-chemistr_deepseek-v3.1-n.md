# Putting the (Hard) Chemistry Back in Med Chem (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses an editorial by Takashi Tsukamoto in *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* that questioned whether drug discovery was too narrowly focused on accessible regions of chemical space. Tsukamoto argued that medicinal chemistry had become overconcentrated on compounds targeting aminergic GPCRs and similar well-trodden areas, while potentially labeling other therapeutic targets as "undruggable" simply because the relevant chemical space remained unexplored.

The article highlights the concern that current medicinal chemistry practices favoring rapid compound generation through straightforward synthetic routes (like amide couplings and palladium chemistry) might miss entire classes of therapeutic opportunities. Using β-lactam antibiotics as a hypothetical example, Tsukamoto suggested that if penicillin-binding proteins were discovered today without prior knowledge of penicillin, they would likely be deemed undruggable. The author (Derek Lowe) endorsed this perspective while acknowledging the economic realities driving outsourcing and efficiency pressures in pharmaceutical research, and pointed to macrocycles as one example of unexplored chemical territory.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in 2013 proved prescient and helped catalyze meaningful changes in medicinal chemistry practices over the subsequent decade. Several concrete developments emerged:

**Exploration of Underexplored Chemical Space**: There has been significant investment in synthesizing and screening more diverse compound libraries, including macrocycles, fragments, and molecules with higher stereochemical complexity. Academic centers and some pharmaceutical companies established specialized groups focused on "difficult" chemistry.

**Protein-Protein Interaction Modulators**: Considerable progress has been made in developing small molecules that disrupt protein-protein interactions, which were once widely considered undruggable. While challenging, these efforts have produced clinical candidates and approved drugs, such as Venetoclax (a BCL-2 inhibitor), demonstrating that protein-protein interactions can be pharmacologically tractable with small molecules.

**Industrial Practices**: The industry has seen a partial shift away from purely portfolio-based, cost-driven outsourcing, with renewed recognition that complex synthesis capabilities represent a competitive advantage. However, significant consolidation and continued efficiency pressures have also accelerated further automation and AI-driven approaches.

**Regulatory Impact**: FDA and EMA have increasingly accepted drugs with non-traditional mechanisms and complex chemistry, provided they demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: That targets would continue to be incorrectly labeled "undruggable" without exploration of relevant chemical space.
  - **Outcome**: Successfully anticipated. There has been a broader recognition that "druggability" assessments should consider both target biology and available chemistry.

• **Prediction**: That current chemical space focused on aminergic GPCRs would prove limiting.
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. The field has greatly expanded beyond traditional GPCRs, with increased focus on previously difficult targets like transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and challenging extracellular interactions.

• **Prediction**: That macrocycles might represent important unexplored chemical space.
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Macrocycles have seen substantial development and several have reached clinical trials and approval.

• **Prediction**: That the trend toward simpler chemistry for rapid compound generation would continue without intervention.
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. Economic pressures have persisted, but recognition of complexity as a differentiator has grown, leading to more sophisticated approaches.

• **Prediction**: That outsourcing to lower-cost regions would continue unless Western researchers could offer specialized chemistry skills.
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. The market has evolved toward competitive advantage through specialized expertise rather than labor arbitrage alone.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article was insightful in identifying structural issues limiting drug discovery. While policy and practice have evolved since 2013, the core challenge of adequately exploring chemical space remains relevant.
