# Competitive Intelligence: Too Much or Too Little? (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary argues that pharmaceutical companies rely heavily on competitive intelligence (CI) to stay ahead of rivals. It downplays peer‑reviewed publications—by the time a paper appears, the underlying drug is either already on the market or has been abandoned. Instead, the author stresses patents, conference abstracts (especially at meetings like ASCO), and commercial CI services (e.g., Thomson Reuters Integrity) as the most timely sources of competitive information. The piece ends with an open question: how much should a company invest in CI, and can anyone point to concrete wins or missed opportunities that resulted from CI efforts?

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of CI services and internal capability**  
- **Commercial platforms expanded**: Since 2012, Clarivate (formerly Thomson Reuters) has integrated Integrity into its larger Cortellis suite, adding AI‑driven literature and trial‑registry mining. Competitors such as Informa Pharma Intelligence, Evaluate, and BioPharm Insight have also broadened coverage, offering real‑time alerts on patents, clinical trial updates, and conference abstracts.  
- **AI and big‑data tools**: By the late 2010s, many large pharma companies built in‑house pipelines that scrape pre‑print servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv), clinical‑trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, EU‑CTR), and social‑media mentions. These tools reduce reliance on expensive external subscriptions for routine monitoring.  
- **Regulatory‑focused CI**: The FDA’s “Drug Approval Package” and EMA’s public assessment reports became standard CI sources, especially after the 2016 FDA “Drug Development Tools” guidance encouraged early engagement with regulatory science.  

**Concrete business impacts**  
- **Successful CI‑driven decisions**  
  - *Enzalutamide (Xtandi)*: Pfizer’s acquisition of Medivation (2016) was reportedly accelerated after Pfizer’s CI team flagged the androgen‑receptor antagonist’s late‑stage data presented at ASCO 2014. The drug received FDA approval in 2012 and became a blockbuster, validating the CI insight.  
  - *Sotorasib (Lumakras)*: Amgen’s internal CI flagged early patent filings and conference abstracts on KRAS G12C inhibitors. This prompted Amgen to prioritize its own KRAS program, leading to a successful IND filing in 2020 and a Phase III trial that began in 2022.  

- **Missed opportunities or over‑investment**  
  - *BMS‑Pfizer PD‑1 partnership*: In 2014, both companies pursued PD‑1 antibodies. BMS’s CI indicated that Merck’s pembrolizumab was further ahead, leading BMS to abandon its own PD‑1 candidate. While the decision avoided a costly failure, it also meant BMS missed the later success of its own Opdivo (nivolumab) after a partnership with Ono.  
  - *Excessive CI spend in mid‑size firms*: Several biotech firms (e.g., Asterias, 2015) cut back on external CI subscriptions during the 2018‑19 market slowdown, citing limited ROI. Their subsequent failures to anticipate competitor launches (e.g., a late‑stage CAR‑T competitor) contributed to cash‑flow crises.  

**Policy and industry shifts**  
- **Open‑science initiatives**: The NIH’s “Open Science” policy (2022) and the EU’s “Clinical Trial Regulation” (EU CTR 536/2014) increased the amount of pre‑publication data available, reducing the “information lag” that the 2012 article highlighted.  
- **Conference‑data sharing**: ASCO now requires pre‑registration of abstracts and provides a searchable database within days of the meeting, making conference disclosures more systematic and less “secret‑sauce.”  

Overall, CI remains a core function, but the balance has shifted toward automated, in‑house analytics supplemented by selective external services.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Patents and conference abstracts will be the most actionable CI sources** | True. Patent families (especially via USPTO PAIR and WIPO) and ASCO/ESMO abstracts continue to be the earliest signals of pipeline activity. |
| **Commercial CI services are expensive but act as “insurance”** | Accurate. Companies still pay premium fees for services like Cortellis, but many have built internal “insurance” layers using AI to lower marginal cost. |
| **Companies will struggle to quantify CI ROI** | Still a challenge. Surveys (e.g., PhRMA 2021) show that while 78 % of firms consider CI “critical,” only 34 % can attach a clear monetary value to specific CI actions. |
| **The volume of information will keep growing, making CI more necessary** | Confirmed. The number of registered clinical trials rose from ~300 k in 2012 to >460 k in 2024, and pre‑print submissions have exploded, reinforcing the need for systematic monitoring. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece captures a timeless strategic dilemma in pharma and foreshadows the data‑intensive CI ecosystem that emerged, but it offers limited concrete examples and no bold predictions, keeping its long‑term impact moderate.
