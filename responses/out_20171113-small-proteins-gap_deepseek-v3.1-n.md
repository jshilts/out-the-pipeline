# Small Proteins: Into the Gap (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the emerging therapeutic space between small molecules and large biologics, focusing on engineered small proteins. It highlights camelid-derived single-domain antibodies (Nanobodies), shark antibodies, and recent advances in computationally designed proteins published in *Nature* (October 2017). The featured study demonstrated successful design of small proteins targeting influenza H1 hemagglutinin and botulinum toxin.

The key advantages highlighted include thermal stability (surviving 80°C for one hour), low immunogenicity in rodents, and potent intranasal efficacy—with influenza protection at doses 100-fold lower than conventional antibodies. The research employed Rosetta computational design, screening 17,000 proteins, and found that disulfide bond incorporation was crucial for protease resistance and stability. The author positioned this as early-stage work with significant future potential.

## 2. HISTORY

**Computational Protein Design:** The field has matured significantly since 2017. The Rosetta software mentioned has continued evolving, and structure prediction breakthroughs like AlphaFold2 (2020) revolutionized protein structure prediction and, subsequently, design capabilities. Protein design platforms now routinely generate functional proteins.

**Nanobody Platform Development:** The camelid-derived Nanobody platform has achieved clinical success. The first Nanobody drug, **caplacizumab** (approved by FDA in 2019 and EMA in 2018), treats acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Several other Nanobody therapeutics entered clinical trials targeting diverse indications including oncology, immunology, and rare diseases.

**Designed Small Proteins:** The specific influenza and botulinum protein binders discussed have not produced FDA-approved therapeutics as of 2024, and public information on their clinical advancement is limited. However, the broader category of engineered small proteins/peptides has seen notable developments. Prothena and others advanced designed proteins for diseases such as amyloidosis, though these often target larger disease mechanisms rather than infectious agents like influenza.

**Clinical Adaptation Challenges:** The article's emphasis on intranasal administration for influenza prefigures interest that expanded dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, but widespread adoption of intranasal protein therapeutics remains limited. Most therapeutic proteins still use systemic or established local delivery routes. Thermal stability advantages, while desirable, did not become decisive differentiators for most approved therapies.

**Business Outcomes:** Companies pursuing computational protein design have proliferated, including spin-outs from academic labs and dedicated biotech companies. Not all have achieved FDA-approved products, but the platform technologies themselves have become valuation drivers through partnerships and venture funding. Some initiatives were acquired or pivoted, while others expanded into diagnostics, materials, and non-therapeutic applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"We're going to get better at producing these proteins, designing them, and selecting them"**
  - Prediction broadly validated: Computational design methods improved dramatically, led by advances like AlphaFold, RFdiffusion, and sophisticated neural network-guided design pipelines.
  - Laboratory production and screening throughput also increased with automation and microfluidics.

• **"there could be some major opportunities out there"**
  - Mixed outcomes: The field grew in academic and commercial interest but did not displace conventional antibodies or small molecules at the predicted scale. Most therapeutics still fall into traditional categories. The success has been concentrated in certain niches rather than broad transformation.

• **Implicit prediction that demonstrated properties would enable new therapeutics**
  - Partial validation: Thermal stability and low immunogenicity proved valuable but not decisive for most successful therapies. The specific exponential potency (100-fold improvement) cited did not translate into fundamental advantages in clinical practice over other antibody formats for most indications.

• **Development momentum would accelerate rapidly**
  - Confirmed: Progress in computational design did accelerate significantly in subsequent years, enabling projects with speed and complexity previously unachievable.

• **Clinical translation of designed proteins against influenza and botulinum**
  - Limited success: No widely approved therapeutic emerged from the discussed targets, despite promising preclinical data. Broader adoption required more than compelling *in vitro* and animal data—manufacturing, clinical safety, and commercial viability proved harder hurdles.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article correctly highlighted a compelling technical development and emerging opportunity, accurately identifying design advances and stability advantages. However, its enthusiasm for rapid translation and broad disruption overlapped with the longer timelines and niche adoption small proteins actually experienced. The piece serves as a valuable snapshot of the field's early-stage promise without fully anticipating downstream challenges.
