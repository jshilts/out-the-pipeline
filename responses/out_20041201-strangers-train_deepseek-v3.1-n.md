# Strangers on a Train (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is not a biotechnology industry commentary article, but rather a brief personal reflection about how strangers react to different scientific professions during casual conversations. The author contrasts experiences as a medicinal chemist versus an organic chemist, noting that medicinal chemistry generates genuine curiosity and questions from people aboard trains/planes, even though most lack detailed knowledge of the field. 

In contrast, identifying as an organic chemist typically elicits negative reactions tied to unpleasant academic memories ("Organic chemistry! Man, I hated that!"). The article references two physics bloggers (Sean Carroll and Chad Orzel) and their differing experiences - Carroll finds people understand astronomy better than theoretical physics, while Orzel attracts "cranks" who challenge physics principles. The author concludes that at least organic chemistry doesn't breed the same kind of obsessive critics that physics seems to attract.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published as a blog post in December 2004, during the early years of science blogging when platforms like Blogger were popular venues for scientists to share personal experiences and build communities. The piece reflects a specific moment when academic scientists began using blogs to communicate both technical content and professional life experiences to broader audiences.

The trajectory since 2004 shows a significant evolution in how scientists engage with the public about their work:

- **Science Communication Growth**: The subsequent two decades saw explosive growth in science communication through blogs (2004-2012), social media platforms (Twitter's rise around 2009-2015), podcasts, and YouTube channels created by scientists
- **Public Engagement**: Institutions increasingly recognized public outreach as a professional responsibility, with funding agencies like NSF and NIH incorporating broader impacts criteria into grant requirements
- **Medicinal Chemistry Visibility**: Public awareness of drug discovery increased substantially due to high-profile drug approvals, pricing controversies, and the COVID-19 pandemic which highlighted pharmaceutical R&D processes
- **Science Blogging Evolution**: Many early science blogs (including referenced sites) either transitioned to other platforms, became less active, or evolved into more formal communication channels

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There were no explicit predictions about biotechnology industry developments, clinical outcomes, or business trajectories in this article. The content was purely observational and anecdotal, focused on immediate social interactions rather than future trends in science or medicine.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This article falls into the bottom decile of interest for biotechnology industry analysis. While it captures an authentic slice of scientific life from 2004, it contains no substantive commentary about biotechnology industry developments, drug discovery pipelines, clinical outcomes, or business trends relevant to the sector.
