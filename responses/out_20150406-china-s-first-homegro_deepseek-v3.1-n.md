# China's First Homegrown Pharma (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Chidamide (brand name Epidaza), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor developed by Shenzhen Chipscreen, which became the first homegrown small molecule drug discovery and development effort to achieve regulatory approval in China. The founder Xian-Ping Lu returned to China in the early 2000s after working at Galderma, building this compound through start-to-finish development.

The article provides important context about HDAC inhibitors as a drug class - the fourth to gain regulatory approval, representing the first class targeting epigenetic signaling, but facing "HDAC inhibitor fatigue" due to limited efficacy in most solid tumors. Three key implications are discussed: (1) China joining the short list of countries capable of complete small molecule drug development, (2) Chidamide's reported $70 million development cost (roughly 10% of typical US/EU costs, likely driven by cheaper clinical trials), and (3) the question of whether Chinese companies would seek global approval and whether China would become a regulatory backwater or integrate with global markets like the US, EU, and Japan.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 article, several concrete developments occurred:

**Regulatory Approvals**: Chidamide gained conditional approval in China in December 2014 for relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), then full approval in 2017, expanding to include indications for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer in combination with exemestane in 2019.

**Clinical Expansion**: The drug demonstrated efficacy in specific malignancies, but HDAC inhibitors broadly did not experience dramatic expansion into solid tumors as was originally hoped. The drug class remained relatively specialized, primarily used in hematological cancers and certain combination therapies.

**Market Performance**: Chipscreen pursued both domestic and international expansion, though global regulatory approval outside China was more limited than the article hoped. The company aimed for FDA approval but faced the typical regulatory hurdles of getting Chinese-developed drugs accepted in Western markets.

**HDAC Inhibitor Class Overall**: The broader HDAC inhibitor landscape saw continued but measured development. After 2015, the class remained "minor players" as predicted, with most approvals in hematological cancers (CTCL, PTCL) rather than broad solid tumor applications.

**Chinese Pharma Industry**: Chidamide indeed served as a milestone, but subsequent years showed mixed progress in China's drug innovation ecosystem - while more domestically discovered drugs emerged, regulatory differences and international acceptance remained ongoing challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **HDAC inhibitors remaining specialized**: ✓ Correct. The article's assessment that HDAC compounds "can drive limited re-expression of silenced genes in some cancers" but would remain "minor players in the oncology world" proved accurate. Chidamide found use in specific indications (PTCL, breast cancer combinations) but did not revolutionize broad cancer treatment, and the HDAC class generally remained confined to hematological malignancies.

• **Regulatory harmonization with global markets**: Partially correct directionally, but overly optimistic. The article's hope that "China becomes another market like the US, EU and Japan" where compounds flow across jurisdictions saw some progress but significant friction remained. Chinese companies faced the "tipping the scales" concern raised - integration was more gradual than the hoped-for seamless reciprocal approval system.

• **Cost advantage driving broader Chinese clinical trial migration**: ✗ Overstated. The $70 million development cost (10% of Western equivalents) did not lead to the predicted widespread migration of multinational pharma clinical trials to China at that scale. While cost advantages existed, regulatory, data quality, and IP protection concerns limited the "swarming" effect predicted if 90% savings were truly achievable.

• **Chinese pharma continues developing innovative drugs**: ✓ Correct. The prediction that "if the drug industry there continues to develop" came true - this was indeed just the first of several domestically discovered Chinese drugs, validating the article's positive long-term outlook on Chinese pharmaceutical innovation.

• **Chidamide as starting point for Chinese innovation**: ✓ Correct. The implied prediction that "the first to do it in China" would matter proved accurate - it did indeed mark the start of increased Chinese drug development capabilities, a prediction the article's statement "something that no one can take away from them" captured clearly.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article scores highly for correctly identifying the HDAC inhibitor class trajectory (they indeed remained specialized) and raising prescient questions about Chinese regulatory integration and cost advantages that proved nuanced. Lower than top decile because the broader HDAC field didn't fundamentally change oncology practice as dramatically as some hoped, and China's global pharmaceutical integration remains ongoing rather than achieving the seamless regulatory compatibility envisioned.
