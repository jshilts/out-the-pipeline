# Rule of Ten? (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a "Rule of 10" guideline for orally available macrocycles that was presented at an ACS meeting in San Francisco. The proposed rule suggested three criteria: macrocycle ring size greater than 10 atoms, molecular weight under 1000, and cLogP (calculated lipophilicity) around 10. The author expresses skepticism about this rule, noting that even compounds meeting these criteria likely have poor oral bioavailability. The article references the complex role of internal hydrogen bonding in macrocycles, which was not well understood at the time, and argues that the percentage of compounds actually achieving oral activity under this rule would be much smaller than those meeting Lipinski's Rule of Five.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 article, macrocycles have continued to evolve as an important but challenging class of therapeutic compounds. The field has seen both continued research interest and pragmatic recognition of the difficulties involved in oral macrocycle development. In the subsequent decade, several macrocyclic drugs have been approved by the FDA and reached the market, though many of these are administered via injection rather than oral delivery.

Cyclosporine and tacrolimus remained the classic examples of orally available macrocycles, but their success has proved difficult to replicate. Newer macrocycles that achieved clinical success and FDA approval include the hepatitis C drug glecaprevir (2017), various antibiotic classes, and some cancer therapeutics. However, the prediction of oral bioavailability in macrocycles largely depends on empirical testing and structural optimization rather than simple rule-based approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction that the "Rule of 10" would have poor success rates**: This prediction proved accurate. The Rule of 10 did not gain widespread adoption as a primary screening tool for macrocycle oral bioavailability.

- **Prediction that oral macrocycle development would remain challenging**: The tendency was correct. Oral delivery has remained a significant hurdle for macrocycle drugs, with most approved macrocycles requiring injection or having limited oral bioavailability.

- **Implicit prediction about the complexity of hydrogen bonding in macrocycles**: The complexity of macrocycle conformational dynamics and intramolecular interactions has indeed remained a challenge for computational prediction and rational design, though our understanding has improved modestly since 2014.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article offers a minor critique of an obscure predictive rule for macrocycles, addressing a niche topic with limited broader scientific significance or long-term impact.
