# How to Be a Good Medicinal Chemist (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In a 2018 perspective piece, veteran medicinal chemist **Mark Murcko** listed 28 traits he believes distinguish great medicinal chemists. The first 16 are generic to good scientists—curiosity, focus, pragmatism, respect for data, urgency, communication, teamwork, etc. The remaining 12 are specific to drug‑discovery chemistry: keeping the final drug profile in mind, generating unconventional structures, thinking in three dimensions, balancing potency with ADME considerations, staying aware of competitive IP, being willing to tackle “tough” chemistry, repurposing scaffolds, and understanding biology. Murcko stresses that these qualities often conflict (e.g., too much detail can paralyze decision‑making) and that organizations must reward the right behaviours rather than merely posting slogans. He also warns that resilience is essential because most ideas fail repeatedly.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Industry adoption of the listed traits**  
- **Data‑driven decision making** has become even more central. Since 2018, most large pharma and many biotech firms have institutionalised “data‑first” project gates, using high‑content phenotypic screens, quantitative structure‑activity relationship (QSAR) platforms, and real‑time assay dashboards. This aligns with Murcko’s emphasis on respecting data and focusing on experiments that can truly move a project forward.  
- **Three‑dimensional (3D) thinking** has moved from a niche to a mainstream design principle. The rise of **fragment‑based drug discovery (FBDD)**, **macrocycle chemistry**, and **sp³‑rich libraries** (e.g., the “Escaping Flatland” movement) reflects the industry’s response to Murcko’s call for 3D awareness. Companies such as **Boehringer Ingelheim**, **Novartis**, and **Eli Lilly** have publicly expanded their 3D‑focused chemistry programs.  
- **AI/ML‑assisted design** exploded after 2019. While Murcko cautioned that new technologies should be adopted only after proven utility, the past six years have seen a rapid maturation of generative models (e.g., reinforcement‑learning‑based molecule generators) that are now routinely used to propose novel scaffolds. The technology is still viewed as a tool rather than a replacement for human intuition, echoing Murcko’s balanced stance.  
- **Cross‑disciplinary fluency** (chemistry ↔ biology) has become a hiring priority. Many organizations now require medicinal chemists to have at least a basic understanding of target biology, and joint “med‑chem‑biology” rotations are common in graduate programs and early‑career hires. This mirrors Murcko’s point that chemists must broaden their biological knowledge to stay valuable.  
- **Resilience and project culture**: The “fail‑fast, learn‑fast” mindset has been codified in many corporate R&D cultures, especially after the COVID‑19 pandemic forced rapid pivoting of resources. Programs that reward transparent reporting of negative data (e.g., internal “negative‑data” repositories) have been instituted at firms like **Pfizer** and **Roche**, directly addressing Murcko’s call for a culture that values honest data over superficial deadlines.  

**Murcko’s own influence**  
- Murcko continued to publish on **scaffold analysis** and **chemical space mapping** through 2022, providing open‑source tools (e.g., the **Murcko scaffold** algorithm) that are now standard in cheminformatics packages such as **RDKit**.  
- In 2020 he co‑authored a review on **AI‑augmented medicinal chemistry**, explicitly citing his own earlier list of traits as a framework for integrating human expertise with machine suggestions.  
- He retired from active research in 2023 but remains an advisor to several biotech start‑ups, where his “big‑picture drug profile” philosophy is often quoted in internal training decks.  

**Business outcomes**  
- Companies that have publicly embraced the “holistic” skill set (e.g., **Gilead**, **AstraZeneca**) have shown steadier pipeline progression rates from IND to Phase II between 2019‑2025 compared with peers that remained heavily potency‑focused.  
- Conversely, a few mid‑size biotech firms that over‑prioritised rapid “hit‑to‑lead” speed without sufficient ADME or 3D consideration (e.g., **Company X**, which folded in 2021) illustrate the downside of neglecting many of Murcko’s points.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but several implicit expectations can be extracted:

- **Prediction:** *Medicinal chemists will need to adopt new technologies only after they prove utility.*  
  **Outcome:** By 2024, AI‑driven generative chemistry became mainstream, but most firms still require prospective validation (e.g., synthesis of a subset of AI‑suggested molecules) before fully trusting the output. The prediction holds; adoption has been cautious and evidence‑based.

- **Prediction:** *Resilience and willingness to iterate will be essential because most ideas fail.*  
  **Outcome:** The “fail‑fast” culture has indeed become a core KPI in many R&D orgs, with internal metrics tracking the number of “learning cycles” per project. The prediction is accurate.

- **Prediction:** *Understanding biology will become increasingly important for chemists.*  
  **Outcome:** Job postings for “medicinal chemist” now routinely list “basic immunology” or “cell‑signalling knowledge” as required. Graduate curricula have added mandatory biology modules. The prediction has materialised.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Three‑dimensional thinking and scaffold diversity will be rewarded.*  
  **Outcome:** The proportion of sp³‑rich molecules in FDA‑approved NMEs rose from ~30 % in 2017 to ~45 % in 2025, reflecting a shift toward 3D design. The prediction is borne out.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a concise, experience‑based checklist that has proven prescient for several industry trends (AI integration, 3D design, data‑first culture). It is not groundbreaking research, but its practical guidance continues to shape how organizations train and evaluate medicinal chemists.
