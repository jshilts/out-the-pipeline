# Article Analysis: How Can There Be a Shortage of Scientists And An Excess At The Same Time? (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary article explores the apparent paradox of simultaneous claims about both a shortage and an excess of qualified scientists and technical workers in the U.S. The author examines competing narratives about workforce availability, focusing particularly on PriceWaterhouseCooper reports that highlight difficulties in hiring qualified candidates. The article draws heavily on research from Peter Cappelli of Wharton School, who argues that employers themselves bear significant responsibility for hiring difficulties through overly rigid job specifications and unrealistic expectations. Cappelli identifies a "Home Depot" approach to hiring where companies seek perfect-fit candidates rather than investing in training. The article also connects these hiring practices to debates around H1B visa policies, suggesting that some employers may advocate for increased technical immigration not out of genuine shortage but to access cheaper labor with greater management leverage. The analysis extends beyond Silicon Valley IT to acknowledge similar dynamics in the biopharma industry.

## 2. HISTORY
Recent empirical evidence broadly validates the article's central thesis. Subsequent studies by organizations including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Economic Policy Institute consistently showed through 2013-2023 that the "STEM shortage" narrative was largely unsupported by data, with many fields showing what researchers termed a "STEM glut." The H1B visa dynamics described in the article became even more pronounced. Major tech companies faced lawsuits and investigations over alleged anti-poaching agreements and preferential hiring of H1B workers. For example, Disney and Southern California Edison both faced controversy in 2014-2015 when they laid off American IT workers while hiring H1B visa holders, leading to Department of Justice scrutiny. The biopharma sector experienced similar pressures. NIH data through 2019 showed a steady increase in biomedical PhDs awarded while tenure-track positions remained stagnant, creating intense competition. Notable companies like Novartis, Pfizer, and GSK continued significant outsourcing and workforce restructuring throughout 2013-2020. The COVID-19 pandemic created some new opportunities in vaccine development and therapeutics, but these were generally temporary and did not fundamentally alter the structural oversupply of trained scientists for available research positions. Salary analyses published in journals like Science and Nature throughout 2013-2023 confirmed that real wages for many scientific positions, particularly in academic research and postdoctoral roles, stagnated or declined in purchasing power, supporting the article's hypothesis about employer incentives to control labor costs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: The "Home Depot" approach to hiring (seeking perfect-fit candidates rather than investing in training) would continue to cause hiring difficulties. **Outcome**: This trend intensified significantly. By 2018-2023, studies by LinkedIn and Harvard Business School showed employers had increased degree requirements and job specifications even for entry-level positions. The average number of skills listed in job postings increased substantially, with automated screening systems becoming more pervasive.
• **Prediction**: Claims of workforce shortages would continue to be used to justify policy changes benefiting employers and controlling wages. **Outcome**: This proved accurate. Throughout 2013-2023, industry associations including the Chamber of Commerce, TechNet, and biotech organizations consistently advocated for expanded H1B visa programs while evidence contradicted widespread shortages. Multiple think tank reports documented systematic underemployment among STEM graduates.
• **Prediction**: The biopharma industry would remain susceptible to the same workforce dynamics and wouldn't fundamentally differ from IT sector trends. **Outcome**: Confirmed. Industry analyses by organizations including the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists consistently documented high competition for limited research positions, increasing reliance on contract research organizations, and stagnant wage growth adjusted for inflation for many scientific roles.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**
The article provides enduringly relevant analysis of systemic labor market dynamics that continued through the following decade. Its insights proved prescient regarding actual workforce data and policy debates, connecting hiring practices to broader economic incentives in a way that remained empirically supportable.
