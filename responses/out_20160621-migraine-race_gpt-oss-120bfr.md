# The Migraine Race (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article highlighted the Phase III results of **erenumab**, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the calcitonin‑gene‑related peptide (CGRP) receptor. Developed jointly by Amgen and Novartis, the trial enrolled chronic‑migraine patients (≈18 migraine days/month at baseline). The drug reduced migraine days by **6.6 days/month** versus **4.2 days/month** for placebo—a statistically significant but modest absolute difference. The author pointed out the unusually large placebo effect, questioned the clinical relevance of a ~2‑day net benefit, and noted that insurance payers might be reluctant to cover an expensive biologic when cheaper “placebo‑like” options exist. The piece also warned that further data—especially in episodic migraine—were needed before the field could be settled.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory approvals**  
* **2018** – The chronic‑migraine data (Study NCT02629861) and a separate episodic‑migraine trial (STRIVE, NCT03235479) supported FDA approval of erenumab under the brand **Aimovig** (Novartis). The European Medicines Agency approved it the same year.  
* **2022** – Amgen bought Novartis’s 50 % stake in Aimovig for ≈ $2.5 bn, making Amgen the sole commercial owner.

**Commercial uptake**  
* Aimovig quickly became a top‑selling migraine therapy, reaching **≈ $2 bn in global sales by 2023**.  
* Payer coverage is now routine in the U.S. and Europe, but most plans require prior authorization and often limit the number of doses per year.  
* Real‑world studies (e.g., 2020‑2022 registry data) confirm an average **≈ 3‑4 day/month** reduction in chronic migraine patients, slightly lower than the pivotal trial but still clinically meaningful for many sufferers.

**Safety & long‑term data**  
* The most common adverse event is **constipation** (≈ 5‑7 % of users), with rare reports of hypertension and hypersensitivity.  
* Post‑marketing surveillance (2020‑2024) has not revealed any unexpected safety signals; long‑term (5‑year) extension studies show sustained efficacy and tolerability.

**Competitive landscape**  
* **Fremanezumab** (Ajovy, Teva/Allergan) – FDA approved 2018; targets the CGRP ligand rather than the receptor.  
* **Galcanezumab** (Emgality, Eli Lilly) – FDA approved 2018; also ligand‑targeting.  
* **Eptinezumab** (Vyepti, Pfizer) – FDA approved 2020; administered intravenously.  
* Small‑molecule CGRP antagonists (rimegepant, ubrogepant) received FDA approval in 2020, offering oral alternatives.  

All four antibody products have achieved multi‑billion‑dollar sales collectively, confirming that the CGRP pathway was indeed a “big market” and that the initial modest placebo‑adjusted effect did not prevent commercial success.

**Policy & practice impact**  
* The FDA’s 2018 approval of the first CGRP‑targeting mAb set a precedent for accelerated pathways for biologics in neurology.  
* Clinical guidelines (American Headache Society, 2021 update) now list CGRP antibodies as **Level A** preventive options for both chronic and episodic migraine after failure of ≥2 oral preventives.  
* Insurance formularies have gradually incorporated these agents, though cost‑containment measures (step therapy, dose caps) remain common.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Erenumab’s modest net benefit might be insufficient to convince payers** | Initial skepticism existed, but after FDA approval and real‑world data showing consistent benefit, most major payers now cover Aimovig (often with prior‑auth). |
| **Further data in episodic migraine were needed before the field could be settled** | The STRIVE trial (episodic migraine) demonstrated a 3.7‑day vs 1.8‑day reduction, leading to FDA approval for that indication in 2018. |
| **Other Phase III players could change the competitive picture** | Within two years, three additional CGRP antibodies (fremanezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab) received approval, creating a crowded market as anticipated. |
| **Placebo response would remain a major hurdle** | Placebo reductions of ~3‑4 days/month persist in migraine trials, confirming the article’s observation of a strong placebo effect. |
| **Low‑cost “pretzel” alternatives might dominate** | Oral CGRP antagonists (rimegepant, ubrogepant) entered the market in 2020, offering cheaper, non‑injectable options, but they are used mainly for acute treatment; preventive antibodies remain the dominant biologic class. |

Overall, the article’s cautious tone was justified regarding the need for more data, but it underestimated the eventual commercial viability of CGRP‑targeting antibodies.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment before the first CGRP antibody reached the market; its discussion of placebo effects and payer concerns remains relevant, and the subsequent industry transformation validates its relevance.
