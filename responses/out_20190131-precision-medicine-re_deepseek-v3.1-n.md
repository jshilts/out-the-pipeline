# Precision Medicine Real Soon Now (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critically examines the gap between the ambitious predictions made for precision medicine and the actual reality nearly two decades after the Human Genome Project. It references a JCI perspective that argues the foundational assumptions of precision medicine—that incorporating human genome information as the dominant factor would lead to marked improvements in human health—were unsound.

The critique centers on several key points: despite expectations that genetic variants would explain common diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's, researchers found complex polygenic contributions explaining only fractions of disease risk, with environmental and developmental factors playing substantial roles. Cancer genomics faced particular challenges due to tumor heterogeneity and genomic instability, making targeted personalized treatments more elusive than anticipated. While the article acknowledges progress such as tissue-agnostic drug approvals (larotrectinib and pembrolizumab in 2018), it argues these represent limited success compared to the "complete transformation" predicted by Francis Collins in 1999 for 2010.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2019 article, precision medicine continued evolving with notable mixed outcomes:

**Cancer Genomics Advancements**: Tissue-agnostic approvals accelerated with drugs like entrectinib (2019) joining larotrectinib and pembrolizumab, mostly targeting NTRK fusions and MSI-H/dMMR biomarkers. Liquid biopsy technologies gained clinical adoption for monitoring, though implementation costs and accessibility remained challenging. Comprehensive genomic profiling became more routine in academic cancer centers, but community oncology adoption was slower due to costs, turnaround times, and unclear clinical utility for many findings.

**Real-World Evidence**: Large-scale studies confirmed the article's concerns about limited predictive power for complex diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) continued identifying hundreds of variants with minimal individual effect sizes for conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Polygenic risk scores showed modest discrimination but limited clinical utility for most common diseases, prompting calls for more research into gene-environment interactions.

**COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic unexpectedly advanced precision medicine capabilities through viral genome sequencing and variant tracking, demonstrating how rapid genomic approaches could inform public health when applied to infectious diseases. However, it also revealed infrastructure limitations for deploying personalized medicine approaches at population scale.

**Regulatory Landscape**: The FDA continued approving companion diagnostics and expanding biomarker-guided therapies, but concerns grew about ensuring equitable access and preventing precision medicine from exacerbating health disparities. The proportion of oncology trials incorporating biomarker selection increased substantially.

**Consumer Genomics**: Companies like 23andMe and Ancestry maintained popularity for ancestry services, but health prediction offerings faced increased regulatory scrutiny and growing recognition of limitations, including false positives/negatives and limited actionable information for most users.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Complete transformation in therapeutic medicine" by 2010-2020**: The article accurately identified this as unrealistic. By 2024, precision medicine had achieved niche successes (especially tissue-agnostic cancer drugs and rare disease genomics) but fell far short of transforming broad therapeutic practice, confirming this article's skepticism. Most drug development still proceeds through traditional mechanisms.

• **Genetic variants explaining common diseases**: The article correctly predicted limited success here. While thousands of genetic associations have been identified, their cumulative predictive power for diseases like diabetes, Alzheimer's, or cardiovascular disease remains modest, with environmental and lifestyle factors continuing to dominate risk prediction.

• **Tumor sequencing enabling personalized cancer treatment**: This has shown partial but limited success. While comprehensive genomic profiling now guides therapy selection for subsets of patients (10-15% in many solid tumors), most patients either lack actionable alterations or receive standard-of-care therapies. The article's concerns about tumor heterogeneity and genomic instability proved well-founded, with drug resistance and clonal evolution remaining major challenges.

• **Consumer genetic testing for health prediction**: The article's skepticism proved largely accurate. Despite massive growth in direct-to-consumer testing, the clinical utility of most health reports remains limited beyond carrier screening and a few validated pharmacogenomic markers, with concerns about interpretation, counseling needs, and potential for unnecessary follow-up.

• **Healthcare system transformation through genomics**: The biomedical research community's focus on genomics continued intensely post-2019, but healthcare delivery transformation was slower than predicted. Electronic health record integration, provider education, and infrastructure for genomic medicine all progressed more gradually than genomic technology itself.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional foresight in identifying fundamental challenges facing precision medicine that remained relevant years later. Its balanced critique of both scientific limitations and overhyped expectations proved remarkably prescient, with the mixed progress in cancer genomics, limited predictive power for complex diseases, and continued gap between genomic capability and clinical implementation all validating its assessment.
