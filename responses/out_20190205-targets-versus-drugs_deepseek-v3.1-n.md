# Targets Versus Drugs
## February 2019

### 1. SUMMARY
This article argues strongly against the misconception held by some academics that discovering a new biological target or pathway is equivalent to discovering a new drug, with the remainder of drug development being mere "technicalities." Using the story of COX-2 inhibitors as a central case study, the author explains how this view is fundamentally wrong both scientifically and legally.

The piece traces the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors, beginning with the long scientific journey from aspirin's introduction in 1899 to the understanding in 1971 that it works by inhibiting COX enzymes, followed by the discovery of COX-2 in 1991. This led to efforts to create "aspirin 2.0" that could provide anti-inflammatory benefits without gastrointestinal side effects. The article focuses on a patent dispute between the University of Rochester (which filed a patent on a method for distinguishing selective COX-2 inhibitors) and Pfizer (marketer of celecoxib/Celebrex), where the court ruled that Rochester's patent, which described an assay method but did not disclose actual pharmaceutical compounds, failed to meet patent law's written description and enablement requirements. The broader point is that drug development requires much more than identifying a drug target - it involves discovering and characterizing specific compounds, ensuring safe dosing, scalability, stability, and meeting exacting legal standards for patentability.

### 2. HISTORY

The article articulates an enduring principle of drug development that has remained relevant since its publication. The core argument - that identifying a drug target is fundamentally different from having a viable drug - has been reinforced by numerous subsequent developments:

**Ongoing Drug Development Challenges:** The high failure rate of drug candidates, particularly those entering clinical trials, demonstrates that target identification remains the beginning rather than the end of the process. Statistics consistently show that even with validated targets, attrition rates remain high due to issues with pharmacokinetics, toxicity, efficacy signals that don't translate from animal models to humans, and manufacturing challenges.

**COVID-19 Impact:** The urgent development of drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 highlighted the difficulties of the "target-to-drug" pipeline. Despite rapid identification of the ACE2 receptor as the viral entry mechanism and various viral proteins as targets, only a limited number of therapeutic compounds achieved widespread clinical use, and many promising candidates failed.

**Recent High-Profile Failures:** Several highly anticipated drug candidates targeting promising pathways have failed in recent years, reinforcing that target validation is just one step.

### 3. PREDICTIONS

• **No specific forward-looking predictions appear** in the article about what would happen after 2019. The piece is primarily an ex-post analysis and argumentation about established principles, using historical examples rather than making predictions about the future. The author's focus is on explaining why a common misperception in academic circles is wrong, rather than forecasting future industry trends.

• **Implicit in the argument** is that the scientific and legal distinction between drug targets and actual drugs will and should persist. This has indeed remained true - regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) continue to require extensive characterization of specific compounds, and the patent system continues to demand enablement and written description of specific compounds rather than merely functions or targets.

• **The underlying principle expressed** - that the path from target to drug is long and failure-prone - has been consistently validated by drug development outcomes in recent years across multiple therapeutic areas.

### 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This article is highly relevant in exposing a persistent misconception that affects research priorities, funding decisions, and public understanding of drug development. The court case example provides concrete legal precedent for a fundamental scientific principle that has ongoing importance, making it valuable beyond just the specific COX-2 story.
