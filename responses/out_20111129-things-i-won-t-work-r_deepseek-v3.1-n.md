# Things I Won't Work With: Reader Request (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a call for reader submissions to expand a popular blog series titled "Things I Won't Work With" by chemist Derek Lowe, who writes the "In the Pipeline" blog hosted by Science magazine. Lowe was compiling a revised and expanded Kindle e-book collection featuring dangerous, explosive, toxic, and foul-smelling chemicals that prudent chemists avoid. The series was known for its entertaining and educational descriptions of hazardous substances. Lowe solicited suggestions from readers for additional dangerous compounds to include in future blog entries and the upcoming e-book, seeking the "unpredictably explosive, alarmingly toxic, overwhelmingly stinky stuff that everyone with any sense avoids on sight."

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2011 reader request, Derek Lowe's "Things I Won't Work With" series continued to be published on his Science magazine blog through the 2010s and remains active. The series became one of the most popular and enduring chemistry blog features, generating extensive discussion and reader engagement. 

Lowe did publish the revised e-book as planned, making it available on Kindle and other platforms, fulfilling his stated intention. The series expanded significantly beyond the original entries, with dozens of additional dangerous compounds profiled in his signature humorous but informative style, covering substances like azidoazide azides, chlorine trifluoride, dimethylmercury, and various nerve agents.

The blog series maintained its relevance and readership throughout the subsequent decade, with Lowe continuing to publish new entries regularly. His "In the Pipeline" blog became one of the most influential and widely-read chemistry blogs, covering pharmaceutical research, chemistry news, and scientific commentary. The series' popularity demonstrated the enduring public and professional interest in both chemical safety education and entertaining science writing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several specific predictions and commitments:
- **"I hope to release first as a Kindle e-book (with other platforms following close behind)"** - ✓ **CORRECT**. Lowe did publish the expanded e-book collection as planned.

- **"I'm throwing in some bonus chapters that haven't appeared on the blog yet"** - ✓ **CORRECT**. Additional unpublished content was included in the e-book.
- **"I'd like to expand the list, both for the e-book and for future blog entries"** - ✓ **CORRECT**. The series continued with many new entries published after 2011.
- Implied commitment to continue the series with reader suggestions - ✓ **CORRECT**. He continued publishing new entries based on reader submissions and his own research.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8/10**

This article represents a successful, long-running science communication initiative that delivered on its promises and maintained relevance for over a decade. The series' enduring popularity and the successful e-book publication demonstrate effective science outreach, though its impact is primarily within scientific and chemistry-enthusiast communities rather than broader society.
