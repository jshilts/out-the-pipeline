# Analysis of "Changing A Broken Science System" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 blog post by Derek Lowe discusses a proposal from prominent biomedical researchers to fundamentally reform the academic research system in the United States. The authors argued that biomedical research was on an "unsustainable path" due to a fundamental mismatch between research funding availability and the growing number of scientists competing for those funds. They traced this back to post-WWII expansion assumptions that no longer held true, particularly after the 2003 NIH budget doubling ended and was followed by budget cuts.

The central problem identified was similar to induced demand in highway engineering—increased NIH funding simply attracted more researchers without solving the structural imbalance. The system was described as "Malthusian," producing far more PhD students and postdocs than could be absorbed into academic, government, or industry positions. This created intensifying competition for grants that rewarded conservative, short-term thinking over high-risk fundamental research, while also favoring "translational research" with obvious medical connections over broader basic science.

The article outlines eleven specific reforms proposed by the authors, including reducing PhD student numbers, increasing postdoc salaries, shifting toward longer-term funding mechanisms like Howard Hughes-style awards, capping total funding per research group, reevaluating review processes, and reforming the indirect cost recovery system that provided perverse incentives for universities to maximize grant overhead.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this article's publication, the structural problems identified have largely persisted or worsened, but meaningful systemic reform has been limited:

**Funding Trends**: NIH funding saw modest increases but never returned to the dramatic growth of the 1998-2003 doubling period. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) provided some additional funding, but overall federal research support remained constrained. The system continued facing boom-bust cycles tied to political budget battles.

**Workforce Issues**: The hyper-competition for academic positions intensified rather than eased. Postdoc numbers remained high, and the transition to independent positions became even more difficult. While some institutions experimented with staff scientist positions, the "pyramid scheme" structure largely persisted.

**Reform Attempts**: Some of the proposed changes gained traction, but implementation was partial and slow:
- NIH did introduce some longer-term funding mechanisms and increased high-risk/high-reward programs
- Postdoc salaries gradually increased due to NIH minimum salary guidelines
- Review processes somewhat broadened, but quantitative metrics (publication counts, impact factors) remained dominant
- Indirect cost reform proved politically difficult due to university resistance

**Unforeseen Developments**: The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily shifted funding priorities dramatically toward virology and vaccine research, demonstrating both the system's responsiveness to crisis and its tendency toward bandwagons. Additionally, the rise of alternative career paths in data science, biotech startups, and science communication accelerated, partly addressing the "too many scientists" problem but also representing talent leakage from traditional academic research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions**:
- **Persistent structural problems**: The fundamental mismatch between scientist supply and academic position availability indeed continued and in some cases worsened
- **Increased competition**: The hyper-competitive environment for grants and positions has become even more intense, particularly for early-career researchers
- **Translational research emphasis**: The focus on obviously "applicable" research has persisted and in some cases strengthened, with NIH continuing to prioritize translational programs
- **Training grant shift**: There has been some movement toward supporting graduate students through training grants rather than research grants, though not as extensively as proposed

**Incorrect or Overstated Predictions**:
- **Systemic collapse timeline**: While the system remains "unsustainable," it hasn't fundamentally broken down in the dramatic way some 2014 predictions suggested—it has proven more resilient (or stagnant) than anticipated
- **Rapid reform adoption**: The authors' proposed multi-year phase-in of reforms has not occurred at anything close to the anticipated scale or pace
- **Foreign student impacts**: While foreign students continued to enter the system, changes in visa policies and improved research opportunities in other countries have somewhat moderated this dynamic

**Mixed Outcomes**:
- **Funding predictability**: NIH has made some efforts toward more stable, longer-term budgeting, but the system remains subject to political budget cycles
- **Postdoc salaries**: Increases have been gradual rather than the more dramatic changes proposed
- **High-risk research**: Programs like the NIH Director's Pioneer Awards have grown, but still represent a small fraction of overall funding

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 7/9**

This article warrants a high interest score (7) because it identified structural problems in biomedical research that remain highly relevant today. While not achieving the top tier of interest (8-9) reserved for groundbreaking scientific discoveries or revolutionary technological advances, it represents an important and prescient critique of how research systems function.

The article is in the 70th-79th percentile of interest because:

- **Persistent relevance**: The problems described—hyper-competition, training bottlenecks, inadequate support for high-risk research—remain pressing issues in 2024
- **Systemic analysis**: It provides a coherent framework for understanding structural rather than individual-failure explanations for career difficulties in science
- **Policy implications**: The reform proposals continue to inform discussions about research system redesign
- **Predictive value**: Many of the described trends continued or accelerated, validating the analysis

However, it falls short of the highest tier because:
- It addresses system administration rather than fundamental scientific discovery
- The pace of actual reform has been slower than the urgency suggested
- Some aspects (like the precise balance of basic vs. translational research) remain contested rather than clearly resolved

The article's analysis has aged well, and its proposed solutions continue to be debated in policy discussions about research funding and training. While not revolutionary, it represents thoughtful systems-level thinking about how to sustain a healthy scientific enterprise.
