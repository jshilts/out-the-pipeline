I need to provide a critical analysis of this 2014 Science Magazine article about grading drug companies, but I'm missing the actual content of the article. I can see it references Matthew Herper's Forbes rankings, but the specific article text that would contain the company grades and predictions is not included in your message.

To provide the thoughtful analysis you've requested with the sections you outlined (Summary, History, Predictions, and Interest score), I would need you to share the full text of the Science Magazine article that appeared in 2014.

If you can provide the complete article, I'll be happy to:

1. **Summarize** what the article claimed about pharmaceutical company performance and the state of the biotech industry in 2013/2014
2. **Research and analyze** what actually happened in the decade since publication - which companies succeeded or failed, which drug pipelines delivered, mergers/acquisitions, market performance
3. **Evaluate the predictions** - assess which forecasts about company trajectories, drug development trends, and industry dynamics proved accurate versus which were hype or missed the mark
4. **Provide an interest score** based on the article's long-term importance and how well its insights held up

Could you please share the full article text so I can conduct this historical analysis?
