# Article Title (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on how R. B. Woodward's immense impact in synthetic organic chemistry was tied to his era—the "right time" when complex natural product synthesis presented uncharted technical and intellectual challenges. It compares this to the brief, cohort-driven quantum mechanics revolution, and contrasts both with the more incremental present. The author speculates that a "Woodward 2.0" today would likely shift attention away from classical total synthesis (e.g., strychnine has long been done) toward grand challenges such as artificial photosynthesis, protein folding, or chemical-biology interfaces, which demand bold, pragmatically discovery-driven approaches akin to Woodward's style. The piece argues there is no present-day divergence between theory and experiment in chemistry comparable to the quantum-era upheavals in early 20th-century physics; instead, biology now contains the biggest "black boxes," even if it remains less theory-driven than chemistry. The central question posed is whether a contemporary Woodward would successfully pivot to a new frontier or remain a "talented scientist born in the wrong era."

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2017 commentary did see several developments consistent with the author's speculation about bold, complex frontiers displacing classical total synthesis as the dominant intellectual challenge.

- **Total synthesis evolution**: Total synthesis has continued, but its focus has increasingly shifted from sheer complexity to efficiency, selectivity, scalability, and functional utility. For example, the target-oriented synthesis of the antimalarial drug artemisinin has been optimized for manufacturing via semi-synthesis. Meanwhile, methodological innovations (e.g., photoredox catalysis, C–H activation, late-stage functionalization) have streamlined routes. While headline-grabbing syntheses still occur, the field's center of gravity appears aligned with sustainable and practical applications.
- **Artificial photosynthesis**: This area has seen progress in both molecular and materials-based systems, including advances in water-oxidation catalysts, CO$_2$ reduction to fuels, and hybrid photoelectrochemical systems. However, scalable, economically viable solar fuels remain largely at the laboratory or pilot scale, with efficiency and stability still being key barriers.
- **Protein folding and structural prediction**: Since 2017, deep learning has transformed protein structure prediction, exemplified by DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 (2020), which delivers high-accuracy predictions for many proteins. This breakthrough enabled drug discovery pipelines (in target identification, structure-based design, and antibody development) and spurred broad use in academia and industry. AlphaFold did not resolve misfolding diseases or small-molecule protein-folding modulators at scale, but it substantially accelerated structure-guided research.
- **Chemical biology and CNS/pain**: In neurobiology and pain research, biologics such as anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (e.g., erenumab, fremanezumab) gained FDA approval for migraine prevention and saw significant patient uptake; later, small-molecule CGRP antagonists (gepants) also reached the market. Cell and gene therapies advanced (e.g., onasemnogene abeparvovec for spinal muscular atrophy). Research on chronic pain pathways continued to center on ion channels, GPCRs, and neuroinflammation, yet many small-molecule programs faced setbacks that underscored the biological "black boxes" the article highlighted.
- **Representation in synthesis**: The "erythromycin dimer" (a macrolide oligomer) was synthesized several years after the article, underscoring that "dimer" challenges do still attract effort, even if they are not the primary locus of cutting-edge impact.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Woodward 2.0 would tackle artificial photosynthesis or protein folding"**
  - **Outcome**: The broad trajectory validated this. Deep learning cracked protein structure prediction with AlphaFold 2 (2020), turning it into a high-utility predictive tool although not a fully biophysical theory of folding. Artificial photosynthesis remains a frontier with notable progress but no widespread deployment of solar fuels at scale.
- **"Total synthesis is no longer the sure-fire path to generational impact"**
  - **Outcome**: Aligned with subsequent trends. While total synthesis persists, its leading edge has increasingly emphasized process intensity (scalability, green metrics), late-stage functionalization, enabling methodologies for drug discovery, and ever-shorter routes.
- **"Biology holds the biggest black boxes, yet is less susceptible to sweeping, mathematically reinforced theories"**
  - **Outcome**: Mixed but directionally consistent. AlphaFold 2 showed that data-driven methods could produce practical structural surrogates for theory, but a unified, first-principles theory of folding and function (let alone of development or disease) remains elusive. Areas such as neurobiology and oncology continue to challenge reductionist prediction, sustaining the "black box" characterization in practice.
- **"Woodward 2.0 might enter via chemical biology"**
  - **Outcome**: Chemical biology matured further post-2017 into a central hub for target discovery, covalent inhibitors, targeted protein degradation (PROTACs and molecular glues), and cellular probe development, fitting the portrait of a bold, pragmatic, synthesis-aware field tackling biological unknowns.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article framed the right question and largely matched subsequent trends: protein folding saw a breakthrough via data-centric prediction (though not a grand theory), artificial photosynthesis remained a frontier with partial progress, and total synthesis continued to evolve toward practical impact rather than pure trophy targets. The reasoning resonates with how fields mature and where ambitious talent now concentrates.
