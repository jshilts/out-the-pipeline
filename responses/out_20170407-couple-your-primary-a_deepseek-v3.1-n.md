# Couple Your Primary Amines (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes a new carbon-carbon bond forming reaction developed by Mary Watson's group at the University of Delaware. The method transforms primary amines into coupling partners for boronic acids through a two-step process: first converting the amine to a Katritzky pyridinium salt, then performing a nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-type coupling. The chemistry appears broadly applicable, tolerating diverse functional groups including nitriles, alkynes, esters, amides, ketones, heterocycles, acetals, and tertiary amines. The reaction requires BPhen as a ligand for the nickel catalyst, with the expectation that optimization efforts would improve the conditions.

## 2. HISTORY
The Watson group's Katritzky pyridinium coupling chemistry has seen significant development since its 2017 publication. The method has been adopted by the synthetic organic chemistry community as a valuable tool for C(sp³)-C(sp²) bond formation, particularly for installing alkyl groups derived from primary amines onto aromatic systems. The reaction addresses a long-standing challenge in cross-coupling chemistry—the direct use of aliphatic amines as coupling partners without requiring pre-functionalization.

Subsequent research has expanded the scope and improved the practicality of this transformation. The nickel-catalyzed approach has proven more accessible and cost-effective compared to traditional palladium systems, making it attractive for pharmaceutical and agrochemical synthesis where amine-containing building blocks are abundant. The method's tolerance for various functional groups has made it useful in complex molecule synthesis, particularly in late-stage functionalization strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original article predicted that: "this can no doubt be improved by people who are able to spend enough of their lives beating on the reaction variables. I look forward to trying this one out!"

• **Prediction Assessment**: This prediction proved accurate. The field of nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling has expanded significantly since 2017, with numerous research groups developing improved conditions, new ligands, and expanded substrate scope for amine-derived coupling partners. The methodology has been incorporated into synthetic chemistry workflows, particularly in medicinal chemistry where rapid access to diverse compound libraries is valued.

• **Broader Impact**: The nickel-catalyzed approach to C(sp³) coupling has become an important area in cross-coupling chemistry, complementing traditional methods and enabling new disconnection strategies in synthesis planning. The field has moved toward more practical, scalable conditions with broader functional group tolerance.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article highlights an important methodological advance in synthetic chemistry that has practical applications in drug discovery and development. The transformation addresses a fundamental challenge in coupling chemistry and has proven utility in real-world synthesis applications.
