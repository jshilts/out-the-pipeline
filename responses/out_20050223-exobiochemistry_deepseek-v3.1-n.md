# Exobiochemistry (23 Feb 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a review paper by Steven Benner and colleagues titled "Is There a Common Chemical Model for Life in the Universe?" published in Current Opinion in Chemical Biology. The review explores alternative biochemistries that could support life beyond Earth's water-based carbon chemistry. Benner analyzes the chemical requirements for life, including bond energies, solubility, and reactivity across different temperatures and solvents. The article covers potential living systems in various environments including gas clouds, solid states, and alternative solvents like ammonia, methane, sulfuric acid, and supercritical dihydrogen on gas giant planets. A key focus is whether life is an "intrinsic property of chemical reactivity" that would emerge given suitable conditions. Benner argues that Titan meets all the theoretical criteria for supporting life, making it a critical test case. The author expresses enthusiasm for future planetary exploration missions to Titan, Europa, Enceladus, and Venus to search for extraterrestrial life.

## 2. HISTORY

In the two decades since this article was published, significant developments occurred in the search for alternative biochemistries and astrobiology:

**Planetary Exploration Missions:**
- **Cassini-Huygens (2004-2017)**: The Huygens probe landed on Titan in January 2005 (just before this article was published) and provided the first direct measurements of Titan's surface. Cassini continued studying Titan and other Saturnian moons until 2017.
- **Dragonfly Mission**: NASA selected Dragonfly in 2019 for launch in 2027 to Titan, representing the first dedicated Titan rotorcraft lander mission.
- **Europa Clipper**: NASA's mission to Europa, approved in 2015 with planned launch in 2024, will study the moon's ice shell and subsurface ocean.

**Titan Research Findings:**
- Titan's surface liquids are primarily methane and ethane, not water, existing at -179°C.
- Complex organic chemistry confirmed in Titan's atmosphere and on its surface, including hydrocarbon lakes and rivers.
- No evidence of life detected, but prebiotic chemistry appears active.

**Field Development:**
Exobiology/astrobiology became more established as a scientific discipline, with dedicated research programs at NASA and other space agencies. The field shifted from pure speculation toward evidence-based approaches using actual mission data from planetary exploration.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about future developments:

• **"I can't wait to find out... I want Titan rovers, Jupiter and Saturn dirigibles, Venusian atmosphere sample return, instrument-laden miniature submarines melting down through the ice on Europa and Enceladus: the lot. How much of this will I ever get a chance to see in my lifetime? Current betting is running to 'none of it, damn it'"**

  - **Outcome**: Partially correct on timeline pessimism. The Huygens probe had already landed on Titan by the time this article was published. Cassini continued operating until 2017. A Titan rover has not been deployed, but Dragonfly (a rotorcraft) was selected for development in 2019. No Jupiter/Saturn dirigibles, Venus sample return, or Europa submarines have been launched. Europa Clipper was approved but not yet launched. Most ambitious predictions for "the lot" within the author's lifetime did not materialize, validating the author's pessimistic assessment.

• **Implicit prediction that Titan would be a key test case for alternative biochemistries**

  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate. Titan became one of the primary targets for astrobiology research, leading to the Dragonfly mission selection. However, no evidence of life has been found there.

• **Implicit prediction that understanding life as "intrinsic property of chemical reactivity" would be tested by Titan exploration**

  - **Outcome**: The question remains unresolved. No life detected on Titan yet, but discovery of complex organic chemistry keeps the question scientifically relevant.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses fundamental astrobiology questions with enduring scientific relevance, particularly regarding alternative biochemistries and the search for extraterrestrial life. However, it primarily discusses a review paper rather than reporting new discoveries, and many of its speculative elements remain unresolved twenty years later.
