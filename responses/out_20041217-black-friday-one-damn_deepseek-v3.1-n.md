# Black Friday: One Damn Thing After Another (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from December 17, 2004, describes a cascade of bad news for AstraZeneca involving three important drugs. The author reports that Crestor (rosuvastatin), a cholesterol-lowering statin, was "under suspicion"; Exanta (ximelagatran), a novel oral anticoagulant for preventing blood clots, was in "major trouble"; and clinical trial data for Iressa (gefitinib), an EGFR inhibitor for lung cancer, was "terribly unimpressive" in its ISEL trial. 

The author contrasts Iressa's poor showing with Tarceva (erlotinib), another EGFR inhibitor that was seen as having a major opportunity. He notes that OSI Pharmaceuticals' shareholders were optimistic about Tarceva's prospects after Iressa's disappointing results, but he expresses personal skepticism that the two drugs are meaningfully different. He advises OSI shareholders to sell, speculating that once Tarceva enters broader use, it may face similar challenges to Iressa.

## 2. HISTORY

**Crestor (rosuvastatin)**: The "suspicion" referenced in the article concerned early safety signals and muscle toxicity risks. Between 2004 and 2008, the FDA conducted multiple safety reviews of Crestor. The drug weathered these concerns, continued on the market, and went on to become one of the most widely prescribed statins. In 2010, the JUPITER trial demonstrated that Crestor reduced cardiovascular events in patients with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, expanding its clinical use. By the 2010s, Crestor was a blockbuster drug generating several billion dollars in annual revenue for AstraZeneca.

**Exanta (ximelagatran)**: The "major trouble" proved prescient. In February 2006, AstraZeneca withdrew its New Drug Application (NDA) for Exanta in the U.S. following an FDA advisory committee vote against approval. The primary concerns were liver toxicity signals, evidenced by elevated liver enzymes in patients, and questions about the robustness of the clinical data. The drug had been approved in Europe in 2004 but was voluntarily withdrawn from the European market in 2006 due to safety issues. Exanta development was ultimately discontinued globally, and no oral direct thrombin inhibitor has since been successfully developed for long-term anticoagulation.

**Iressa (gefitinib) vs. Tarceva (erlotinib)**: The ISEL trial results referenced in the article were indeed negative: gefitinib failed to show a statistically significant overall survival benefit versus placebo in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Consequently, AstraZeneca voluntarily withdrew Iressa's U.S. indication in 2005, and it was largely superseded by Tarceva, which demonstrated a survival benefit in its pivotal NSCLC trial and received FDA approval. In 2015, however, Iressa made a comeback in the U.S. market based on the IPASS trial, which showed its efficacy in patients with EGFR-activating mutations. This highlighted the critical importance of patient selection by molecular markers. Today both EGFR inhibitors are available, with choices guided by specific EGFR mutation profiles and lines of therapy. The author's skepticism that the drugs were meaningfully different proved premature, as Tarceva's validated survival benefit in its initial trials allowed it to capture significant market share, while Iressa only later found a defined role in targeted, mutation-selected populations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

*   **Prediction**: The author wasn't convinced Tarceva and Iressa were meaningfully different and advised OSI shareholders to sell, speculating that Tarceva might face similar issues in broader use.
  *   **Outcome**: This was only partially accurate. Tarceva did show a survival benefit in its pivotal trials, distinguishing it from Iressa's initial negative ISEL results, and it gained widespread adoption. The author underestimated the importance of clinical trial design and patient selection at the time. However, his broader caution had some merit: Iressa ultimately returned with a targeted biomarker strategy, and many patients on Tarceva develop resistance, reinforcing that neither drug was a panacea.

*   **Prediction** (implied by calling Exanta in "major trouble"): The article suggested Exanta's path to market was jeopardized.
  *   **Outcome**: This proved correct. Within a year and a half, AstraZeneca withdrew the NDA, and the drug was ultimately abandoned due to unresolved safety concerns about liver toxicity.

*   **Prediction** (implied by noting Crestor was "under suspicion"): The article highlighted emerging safety concerns, implying a degree of risk to the drug's continued marketing and reputation.
  *   **Outcome**: This was overly pessimistic in the long term. While the drug faced regulatory scrutiny and safety reviews, Crestor remained on the market, and its clinical utility in reducing cardiovascular events was later established in the landmark JUPITER trial, leading to its blockbuster success.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captures a pivotal moment of clinical and regulatory setbacks for a major pharma company and correctly identifies the uncertain competitive dynamics between Iressa and Tarceva, which later evolved into the paradigm of EGFR-mutation guided therapy.
