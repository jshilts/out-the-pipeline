# No More Varian (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article announces that Agilent is exiting the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) business, ending the Varian line of NMR instruments that had been a fixture in chemistry for decades. The author recalls using early Varian models like the EM-360 (60 MHz) before the field shifted to Fourier-transform superconducting systems and higher fields. The piece observes that the NMR hardware market has consolidated dramatically—from multiple manufacturers (Varian, Bruker, JEOL, Oxford, GE) to Bruker as the dominant remaining player. The author attributes this consolidation to market saturation (universities and companies already have adequate capacity), a robust used-equipment market, and a hardware plateau where high-field instruments like 700 MHz systems already meet most experimental needs. While 1000 MHz instruments exist and even higher fields are conceivable, the article notes there is little practical demand to justify their development or purchase.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2014 announcement, Agilent did in fact exit NMR hardware, and Bruker solidified its dominance of the high-field NMR market. No major manufacturer emerged to challenge Bruker in the subsequent decade. Oxford Instruments, historically focused on magnet manufacturing, continue to supply some components and operate lower-field benchtop systems in adjacent markets but did not re-enter high-field NMR as a major competitor. JEOL remained active but as a minor player, largely serving niche applications or regional markets.

The saturation argument held true—most research institutions that needed NMR already had adequate equipment, and budget constraints during the late 2010s limited new purchases. NMR remains essential in pharmaceutical research (structure elucidation, fragment-based drug discovery, protein-ligand binding studies), but many labs rely on existing infrastructure, refurbished systems, or contract NMR services rather than purchasing new ultra-high-field instruments.

The only significant market expansion came from benchtop NMR systems (operating at lower fields, around 60-100 MHz), where companies like Thermo Fisher introduced more accessible instruments for routine analysis and teaching. However, these low-field systems do not compete with Bruker's high-field research instruments, reinforcing rather than challenging Bruker's position at the top end.

Clinical MRI, while NMR-based, operates as a completely separate market dominated by Siemens, GE Healthcare, and Philips—these companies never entered the analytical NMR market, and the consolidation of clinical MRI did not impact analytical NMR competition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **No new major NMR manufacturers would emerge:** This proved accurate. The subsequent decade saw no new competitors challenge Bruker at the high end, confirming that the barriers to entry (R&D costs for magnet technology, limited market size) were too high.

• **Market saturation would persist:** This also proved correct. Research institutions and pharmaceutical companies did not engage in widespread upgrading to the highest-field instruments, limiting growth opportunities for new entrants.

• **Limited demand for ultra-high-field instruments beyond existing 700 MHz/1000 MHz machines:** This held true. While some 1 GHz systems exist at national facilities, they remain rare; the envisioned 2 GHz NMR was never built commercially, as the practical advantages did not justify the astronomical costs. Research applications requiring the highest fields (e.g., complex protein structures) can typically use existing 700-1000 MHz instruments.

• **Bruker would remain dominant without significant competition:** This proved accurate for the analytical NMR market. Bruker continued to be the primary supplier to academic and industrial labs globally.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This article accurately described a niche but important consolidation in analytical instrumentation, with generally sound reasoning about market dynamics. However, it has limited long-term importance beyond the field of chemical instrumentation itself, as NMR hardware consolidation had minimal impact on broader biotechnology or pharmaceutical R&D outcomes.
