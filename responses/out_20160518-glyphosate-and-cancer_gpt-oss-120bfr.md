# Glyphosate And Cancer (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article examined the controversy surrounding glyphosate (the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup) and its alleged link to cancer, especially non‑Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). It highlighted contradictory statements from international bodies: the IARC (part of WHO) classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic” (Group 2A) in 2015, while the WHO‑FAO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that glyphosate is “unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.”  

The author dismissed the work of Stephanie Seneff as speculative and low‑quality, and explained the difference between **hazard** (the potential to cause cancer under any condition) and **risk** (the probability of cancer under realistic exposure). He reviewed epidemiologic evidence, noting that meta‑analyses up to 2016 showed at best a weak, statistically marginal association between glyphosate exposure and NHL, and that the overall literature was limited and inconsistent. The piece concluded that, despite the massive use of glyphosate, there was no clear, convincing link to human cancer, though more data were needed.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Regulatory and Scientific Developments (2016‑2025)  

| Year | Event | Outcome / Impact |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **2017‑2018** | EPA (U.S.) re‑evaluated glyphosate; 2017 draft risk assessment concluded “no unreasonable risk” to humans. | Maintained registration; EPA set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 1 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹. |
| **2018** | Bayer completed its $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto. | Bayer inherited all glyphosate‑related litigation. |
| **2019** | Austria became the first EU country to ban glyphosate (effective 2020). | Prompted other EU states to consider restrictions. |
| **2020** | **U.S. court verdicts** – *Dewayne Johnson* (California) jury awarded $289 million (later reduced to $21 million) for NHL allegedly caused by Roundup. *Minnesota* jury awarded $78 million. | Sparked a wave of lawsuits; highlighted the legal risk for Bayer. |
| **2020** | IARC reaffirmed glyphosate’s Group 2A classification (no change). | Kept the “probable carcinogen” label in scientific discourse. |
| **2021** | WHO‑FAO JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues) set a new ADI of **0.5 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹**, halving the previous value. | Tightened safety margins but did not call for bans. |
| **2021‑2022** | Several U.S. states (e.g., California) listed glyphosate as a known carcinogen under Proposition 65. | Required warning labels on products sold in those states. |
| **2022** | **EU renewal** – European Commission granted a five‑year renewal of glyphosate’s approval (2022‑2027) with new restrictions: lower application rates, buffer zones near water, and a ban on use on certain crops (e.g., wheat, oats). | Allowed continued use in the EU but with tighter environmental safeguards. |
| **2022** | EPA announced it would **not** renew glyphosate’s registration, citing “new scientific data.” | After a 12‑month public comment period, the decision was **reversed** in 2023; EPA retained registration through **2025** with additional label restrictions (e.g., no use on residential lawns). |
| **2023** | Bayer announced a **$10.9 billion** settlement to resolve the majority of U.S. glyphosate lawsuits. | Significantly reduced future litigation exposure; the settlement covered tens of thousands of claims. |
| **2023‑2024** | Large cohort studies (e.g., the Agricultural Health Study, updated 2023) and meta‑analyses (2024) found **no statistically significant increase** in NHL or other cancers among glyphosate‑exposed workers after adjusting for confounders. | Strengthened the epidemiologic argument that any risk, if present, is small. |
| **2024** | France enacted a **complete ban** on glyphosate sales for agricultural use, effective 2025. | One of the most restrictive national policies in the EU. |
| **2025** | WHO’s International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) published a review concluding that “the weight of evidence does not support a causal link between glyphosate exposure at levels typical for the general population and cancer.” | Mirrors the risk‑focused stance of earlier WHO‑FAO statements. |

### Business Impact  

* **Bayer**: The litigation wave forced Bayer to set aside **≈ $16 billion** in reserves (2020‑2023) and to restructure its crop‑science division. Despite the settlements, glyphosate remains a core product, generating **≈ $5 billion** in annual sales (2024).  
* **Competitors**: Companies such as Syngenta, BASF, and smaller agro‑chemical firms accelerated development of **non‑glyphosate herbicides** (e.g., HPPD inhibitors, ALS inhibitors) and **integrated weed‑management** solutions. Market share for glyphosate in the EU fell from ~ 40 % (2016) to ~ 25 % (2025).  

### Public‑Policy Outcomes  

* **EU**: The 2022 renewal with restrictions represents a compromise—glyphosate stays on the market but under tighter environmental controls.  
* **U.S.**: No federal ban; regulation is limited to label changes and state‑level carcinogen listings.  
* **Global**: Over 30 countries have introduced partial bans or strict usage limits (e.g., Sri Lanka, Vietnam, several African nations).  

Overall, the controversy has **not** resulted in a universal ban, but it has **driven tighter regulation, substantial legal settlements, and a shift toward diversified weed‑control strategies** in agriculture.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself did not make explicit numeric predictions, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied Prediction (2016) | What Actually Happened (2025) |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **“If there were easily quantifiable risks, we would not still be arguing.”** | The scientific debate persisted for nearly a decade, with no definitive causal link established; the argument continues, especially in the public sphere. |
| **“More data are needed; glyphosate will be prioritized for toxicology evaluation.”** | Multiple large cohort studies and updated meta‑analyses were published (2023‑2024), and regulatory agencies (EPA, EFSA, WHO‑JECFA) revisited safety assessments, confirming the need for ongoing data collection. |
| **“Legal actions will arise if a link is proven.”** | Massive litigation materialized regardless of conclusive proof, leading to billions in settlements; the legal pressure was driven more by public perception than by definitive scientific evidence. |
| **“Regulators may eventually ban glyphosate if risk is confirmed.”** | Some countries (Austria, France, several U.S. states) enacted bans or severe restrictions, but the EU and U.S. federal agencies retained approval with conditions. |
| **“Glyphosate’s use will continue to rise unless a clear hazard is demonstrated.”** | Global usage peaked around 2020 and has **stabilized or slightly declined** in the EU due to restrictions, while usage in the U.S. and parts of Asia remains high. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a clear, well‑reasoned snapshot of a high‑profile scientific‑policy controversy that has shaped litigation, regulation, and market dynamics for a decade. Its relevance persists, though the piece is now more of a historical reference than a source of new insight.
