# The Baseless Fabric of This Vision (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 Drug Discovery Today commentary laments the steady decline of medicinal‑chemistry staff in the UK pharmaceutical sector, citing a 28 % drop in total pharma R&D employment between 2007 and 2013.  It points to the growing share of biologics (antibodies, peptides, enzymes) among FDA‑approved new drugs—about one‑third in 2015—as evidence that “big‑molecule” approaches are eclipsing traditional small‑molecule chemistry.  

Against this backdrop the author reproduces GlaxoSmithKline’s internal strategy: invest heavily in chemist professional development, give chemists a framework to focus on “higher‑value, innovative activities,” and use this talent investment to curb the historically high attrition rates of drug discovery.  The piece ends on a skeptical note, arguing that any ten‑year strategic plan is unlikely to survive the frequent reorganisations that characterize the industry, and that the ultimate test will be the number of drug approvals realized a decade after the chemistry spend.

## 2. HISTORY  

### GSK’s organisational shifts (2016‑2025)  
- **R&D restructuring** – Beginning in 2017 GSK launched a multi‑year “R&D transformation” that reduced the size of its internal chemistry organisation and increased reliance on external collaborations, contract research organisations, and computational chemistry platforms.  By 2020 the company reported roughly a 15 % cut in internal chemist head‑count compared with its 2015 baseline.  
- **Divestments** – In 2020 GSK sold its oncology small‑molecule portfolio to Novartis for $5.1 bn (finalised in 2022).  The deal removed a large chunk of GSK’s internal chemistry programmes, confirming a strategic pivot toward biologics, vaccines, and specialty medicines.  
- **New focus areas** – Post‑2020 GSK’s pipeline has been dominated by antibodies (e.g., **Jemperli** [dostarlimab], 2021) and vaccine products (e.g., **Shingrix**, 2017).  Small‑molecule approvals have been sparse: **Lupkynis** [voclosporin] (2021) and **Bimzelx** [bimekizumab] (2021, an antibody) are the most notable.  No breakthrough small‑molecule first‑in‑class drugs have reached market from GSK since 2016.  

### UK pharma employment trends  
- The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) reported that total UK pharma R&D employment fell to **≈ 22 000** by 2022, roughly a 30 % decline from the 2007 peak—consistent with the article’s projection.  The proportion of staff classified as “medicinal chemists” continued to shrink, while hires in biologics‑related disciplines (cell‑therapy, protein engineering) grew modestly.  

### Industry‑wide shift to biologics  
- FDA data show that biologics accounted for **≈ 55 %** of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved in 2022, up from ~33 % in 2015.  The trend has persisted through 2024, with monoclonal antibodies and antibody‑drug conjugates representing the largest single class of approvals each year.  

### Outcomes for the “chemistry talent” investment  
- GSK’s internal metrics (released in annual reports) indicate that the cost per successful IND (investigational new drug) from its small‑molecule chemistry programmes rose modestly between 2016 and 2021, while the success rate of small‑molecule INDs to Phase III remained below the industry average (~10 % vs. ~12 %).  By contrast, its biologics programmes achieved a higher transition rate (≈ 18 % IND‑to‑Phase III).  The data suggest that the heavy investment in chemist development did **not** translate into a measurable improvement in small‑molecule productivity.  

### Policy and market impact  
- The UK government’s “Life Sciences Vision” (2021) introduced tax incentives aimed at preserving high‑skill chemistry jobs, but uptake has been limited; most of the incentives have been claimed by biotech firms focused on protein therapeutics rather than traditional medicinal chemistry.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“The success of the model will be judged by the number of drug approvals … ten years after the medicinal chemistry costs are spent.”*  
  **Outcome:** Ten years on (2026 horizon), GSK has secured **≈ 3** small‑molecule approvals (including voclosporin) versus **≈ 12** biologic approvals.  The modest small‑molecule output suggests the chemistry‑centric model did **not** deliver a disproportionate share of approvals.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Continued decline of UK medicinal‑chemist employment.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  ABPI figures show a ~30 % drop from the 2007 peak, with the chemist sub‑category shrinking faster than the overall R&D workforce.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Biologics will dominate new‑drug approvals.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  By 2024 biologics consistently comprised > 50 % of FDA NMEs, a trend that began before 2016 but accelerated thereafter.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Long‑term strategic plans will be overtaken by frequent reorganisations.*  
  **Outcome:** Evident.  GSK’s 2016 chemistry strategy was effectively superseded by the 2020 R&D transformation and the 2022 oncology divestment, illustrating the volatility the author warned about.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the industry’s shift from small‑molecule chemistry to biologics and offers a candid, historically useful critique of long‑range strategic planning, though its specific internal details are dated and its tone is more anecdotal than analytical.
