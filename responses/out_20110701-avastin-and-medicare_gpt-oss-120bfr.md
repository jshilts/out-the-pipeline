# Avastin and Medicare (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary noted that in June 2011 the FDA’s advisory committee voted unanimously to **remove the FDA‑approved indication for bevacizumab (Avastin) in metastatic breast cancer**.  Despite that, the author highlighted a Reuters report stating that **the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said it would continue to pay for the drug for this indication**.  The piece framed the clash as a clash between scientific judgment (the FDA saying the trial data do not support benefit) and payer policy (Medicare apparently willing to reimburse regardless), and wondered whether the disagreement would affect oncologists’ willingness to prescribe off‑label and what it meant for health‑care costs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome** – After the advisory committee vote, the FDA formally **withdrawn the breast‑cancer indication in October 2011**.  The drug remained approved for colorectal cancer, non‑small‑cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, renal‑cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer.

**Medicare coverage** – In July 2011 CMS issued a **“coverage with evidence development” (CED) decision** that allowed continued reimbursement for bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer, provided patients were enrolled in a registry to collect outcomes data.  This policy was unusual because it decoupled coverage from an FDA indication.  The CED remained in place for several years but **was rescinded in 2014**, when CMS announced that it would no longer cover bevacizumab for breast cancer because the required evidence had not demonstrated a meaningful benefit.

**Clinical practice** – The FDA withdrawal and the eventual loss of Medicare coverage led most major oncology societies (e.g., NCCN, ASCO) to **remove bevacizumab from their breast‑cancer treatment guidelines**.  Off‑label use persisted in a minority of centers for a few years, but by the mid‑2010s it had become rare, largely limited to clinical‑trial settings.

**Economic impact** – Avastin’s high price (≈ $5,000–$6,000 per month in 2011) sparked ongoing debate about drug‑cost sustainability.  The emergence of **biosimilar versions of bevacizumab**—first approved in 2017 (Mvasi, followed by others)—has modestly reduced acquisition costs, though price reductions have been less dramatic than for some other biologics.

**Policy implications** – The 2011 episode highlighted the **potential for discord between FDA approval and Medicare coverage**.  It contributed to broader discussions that later informed reforms such as the **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** and CMS’s “coverage with evidence development” framework, which now more explicitly ties coverage decisions to the strength of clinical evidence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *Medicare’s willingness to pay would keep off‑label Avastin use alive despite the FDA’s withdrawal.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct.  Medicare’s CED allowed continued use for about three years, but after the 2014 coverage termination, off‑label prescribing sharply declined.

- **Prediction:** *The clash would expose a systemic problem in how health‑care costs are managed, possibly prompting policy change.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  The case became a frequently cited example in policy debates and helped shape later CMS policies that more closely align coverage with FDA‑approved indications and robust evidence.

- **Prediction:** *Patient advocates would argue that denying coverage would “consign people to death.”*  
  **Outcome:** The concern was voiced at the time, but subsequent data showed that bevacizumab provided only modest, non‑statistically significant survival benefit in breast cancer, and its toxicity profile limited its net clinical value.  The feared large‑scale patient harm did not materialize.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when regulatory, payer, and clinical perspectives collided, illustrating lasting implications for drug coverage policy and the economics of high‑cost biologics.
