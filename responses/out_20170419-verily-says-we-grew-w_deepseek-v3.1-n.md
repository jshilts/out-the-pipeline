# Verily Says (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Verily (Google/Alphabet's life sciences division) shifting from hype-driven "moonshot" announcements to more practical, grounded research. Previously, Verily had made grand promises about transformative technologies like glucose-monitoring contact lenses, nanoparticle diagnostic "tricorders," and all-in-one medical scanners. CEO Andy Conrad had expressed confidence that these innovations were likely to work without needing animal testing.

By 2017, the company pivoted to the Baseline Study—collecting comprehensive biometric data from 10,000 healthy volunteers—and acknowledged that "Mother Nature defeated us wildly" on the nanoparticle diagnostics. Rather than revolutionary devices, participants wore the Verily Study Watch tracking movement and cardiovascular data—essentially a more sophisticated fitness tracker. Conrad admitted the company had "grown up" and moved away from disruptive rhetoric toward the "day-to-day practical drudgery" of research. The piece frames this as a welcome dose of reality for Silicon Valley's sometimes naive approach to healthcare complexity.

## 2. HISTORY

The developments after 2017 followed this trajectory:

**Baseline Study outcomes**: Verily's Project Baseline expanded significantly beyond the initial 10,000 participants, growing into multi-year longitudinal studies. The research produced publications and datasets but didn't yield immediate breakthrough diagnostic technologies or fundamentally change medical practice.

**Continued product development**: Verily did eventually launch commercial products, including:
- **Verily Study Watch**: Evolved into clinical-grade continuous monitoring devices used in research studies
- **Onduo**: A virtual diabetes management platform (partnership with Sanofi)
- **Verb Surgical**: A robotics surgery venture (with Johnson & Johnson, later dissolved)

**Nanoparticle diagnostics**: The "tricorder" concept that Conrad admitted "Mother Nature defeated us wildly" on never materialized commercially, and no FDA-approved nanoparticle diagnostic emerged from this initiative.

**Contact lens glucose monitoring**: Google announced this in 2014 with much fanfare, but after partnership difficulties (including with Novartis/Alcon), the project was effectively abandoned. No glucose-sensing contact lens reached the market.

**Firings and restructuring**: Verily underwent multiple rounds of layoffs and organizational changes, indicating ongoing struggles to find profitable, scalable healthcare products.

**Real business model**: Verily increasingly focused on partnerships with pharmaceutical companies (like GSK, Sanofi) rather than pure moonshots, essentially becoming a contract research and data analytics organization.

**Public policy impact**: No major healthcare policy changes resulted from Verily's initiatives specifically.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Tricorder nanoparticle diagnostics (mentioned as 2014 concept)**: 
  - **Prediction**: Conrad initially claimed no need for animal testing, expressing confidence it would work and suggesting study participants would wear these devices
  - **Outcome**: Complete failure. Conrad admitted "Mother Nature defeated us wildly" by 2017, and no such diagnostic technology ever reached the market or even late-stage clinical trials

• **Glucose-monitoring contact lenses**:
  - **Prediction**: Revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring through contact lenses
  - **Outcome**: Abandoned. Despite partnerships with Novartis/Alcon, technical challenges proved insurmountable for accurate, reliable glucose measurement in tear fluid

• **All-in-one medical scanners**:
  - **Prediction**: Multi-diagnostic devices that could scan for multiple conditions
  - **Outcome**: Never materialized commercially

• **Verily's general transformation of healthcare**:
  - **Prediction**: Silicon Valley disruptive innovation would revolutionize healthcare delivery
  - **Outcome**: Much more modest. Verily became a contract research and device company rather than a true healthcare disruptor. The "moonshot" mentality gave way to incremental improvements and partnerships with traditional healthcare companies

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article was prescient in documenting a key inflection point where reality caught up with healthcare hype, making it historically significant as Silicon Valley learned the hard way about biology's complexity.
