# Hire the Thoroughbreds? (Nov 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the role of academic pedigree in hiring decisions for pharmaceutical research labs, particularly for PhD-level positions. The author categorizes job candidates into five groups based on their PhD advisor's reputation: (1) poor reputation, (2) unknown, (3) neutral reputation, (4) solid but not famous, and (5) famous advisors.

The central debate is whether hiring primarily from category (5) - the "thoroughbreds" from famous labs - provides better quality assurance, or whether this approach misses talented candidates from less famous groups. The author's colleague argues that elite pedigree acts as a "bozo filter," while the author counters that good interview processes should identify capable candidates regardless of pedigree, and that hiring exclusively from famous labs risks missing diverse talent while potentially acquiring problematic attitudes.

**Note:** This article appears to be off-topic for the prompt template, which specifies analysis of biotechnology industry commentary articles. This piece focuses on HR/hiring philosophy in pharmaceutical companies rather than biotechnology science, drug development, or industry trends.

## 2. HISTORY

I cannot provide a meaningful historical analysis of pharmaceutical industry hiring practices from 2005 to present, as this would require specific knowledge of internal hiring policies, personnel data, and industry-wide trends that I do not have access to without research capabilities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No clear testable predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical outcomes are present in this article.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 0/10**

This article is off-topic for the analysis framework requested. While potentially interesting for human resources professionals in pharma, it does not address biotechnology industry developments, drug discovery, regulatory changes, or clinical outcomes that the prompt template is designed to evaluate.
