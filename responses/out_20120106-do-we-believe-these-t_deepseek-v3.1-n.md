# Do We Believe These Things, Or Not? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article poses a series of propositions about drug development failures to gauge consensus in the biotech/pharma community. The author asserts that clinical attrition rates are unsustainably high, with most failures stemming from two root causes: lack of efficacy and toxicity/side effects. 

For efficacy failures, the author argues that deeper disease mechanism knowledge is required but difficult to obtain, with most of this understanding actually coming from studying why drugs fail. Better target selection is challenging without such knowledge, though phenotypic assays may offer a shortcut.

For toxicity failures, the author notes these are even harder to predict due to the vast number of potential failure mechanisms. However, structural correlations do exist that can guide drug design - specifically avoiding redox-active groups like nitro and quinones, and maintaining logP values in the 1-3 range rather than 4-6. The central question is whether the field agrees that these structural-activity relationships are reliable enough to improve clinical success rates.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns raised in 2012 have remained remarkably persistent, with the biopharmaceutical industry continuing to face high clinical attrition rates through the subsequent decade. By 2021, overall clinical success rates remained low, averaging around 7.5-10% from Phase I to approval, with particularly poor success rates in oncology (around 5%).

### Efficacy Challenges:
Target validation and disease mechanism understanding have seen some improvement through advances in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology, but fundamental gaps remain. The industry has increasingly embraced phenotypic screening approaches, with several approved drugs originating from phenotypic screens, though this hasn't dramatically shifted overall success rates.

### Toxicity and Structural Alerts:
The structural alerts mentioned (nitro groups, quinones, high logP) have been extensively validated. The pharmaceutical industry widely adopted "drug-likeness" filters and structural alert systems. Lipinski's Rule of Five (which includes logP considerations) became standard practice in drug discovery. However, these filters primarily reduce early-stage failures rather than late-stage clinical attrition.

### Business Impact:
The high attrition rates contributed to continued pharmaceutical industry consolidation and increased focus on late-stage acquisitions rather than early-stage internal R&D. Many companies shifted toward licensing or acquiring programs that had already demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept to mitigate risk.

### Policy and Regulatory:
FDA implemented various expedited programs (Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Accelerated Approval) to address the high cost and slow pace of drug development, though these primarily affect approval timelines rather than underlying scientific failure rates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: Compounds without nitro groups or with lower logP (1-3 vs 4-6) will have higher clinical success rates**

- **Outcome**: **Substantially validated**. Multiple retrospective analyses confirmed these structural features correlate with lower success rates. Pharmaceutical companies systematically incorporated these filters into discovery workflows. However, structural properties alone couldn't overcome the fundamental challenges of efficacy prediction and complex toxicity mechanisms.

**Implicit prediction: Structural property correlations are strong enough to be practically useful**

- **Outcome**: **Partially validated**. While these correlations held true, they primarily helped eliminate obvious failures early rather than meaningfully improving overall clinical success rates. The industry learned that avoiding "bad" properties is necessary but insufficient for creating successful drugs.

**Implicit prediction: Deeper disease mechanism knowledge would be hard to come by**

- **Outcome**: **Validated but evolving**. While disease mechanism understanding has advanced through technologies like CRISPR, single-cell genomics, and AI/ML approaches, translating this knowledge into predictable drug efficacy remains challenging. Most mechanism-based target selections still fail in clinical trials.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified fundamental, persistent challenges in drug development that remained largely unchanged for the subsequent decade-plus. The structural insights were practical and widely adopted, while the broader efficacy/toxicity dichotomy continues to define pharmaceutical R&D difficulties today.
