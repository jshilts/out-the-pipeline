# The Soon-Shiong Hype Machine (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Patrick Soon-Shiong's "cancer moonshot" initiative, expressing skepticism about the use of moonshot rhetoric in biomedical research. The author contrasts the Apollo and Manhattan projects—which had established physical principles but required massive engineering—with cancer research, which involves thousands of different diseases with poorly understood pathways.

The STAT investigation revealed minimal scientific progress in Soon-Shiong's initiative, instead characterizing it as "an elaborate marketing tool" to promote his expensive "GPS Cancer" diagnostics platform while his publicly-traded companies were losing tens of millions per quarter. The article details inflated claims about clinical trials and mentions MD Anderson's trademark infringement lawsuit over the "moonshot" term. It also notes Soon-Shiong's meetings with the Trump Administration about a potential "health czar" role and his plans to unveil a "genomics transcriptomics supercomputing medical reasoning engine."

## 2. HISTORY

Patrick Soon-Shiong did not secure a significant role in the Trump Administration. Instead, he made his most notable move in February 2018 when he acquired the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million, shifting focus toward media ownership.

In March 2019, the National Cancer Institute terminated its collaboration with Soon-Shiong's NantHealth, ending the "Cancer Moonshot" partnership after producing no significant clinical results. In 2021, Soon-Shiong faced a shareholder lawsuit alleging he inflated the company's stock value through misleading statements about NantHealth's capabilities.

The GPS Cancer test never achieved widespread clinical adoption or validation. NantHealth's stock declined from around $15-20 in 2016-2017 to under $1 by 2024, and the company faced multiple shareholder lawsuits. MD Anderson's trademark lawsuit was eventually dropped, but no significant intellectual property conflicts emerged to validate Soon-Shiong's claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Moonshot approach to cancer**: The article correctly identified that cancer research cannot be solved like Apollo or Manhattan Project due to its complexity. Subsequent years showed massive investment in cancer research without the dramatic breakthroughs predicted in "moonshot" rhetoric. Cancer treatment has improved incrementally through targeted therapies and immunotherapy rather than a single moonshot success.

- **Clinical impact of Soon-Shiong's initiatives**: The skepticism about "GPS Cancer" and inflated trial claims proved accurate. No substantial clinical breakthroughs or widely adopted diagnostics emerged from his initiatives.

- **Political influence**: While Soon-Shiong met with Trump officials as reported, he did not obtain a "health czar" position, and his political influence remained limited.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrated prescient skepticism about celebrity-driven "moonshot" rhetoric in biomedical research, accurately predicting the failure of Soon-Shiong's initiatives and highlighting important issues about hype versus substance in medical innovation.
