# First Slide, Please (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal anecdote about presentation anxiety and improvisation in a corporate or research setting. The author describes two incidents where they were unexpectedly called upon to present without adequate preparation. In the first incident, the author was surprised to learn during a group meeting that they were scheduled to present on a binding data approach they had been working on. Unprepared and with little meaningful results to share, they delivered what they describe as a "grim chalk talk" that exposed the inadequacy of their work. In the second incident, the author realized mid-meeting that they were on the agenda to present a new project they had just been assigned. They quickly excused themselves, hastily prepared slides in their office, and returned to deliver a surprisingly coherent presentation—setting a personal record for preparing a presentation just twenty minutes after the meeting had begun.

## 2. HISTORY

This article appears to be a personal blog post or column sharing workplace anecdotes rather than biotechnology industry commentary. The content focuses entirely on presentation experiences and contains no substantive information about biotechnology developments, research findings, or industry trends. There are no companies, technologies, drug candidates, or scientific methodologies mentioned that would allow for analysis of subsequent real-world developments. The piece appears intended as light reading about work culture rather than serious industry analysis.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about the biotechnology industry or future scientific developments. It is purely retrospective storytelling about past personal experiences with workplace presentations and contains no forward-looking statements about technology, medicine, or industry trends.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article is completely off-topic for biotechnology industry analysis. It is a personal anecdote about workplace presentations with no substantive content related to biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, or scientific research.
