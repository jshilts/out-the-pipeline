# Where Does the News Hype Come From? (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2018 commentary by Derek Lowe examines the source of hype and distortion in science journalism, particularly regarding biomedical research. After initially assuming that mainstream media outlets like the Daily Mail were primarily responsible for exaggerating scientific findings through poor reporting, the article highlights research by Chris Chambers and colleagues revealing that much of the hype originates from university and journal press releases themselves—not from journalists adding it later.

The key insight is that most popular press stories about scientific research are written based on these institutional press releases, which already contain exaggerated claims and simplifications. Critically, these press releases are typically approved by the scientists involved in the research. The article acknowledges that while industry press releases are expected to be hyped, university and publisher press materials cannot be assumed to be more reliable or accurate. The author concludes that fixing science communication requires starting at the source—ensuring press releases don't distort findings in the first place, rather than expecting journalists to accurately report on already-hyped material.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2018 article identified a systemic problem in science communication that has continued to be recognized and studied in subsequent years. The issues raised about university and journal press releases contributing to hype and misrepresentation of scientific findings have been documented in multiple subsequent analyses. Research on this topic has continued to examine the pipeline from scientific publication to press release to media coverage, with studies confirming that institutional communication often amplifies or misrepresents findings. 

However, the problem persists: sensationalized science headlines and overhyped press releases remain common, particularly around biomedical breakthroughs, health studies, and emerging technologies. The mechanisms described—where universities compete for attention and funding through media coverage—have continued to drive the same behaviors. The article's identification of the Daily Mail's practices proved prescient, as discussions about media accountability and accuracy in science reporting have become more prominent.

The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023) provided numerous examples of the phenomena described, with institutional communications about preliminary research sometimes outpacing evidence, and media coverage amplifying both legitimate findings and misinformation. The core structural issues identified in 2018—academic institutions incentivized to generate attention, journalists relying on often-hyped press releases, and scientists themselves approving exaggerated claims—have largely persisted, with ongoing debates about science communication ethics and the role of institutions in responsible science dissemination.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

* **The article's key assertion about hype originating from institutional sources rather than journalists**: The 2018 article correctly identified the structural problem, but **no significant systemic reforms have been implemented**. University and journal press releases continue to generate much of the hype, with institutional incentives for attention remaining intact. This prediction about the source of the problem was accurate, though the problem itself continues.

* **Implicit assumption that scientists would recognize this issue and work to improve press releases**: While awareness has increased through public discussions and academic studies of science communication, **there has been limited broad-scale improvement** in the quality and accuracy of institutional press releases. Individual scientists have become more cognizant, but institutional incentives for attention generation remain dominant.

* **Expectation that journalists would continue relying on these problematic press releases**: This has **proven accurate**, as most general-audience science reporting still relies heavily on institutional press releases and communications offices. Breaking news about scientific studies typically flows from research institutions → press releases → media outlets with minimal independent verification.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses a persistent and important problem in science communication with structural insights that remain relevant, though confined to a specialized topic without broader transformative impact on the field. Its identification of institutional sources of hype proved accurate but hasn't led to significant systemic change.
