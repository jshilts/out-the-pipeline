# Not the Usual Morning Around Here (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a short personal blog post written on April 19, 2013, during the Boston Marathon bombing aftermath and subsequent manhunt. The author, who appears to work for a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, describes being instructed to stay home from work due to security lockdowns, mass transit shutdowns, and active police operations in the area. The author notes that gunfire occurred overnight just a few blocks from their workplace, referencing the dramatic events surrounding the capture of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects. This is not a biotechnology industry analysis but rather a personal account written during a period of civic emergency.

## 2. HISTORY

The article was written during the immediate aftermath of the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which killed 3 people and injured hundreds. The date of this post (April 19) corresponds to the lockdown of Boston and surrounding areas during the manhunt for suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police in Watertown on the night of April 18, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended later on April 19 after the lockdown was lifted. The biotech industry in Cambridge continued its growth trajectory after 2013, but this specific post has no bearing on biotechnology developments and was simply a contemporaneous personal account of living through those events.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contains no predictions about biotechnology, science, or industry developments. It is purely a descriptive account of personal circumstances during a security emergency.

## 4. INTEREST
