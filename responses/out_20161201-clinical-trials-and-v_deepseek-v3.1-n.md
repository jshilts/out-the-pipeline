# Clinical Trials, Up and Very Much Down (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses mixed news from the biotech industry in late 2016. On the negative side, Arrowhead Pharma halted three clinical RNA interference programs due to delivery technology failures that caused fatalities in primate studies, Cerecor's depression drug CERC-301 failed its Phase II trial after a previous lower-dose trial had already failed, and Eli Lilly faced job cuts following a Phase III Alzheimer's drug failure. On the positive side, Bluebird Bio reported encouraging CAR-T cell therapy results for multiple myeloma with strong efficacy and minimal toxicity, providing hope for the field after Juno's recent CAR-T safety issues.

## 2. HISTORY

**Arrowhead Pharma**: The company's struggles with RNAi delivery technology led to a strategic pivot. They later successfully developed novel subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutics (EX1 and TRiM platforms) and achieved FDA approval for Amvuttra (vutrisiran) in 2022 for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. The 2016 crisis, while devastating at the time, forced necessary technology innovation.

**Cerecor/CERC-301**: The NMDA antagonist approach for depression was largely abandoned following these failures. Subsequent depression research shifted toward different mechanisms, particularly with the success of ketamine/esketamine (approved by FDA in 2019) using different administration routes and mechanisms than CERC-301.

**Eli Lilly Alzheimer's Program**: Lilly's 2016 failure was part of a broader pattern of Alzheimer's drug development challenges. However, the company continued research in this area and would later develop donanemab, which showed clinical benefits in Phase II trials (2021) and received FDA approval in 2024, representing one of the first disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's.

**Bluebird Bio CAR-T**: The promising bb2121 (idecabtagene vicleucel/Abecma) data referenced in the article led to FDA approval in March 2021, becoming the first CAR-T therapy approved for multiple myeloma. The therapy achieved significant market adoption, treating thousands of patients with durable responses. Bluebird also received approval for another CAR-T therapy (Zynteglo) for beta-thalassemia in 2022.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit CAR-T field optimism**: The article's positive framing of Bluebird's results was validated—CAR-T therapies became a major treatment modality with multiple FDA approvals and significant patient impact.
- **RNAi technology skepticism**: The article correctly identified fundamental delivery challenges that RNAi therapeutics faced, though it couldn't predict that Arrowhead would successfully innovate new delivery platforms and achieve eventual approval.
- **Alzheimer's research difficulty**: The Lilly failure example highlighted broader Alzheimer's drug development challenges that persisted for years, though ultimately some disease-modifying treatments did emerge.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a snapshot of biopharma's high-risk nature by documenting both dramatic failures and promising successes that exemplify the industry's boom-bust cycles and the multi-year timelines required to validate therapeutic approaches.
