# NASA's Arsenic Bacteria: A Call For Follow-Up Experiments (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article serves as a crowdsourcing call from the Science blog for expert feedback on the controversial NASA study published in Science claiming discovery of bacteria (GFAJ-1 strain from Mono Lake, California) that could incorporate arsenic into its DNA instead of phosphorus. The original NASA paper suggested these bacteria could substitute arsenate for phosphate in their biomolecules, fundamentally challenging biological principles. The blog author notes widespread skepticism within the scientific community about the validity of these claims and explicitly asks chemists and other experts to propose specific follow-up experiments and data that would be needed to substantiate or refute the NASA findings. The post seeks to compile technical suggestions for verification experiments, reflecting the scientific community's demand for rigorous validation of extraordinary claims that would rewrite biochemistry textbooks.

## 2. HISTORY

The arsenic bacteria controversy unfolded rapidly after the initial December 2010 publication. Within months, numerous research groups attempted to replicate the findings and conducted critical analyses. By 2012, two major independent studies were published in Science (one from Princeton, another from University of British Columbia) that systematically refuted the original claims. These studies showed that GFAJ-1 bacteria could survive in high-arsenic conditions but still required phosphorus to grow, and did not actually incorporate arsenic into their DNA backbone as claimed. The bacteria were simply highly resistant to arsenic toxicity, not fundamentally different in their biochemistry.

The lead author of the original study, Felisa Wolfe-Simon, maintained her position initially but the scientific consensus solidified against the arsenic-DNA hypothesis. NASA distanced itself from the claims, and no subsequent research has demonstrated arsenic-based biochemistry in any organism. The controversy became a case study in scientific skepticism, peer review processes, and how extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The methodology of the original study was criticized for potential phosphate contamination and insufficient analytical rigor. The episode did not lead to any approved medical treatments, policy changes, or practical applications, as the fundamental premise was disproven.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself makes no explicit predictions, functioning instead as a call for experimental verification. However, the underlying NASA paper made the implicit prediction that arsenic could functionally replace phosphorus in DNA, which would have revolutionized our understanding of biochemistry and astrobiology. This prediction **failed completely** - subsequent research definitively showed that:
- GFAJ-1 bacteria still required phosphorus and did not incorporate arsenic into DNA
- No organisms have been found that use arsenic in their fundamental biochemistry
- The original claims resulted from methodological artifacts rather than genuine biochemical novelty

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article represents a significant moment in modern scientific discourse, documenting the scientific community's rapid and effective self-correction mechanism in response to extraordinary claims. The arsenic bacteria episode became a textbook case in scientific skepticism and remains highly cited in discussions of peer review and evidence standards.
