# Peter Thiel's Book (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reviews Peter Thiel's book "Zero to One" and his critique of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Thiel contrasts the conservative, risk-averse culture of pharma with the "swashbuckling" entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley. The central tension identified is that drug discovery faces fundamentally higher failure rates due to biological complexity and factors outside human control, making the cautious approach more rational than in software/IT where sheer skill and effort can more reliably overcome obstacles. The author acknowledges a grain of truth in Thiel's diagnosis about pharma's lost frontier spirit, while defending the industry's caution as necessary given the inherent uncertainties of biological systems.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following 2015, the biotech and pharma landscape underwent significant transformation that reflects both Thiel's critiques and the author's pushback. Several developments are noteworthy:

**Investment and Market Dynamics**: Biotech saw massive capital influx, with venture funding in biotech growing from approximately $10 billion annually in 2015 to over $30 billion by 2021. However, this boom was followed by a significant downturn starting in 2021-2022, when many overvalued companies faced reality checks about actual scientific and clinical progress.

**Clinical Success Rates**: The fundamental challenge Thiel identified persisted—drug development failure rates remained high. Analysis from 2016-2021 showed overall clinical success rates around 10-15% from Phase I to approval, with particularly high failure rates in oncology (around 97% failure rate for novel mechanisms). This reinforced the author's point about unavoidable biological complexity.

**Regulatory Evolution**: The FDA approved record numbers of novel drugs in the late 2010s, with 59 approvals in 2018 alone. Expedited pathways like breakthrough therapy designation did increase approval efficiency, but didn't fundamentally change the underlying scientific uncertainty.

**Specific Therapeutic Advances**: Gene therapies emerged as a major frontier, with landmark approvals like Luxturna (2017) for inherited retinal disease and multiple CAR-T cell therapies for cancer (Kymriah, Yescarta, both 2017). These represented genuine breakthrough innovations, yet development timelines remained long (often 10-15 years) and costs high (hundreds of millions to over $1 billion per approved drug).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Thiel's implicit prediction of more entrepreneurial, risk-taking biotech transforming the industry**: Partially realized in the venture boom and emergence of aggressive biotechs like Moderna, BioNTech, and various gene therapy companies. However, these companies still operated within the constraint of biological uncertainty—Moderna's COVID vaccine success built on a decade of mRNA platform development, and even then required the unique circumstances of a pandemic for rapid deployment.

• **That Silicon Valley's "can-do" spirit could overcome biotech's conservatism**: Partially accurate—companies like Alphabet's Verily and various tech-bio hybrids emerged, but they largely learned to respect biological complexity rather than conquering it through software-style iteration. Many tech approaches (AI drug discovery, digital therapeutics) showed promise but faced the same lengthy validation timelines as traditional approaches.

• **Implicit assumption that higher risk-taking would yield breakthrough results**: The period did see remarkable breakthroughs (CRISPR gene editing, CAR-T, mRNA vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors), but these came from sustained scientific investment rather than simply adopting Silicon Valley's cultural mores. The fundamental timeline and uncertainty problems persisted.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a prescient moment in the evolving relationship between tech culture and biotechnology, highlighting tensions about risk, failure, and innovation that would become increasingly relevant as tech money flowed into biotech. The core thesis—that biological complexity fundamentally constrains the applicability of software-style entrepreneurial approaches—remained highly relevant through the subsequent biotech boom and bust cycles.

## 5. ACCURACY ASSESSMENT

The author's cautious stance has held up well. The 2015-2024 period demonstrated that while biotech could benefit from some entrepreneurial energy (better funding, faster decision-making, platform approaches), the fundamental challenge wasn't cultural but biological. Tech billionaires and VCs learned this lesson through expensive failures, with many high-profile tech-bio experiments either failing or requiring much longer timelines than initially projected. The author's emphasis on "factors outside your control" proved prophetic, as even well-funded companies with breakthrough science faced the same clinical attrition rates. The industry did become somewhat more dynamic, but the core constraints remained intact.
