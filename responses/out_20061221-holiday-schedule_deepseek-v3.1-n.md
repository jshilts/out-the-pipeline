# Holiday Schedule (December 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This December 2006 blog post is a brief holiday announcement from an organic chemist blogger. The author explains that posting will be intermittent during the Christmas season due to family commitments and cooking activities. He mentions plans to cook with his two children, prepare a crown roast of pork, leg of lamb on a spit, and traditional Christmas breakfast featuring country ham, eggs, biscuits, and red-eye gravy. The author notes he'll post occasionally but regular posting won't resume until after New Year's, and expresses some hope of working on a "Vial 33" paper during the break, though acknowledges this may not happen with two young children.

## 2. HISTORY

This was simply a holiday scheduling announcement rather than a substantive biotechnology article. It contained no scientific content, industry analysis, or prognostications about the biotech sector. As such, there are no subsequent developments or real-world implications to track from this particular blog post.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This post contained no predictions about biotechnology, drug development, scientific methods, or industry trends. It was purely a personal scheduling announcement.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **0/10**

This post is completely off-topic for a biotechnology industry analysis context. It contains zero scientific or industry content and serves only as a personal blog update about holiday plans.
