# Sanofi - Trouble At the Top? (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on boardroom tensions at Sanofi, where CEO Chris Viehbacher was under pressure from the company's board of directors. The sources of conflict included Viehbacher's relocation to Boston, concerns about Sanofi's oncology portfolio, and his outspoken management style, which was described as "not very French." The piece references leaked documents, including a September 2014 letter from Viehbacher to the board arguing why he should not be replaced, suggesting the situation involved serious internal politics and potentially leaked by parties seeking his removal. The article frames this as part of ongoing tensions between Viehbacher and the board that had been previously noted in industry commentary.

## 2. HISTORY

Chris Viehbacher was indeed removed as Sanofi's CEO in October 2014, shortly after this article was published, ending his six-year tenure. He was replaced by Olivier Brandicourt, who served until 2019 when Paul Hudson took over as CEO. During the post-2014 period, Sanofi underwent significant strategic shifts, including major restructuring efforts and portfolio changes. The company expanded its presence in specialty care areas like immunology and rare diseases, while also strengthening its vaccines business. Sanofi's diabetes portfolio faced challenges due to pricing pressures and competition, leading to some divestitures. The company made several significant acquisitions and partnerships, including the $11.6 billion acquisition of Bioverativ in 2018 and the $3.7 billion purchase of Principia Biopharma in 2020, indicating continued investment in rare diseases and immunology. The oncology portfolio concerns mentioned in 2014 were addressed through both internal development and external partnerships, though Sanofi has maintained a diversified therapeutic focus rather than putting all emphasis on oncology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events. It was primarily reporting on contemporaneous boardroom dynamics and their context rather than making forward-looking statements about biotechnology industry trends or Sanofi's future performance.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article was primarily a news report about corporate leadership dynamics rather than fundamental biotechnology science or drug development. While it documented an important executive transition, it has limited long-term significance for understanding biotechnology innovation or clinical outcomes.
