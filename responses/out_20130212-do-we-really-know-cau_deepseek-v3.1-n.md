# Article Title (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 commentary questions a widely-cited NIH claim that researchers had identified the causes of more than 4,500 diseases, while effective treatments existed for only about 250. The author expresses skepticism about both the disease count and what constitutes "knowing the cause," noting that many complex conditions (type II diabetes, Alzheimer's, arthritis) involve multiple genetic and environmental factors rather than single identifiable causes. The article suggests the 4,500 figure likely comes from the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) GeneMap database, which includes single-gene disorders, traits, and disease susceptibilities, but questions whether this constitutes true causal understanding, especially for complex diseases.

## 2. HISTORY
The underlying tension highlighted in this article—the gap between identifying genetic associations and developing effective therapies—has remained a persistent challenge in precision medicine. In the years following 2013, several developments shed light on this issue:

The precision medicine initiative launched in 2015 (later rebranded as the All of Us Research Program) revealed both progress and continued challenges. While whole-genome sequencing became dramatically cheaper (from thousands to hundreds of dollars), the translation to therapies remained slow.

Cancer genomics demonstrated both successes and limitations. Drugs targeting specific mutations (like EGFR, ALK, BRAF) showed remarkable efficacy in selected patients, but acquired resistance remained a major problem. Immunotherapy (immune checkpoint inhibitors from ~2014 onward) achieved breakthrough responses across multiple cancer types, though response rates varied widely (20-50% depending on cancer type).

In genetic diseases, enzyme replacement therapies and small molecule treatments advanced, but remained expensive and limited. The 2013-2023 period saw FDA approval of numerous orphan drugs targeting rare genetic conditions, though many cost hundreds of thousands annually per patient.

The Alzheimer's disease field faced major disappointments. Multiple amyloid-targeting drugs failed in clinical trials between 2013-2019, despite targeting the "cause" identified by genetic studies. Only in 2021 did aducanumab receive controversial accelerated approval, followed by lecanemab in 2023, with modest effects and significant side effects.

CAR-T cell therapy (first approved 2017) represented a major advance in blood cancers, demonstrating that even without knowing the complete molecular cause, therapeutic progress could be made.

GWAS studies continued identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases, but effect sizes were generally small, and few led to new therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article doesn't make explicit forward predictions, but raises implicit questions:
- **Can we actually develop therapies for these 4,500 conditions?** Mixed results: Progress has been substantial in targeted cancer therapies and some genetic disorders, but complex diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and most psychiatric conditions remain largely untreatable at the causal level.
- **Is the "know the cause" to "effective therapy" pipeline straightforward?** As suspected in the article, this has proven far more difficult than anticipated. Pathway complexity, off-target effects, delivery challenges, and individual variation have made translation harder than expected.
- **Are there really 4,500 distinct diseases with known causes?** Post-2013 genomics has confirmed extensive genetic heterogeneity; many "single" diseases are actually collections of distinct molecular subtypes, potentially supporting the high number, though the clinical utility of such fine subdivisions varies.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a crucial issue in translational medicine—the gap between attribution and understanding—that remains highly relevant today. It presciently questioned easy narratives about precision medicine's immediate prospects, making it substantially more insightful than typical commentary on this topic.
