# Opening the Lid on Sarepta's Drug Approvals (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines the FDA's controversial approval of Sarepta's exon-skipping therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), with particular focus on golodirsen (Vyondys 53). The author, writing from a critical perspective in January 2020, recounts how golodirsen initially received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA in summer 2019 due to kidney toxicity and infection risks, only to be unexpectedly approved months later without clear explanation.

The piece highlights serious concerns: golodirsen showed minimal increase in truncated dystrophin (the surrogate marker), no established clinical benefit, significant kidney toxicity risks common to antisense oligonucleotides, and infection risks evidenced by post-market experience with Sarepta's earlier drug eteplirsen (Exondys 51). The article emphasizes that Sarepta failed to conduct the required post-marketing confirmatory study for eteplirsen that was mandated at its 2016 accelerated approval. The FDA's reversal on golodirsen, despite previously documented safety concerns and weak efficacy data, raised fundamental questions about regulatory consistency and whether the agency was appropriately balancing patient protection with access to treatment.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication in January 2020, several developments occurred in Sarepta's DMD franchise and the broader regulatory landscape:

**Regulatory Continuity and Approvals:**
- The FDA maintained its approval pathway for oligonucleotide therapies, and Sarepta continued building its exon-skipping portfolio. Subsequent Sarepta therapies in this class remained on the market.

**Post-Marketing Commitments:**
- Sarepta proceeded with confirmatory studies as required under accelerated approval mechanisms. The regulatory framework continued to rely on confirmatory trials to verify clinical benefit, a structure that remained controversial for drugs granted accelerated approval with surrogate endpoints.

**No Major Regulatory Policy Changes:**
- Despite the concerns raised in the article, there was no wholesale reversal of the FDA's approach to accelerated approval for rare disease therapies, particularly those addressing conditions with high unmet need like DMD. The tension between evidentiary standards and patient access remained a persistent theme in FDA decision-making for orphan diseases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about future developments:
- **Predicted negative impact on FDA integrity:** The article warned that inconsistent regulatory decisions would damage the FDA's reputation and the integrity of the regulatory process, stating "fairness, competence, impartiality, integrity, and the reputation for having them: they don't just reappear when you decide later on that you'd rather have them back."
- **Predicted continued safety concerns:** The author expressed concern that golodirsen would demonstrate similar or worse safety issues than eteplirsen.
- **Predicted confirmatory study deferral pattern:** The author questioned whether the FDA would actually enforce the confirmatory study requirement for golodirsen (due 2023), given the agency's failure to enforce similar commitments for eteplirsen.
- **Predicted minimal clinical benefit:** The article strongly suggested that golodirsen would fail to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefit, given the weak surrogate marker data and the absence of proven clinical efficacy.

*Note: The author expressed uncertainty about whether these patterns would persist, asking whether the FDA would commit to "re-evaluating its recent tendency to overrule its own scientists if these drugs injure more Duchenne patients in the next three years without doing them any good."*

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article examines a critical and persistent tension in drug regulation—the balance between access to treatment for devastating rare diseases and evidentiary standards for safety and efficacy. The Sarepta case study illuminates broader questions about regulatory consistency, accelerated approval mechanisms, and the FDA's decision-making processes that remain highly relevant to contemporary drug development and approval debates.
