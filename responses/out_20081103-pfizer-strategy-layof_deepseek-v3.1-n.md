# Pfizer: Strategy, Layoffs, and Money (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler's 2008 interview response to the Financial Times regarding the looming Lipitor patent expiration in 2011. Kindler outlined a strategy focused on internal pipeline development, growth in emerging markets, expansion of off-patent products, and maximizing existing products. The author dismisses this as generic corporate speak amounting to "making more money on all our other stuff" without concrete specifics.

The commentary also discusses ongoing layoffs at Pfizer, noting a trend toward higher associate-to-PhD ratios and increased outsourcing. It highlights the irony of employees recently relocated from Ann Arbor to Groton at significant company expense now facing job cuts shortly after settling in Connecticut, despite Pfizer's generous relocation packages that included covering property value differences.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent years revealed the accuracy of the article's skepticism about Pfizer's strategic positioning:

**Lipitor Patent Cliff Impact**: Lipitor (atorvastatin) lost US patent protection in November 2011, and its global sales plummeted from over $10 billion annually to generic competition. This created one of the largest patent cliffs in pharmaceutical history.

**Pfizer's Actual Response**: Rather than the vague strategy outlined in 2008, Pfizer pursued major acquisitions to offset revenue losses:
- Acquired Wyeth for $68 billion in 2009 (closed 2009)
- Attempted to acquire AstraZeneca in 2014 (failed)
- Acquired Hospira for $17 billion in 2015
- Acquired Medivation for $14 billion in 2016

**Leadership Changes**: Jeff Kindler unexpectedly resigned as CEO in December 2010, replaced by Ian Read, suggesting the board may have lacked confidence in the 2008 strategy execution.

**R&D Restructuring**: Pfizer significantly downsized R&D operations, including closing the Ann Arbor facility entirely and consolidating research sites, validating concerns about the relocation waste mentioned in the article.

**Emerging Markets Performance**: While emerging markets became more important, Pfizer faced increased competition and pricing pressures, particularly in countries like China where local generic manufacturers gained market share.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Article's explicit predictions**: The article made relatively few concrete predictions, focusing more on immediate skepticism.

**Kindler's stated predictions/strategy from the interview**:
• **Internal pipeline growth**: Failed to materialize as expected. Pfizer's pipeline in the subsequent years produced some successes (like Ibrance in 2015) but not enough to offset Lipitor losses.
  
• **Growth in emerging markets**: Partially successful but faced intense competition. Emerging markets revenue grew but not at the dramatic rates needed to replace $10+ billion in Lipitor sales.

• **Increase in off-patent products business**: Some expansion occurred, but this segment inherently carries lower margins and couldn't compensate for the blockbuster revenue loss.

**Broader pattern**: The article's underlying skepticism about vague corporate strategies proved prescient, as Pfizer resorted to large-scale M&A rather than organic growth to address the patent cliff.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article provides valuable insight into pharmaceutical industry dynamics during a critical period, with its skepticism about Pfizer's strategy proving largely justified by subsequent events. However, it lacks deeper analysis of broader industry trends beyond the Pfizer-specific commentary.
