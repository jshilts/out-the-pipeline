# Keep It To Yourself (Nov 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the Federal Circuit's *In re Klopfenstein* decision, which clarified what constitutes a "printed publication" that can invalidate patent rights through prior disclosure. The case involved inventors Carol Klopfenstein and John Brent, who filed a 2000 patent application for a method to lower cholesterol using soy cotyledon fiber in food. The USPTO rejected their application because the invention had been displayed on a poster at the American Association of Cereal Chemists meeting in 1998 for approximately three days, and later briefly at Kansas State University. The court ruled that even without printed handouts, cataloging, or indexing, the poster constituted sufficiently public accessibility to count as prior publication because experts could easily copy the presented information over an extended period without restrictions.

The author notes that the pharmaceutical industry already followed conservative practices of filing patent applications before any public disclosure, and suggests the court's decision reinforces this cautious approach. The article also raises an unanswered question about how an uncatalogued poster came to the Patent Office's attention.

## 2. HISTORY

The *In re Klopfenstein* decision became a landmark case in US patent law, establishing important precedent for what constitutes prior public disclosure. Subsequent developments include:

**Legal Impact**: The decision was widely cited in later patent cases and influenced patent prosecution strategies. Attorneys began advising clients to file provisional or full patent applications before any form of public presentation, including conferences, poster sessions, and academic talks. The factors established by the court (duration of display, expertise of audience, expectations of copying, ease of reproduction) became standard considerations in disclosure analysis.

**Patent Practice Changes**: The ruling accelerated a trend toward defensive filing practices. Many universities and research institutions implemented stricter internal policies requiring patent reviews before any public presentation of potentially patentable research. This created tension with academic traditions of rapid knowledge sharing and conference participation.

**Continued Legal Evolution**: The principles from *Klopfenstein* were applied and refined in later cases such as *In re Lister* and *SRI International v. Internet Security Systems*, helping to establish a more consistent framework for evaluating public accessibility of various forms of disclosure. The America Invents Act of 2011 later shifted the US to a "first-inventor-to-file" system, making early filing even more critical.

The soy cotyledon fiber invention itself does not appear to have resulted in approved therapeutics or commercial success, suggesting the invention did not overcome the patentability obstacles or achieve practical implementation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's implied predictions and analysis:**

• **Inventor Freedom vs. Patent Protection**: The article implicitly suggests that without proper patent strategy, inventors risk losing protection. The Klopfenstein case outcome validated this concern - the inventors lost their patent rights due to premature disclosure. This became a cautionary tale widely taught in patent law and technology transfer.

• **Industry Practice Validation**: The author's statement that "in the drug industry there's no way that we would show a poster on anything before the patent application had been filed" proved prescient. This conservative approach became even more entrenched post-*Klopfenstein*, and the decision is frequently cited in patent CLE programs and corporate IP policies.

• **Legal Firm Warnings**: The article mentions that "some law firms from issuing ominous-sounding releases about how the courts are trampling on the patent rights of individuals" but dismisses this as ridiculous. In reality, the decision did spark significant concern in academic and startup communities, where resources for rapid patent filing were more limited than in large pharmaceutical companies. However, the legal framework established by *Klopfenstein* has largely been accepted as sound patent policy.

• **Poster Session Practices**: There's no evidence that the specific suggestions mentioned (shorter displays, anti-copying disclaimers, or deliberately obscure presentations) became widespread practices. Instead, the dominant response was simply filing patent applications earlier.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This case established important legal precedent affecting thousands of subsequent patent applications and changed how researchers approach conference presentations, making it highly relevant to biotechnology patent strategy and academic technology transfer practices.
