I notice that this article is a cooking recipe for chicken pot pie, not a commentary about the biotechnology industry. The PROMPT_TEMPLATE you've provided appears to be designed for analyzing biotech articles with specific sections on SUMMARY, HISTORY, PREDICTIONS, and INTEREST ratings.

Since this is actually a cooking recipe published on a science blog, it doesn't fit the analytical framework you've outlined. Could you clarify what you'd like me to do? 

Would you like me to:
1. Find a different article about biotechnology to analyze using your template?
2. Apply the template creatively to this recipe article (though it wouldn't make much sense)?
3. Help you with something else related to this content?
