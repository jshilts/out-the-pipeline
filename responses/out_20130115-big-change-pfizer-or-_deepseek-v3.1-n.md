# A Big Change at Pfizer? Or Just a Rumor? (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses speculation about major structural changes at Pfizer under CEO Ian Read. The context included recent hints about potentially splitting the company, following Abbott's similar breakup move, with Wall Street analysts making cases for such restructuring. The article mentions Pfizer's reorganization of business units that fueled breakup speculation.

The central rumor floated was that Pfizer might exit all in-house small molecule drug discovery and shift focus primarily to biologics. This would extend beyond their already-known outsourcing model where "drug designers" would direct chemistry work to offshore teams. The author considered several scenarios: Pfizer could spin off small-molecule research as a separate entity, or split between pharma and other businesses (consumer, generics), or perhaps small molecule research would simply be discontinued. The article presents this as unverified industry rumor and solicits reader thoughts on plausibility.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade revealed a different trajectory than the rumored exit from small molecules:

**No Complete Exit from Small Molecules**: Pfizer did not abandon small molecule drug discovery. The company maintained, and in some areas expanded, small molecule research while also growing biologics capabilities. Small molecules continued to constitute a significant portion of Pfizer's pipeline and approved drugs.

**Major Strategic Moves Instead**: Rather than exiting small molecules entirely, Pfizer executed several major strategic shifts:
- **2013-2014**: Failed attempt to acquire AstraZeneca for approximately $118 billion, which would have dramatically expanded both small molecule and biologic portfolios
- **2015**: $17 billion acquisition of Hospira, expanding into biosimilars and sterile injectables
- **2016**: $14 billion acquisition of Medivation, strengthening oncology portfolio (both small molecules and other modalities)
- **2019**: $11.4 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma, adding small molecule cancer drugs
- **2020**: Acquired rights to collaborate on small molecule programs with other companies

**Major Biologic Success**: Pfizer did achieve significant biologic success with Comirnaty, the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine developed with BioNTech, generating tens of billions in revenue during 2021-2022.

**Company Split**: In 2019-2020, Pfizer did split off its established medicines business (Upjohn) and merged it with Mylan to form Viatris, but this involved generic drugs and established brands rather than R&D capabilities. Pfizer retained the innovative medicines business including both small molecule and biologic R&D.

**Research Model Evolution**: Pfizer continued operating multiple research sites globally, maintaining in-house small molecule medicinal chemistry while also using external partnerships and CRO relationships - a hybrid model rather than complete outsourcing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit dated predictions. The main speculative scenarios mentioned were:
- Pfizer getting out of all in-house small molecule drug discovery and focusing on biologics
- Small molecule operations being spun out as a separate entity
- Company split between pharma and other businesses

**Comparison to Reality**: None of these scenarios materialized as described. Pfizer continued investing in small molecule discovery while also building biologic capabilities, representing a "both/and" rather than "either/or" strategy. The company did split off established medicines but retained R&D capabilities for both modalities.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captured legitimate industry speculation during a period of major pharmaceutical restructuring, and the broader question of small molecule vs. biologics strategy remained relevant for the next decade. However, the specific rumor did not accurately forecast Pfizer's actual trajectory.
