# C&E News: No Smiley Face This Time (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a Chemical and Engineering News (C&E News) piece from November 2012 that presented a bleak assessment of the employment situation for chemists. The review indicates that unlike previous C&E News coverage which may have downplayed employment challenges, this particular article was described as "worrisome and depressing" and would "absolutely give you the shakes" whether readers were currently employed or not. The review suggests the C&E News article provided a realistic but grim portrayal of the job market challenges facing chemists at that time, presenting stark realities for people in the field.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2012 article, the chemistry employment landscape has shown mixed but generally challenging trends. The chemical industry faced significant headwinds during this period, with major pharmaceutical companies continuing restructuring efforts that began before 2012. Employment data from the American Chemical Society showed persistent challenges for chemists in securing stable employment, particularly in traditional R&D roles. The period saw continued outsourcing of chemistry positions, automation of laboratory processes, and consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry. While some sectors like specialty chemicals and materials showed growth, overall chemist employment struggled to recover to pre-2008 levels. The shale gas boom provided some opportunities in petrochemicals, but these were geographically concentrated and often required different skill sets than traditional chemistry PhD training. Academic positions remained highly competitive with limited openings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself appears to be more descriptive of then-current conditions rather than making specific predictions about the future chemist job market. The tone and description suggest ongoing rather than improving conditions for chemistry employment as of 2012.

## 4. INTEREST
**4/10**

This article represents a snapshot of employment concerns within the chemistry profession and serves as a useful indicator of workforce challenges in scientific fields, though it covers a narrower scope than broader biotechnology industry trends.
