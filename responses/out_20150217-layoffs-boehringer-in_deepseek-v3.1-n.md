# Layoffs at Boehringer Ingelheim (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that Boehringer Ingelheim announced workforce reductions at its Ridgefield, Connecticut facility in February 2015, citing the need to "rebalance its workforce in the U.S. to put the company in the best position for future growth." The information came from a FierceBiotech report, and the author noted uncertainty about which departments were most affected—whether R&D, sales, or administration—and indicated they would provide updates as more details emerged.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2015 announcement, Boehringer Ingelheim continued its strategic transformation. The company maintained significant R&D investments while navigating patent cliffs and shifting market dynamics:

- **Continued R&D Pipeline Development**: Despite workforce adjustments, Boehringer maintained one of the pharmaceutical industry's higher R&D investment ratios, consistently spending approximately 20% of net sales on R&D through the late 2010s.

- **Major Drug Approvals**: Several important therapies achieved regulatory success post-2015, including:
  - Ofev (nintedanib) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) - already approved in 2014, continued to show strong performance
  - Jardiance (empagliflozin) for type 2 diabetes, with later expansions into cardiovascular indications showing significant outcomes data
  - Pradaxa (dabigatran) maintained market presence despite competition

- **Business Performance**: The company's global revenues showed steady growth, reaching approximately €19.1 billion in 2020, demonstrating resilience despite various challenges including the described 2015 workforce adjustments.

- **Strategic Focus Shifts**: The company continued to emphasize areas like immunology, oncology, and respiratory diseases while managing legacy products facing generic competition.
