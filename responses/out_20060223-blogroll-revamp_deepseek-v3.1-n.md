# Blogroll Revamp (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from February 23, 2006 is a short administrative update from what appears to be a pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry blog. The author announces plans to post about an upcoming Sanofi-Aventis investors meeting where rimonabant (an obesity drug) would be discussed, and notes ongoing debate about Merck and the New England Journal of Medicine in previous comments. The primary purpose of the post is to update the blogroll with new science and pharmaceutical industry blogs, welcoming several new additions including Terra Sigillata, various science blogging sites, and noting the migration of existing blogs to the Scienceblogs platform.

## 2. HISTORY
**Rimonabant (the obesity drug mentioned):** In April 2006, just two months after this post, rimonabant was approved in the European Union for obesity treatment under the name Acompla. However, it was never approved by the FDA in the United States. In October 2008, the European Medicines Agency recommended suspension of rimonabant due to serious psychiatric side effects including depression and suicidal ideation. Sanofi-Aventis subsequently withdrew the drug from all markets by early 2009, marking a major failure for the CB1 receptor antagonist approach to obesity. The company was later acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb to become Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2014.

**Scienceblogs platform mentioned in the post:** Scienceblogs, launched in 2006, became one of the first major science blogging networks and operated successfully for many years, though it later declined in influence and was acquired by different companies before largely fading from prominence.

**The broader context:** This post captures a moment when pharmaceutical companies were actively developing endocannabinoid system drugs for obesity, before the serious psychiatric side effects were fully understood. It also reflects the early era of science blogging when individual experts maintained influential blogs, before the consolidation into major platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this blog post, which was primarily administrative in nature. The implicit expectation that rimonabant information would be forthcoming at the Sanofi-Aventis meeting was fulfilled within days, but the long-term outcome for the drug turned out to be commercial failure due to safety concerns rather than the success that was likely hoped for at the time.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
This is essentially a blog housekeeping post with minimal substantive content about biotechnology. While it provides a snapshot of the science blogging community in 2006 and briefly mentions rimonabant at a pivotal moment, the post itself contains no analysis, insights, or meaningful commentary about biotechnology developments.
