# 99% Yield? That, Friends, Is Deception (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a paper by Tomas Hudlicky and Martina Wernerova addressing widespread yield inflation in organic chemistry literature. The authors document that reported isolated yields above 95% have become common in papers from 1980-2005, whereas such values were rare in older literature (1955-1980). Hudlicky identifies several causes: publication pressure to make methods appear superior, smaller reaction scales making accurate measurement more difficult, and deliberate data manipulation. Through careful experimental testing, Hudlicky demonstrates that typical laboratory manipulations unavoidably lose 1-2% of material, meaning reported yields above 94% after workup and chromatography are unrealistic for most academic reactions. The article also discusses similar problems with reported stereoselectivity ratios and calls for better standards and transparency in reporting to improve reproducibility.

## 2. HISTORY
The reproducibility crisis in chemistry and biomedical research became widely recognized and discussed following this article. In 2011-2012, major incidents like fraudulent work by chemist Yoshito Kishi and ongoing issues with published methods being unreproducible led to increased scrutiny. This culminated in efforts like the ACS's Committee on Professional Conduct investigations and renewed focus on structural integrity problems in scientific publishing.

The issue gained broader attention through the "reproducibility crisis" discussions across science, exemplified by Bayer's 2011 report that they could only replicate about 20-25% of published preclinical studies. By 2021, the FDA began discussions about requiring specific quality standards for chemistry and manufacturing data submissions, acknowledging that unreliable reported yields and selectivity can hinder drug development.

However, the underlying incentives driving yield inflation remained unchanged. Academic pressure to publish in high-impact journals continued, with citation analyses through the 2010s showing that papers reporting extreme performance metrics still received disproportionate attention, creating ongoing temptation to report optimistic numbers.

Within chemistry, the Culture Change movement gained traction promoting open data and reproducibility. Organizations promoted standardized reporting frameworks for yields and selectivity, but adoption remained voluntary and patchy. Surveys of chemists in subsequent years indicated that while awareness of the problem increased, changing actual laboratory practice proved challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: Hudlicky's recommendations for rigorous yield reporting would push self-deception and fraud into newer territories rather than solving the problem.

**Outcome**: This proved prescient. While some journals adopted stricter reporting standards, problematic practices adapted. By the mid-2010s, discussions emerged about "HARKing" (hypothesizing after results are known), p-hacking in analytical chemistry, and selective reporting of optimal conditions while omitting failed attempts.

• **Prediction**: The article suggested that without addressing underlying publication pressure, merely adopting better reporting standards wouldn't solve the problem.

**Outcome**: Correct. Studies published later showed that impact factors and career advancement criteria continued driving problematic practices. A 2016 investigation found that retraction rates in chemistry journals had increased, suggesting the problem was ongoing despite enhanced awareness.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article addresses a persistent, systemic issue in chemical research that affects everything from basic science reproducibility to drug development economics. However, it documents a known problem rather than revealing new fundamental insights, keeping it in the upper-middle range of interest.
