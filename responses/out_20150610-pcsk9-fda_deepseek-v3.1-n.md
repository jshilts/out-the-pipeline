# PCSK9 at the FDA (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary covers the June 2015 FDA advisory committee meetings reviewing PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies for cholesterol reduction—Regeneron/Sanofi's alirocumab on June 9 and Amgen's evolocumab on June 10. The article notes these were viewed as potential blockbuster drugs that could dramatically lower LDL cholesterol across broad patient populations. The central tension was that while the drugs clearly reduced LDL levels (a surrogate endpoint), definitive cardiovascular outcomes data—whether they actually reduced heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular mortality—would not be available for another 2-3 years. Regeneron/Sanofi proposed targeting patients with genetic predisposition to high LDL and statin-intolerant patients. The FDA committee approved the genetic indication but expressed reservations about the broader statin-intolerant population, concerned about sending a "ditch your statins" message when inexpensive, proven statins already existed with established cardiovascular benefits. The piece captures the regulatory dilemma: approve based on surrogate markers versus wait for hard outcomes data, while noting that no PCSK9 drug could reach full market potential without proven cardiovascular benefit.

## 2. HISTORY
The PCSK9 inhibitors ultimately achieved both FDA approval and demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits, though the pathway unfolded largely as anticipated in the article:

**Approvals and Indications:**
- **Evolocumab (Repatha, Amgen)**: Approved August 2015 for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease requiring additional LDL reduction
- **Alirocumab (Praluent, Regeneron/Sanofi)**: Approved July 2015 for similar indications

**Cardiovascular Outcomes Data (2017):**
- **FOURIER trial (evolocumab)**: Published March 2017 in New England Journal of Medicine, showed 15% relative risk reduction in primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) with median follow-up of 2.2 years
- **ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (alirocumab)**: Published November 2018, showed 15% relative risk reduction in primary endpoint (death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) with median follow-up of 2.8 years

**Market Adoption and Uptake:**
The "blockbuster" prediction materialized, but with limitations. Both drugs achieved multi-billion dollar annual sales (evolocumab ~$1.3B in 2023; alirocumab ~$2.6B in 2023), though this fell short of the massive projections some analysts had made before outcomes data were available. High cost and payer restrictions limited uptake—real-world use focused primarily on high-risk statin-intolerant patients and those with familial hypercholesterolemia, rather than broad population replacement of statins. Step therapy requirements and prior authorizations remained common barriers.

**Clinical Practice Impact:**
The drugs became established options in guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate statins or need additional LDL reduction despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. However, generic statins remained first-line treatment due to their proven cardiovascular benefits, low cost, and extensive evidence base—exactly the concern the 2015 FDA committee had articulated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
Several predictions from the article can be evaluated:

• **"Many statin-intolerant patients will go onto the new therapies, no matter what the label might say"** - **Largely correct directionally, but overestimated scale**: Statin-intolerant patients did become a primary target population, but payer restrictions and high costs substantially limited uptake compared to the "many" prediction. The broader mass market adoption did not occur.

• **"No PCSK9 antibody is going to reach its full market potential until the outcomes data arrive"** - **Accurate**: Both drugs saw significantly increased prescribing and guideline inclusion after the 2017-2018 outcomes trials provided definitive cardiovascular benefit data. Revenue growth accelerated post-outcomes data publication.

• **"Companies would much rather not wait another two or three years for [outcomes data] to report"** - **Correct both in timeline and motivation**: The approvals came in 2015, outcomes data arrived 2017-2018, performing on the 2-3 year timeline predicted. The companies indeed pushed for earlier approval based on LDL surrogates rather than wait.

• **"Regulators are alarmed over the impact these new drugs could have on statins"** - **Partially validated**: Statins maintained their first-line position due to cost-effectiveness and proven benefits. The feared massive statin replacement didn't materialize, though some statin-intolerant patients did switch.

The fundamental prediction about the necessity of outcomes data proved correct—these became major cardiovascular drugs after, not before, demonstrating hard clinical endpoints.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal regulatory moment for a genuinely important drug class that did achieve blockbuster status while illustrating the surrogate endpoint vs. hard outcomes data dilemma that remains highly relevant to drug development. The clinical and commercial outcomes largely validated the core insights about needing proven cardiovascular benefit for market success.
