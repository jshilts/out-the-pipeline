# Compassion, Drug Prices, and Money (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary responds to a Guardian article about activist Jamie Love's campaign against pharmaceutical patents and high drug prices. The author argues that Love and other campaigners fundamentally misunderstand drug discovery, viewing it as if drugs are simply "picked off trees" rather than being the product of extensive, expensive industrial research. Using the breast cancer drug Kadcyla as a case study, the article traces its development through decades of work: Herceptin's antibody technology from Genentech in the 1980s, the cytotoxic agent maytansine (discovered academically in the 1970s but clinically failed due to toxicity), and Immunogen's antibody-drug conjugate technology. The author contends that while academic research provides general principles, industrial R&D—requiring billions in investment—does the difficult work of "reducing them to practice" as actual medicines. The piece defends value-based pricing, arguing that drug companies need profit incentives to sustain R&D, and suggests the current patent system, despite its flaws, delivers both innovative drugs and eventual generic competition. The author acknowledges market imperfections but maintains the system generally works better than Love's proposed alternatives.

## 2. HISTORY

**Kadcyla's trajectory since 2016:**
- **FDA approval and adoption:** Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) was already FDA-approved in 2013 for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Post-2016, it gained additional approvals: in 2019 for HER2-positive early breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. Patient uptake has been substantial among the HER2-positive subset (~15-20% of breast cancers), though costs remain high (roughly $9,000-14,000 per month in the U.S.), leading to continued access challenges and payer negotiations.

**Drug pricing and patent debates:**
- The high-profile controversy around Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals (2015), EpiPen price hikes (2016), and continued scrutiny of cancer drug prices kept drug pricing reform on the policy agenda.
- Governments increasingly used value-based pricing frameworks (e.g., UK's NICE, Germany's IQWiG) to negotiate discounts and restrict coverage; outcomes-based contracts emerged where payment is tied to real-world effectiveness.
- The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) in the U.S. introduced Medicare price negotiation for select high-cost drugs (initially 10 drugs, expanding over time), caps on out-of-pocket costs, and inflation rebates—the most significant legislative change to pharmaceutical pricing in decades.
- **No widespread compulsory licensing occurred** in major markets for cancer drugs despite activist calls. The UK did not break Roche's Kadcyla patent; instead, confidential discounts were negotiated with the NHS, and access was restricted to specific indications based on cost-effectiveness thresholds.

**Biotech investment and R&D productivity:**
- Biotech stocks experienced boom-bust cycles (2015-2016 correction, then a 2019-2021 boom followed by a 2022-2023 downturn), but sector-wide returns remained mixed. Large pharma continued to acquire innovative biotech companies (e.g., Roche acquired Spark Therapeutics in 2019; Alexion, Kite, and others), validating the model of industry-academic partnerships.
- The Tufts $2.6B drug development cost estimate remained contentious; subsequent studies (e.g., by JAMA, 2020) suggested wide variation by therapeutic area but confirmed high costs and long timelines, especially for oncology.
- **Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)** like Kadcyla became a major drug class: approvals expanded to breast, lymphoma, and other cancers (e.g., Enhertu, Trodelvy, and others), with over a dozen ADCs approved by 2024 and many more in development. ImmunoGen, central to Kadcyla's DM-1 technology, continued ADC partnerships before being acquired by AbbVie in late 2023 for $10.1B, signaling the commercial and clinical success of the ADC platform.

**Innovation dynamics:**
- The role of academic research in originating new drugs remained nuanced. While some breakthrough drugs trace back to academic discoveries, "reduction to practice" (e.g., synthetic optimization, formulation, clinical development, manufacturing) continued to be overwhelmingly driven by industry. Publicly funded research (e.g., NIH, MRC) provided foundational science, but late-stage clinical trials and regulatory filing were almost entirely corporate activities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article largely avoided explicit forward-looking predictions, focusing instead on defending existing market mechanisms. Implicit forecasts and related analysis:

- **Implicit forecast: The patent system will continue delivering innovation while providing eventual generic access.**  
  **Outcome:** Largely held. Generics dominate prescription volume (90%+ in the U.S.), and new drugs continue to emerge via the patent-reward model. However, sustained high prices, access disparities, and political pressure led to reforms (e.g., Medicare negotiation under the IRA) that partially constrain monopoly pricing.

- **Implicit forecast: Value-based pricing will be implemented through pushback and negotiation by payers.**  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Value frameworks (NICE, ICER, etc.) became standard, and confidential discounts/rebates are now routine. Outcomes-based contracts gained traction (e.g., Novartis' Zolgensma, Merck's Keytruda), tying reimbursement to real-world results.

- **Implicit forecast: Compulsory licensing would not be widely adopted in developed countries.**  
  **Outcome:** Correct. No widespread compulsory licensing occurred in the U.S., EU, or UK for cancer drugs; instead, price negotiation and managed-access agreements became the norm. (Note: During COVID-19, compulsory-licensing debates briefly re-emerged for vaccines/therapeutics but did not lead to broad patent-breaking in high-income countries.)

- **Argument that biotech/pharma profits are not "obscene" and that R&D costs are real:**  
  **Follow-up analysis:** Sector-wide profitability and stock performance remained volatile, with many small biotechs struggling to raise capital post-2021. R&D productivity (new drugs per R&D dollar) remained a challenge, and high-profile failures (e.g., Alzheimer's drugs, multiple oncology candidates) underscored the difficulty of drug development. The ADC class, exemplified by Kadcyla, became a major therapeutic advance, validating the multi-decade, industry-led effort to optimize antibody-drug conjugates.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This piece crystallizes durable, high-stakes debates in biopharma: the roles of academic vs. industrial R&D, the justification for high prices via value-based arguments, and the interplay between patents, access, and innovation incentives. The issues it addresses remain central to policy today—seen in the Inflation Reduction Act, ICER evaluations, and ongoing ADC development—and the Kadcyla case study illustrates complex, industry-driven drug development that defies simplistic narratives about "academic compounds snatched by big pharma."
