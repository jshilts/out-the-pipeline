# The Problems That the Synthesis Machine Won't Solve (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses chemist Martin Burke's "synthesis machine" technology, which uses iterative boron-based carbon-carbon bond formation (particularly MIDA boronates) to automate organic molecule construction in a modular fashion, similar to how peptide synthesizers build proteins. The author had initially been impressed by this development, seeing it as potentially transforming medicinal chemistry by enabling rapid, automated synthesis of analog compounds that drug discovery requires.

However, the article pushes back against Burke's broader claims that synthesis has been a major bottleneck preventing progress. The author argues that while Burke's machine will be useful for routine medicinal chemistry work (making analogs and derivatives), synthesis hasn't actually been the rate-limiting factor in drug discovery. Contract synthesis labs already make most molecules accessible, and the real bottleneck is the fundamental scientific challenge of knowing *what molecules to make* - understanding biology well enough to design compounds that will actually work as drugs.

The author also objects to the "printing" metaphor and Burke's suggestion that democratizing synthesis will enable breakthroughs, arguing that the real constraint isn't access to synthesis but rather the difficult creative work of drug design and biological understanding.

## 2. HISTORY

**Burke's Technology Development:**
Following the 2015 article, Martin Burke continued developing his automated synthesis platform. The technology became commercialized, with Burke co-founding **REVOLUTION Medicines** (founded 2015), a pharmaceutical company that has utilized automated synthesis approaches in their drug discovery programs. Burke also continued academic research, expanding the scope of iterative coupling strategies.

**Adoption and Impact:**
The automated synthesis approach has found niche applications primarily in drug discovery settings, particularly for rapid analog synthesis in medicinal chemistry. However, it did not achieve the broad democratization that Burke envisioned in the quoted interview. The technology remains largely in the hands of specialized chemistry labs and pharmaceutical companies rather than becoming widely accessible to biologists or physicists.

**Clinical Outcomes:**
REVOLUTION Medicines advanced several drug candidates into clinical trials, though as of 2024, no drugs discovered using this automated synthesis approach have received FDA approval. The company has focused on cancer therapeutics, with compounds like RMC-4630 (a SHP2 inhibitor) entering clinical studies, but these represent targeted inhibitor development rather than breakthrough "printed molecule" concepts.

The synthesis machine did not transform drug discovery in the fundamental way suggested by early enthusiasm. Pharmaceutical companies still rely heavily on traditional medicinal chemistry, with automated synthesis serving as a productivity tool for analog generation rather than a paradigm-shifting technology.

**Technological Evolution:**
Other automated chemistry platforms emerged, including flow chemistry systems and AI-assisted synthesis planning. However, none of these solved the core problem identified in the article: the challenge of knowing what to make. As of 2024, AI drug discovery companies are pursuing this from the other direction - using machine learning to predict what molecules might work, then synthesizing them - but this remains an unsolved problem.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions in the article:**

• **Burke's vision:** That making synthesis accessible to non-chemists (biologists, physicists) through web-based ordering and automated "printing" would foster creative, out-of-the-box thinking and transform science, medicine, and technology.

**Actual outcomes:**

• **Not achieved:** Despite commercialization efforts, automated synthesis never became broadly accessible to non-specialists. The technology remains complex, expensive, and primarily used by chemistry professionals. No meaningful "molecule printing" service emerged for general scientists.

• **Limited democratization:** The vision of biologists or physicists casually ordering custom molecules online never materialized. Molecule synthesis remains a specialized service requiring significant expertise and high costs, even when automated.

• **Synthesis bottleneck question:** The article's author was largely correct - synthesis has remained a solvable problem through contract labs and internal capabilities, while the fundamental design challenge ("knowing what to make") has continued to be the primary constraint in drug discovery.

• **Broader impact:** Automated synthesis has improved productivity in pharmaceutical R&D for routine analog synthesis but has not fundamentally changed the research paradigm. The same structural families and synthetic strategies dominate modern medicinal chemistry.

The core insight of the article proved prescient: technological advances in synthesis automation cannot overcome the fundamental challenge of rational drug design and biological understanding.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates strong scientific insight and accurate skepticism about technological hype, correctly identifying the real bottleneck in drug discovery. Its analysis remains relevant to ongoing conversations about AI in drug discovery and the gap between synthesis capability and design knowledge.
