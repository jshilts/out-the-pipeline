# How long does a drug molecule stay in its site of action? How long does it need to? (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the growing attention to "residence time" in drug discovery – how long a drug molecule stays bound to its biological target. While one might assume that residence time directly correlates with binding potency, the relationship is not straightforward. Even structurally similar compounds with similar potencies can show significant differences in off-rates and residence times due to complex protein conformational changes and equilibrium states that occur during drug binding.

The review notes that reversible covalent and irreversible binding compounds represent particularly long residence time compounds, having evolved from curiosities to sought-after classes. However, the author cautions that long residence time is not a guaranteed path to success, citing examples where compounds with different in vitro residence times showed similar behavior in animal models or humans. The appropriate residence time depends on the specific biological system being targeted and whether prolonged inhibition is necessary for therapeutic effect. The article concludes that while residence time should be considered as an important parameter, drug discovery still often requires empirical testing to understand what works.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2015 article, residence time has indeed become established as a critical parameter in drug design, though the field has evolved with some surprising nuances:

**Established Clinical Success**: BTK inhibitors like ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, which rely on covalent binding for longer residence time, achieved FDA approval and widespread clinical use. Ibrutinib (approved 2013, before the article) and acalabrutinib (approved 2017) validated the principle that targeted covalent inhibitors with prolonged residence time could be both effective and tolerable.

**Osimertinib Success**: The third-generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib (Tagrisso), approved in 2015, exemplified the residence time strategy by using covalent binding to overcome resistance mutations while maintaining selectivity, becoming a blockbuster drug.

**Methodological Advances**: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and other biophysical techniques became standard tools in drug discovery programs to explicitly measure binding kinetics and residence times. This moved residence time from an academic concept to a routinely measured parameter.

**CAR-T Cell Therapy Integration**: In cell therapy, residence time concepts were extended to CAR-T cells, where the persistence and residence time of engineered cells in patients became a critical factor for both efficacy and safety.

**Continued Empirical Reality**: The article's caution about empirical testing remained true – while many companies incorporated residence time into drug design strategies, predicting in vivo efficacy from in vitro residence time data remained challenging, with multiple high-profile clinical failures where elegant binding kinetics didn't translate to patient benefit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "Many drug discovery teams will pay attention to residence time" and it will become "one more way to get where you're going."
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Correct**. Residence time measurement became incorporated into standard medicinal chemistry workflows across the pharmaceutical industry. Most major pharma companies now routinely measure binding kinetics as part of lead optimization.

• **Prediction**: Long residence time compounds (reversible covalent and irreversible binders) will move from "curiosities, to be treated with some wariness, to perfectly acceptable (and even sought-after) classes."
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Correct**. Covalent inhibitors became a major drug class, exemplified by the commercial success of ibrutinib, osimertinib, and newer KRAS inhibitors like sotorasib (approved 2021). The "wariness" regarding off-target effects was addressed through careful selectivity design.

• **Prediction**: There will continue to be "examples of compounds whose in vitro behavior showed clear and reproducible variations in residence time, but whose behavior in animal models (or humans) hardly budged."
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Correct**. This remained a persistent challenge, with numerous examples where elegant in vitro binding kinetics didn't predict in vivo efficacy, including failed clinical trials where long residence time compounds showed no advantage over competitors.

• **Prediction**: "Often that's just what it comes down to – find some compounds and see what they do."
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Correct**. Despite advances in rational design including residence time considerations, the fundamentally empirical nature of drug discovery persisted. Target validation and understanding of disease biology remained the primary drivers of success or failure.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article was prescient in identifying residence time as an important emerging concept that would become integrated into standard drug discovery practice, while maintaining realistic expectations about its limitations. It successfully predicted the rehabilitation of covalent inhibitors and the continued need for empirical testing, making it a solid mid-to-high-interest piece.
