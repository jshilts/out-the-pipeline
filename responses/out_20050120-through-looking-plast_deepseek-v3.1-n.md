# Through the Looking Plastic (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal anecdote from an organic chemist reflecting on laboratory mishaps involving material incompatibilities between plastic and glassware. The author describes how biologists typically use plastic equipment for aqueous biological systems, while chemists work with aggressive organic solvents (ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, DMSO) that dissolve or degrade many plastics.

The article recounts two specific incidents: a colleague who accidentally dissolved a plastic membrane filter into his HPLC sample when the solvent attacked the wrong type of plastic, and the author's own experience where a syringe's rubber plunger tip swelled up from organic solvent contact, causing the syringe barrel to explode and spray precious late-stage synthetic compound (step 18-19 of a synthesis) across his shirt. Both illustrate the practical challenges when chemical compatibility issues arise at inconvenient moments.

## 2. HISTORY

This essay appeared in January 2005 as part of Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog, which began in 2002 and became one of the most influential chemistry/pharma industry blogs. The blog chronicled drug discovery, laboratory life, and pharmaceutical industry trends through personal and technical perspectives.

**Subsequent developments:**
- **Laboratory equipment evolution**: The early 2000s marked a transitional period. While the compatibility issues described remained fundamentally true (organic solvents still dissolve many plastics), equipment manufacturers increasingly developed chemically-resistant alternatives. PTFE (Teflon), PFA, and specialized fluoropolymer plastics became more widely available for chromatography and solvent handling applications.
- **Syringe technology improvements**: By the late 2000s, chemically-compatible syringes with PTFE plunger tips, glass barrels, and Kalrez seals became standard for organic chemistry applications, largely eliminating the rubber-swelling problem the author encountered.
- **Filter membrane standardization**: Membrane filters became better labeled and standardized by chemical compatibility. The incident of dissolving filters became less common as manufacturers provided clear compatibility charts and color-coding.
- **Regulatory and safety impact**: While not directly resulting from this article, similar compatibility incidents contributed to broader awareness. The pharmaceutical/biotech industry increasingly emphasized material qualification under ICH Q7 and GMP guidelines, requiring documented chemical compatibility studies for processing equipment contacting drug substances.
- **Industry consolidation of suppliers**: Companies like MilliporeSigma, Pall Corporation, and Thermo Fisher expanded their chemically-resistant product lines, making suitable equipment more accessible but also concentrating the supply chain.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no explicit predictions about future developments. It is entirely retrospective, recounting past experiences without forecasting technological or industry trends.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

This is a well-written personal anecdote that resonates with laboratory chemists, and it captures genuine material science challenges that remain relevant. However, it's primarily entertainment/commiseration rather than analysis of biotechnology industry developments, and it has limited broader significance for understanding drug discovery outcomes or clinical successes. It represents a minor footnote in science communication rather than a piece with long-term analytical importance.
