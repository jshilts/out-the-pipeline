# Good Sense Breaks Out, Film at Eleven? (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the reportedly terminated merger talks between Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb in February 2007. The author expresses relief at the news, having long been critical of pharmaceutical mergers, but speculates that the deal collapse was likely due to disagreements over Plavix (the blockbuster anti-clotting drug) and BMS's rising stock price rather than any strategic wisdom about research productivity. The author predicts the deal will likely revive once Plavix legal issues are resolved, noting that Sanofi's chairman Jean-Francois Dehecq has an appetite for acquisitions and that BMS appears to prefer independence.

## 2. HISTORY

**What actually happened:** The Sanofi-Aventis/Bristol-Myers Squibb merger did **not** occur in 2007. The deal remained dormant through the year as Plavix patent litigation played out. Bristol-Myers Squibb successfully defended its independence at the time and remained a standalone company for over a decade.

**Longer-term developments:** In subsequent years, BMS did eventually pursue major deals, most notably acquiring Celgene in 2019 for $74 billion—one of the largest pharmaceutical acquisitions ever. This demonstrates that while BMS resisted the 2007 merger, the company eventually did engage in large-scale M&A activity, though more than a decade later in a different strategic context.

**Plavix outcomes:** Plavix faced patent challenges but ultimately remained a successful drug until generic competition arrived. It peaked as one of the world's best-selling medications, generating billions in annual revenue through the late 2000s and early 2010s.

**Research productivity concerns:** The author's broader skepticism about pharma mergers and their impact on R&D productivity reflects ongoing challenges in the industry, where large mergers have often been followed by pipeline struggles rather than innovation breakthroughs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The Sanofi-Aventis/Bristol-Myers Squibb merger would "come back to life" once Plavix legal issues were settled
  - **Actual outcome**: This merger did not happen in 2007 or subsequently. The deal remained dead.

• **Prediction**: CEOs who "get a taste for engulfing other companies" often "don't seem to know when to quit"
  - **Actual outcome**: While Jean-Francois Dehecq did oversee other Sanofi acquisitions, this specific merger appetite didn't materialize. However, the broader pattern of serial M&A in pharma continued industry-wide.

• **Implicit prediction**: BMS preference for independence might not be sustainable
  - **Actual outcome**: BMS remained independent until 2019, when it made its own major acquisition (Celgene), suggesting the company's stance evolved over more than a decade rather than succumbing to immediate pressure.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While pharmaceutical M&A remains important, this specific deal speculation about a merger that never happened has limited lasting significance. The piece captures a moment in time but doesn't address broader transformative developments.
