# The First Real Anti-Aging Trial in Humans (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a proposed clinical trial using metformin as a general anti-aging therapy, led by principal investigator Nir Barzilai. The trial represents the first attempt to treat aging itself as a medical condition rather than targeting individual age-related diseases. Metformin was chosen strategically for its established safety profile rather than potentially more potent alternatives like rapamycin, which had more spectacular animal results but greater safety uncertainties. The FDA had shown openness to the unprecedented trial design that would measure multiple disease endpoints in an aging population, breaking from traditional drug approval pathways. The research team estimated needing approximately $50 million in funding from public or private sources to conduct the trial.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2015 article, the TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial faced significant funding challenges despite initial FDA interest. By 2018-2019, the trial had secured only a fraction of the needed $50 million, though Barzilai and colleagues continued pursuing funding through various channels including philanthropists and potential industry partners.

Metformin research for longevity continued in observational studies, with research showing mixed results. Large epidemiological studies suggested potential benefits for reducing cancer incidence and cardiovascular events in diabetic populations, though results were inconsistent. Some studies showed modest lifespan extension in certain populations, while others found no significant anti-aging effects.

In 2016, the World Health Organization added aging to its International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), providing legitimacy to treating aging as a medical condition. This represented a conceptual breakthrough that helped advance the field.

However, concrete outcomes from the TAME trial approach remain limited. The trial has had difficulty securing full funding. No definitive human evidence has emerged to show metformin provides broad anti-aging benefits. While metformin is widely used and studied, it has not been proven to extend healthy lifespan in humans.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The trial would receive FDA approval and proceed with $50 million funding
  - **Reality**: The trial gained FDA conceptual approval but struggled significantly with funding, failing to secure the full amount needed to complete the ambitious study design.

• **Prediction**: Metformin would demonstrate anti-aging effects in humans
  - **Reality**: While animal studies continued showing promise, human evidence has remained largely observational and inconclusive. No robust clinical trial has definitively proven metformin extends healthy lifespan.

• **Prediction**: Pharmaceutical companies would enter the anti-aging field after regulatory precedent was set
  - **Reality**: Some companies have pursued longevity research, but not at the scale predicted. Investment has grown but remains cautious compared to expectations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article represents a pivotal moment in the recognition of aging as a treatable medical condition, documenting early regulatory discussions and strategic thinking that helped establish the field despite mixed practical outcomes.
