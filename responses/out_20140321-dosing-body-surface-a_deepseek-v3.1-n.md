# Dosing by Body Surface Area (Mar 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a 2008 FASEB paper that advocated for body surface area (BSA) normalization as the preferred method for extrapolating drug doses from animals to humans, particularly for first-in-human trials. The author notes that the BSA method has been criticized in the literature as having limited scientific foundation, despite its widespread use in oncology for cytotoxic drugs. The central criticism is that the FASEB paper misrepresented one of its key references—citing it for support while that reference actually argued for gradually discontinuing BSA-based dosing in clinical practice. The article highlights controversy around whether BSA dosing is appropriate for obese patients and notes that critics questioned the clinical validity of the entire BSA approach. The debate was unfolding on PubPeer at the time of writing.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 article, the debate over BSA-based dosing has continued, though BSA normalization remains widely used in oncology chemotherapy dosing. The approach's limitations have become more widely acknowledged in the medical literature. Several studies have demonstrated that alternative dosing strategies, such as flat dosing and weight-based dosing, can be equally or more effective for certain drugs, particularly with the rise of immunotherapy and targeted therapies. For immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors, fixed dosing became more common in the 2015-2020 period, as these drugs showed different pharmacokinetic profiles compared to traditional cytotoxics. In 2020-2023, several oncology drugs received FDA approval with flat dosing recommendations, moving away from BSA calculations. However, BSA dosing still dominates for many conventional chemotherapy agents, and there has been no wholesale industry-wide abandonment of the practice. The scientific consensus appears to have shifted toward viewing BSA as one tool among several, with drug-specific approaches becoming more common.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Presumed prediction of continued debate resolution**: The 2014 article appeared to expect the PubPeer discussion to clarify the controversy around BSA dosing validity.
  - **Outcome**: The debate did continue and became more nuanced, but no definitive resolution occurred that eliminated BSA dosing. Instead, the field moved toward more selective use of BSA based on drug-specific pharmacokinetic profiles.

- **Implicit prediction about obesity dosing controversies**: The article mentioned controversies around dosing obese patients using BSA.
  - **Outcome**: This has remained an active area of research, with multiple studies published examining obesity's effects on drug pharmacokinetics. However, universal guidelines remain elusive, and oncology practices vary considerably on whether to use actual body weight, adjusted body weight, or cap BSA calculations for obese patients.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses a real methodological concern in oncology dosing, but this is a niche pharmacokinetic debate that has not fundamentally transformed clinical practice despite ongoing discussion. BSA dosing remains widely used despite its known limitations, making the debate persistent but not transformative.
