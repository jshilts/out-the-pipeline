Here is the analysis of the article.

# [In Praise of Organic Chemistry (November 2013)]

## 1. SUMMARY
This article summarizes a *New York Times* piece that praises the undergraduate organic chemistry ("orgo") course as a valuable, albeit difficult, rite of passage for pre-medical students. The author of the *Times* article, a 42-year-old career-changer taking the course, moves beyond asking "Is this on the test?" to "What are they really testing?". The core argument is that organic chemistry's true pedagogical value isn't just in the specific chemical reactions, which physicians rarely use in practice. Instead, it's a rigorous training ground for a specific cognitive skill: inductive generalization. The course forces students to build intuition and apply general rules, with their many exceptions, to novel problems—a cognitive process directly analogous to medical diagnosis. While some students resort to brute-force memorization, the article posits that learning to reason through problems is the key takeaway, a skill more useful for medicine than recalling the Friedel-Crafts reaction.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent to the article's publication, the debate over organic chemistry's role in medical admissions has intensified and led to concrete policy changes, validating the article's core premise that the course's utility was already being questioned.

The most significant development came in 2022, when the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), a body representing U.S. and Canadian medical schools, announced that the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) would no longer require a knowledge of organic chemistry and physics for the Chemical and Physical Foundations of Living Systems section. This was part of a larger pre-med curriculum overhaul by leading medical schools, including Harvard Medical School, which announced that two semesters of organic chemistry would no longer be a mandatory prerequisite for admission. This shift was framed as an effort to modernize the pre-med curriculum, focusing less on memorization-heavy subjects and more on subjects like statistics, data analysis, and social sciences that reflect the changing nature of medicine. The goal was to broaden access for students from diverse academic backgrounds and reduce a known barrier to entry into the medical field. Interestingly, this mirrors the sentiment from the article, acknowledging that while the knowledge itself may be secondary, the critical thinking the course is supposed to inculcate remains vital.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit, verifiable predictions about the future of organic chemistry requirements or medical education reform. It was primarily an analysis of the pedagogical purpose of the course at the time it was written. It did, however, implicitly assume that the debate over its relevance would continue, a sentiment that proved true. The subsequent policy changes by the AAMC and major medical schools can be seen as the eventual, concrete outcome of this long-standing debate.

## 4. INTEREST
**Interest Score: 6**

The article is interesting for its insightful and early mainstream articulation of a pedagogical debate that would later lead to significant policy shifts in medical education, though its scope is limited to a single academic requirement.
