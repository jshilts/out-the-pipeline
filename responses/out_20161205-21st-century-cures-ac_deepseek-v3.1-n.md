# The 21st Century Cures Act: A Giant Piñata (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines the sprawling 21st Century Cures Act, a nearly 1,000-page healthcare legislation facing potential passage in late 2016. The author describes the bill as a "giant piñata" filled with diverse provisions. Key components include approximately $5 billion in funding over ten years for NIH initiatives including the Precision Medicine Initiative, the BRAIN Initiative, and Biden's Cancer Moonshot, though the author notes this funding would be subject to annual congressional approval rather than guaranteed. The bill also contains significant FDA regulatory reforms aimed at accelerating drug approval by loosening standards, particularly for medical devices, antibiotics, and regenerative therapies. A notable provision directs the FDA to consider "patient experience data" in risk-benefit assessments, which the author views with uncertainty about its practical meaning. The article highlights ongoing controversies, including last-minute removal of provisions that would have exempted certain continuing medical education reporting requirements after objections from Senators Warren and Grassley. The author expresses concern that the legislation's push for faster approvals could lead to approving treatments with insufficient evidence of effectiveness, questioning how this would control healthcare costs while potentially compromising patient safety.

## 2. HISTORY

The 21st Century Cures Act passed and was signed into law in December 2016, fundamentally reshaping drug and medical device regulation in the United States. The most significant concrete impact was the creation and subsequent growth of the **All of Us Research Program** (formerly the Precision Medicine Initiative), which has enrolled over 790,000 participants as of 2024, creating one of the world's largest and most diverse health research databases.

The FDA implemented multiple new approval pathways enabled by the Act:
- **Breakthrough Therapy designation** became widely adopted, significantly accelerating drug development timelines. By 2024, over 300 drugs had received this designation, with approval times reduced by several years compared to traditional pathways.
- **Real-world evidence** provisions led to FDA accepting data from sources beyond traditional clinical trials for certain approvals, though this has been applied more cautiously than initially anticipated.
- **Regenerative medicine** provisions established a expedited framework, though the FDA has faced enforcement challenges against numerous unapproved stem cell clinics that emerged claiming Cures Act protection.

The $1.8 billion **Cancer Moonshot** funding led to notable initiatives including the Cancer Research Data Ecosystem and expanded clinical trial networks, though progress toward the goal of accelerating cancer research has been incremental rather than revolutionary.

The opioid crisis funding ($1 billion to states) was distributed, but subsequent data shows opioid overdose deaths continued rising dramatically through 2021-2022, suggesting the scale of funding was insufficient for the crisis magnitude.

Most significantly, the Act's changes to FDA evidentiary standards did not result in the widespread approval of ineffective drugs that critics feared. Instead, real-world uptake by physicians and payers has been more conservative, with most accelerated approvals requiring post-market confirmatory studies. The Act's most lasting impact has been institutionalizing patient advocacy input into drug approval decisions and establishing frameworks for adaptive trial designs and use of real-world evidence—changes that have become permanent fixtures of regulatory science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: "I really don't think that there's this huge backlog of wonderful therapies piling up behind a big FDA roadblock"
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Post-Act data showed no dramatic surge in breakthrough drug approvals. While approval times decreased modestly, the pipeline of genuinely transformative therapies remained limited, supporting the author's skepticism about regulatory bottlenecks being the primary constraint on medical innovation.

- **Prediction**: "You can instruct everyone to collect less data, but then you will approve - and ask people and their insurance companies to pay for - more things that don't actually work"
  - **Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. The FDA did approve more drugs using less conventional evidence (real-world data, surrogate endpoints), creating some controversies over drugs with uncertain clinical benefits. However, the scale of problematic approvals was smaller than predicted, partly because payers and practitioners proved more conservative than regulators in adopting accelerated-approval drugs.

- **Prediction about funding stability**: The author noted that NIH funding would be "subject to yearly congressional vote" rather than guaranteed
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. While the major initiatives received initial funding, subsequent administrations have indeed had to fight for continuing appropriations, particularly for the Cancer Moonshot, creating funding uncertainty that the author correctly anticipated.

- **Prediction**: "I'm never sure if these things [councils and collaborative bodies] are useful or not"
  - **Outcome**: **Mixed**. Some collaborative bodies established under the Act produced valuable coordination (like the Oncology Center of Excellence), while others became bureaucratic layers with unclear impact, confirming the author's uncertainty was warranted.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article demonstrates remarkable prescience about the Cures Act's actual—rather than hyped—impact, correctly identifying that regulatory reform alone wouldn't create a pipeline of breakthrough therapies while accurately predicting the funding continuity challenges. Its balanced assessment of risk-benefit debates avoids both industry optimism and reflexive opposition, focusing instead on empirical questions about evidence standards.
