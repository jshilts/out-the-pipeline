# The Pricing Weapon (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Abbott's controversial decision to increase the price of its HIV drug Norvir (ritonavir) by approximately four times in December 2003—from about $20/day to $8.57/day at the lower 100 mg dose. Norvir, originally introduced as a frontline protease inhibitor, had evolved into an unusual role as a pharmacokinetic booster. The drug inhibits CYP3A, a liver enzyme that metabolizes medications, and when added to other HIV cocktails, it increases the blood levels and potency of co-administered drugs. While Norvir was originally dosed at 1200 mg/day as a standalone antiretroviral, by 2004 it was primarily used at just 100 mg/day as an adjunct. That drop in per-patient dosage substantially reduced Abbott's revenue expectations. The author suggests the price hike served dual purposes: to better monetize Norvir and to disadvantage competing combination therapies. Because Abbott's newer fixed-dose combination Kaletra already contained ritonavir, inflating the price of standalone Norvir raised the cost of rival regimens relative to Abbott's own product.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years after the article, the Norvir pricing controversy triggered investigations and lawsuits. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry, and advocacy groups, state attorneys general, and competitors challenged Abbott's pricing practices as anti-competitive. In 2007, Abbott settled with several states and agreed not to block generic versions of Norvir but did not admit wrongdoing; the company also offered discounts to federal programs. Generics of ritonavir entered the U.S. market around 2005–2006, easing long-term affordability. Ritonavir's role as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other protease inhibitors (and later, integrase inhibitors) became standard practice and was incorporated into multiple fixed-dose combinations in subsequent years, including boosted atazanavir, darunavir, and elvitegravir regimens—cementing low-dose ritonavir's utility far beyond its modest direct antiretroviral activity. The strategy of charging above-market prices for a small booster dose persisted, however. Gilead later marketed cobicistat (branded as Tybost) as an alternative pharmacoenhancer, specifically to avoid paying royalty-inflated ritonavir prices and to reduce ritonavir's modest side effects and drug–drug interactions. Cobicistat is not a protease inhibitor but functions similarly as a CYP3A inhibitor, and it is used in several modern single-tablet regimens (e.g., Genvoya, Stribild, Symtuza) as an alternative boosting agent to ritonavir.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article included explicit and implicit predictions:**

- **Prediction:** "Companies can charge what they want… but that doesn't mean that it's always a good idea," and "we pharmaceutical companies might not have the pricing power that we once did. If we keep doing this kind of thing, we're going to end up with no pricing power at all, and people will be clapping and cheering while we all tip over into the trash."

  - **Outcome:** By contemporary standards, this prediction was both prescient and overstated. Pharmaceutical pricing power did subsequently face sustained public and political backlash, with notorious examples including Martin Shkreli's 2015 price hikes, insulin pricing scandals, and Sovaldi pricing debates, leading to prominent congressional hearings, lawsuits, and new policy frameworks. In HIV specifically, high prices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), continued patent strategies around pharmacoenhancers, and frequent delays for generics kept pricing power in focus. The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced Medicare drug price negotiation, and similar proposals targeted pharmacy benefit managers and rebate structures. However, the industry did not "tip over into the trash"—instead, companies adapted with patient assistance programs, differential international pricing, and formulary strategies, while successfully defending many patents and maintaining profitability.

- **Implicit prediction:** Abbott's move might provoke backlash, bad press, and competitive responses.

  - **Outcome:** This proved accurate. Abbott faced FTC scrutiny, multi-state legal challenges, and widespread criticism from physicians and advocates. Competitors ultimately developed alternative pharmacoenhancers (e.g., cobicistat) specifically to circumvent reliance on ritonavir. Payers increasingly managed boosted-PI regimens through formulary restrictions and step therapy, and clinicians shifted toward unboosted integrase inhibitors and fixed-dose combinations where feasible.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article perceptively diagnosed a strategic shift in pharmaceutical pricing—leveraging a small essential ingredient to disadvantage competitors and maximize revenue. It foreshadowed broader pricing-power debates that later engulfed the industry, making it a durable case study of both drug-market dynamics and healthcare ethics.
