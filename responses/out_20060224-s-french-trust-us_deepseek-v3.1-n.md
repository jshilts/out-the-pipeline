# What's French for (24 Feb 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2006 commentary discusses Sanofi-Aventis's obesity drug Acomplia (rimonabant). At the time, the company had recently met with analysts about the drug's regulatory status but revealed few details about the FDA's concerns. The article notes that Sanofi-Aventis still planned to launch the drug later that year and intended to meet with the FDA in March. The author speculates that the company's silence on the specific FDA concerns likely indicated significant problems rather than minor issues, arguing that if the issues were small, the company would have been transparent about them.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent history of Acomplia proved the author's skepticism to be well-founded:

**Regulatory Path:**
- Acomplia was eventually **FDA rejected in June 2007** due to concerns about psychiatric side effects, including depression and suicidal ideation
- The drug had already been **approved in Europe in 2006** but was later suspended by the European Medicines Agency in October 2008

**Post-Market Outcomes:**
- While briefly available in Europe, Acomplia demonstrated serious safety issues that led to its market withdrawal
- Multiple studies confirmed increased risks of psychiatric adverse events, including depression and suicidal thoughts
- The drug's failure marked a significant setback for Sanofi-Aventis, which had projected Acomplia as a potential blockbuster drug with billions in annual sales

**Broader Impact of CB1 Receptor Antagonists:**
- Acomplia's failure cast doubt on the entire class of CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists for obesity treatment
- No other CB1 antagonist drugs achieved successful widespread clinical use for obesity following this experience
- The mechanism proved too risky for this indication, leading most companies to abandon this therapeutic approach

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's implicit prediction that FDA concerns were significant proved accurate:
- **Prediction:** The author suggested that silence from Sanofi-Aventis indicated serious FDA concerns
- **Outcome:** The FDA did indeed reject Acomplia in 2007 due to major safety concerns about psychiatric side effects

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This short commentary demonstrates prescient skepticism that proved correct, highlighting the importance of reading between regulatory disclosure lines. The Acomplia case became an important example of drug development failure and the risks of targeting cannabinoid receptors for obesity.
