# Blasting Your Way In (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the challenge of delivering therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), particularly for drugs that fall outside typical size and polarity ranges. The author highlights focused ultrasound as an emerging technique that has shown promise in animal experiments since 2001 for temporarily opening the tight cellular junctions of the brain's vasculature. The method can be performed non-invasively with targeted precision, especially when combined with microbubbles to reduce required energy levels.

The technique is presented as particularly relevant for delivering biologics and hybrid molecules—including antibodies, antibody conjugates, siRNA, viral vectors, and PEGylated drugs—that normally cannot efficiently cross the BBB. The article emphasizes the potential application against gliomas and Alzheimer's disease, while noting that ultrasound alone had shown effectiveness in breaking up amyloid plaques in mouse models. Several clinical trials were already ongoing at the time of publication.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2015 article, focused ultrasound for BBB disruption has progressed significantly, though full clinical adoption has been measured:

**Clinical Development**: Multiple clinical trials have advanced, with several reaching Phase II stages. Notably, work has progressed in applying focused ultrasound BBB opening for conditions including glioblastoma, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological disorders.

**Regulatory and Clinical Milestones**: The technique has achieved important validation milestones. Studies have demonstrated safety and feasibility in human patients, with researchers successfully showing that therapeutic agents (including antibodies and other biologics) can be delivered to targeted brain regions with precision.

**Alzheimer's Applications**: Research in Alzheimer's disease has expanded substantially, with multiple groups investigating focused ultrasound both for drug delivery and for its potential direct effects on amyloid pathology. The Insightec ExAblate system and similar technologies have been used in clinical studies.

**Technical Refinements**: The methodology has evolved with improved targeting accuracy, better microbubble formulations, and more sophisticated ultrasound control systems that allow for precise, temporary BBB opening without significant tissue damage.

**Commercial Activity**: Companies like Insightec have continued developing focused ultrasound systems, with increasing focus on neurological applications beyond their established use in essential tremor treatment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions about focused ultrasound technology:

• **"Having a technique to blast things into the brain will probably come in handy"** - This prediction has proven valid. Focused ultrasound BBB disruption has become an established research tool and is advancing toward clinical utility, with numerous ongoing trials and growing research interest.

• **Antibodies, siRNA, viral vectors, and PEGylated drugs would benefit** - These predictions have been borne out, with published studies demonstrating successful delivery of antibodies and other biologics using focused ultrasound in both animal models and human trials.

• **Applications against glioma would be appropriate** - This has evolved as predicted, with multiple clinical trials investigating focused ultrasound for glioblastoma treatment and drug delivery.

• **Alzheimer's disease would be a key target** - This prediction was accurate, as Alzheimer's has become one of the most active areas of focused ultrasound BBB research, with several clinical programs underway.

• **The ultrasound-alone approach for amyloid plaque disruption might be more difficult in humans** - This has proven prescient, as while research continues, the practical challenges of scaling mouse-model ultrasound parameters to human brains remain significant.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified a genuinely important emerging technology at a crucial developmental stage. Focused ultrasound for BBB disruption has maintained steady scientific momentum and represents one of the more promising approaches to a fundamental challenge in neurotherapeutics.
