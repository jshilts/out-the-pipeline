# A New Look at Phenotypic Screening (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary analyzes a Novartis-led re-evaluation of whether phenotypic screening is unusually effective at delivering "first-in-class" drugs. The authors reviewed 113 first-in-class FDA approvals from 1999-2013 and found that 78 came from target-based approaches, while only 35 came from systems-based approaches. When using a strict definition of phenotypic screening—evaluation of random compound libraries against biological systems without target knowledge—only 8 drugs qualified as "pure phenotypic." The authors distinguished this from "chemocentric" approaches that modify known pharmacophores or use natural products.

The analysis also revealed that target-based projects averaged 20 years from initial discovery to approved drug, while systems-based approaches took 25 years, with half the difference occurring post-patent publication. Most pure phenotypic successes clustered in anti-infectives or antiproliferatives, where cellular readouts are clearest. The authors argued that target-based drug discovery is healthier than some assumed, and that high-throughput screening and human genome sequencing might only be starting to show their full impact. They called for strengthening phenotypic screening as an evolved discipline rather than reverting to older methods.

## 2. HISTORY
The phenotypic vs. target-based debate continued intensively post-2014, with significant evolution in both approaches:

**Continued Emphasis on Phenotypic Screening**: In 2015, Altshuler et al. (then at Vertex) summarized the industry experience, noting that while target-based approaches dominated pharmaceutical R&D investment, phenotypic approaches generated a disproportionate share of breakthrough medicines. The period saw a modest resurgence in phenotypic screening infrastructure, including improved readouts for CNS diseases, which the 2014 article noted were difficult.

**Success of Cited Drugs**: Of the "pure phenotypic" examples mentioned, several had significant post-approval histories. Alemtuzumab (targeting CD52, initially characterized after antibody development) achieved multiple sclerosis and leukemia indications. Bedaquiline became critical for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, demonstrating phenotypic screening's value where targets were unclear—though significant cardiac safety concerns emerged. Trametinib (MEK inhibitor for BRAF-mutant melanoma) exemplified how some "phenotypic" hits eventually revealed their targets, blurring the strict classification.

**Real-World Drug Discovery Outcomes**: Overall industry data from 2010-2020 showed target-based discovery continued to dominate pharmaceutical pipelines. However, approval rates for
