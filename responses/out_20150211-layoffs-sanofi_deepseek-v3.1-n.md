# Layoffs at Sanofi (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The short blog post from February 11, 2015 reported that Sanofi had announced internal layoffs, confirmed through people "in a position to know," with specifics still emerging at the time of publication. The post noted these cuts appeared timed ahead of naming a new CEO. An update appended the same day linked to a FierceBiotech report stating Sanofi was laying off 100 Genzyme staffers in an R&D reorganization.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the February 2015 layoffs at Sanofi/Genzyme, broader restructuring continued. In October 2015, Sanofi announced it would cut roughly $1.6 billion in costs through 2018, with hundreds of additional U.S. R&D jobs slated for elimination specifically in diabetes and cardiovascular research as clinical programs were halted or deprioritized. By 2016–2017, Sanofi had exited or sharply reduced internal discovery in several therapeutic areas. The restructuring aligned with competitive and regulatory shifts, including FDA rejections of Sanofi diabetes candidates and the rise of SGLT-2 and GLP-1 therapies that impacted older insulin franchises. Payouts and collaborations were used to refill the pipeline; for example, Sanofi made a substantial equity investment in Regeneron in 2015–2016. Sanofi's later-period growth increasingly hinged on Dupixent (dupilumab), approved in 2017, which became a multi-billion-dollar blockbuster for inflammatory conditions. Vaccine and rare-disease units generally retained investment while diabetes R&D scaled back. The 2015 cuts therefore marked the start of a multi-year pivot away from internal discovery in certain metabolic/orphan areas and toward external innovation and higher-margin biologics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- The brief article made no explicit forward-looking statements and focused instead on reporting the immediate layoff news and noting the odd timing relative to CEO succession.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The post is a timely industry note but primarily documents an internal restructuring detail; its longer-term significance is mostly as one early marker in Sanofi's multi-year pivot rather than a standalone milestone, limiting broader interest.
