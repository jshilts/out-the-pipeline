# A Fungal Origin For Alzheimer's? (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses a Nature paper claiming evidence of fungal infections in brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients. Researchers from Madrid used antibody staining and nested PCR to detect fungal cells and DNA in brain regions of Alzheimer's patients, with no such signs found in control samples. The fungal structures appeared in both neurons and cerebrovasculature. Multiple fungal species were identified across different patients.

The article raises questions about the strength of this evidence, particularly regarding potential antibody cross-reactivity and whether the microscopic structures are definitively fungal. A crucial cause-and-effect question is posed: if fungal infection is associated with Alzheimer's, does it cause the disease or result from it? The author notes that antifungal drugs could potentially be tested as treatments, referencing two cases where cryptococcal meningitis initially presented like Alzheimer's but improved with antifungal therapy.

## 2. HISTORY
The fungal hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has not gained mainstream acceptance in the years following this 2015 publication. Despite the promising initial findings, subsequent research has largely failed to replicate or validate these results, and the theory remains highly controversial and marginal within the broader Alzheimer's research community.

Key developments include: No FDA-approved antifungal treatments for Alzheimer's have emerged. Large-scale clinical trials of antifungal drugs specifically for Alzheimer's treatment have not materialized. The dominant research focus has remained on amyloid, tau, and other established pathways. The fungal infection theory is now generally regarded as speculative rather than a well-substantiated alternative hypothesis. The 2015 paper's lead researchers continued publishing on this topic, but their work has not fundamentally shifted the direction of Alzheimer's research or treatment approaches.

The field has instead seen continued investment in amyloid-targeting therapies, tau-based approaches, and other mechanisms, with drugs like aducanumab (controversially approved in 2021) and lecanemab (approved in 2023) emerging from these more established research pathways.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article anticipated several specific developments:

• **"This hypothesis goes into the 'well worth testing' category, because the barriers to such testing aren't high, and the potential returns are so great."** - Despite this assessment, the hypothesis has not been systematically tested in large clinical trials. The low barrier to testing did not translate into substantial clinical investigation.

• **"I hope someone takes the authors up on it!"** - While some limited follow-up studies occurred, the scientific community did not broadly "take up" this research direction in the way the author hoped.
后
• **Implicit prediction of potential "breakthrough" if antifungal treatment worked** - No such breakthrough occurred. No evidence has emerged that antifungal therapy meaningfully improves Alzheimer's symptoms.

• **Comparison to "bacterial origin of ulcers was a long shot, too, and that one was completely correct"** - This analogy has not proven accurate. The fungal-Alzheimer's hypothesis has not followed the trajectory of H. pylori and ulcers, which achieved widespread acceptance through robust replication and successful treatment trials.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article addresses an intriguing alternative hypothesis that challenged conventional thinking about Alzheimer's disease. While the fungal theory has not proven out, the discussion illustrates how scientific hypotheses are evaluated and how difficult it is to shift research paradigms, even with suggestive preliminary evidence.
