# Publishing Without Consent (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article, a short commentary by Derek Lowe, describes a recurring but under‑reported problem in academic research: a post‑doctoral fellow (or graduate student) publishing a manuscript that contains data generated in the lab without the permission of the principal investigator (PI).  Lowe notes that, when the work is funded by the NIH, the data are considered property of the institution and the PI (as the grantee) controls when and where the results are released.  He contrasts this with industry, where employment contracts explicitly assign all data and inventions to the company, making “rogue” patent filings virtually unheard of.  The piece also mentions the German system, where inventors receive a statutory share of any profits, which can create its own disputes over inventorship.  Overall, the commentary warns that academic researchers sometimes feel a personal claim to the data they generated, but legally the ownership rests with the funding institution or employer.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑doc publishing disputes after 2012**  
- **Policy reinforcement:** The NIH has continued to emphasize its “Data Management and Sharing” policy (finalized in 2020) and the requirement that institutions maintain clear authorship and data‑ownership agreements.  Many universities now require written “publication agreements” between PIs and trainees at the start of a project.  This trend reflects a response to the type of conflict Lowe described, though no single high‑profile lawsuit has reshaped the law.  
- **Reported cases:** A handful of disputes have been documented in the literature and in COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) case archives (e.g., a 2015 dispute at a U.S. university over a manuscript submitted without PI approval; a 2018 case in the UK where a post‑doc posted a pre‑print on bioRxiv that the PI later contested).  In most instances the outcome was an internal resolution—re‑traction of the manuscript, amendment of authorship, or mediation—rather than litigation.  
- **Pre‑print culture:** The rapid growth of bioRxiv and medRxiv has added a new layer to the problem.  Because pre‑prints can be posted without formal journal review, some PIs have instituted “pre‑print approval” policies to avoid unilateral posting.  This shift has reduced the number of outright “rogue” journal submissions but has introduced new disputes over timing and credit.  

**Industry patenting disputes**  
- **No major rogue filings:** Since 2012 there have been no widely reported cases of former employees filing patents on work that was developed while employed, in contrast to the academic scenario.  Companies continue to rely on standard employment agreements that assign IP to the employer, and enforcement through litigation remains rare.  
- **German inventorship rules:** The German “Erfinder‑beteiligung” (inventor profit‑sharing) regime remains in force.  Companies typically negotiate “invention assignment” clauses that channel any statutory inventor share back to the firm, so the practical effect on internal disputes has been minimal.  

**Broader impact**  
- The discussion sparked by Lowe’s piece contributed to a modest increase in awareness of authorship and data‑ownership issues, prompting several institutions (e.g., MIT, Stanford, University of Cambridge) to publish guidance documents on “authorship consent” between PIs and trainees.  
- The issue has not escalated into a systemic crisis; rather, it has become a routine part of research‑group management and of the training curriculum for graduate students and post‑docs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit, quantified predictions.  Implicit expectations can be extracted:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Academic “rogue” publishing will remain a rare but recurring problem** | True.  A few isolated disputes have been reported each year, but no epidemic has emerged. |
| **Industry will not see comparable “rogue” patent filings** | True.  No notable cases of former employees filing patents on company‑owned work have surfaced. |
| **German inventorship rules could cause “elbow‑throwing” but will not change ownership** | Accurate.  The statutory inventor share exists, but companies routinely contract it away, so ownership disputes remain uncommon. |
| **Researchers will increasingly feel that data they generate are “theirs”** | Partially true.  The rise of pre‑print servers has amplified the sense of personal ownership, leading to new (pre‑print) consent policies. |

Overall, the article’s informal forecasts have held up; the landscape has evolved (especially with pre‑prints) but the core contrast between academia and industry remains as described.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The piece is moderately interesting: it highlights a persistent, real‑world conflict that affects many labs, and its observations have influenced institutional policy, but the topic is niche and has not led to major legal or scientific upheavals.
