# The Latest Thing (February 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article serves as a skeptical retrospective on the "computer-aided rational drug design" movement of the mid-to-late 1980s. The author describes how companies like Vertex promoted computational approaches as the future of drug discovery, claiming they would replace traditional methods like random screening and analog synthesis. Pharmaceutical companies, including Lilly with its showcase supercomputer facility and Agouron with its 3-D molecular docking visualization rooms, invested heavily in computational infrastructure to avoid being left behind.

The piece characterizes the 1980s wave as "relentlessly oversold" and suggests that the technology of that era was fundamentally inadequate for the task. While companies could generate impressive visualizations of molecules docking with targets, the author questions whether these representations reflected biological reality. The article concludes that the "first wave" of computational drug design largely failed to deliver on its promises, setting up a pattern where new technologies are hyped before they're truly ready for practical application.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Aftermath (2002-2010):** Following this 2002 article, computational methods in drug discovery continued to evolve significantly. Structure-based drug design became more reliable as X-ray crystallography improved and computational power increased. Important successes emerged:
- Gleevec (imatinib), approved in 2001, was partly developed using structure-based approaches
- HIV protease inhibitors like ritonavir benefited from structural information
- Companies like Vertex eventually succeeded with drugs like Telaprevir (approved 2011), though this came decades after their initial hype

**Structural Biology and Computational Advances (2010-2020):** 
- Cryo-electron microscopy revolutionized structural biology, making it faster and cheaper to obtain protein structures
- Molecular dynamics simulations became more accurate with improved force fields
- Fragment-based drug discovery gained traction as a more practical approach than purely computational methods
- High-throughput screening remained dominant for lead discovery despite computational advances

**Recent Developments (2020-Present):**
- AlphaFold2 (2020) provided highly accurate protein structure predictions, potentially transforming structure-based drug design
- AI/machine learning platforms (e.g., DeepMind, Exscientia) began delivering drug candidates to clinical trials
- Computational methods are now standard tools but remain supplementary rather than replacement for experimental validation
- Many companies still rely heavily on traditional screening and medicinal chemistry

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in the Article:**

• **Vertex and similar companies would eventually deliver drugs** - Partially correct. Vertex succeeded with cystic fibrosis drugs (Kalydeco 2012, Orkambi 2015) and hepatitis C treatments, but these came 20+ years after the 1980s hype cycle described, and required much more than pure computational design.

• **Computational tools would remain inadequate in the near term** - Generally accurate. Even by 2002 standards, purely computational approaches struggled with accuracy. It took until the 2010s for computational methods to become genuinely useful in routine drug discovery.

• **Rational drug design wouldn't replace traditional methods** - Correct. Random screening, high-throughput screening, and medicinal chemistry optimization remain central to drug discovery. Computational tools are now used to enhance rather than replace these approaches.

• **Technology hype cycles would continue** - Correct. The pattern described (overselling, followed by disappointment, followed by gradual maturing) has repeated with genomics, RNAi, CRISPR, and AI-based drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article demonstrates prescient skepticism about technology hype cycles and provides valuable historical context about computational drug discovery's evolution. It captures a turning point where computational methods were transitioning from pure hype to gradually becoming useful tools, making it relevant for understanding the current AI-driven drug discovery landscape.
