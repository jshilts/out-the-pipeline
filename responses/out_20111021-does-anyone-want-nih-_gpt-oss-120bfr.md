# Does Anyone Want the NIH's Drug Screening Program? (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary by Derek Lowe highlighted growing concerns about the NIH **Molecular Libraries Program (MLP)**, a $70 million‑per‑year initiative launched in 2004 to give academic researchers access to high‑throughput screening (HTS) facilities and to generate “probe” molecules for biology. The program was funded through the NIH Common Fund and was slated to be “weaned” off that source and re‑hosted by individual NIH institutes beginning in 2012.  

Lowe reported that the transition was already proving politically sensitive: NIH officials admitted difficulty finding a new home, and screening‑center directors (e.g., John Reed of the Sanford‑Burnham Medical Research Institute) complained that industry collaborations were modest and that the long‑term commitment was unclear. The piece asked whether the MLP had delivered enough value to justify continued federal support.

## 2. HISTORY  

**2012‑2014 – Funding shift and gradual shutdown**  
* The Common Fund withdrew its core $70 M annual allocation in FY 2013. Individual institutes were invited to adopt parts of the program, but few did so at comparable scale.  
* By FY 2014 the NIH announced the **termination of the Molecular Libraries Program** as a Common Fund activity. The remaining HTS centers were either closed or re‑purposed under institute‑specific contracts.  

**2015‑2020 – Legacy assets and the NIH Small Molecule Repository**  
* The **NIH Small Molecule Repository (SMR)**, which housed the ~300 k‑compound “MLPCN” library, was retained and made publicly available to academic investigators via a request‑based system.  
* The **NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC)**, an intramural HTS facility at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), continued to run screens for disease‑relevant targets, but its focus shifted toward translational projects rather than open‑access probe generation.  

**Probe output and downstream impact**  
* Over its ~10‑year lifespan the MLP produced **≈ 400‑500 chemical probes** that were deposited in the public domain (e.g., the **MLPCN Probe Collection**).  
* A minority of these probes were adopted by the broader research community; notable examples include **JQ1** (BET bromodomain inhibitor) and **GSK‑J1** (SIRT2 inhibitor). Both have been widely used as tool compounds, and JQ1 helped catalyze the BET‑inhibitor drug class, leading to FDA‑approved drugs such as **pomalidomide** (though pomalidomide’s development pre‑dated JQ1).  
* Few probes progressed directly into clinical candidates. The most cited “success story” is the **BCR‑ABL inhibitor imatinib**, but that drug originated from industry, not the MLP. Overall, **no FDA‑approved drug can be traced directly to an MLP‑generated probe**.  

**Industry engagement**  
* Industry collaborations remained limited. The program’s public‑access model was attractive for early‑stage biology but did not align well with pharmaceutical companies’ proprietary pipelines. Consequently, the anticipated “industry‑style” partnership model never materialized at scale.  

**Policy and funding landscape**  
* The MLP’s demise coincided with broader NIH Common Fund reforms that emphasized **short‑term, high‑impact initiatives** (e.g., the BRAIN Initiative, the Cancer Moonshot).  
* In 2020 the NIH launched the **Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP)** and the **NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research**, both of which allocate resources for target validation but rely on **industry‑driven consortia** rather than a centralized HTS service.  

**Current status (2026)**  
* The NIH still offers **access to the SMR library** (≈ 300 k compounds) through a modest fee‑for‑service model.  
* Academic HTS capacity has largely migrated to **private core facilities** (e.g., the Broad Institute’s Drug Repurposing Hub, the Scripps Research Institute’s Molecular Screening Center) and to **commercial contract research organizations (CROs)**.  
* The original vision of a **permanent, federally funded, open‑access screening platform for academia** has not been reinstated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **The program would need a new home and might be scaled back** | The Common Fund withdrew funding; the program was formally terminated in 2014. | Accurate – the program was indeed scaled back dramatically. |
| **Industry would provide modest funding, leaving the program financially vulnerable** | Industry collaborations remained limited; most centers could not replace the Common Fund dollars. | Accurate – lack of industry support contributed to the shutdown. |
| **If the NIH does not commit long‑term, the $100 M+ investment would be wasted** | The investment yielded a sizable probe collection, but few downstream drugs; the library remains useful but the broader translational impact is modest. | Partially accurate – the scientific value of the probe set persists, but the hoped‑for pipeline of new drugs did not materialize. |
| **The initiative could become a model for academic‑industry drug discovery** | No lasting model emerged; subsequent NIH efforts (AMP, Blueprint) rely on industry‑led consortia rather than a central HTS service. | Inaccurate – the MLP did not become the template for future collaborations. |
| **The program would survive political scrutiny because of its scientific merit** | Political and budgetary pressures led to its termination despite scientific output. | Inaccurate – merit alone was insufficient to secure funding. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in U.S. biomedical policy and raises questions that remain relevant (sustainable academic drug discovery infrastructure). Its historical importance is moderate: the program’s rise and fall illustrate the challenges of large‑scale, publicly funded HTS, but the piece does not predict any major breakthrough that reshaped the field.
