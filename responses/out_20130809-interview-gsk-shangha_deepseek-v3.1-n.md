# An Interview With A GSK Shanghai Scientist (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses an interview with Liu Xuebin, a former GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) scientist in Shanghai, who was involved in a research scandal. Liu had worked extensively on multiple sclerosis research, resulting in a Nature Medicine publication in January 2010, after which he was promoted to associate director of GSK's global neuro-inflammation center in Shanghai. However, an internal review found misrepresented data in the paper, leading to Liu's suspension in June 2013 and subsequent resignation. Liu acknowledged a different industry culture compared to his previous NIH experience and mentioned inadequate attention to compliance and collaboration reporting. The author, Derek Lowe, critiques the emphasis on racing to publish in journals as unusual for pharmaceutical industry research, noting that companies typically prioritize patenting and clinical development over journal publications for validation.

## 2. HISTORY

The GSK China scandal mentioned in this article was part of broader compliance and corruption issues that plagued the company in China between 2013-2014. In July 2013, Chinese authorities began investigating GSK for widespread bribery allegations involving doctors and hospitals. The scandal resulted in a **$489 million fine** in September 2014 for corrupt practices including funneling money through travel agencies to bribe healthcare professionals.

Regarding the scientific aspect, the **Nature Medicine paper was retracted** in November 2013 (just months after this interview), titled "Identification of a new therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis," involving 18 co-authors including Liu as first author. The retraction notice cited "several figure panels containing misrepresented data". This case highlighted broader concerns about research integrity in pharmaceutical industry publications.

The GSK Shanghai research center, which opened in 2007 as part of GSK's major investment in China, faced significant operational challenges following these scandals. Many senior executives were replaced, and the company implemented extensive compliance reforms across its China operations. However, the long-term impact on MS drug development specifically from this research remains unclear - **no major MS drug has emerged from this research program** in the subsequent decade.

GSK's overall MS portfolio continued with other approaches, but the specific targets identified in this retracted research did not translate into successful clinical candidates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article didn't contain specific forward-looking predictions about drug development timelines or market outcomes. However, it highlighted several implicit expectations about pharmaceutical research culture and validation processes that can be evaluated:

- **Implicit assumption about publishing culture**: The article suggested that racing to publish in high-profile journals was unusual for industry R&D. This concern about publication pressure compromising research integrity proved prescient, as the paper was retracted months later and similar issues have been reported across pharmaceutical research.

- **Expectation about internal validation**: The author implied that solid research would be validated through internal development rather than journal acceptance. The retraction confirmed that the scientific foundation was indeed problematic, supporting the author's skepticism about prioritizing journal publication over rigorous internal validation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article ranks below average in long-term importance as it primarily documents a specific corporate scandal with limited broader scientific or clinical implications. While offering insight into research integrity challenges and pharmaceutical industry culture, the case did not significantly impact MS drug development or broader biotech trends, remaining more relevant as a corporate compliance case study than a pivotal scientific moment.
