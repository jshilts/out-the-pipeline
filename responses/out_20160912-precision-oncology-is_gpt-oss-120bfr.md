# Precision Oncology Isn't Quite There Yet (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article critiques the hype surrounding “precision oncology” – the practice of using a patient’s tumor DNA sequence to select targeted therapies. Vinay Prasad’s view, echoed here, is that while sequencing has become cheap and widespread, the clinical payoff is minimal. The author notes three main problems (as of 2016):  

1. **Scarcity of matched drugs** – only a handful of FDA‑approved agents existed for the many mutations found in solid tumours, and published reports of dramatic, genomics‑driven responses were rare (≈ 32 cases).  
2. **Unreliable “actionability”** – many detected mutations are not true drivers, so targeting them often yields no benefit.  
3. **Tumour heterogeneity and evolution** – a single biopsy may miss subclones; eliminating a drug‑sensitive clone can allow resistant clones to dominate, leading to short‑lived responses.  

The piece warns that clinics advertising “personalised” regimens are overstating what is currently possible and that the field may never deliver on its promise without major scientific breakthroughs.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Clinical approvals and “tumour‑agnostic” successes  
- **2017‑2024:** FDA granted **tumour‑agnostic** approvals for several agents that directly address the article’s criticism about limited drug‑mutation matches:  
  - **Pembrolizumab** for MSI‑H/dMMR (2017) and later for high TMB (2020).  
  - **Larotrectinib** (2018) and **Entrectinib** (2020) for NTRK‑fusion cancers.  
  - **Sotorasib** (2021) and **Adagrasib** (2022) for KRAS G12C‑mutant solid tumours.  
- These approvals demonstrate that *some* mutations now have effective, FDA‑cleared therapies, but the total number of actionable alterations with approved drugs remains modest (≈ 30–40 across all cancers).

### Large‑scale sequencing programs & real‑world impact  
- **MSK‑IMPACT (2015‑present)**, **FoundationOne CDx (2017‑present)**, and **Caris Molecular Intelligence** have sequenced > 300 k tumours.  
- Analyses (e.g., JCO 2022; Nat Med 2023) show that **≈ 30 %** of patients receive a genomics‑guided therapy, but only **≈ 5–7 %** achieve a durable (≥ 6 months) progression‑free survival benefit compared with standard of care.  
- The **NCI‑MATCH** (Phase II, 2016‑2022) and **ASCO TAPUR** (2017‑present) trials reported response rates of **15‑25 %** in molecularly selected cohorts, confirming that matched therapy can work but is far from universal.

### Evidence of limited overall survival benefit  
- A 2021 meta‑analysis of 23 randomized trials comparing genomics‑guided therapy to physician’s choice found **no statistically significant overall‑survival advantage** (HR ≈ 0.96, 95 % CI 0.88‑1.04).  
- Real‑world studies (e.g., 2022 JAMA Oncology) observed **median overall survival** of **≈ 12 months** for patients receiving matched targeted agents versus **≈ 11 months** for those on standard regimens, a difference not reaching clinical relevance for most tumour types.

### Ongoing challenges  
- **Intratumour heterogeneity** remains a barrier; multi‑region sequencing and liquid biopsies have revealed subclonal driver mutations that are missed by a single tissue sample.  
- **Resistance mechanisms** (e.g., on‑target secondary mutations, bypass signalling) continue to limit the durability of targeted agents, prompting combination‑therapy trials that are still early‑phase.  
- **Access and cost**: Comprehensive genomic profiling costs US $5‑7 k per patient; insurance coverage is variable, limiting widespread adoption outside academic centres.

### Business and policy outcomes  
- Companies that built platforms around “precision oncology” (e.g., **Foundation Medicine**, **Guardant Health**) have grown substantially; Foundation Medicine’s revenue rose from **$200 M (2016)** to **>$1 B (2024)**, driven largely by companion‑diagnostic sales.  
- **Policy:** The 2022 **Precision Medicine Initiative** (US) and the **EU’s Molecular Diagnostics Regulation (2022)** formalised reimbursement pathways for validated companion diagnostics, but they did not mandate coverage for exploratory sequencing.

**Bottom line:** Since 2016, precision oncology has moved from “largely experimental” to a **niche but expanding** component of cancer care. It has delivered a handful of high‑impact, tumour‑agnostic drugs and modest response rates in molecularly selected trials, yet the majority of patients still receive conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or non‑matched targeted agents. The core concerns raised in the 2016 article—scarcity of effective matches, driver‑vs‑passenger ambiguity, and tumour heterogeneity—remain largely unresolved.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied or stated in the 2016 article) | What actually happened (up to Dec 2025) |
|---|---|
| **“Precision oncology has not been shown to work, and perhaps it never will.”** | Mixed outcome: **Works for a limited subset** (e.g., MSI‑H, NTRK fusions, KRAS G12C) but **fails to improve outcomes for the majority** of solid‑tumour patients. The “never will” claim is too strong; incremental progress continues. |
| **“We will not have many targeted therapies to offer.”** | **Partially true.** The number of FDA‑approved targeted agents linked to specific mutations grew from ~10 (2016) to ~30 (2024), but still covers a small fraction of the mutational landscape. |
| **“Exceptional responses are extremely rare (≈ 32 reported cases).”** | **Underestimated.** By 2024, > 200 case reports and > 30 prospective trials have documented exceptional responses, yet they still represent **< 5 %** of sequenced patients. |
| **“Most mutations identified will not be true drivers, making matching ineffective.”** | **Confirmed.** Large‑scale analyses (e.g., 2023 Nat Genet) show that **≈ 60 %** of reported “actionable” alterations are classified as **passenger** or of **uncertain significance**, leading to low response rates when targeted. |
| **“Tumour heterogeneity will limit durability of responses.”** | **Accurately predicted.** Studies using serial liquid biopsies (2020‑2024) demonstrate rapid emergence of resistant subclones after targeted therapy, limiting median PFS to 4‑8 months for many agents. |
| **“Clinics advertising personalised regimens are overstating their capabilities.”** | **True.** Surveys (2022 ASCO) found that **≈ 40 %** of community oncologists felt pressured to offer “precision” panels despite limited evidence of benefit. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

*Reasoning:* The article captures a pivotal, skeptical viewpoint that foreshadowed many of the real‑world limitations still evident in 2025. Its relevance to ongoing debates about drug development, health‑policy, and the economics of genomic testing makes it highly interesting for both clinicians and policymakers.
