# Sarepta’s Day at the FDA (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on the FDA advisory committee meeting that would decide whether to grant accelerated approval to **eteplirsen** (brand name *Exondys 51*), an antisense‑oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 in the dystrophin gene of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The author notes that families and patient‑advocacy groups are heavily lobbying for approval, even organizing webinars, travel grants, and data‑gathering on risk tolerance.  

The scientific controversy centers on two points: (1) the sponsor’s 12‑patient trial provides only a weak signal of clinical benefit, and (2) the surrogate endpoint—an increase in dystrophin protein measured in muscle biopsies—has uncertain relevance to functional improvement. The piece outlines four possible ways the committee’s vote could be interpreted, ranging from a “negative” rejection of the drug to a “positive” approval that might be seen either as a triumph for patients or as a dangerous concession to emotion over data.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome (2016‑2022)**  
- **September 2016:** The FDA granted **accelerated approval** to eteplirsen for DMD patients amenable to exon‑51 skipping (≈13 % of the DMD population). The decision was based on the surrogate endpoint (dystrophin increase) despite a split advisory committee vote (8 yes, 3 no, 2 abstentions).  
- **2017‑2019:** Sarepta completed a larger, randomized, placebo‑controlled Phase III trial (the “PROMOVI” study). The primary functional endpoint (6‑minute walk distance) was not met, and the increase in dystrophin remained modest.  
- **October 2019:** The FDA issued a **post‑marketing requirement** for a confirmatory trial and warned that approval could be withdrawn if the study failed to demonstrate clinical benefit.  
- **2021‑2022:** Additional data from longer‑term natural‑history comparisons and open‑label extensions showed modest slowing of disease progression in some subgroups. The FDA **reaffirmed** the accelerated approval in 2021, citing the unmet medical need and the lack of alternative therapies for exon‑51‑amenable patients.  

**Clinical uptake**  
- By 2023, eteplirsen was prescribed to several hundred patients in the United States, primarily through specialty pharmacies.  
- The drug’s **annual price** (~ $300 k) limited access; many insurers required prior authorization, and some denied coverage pending further efficacy data.  
- Real‑world registries (e.g., the Duchenne Registry) indicate that patients receiving eteplirsen tend to have a slower decline in ambulatory function compared with historical controls, but the effect size is small and highly variable.  

**Industry and policy ripple effects**  
- Sarepta’s experience accelerated the **development of other exon‑skipping drugs**: golodirsen (exon 53) received accelerated approval in 2019, and viltolarsen (exon 53) in 2020 (U.S. approval in 2021).  
- The case intensified debate within the FDA and Congress about the **balance between accelerated approvals, surrogate endpoints, and patient‑advocacy pressure**. In 2020, the FDA issued guidance emphasizing the need for robust confirmatory trials even for rare‑disease therapies.  
- Patient‑advocacy groups (e.g., Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy) have continued to lobby for broader insurance coverage and for the inclusion of exon‑skipping therapies in newborn screening panels.  

**Business impact**  
- Sarepta’s market capitalization surged after the 2016 approval (from ≈ $2 bn to > $7 bn by early 2018) but fell back after the 2019 trial failure, stabilizing around $4‑5 bn in 2023.  
- The company diversified into gene‑replacement (AAV‑mediated micro‑dystrophin) and gene‑editing programs, leveraging the regulatory experience gained with eteplirsen.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction in the article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **(1) Negative vote – rejection of the drug** | The FDA **approved** eteplirsen (accelerated approval). | Not realized. |
| **(2) Negative vote – the only possible one because data are too weak** | Same as above – approval occurred despite weak data. | Not realized. |
| **(3) Positive vote – a victory for patient advocates and the ill boys** | The advisory committee voted **yes** (8‑3‑2) and the FDA granted accelerated approval, which patient groups hailed as a win. | Realized. |
| **(4) Positive vote – an undeserved, potentially hazardous victory of emotion over evidence** | Many clinicians, scientists, and some FDA staff criticized the approval as premature; subsequent confirmatory trials failed to show clear functional benefit, leading to ongoing controversy. | Realized (the “hazardous” aspect is debated, but the criticism aligns with this prediction). |

**Other implicit predictions** (not explicitly listed but implied):  
- *Patient advocacy would shape the approval process.* **True** – organized testimonies and lobbying were a prominent feature of the meeting and set a precedent for future rare‑disease approvals.  
- *The surrogate marker (dystrophin increase) would be accepted as sufficient evidence.* **Partially true** – it was accepted for accelerated approval, but the FDA later required confirmatory functional data, indicating the surrogate alone was insufficient for full approval.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in modern drug regulation where patient advocacy, surrogate endpoints, and accelerated approval intersected, setting a lasting precedent for rare‑disease therapeutics.
