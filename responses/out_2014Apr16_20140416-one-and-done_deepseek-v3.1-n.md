# Analysis of "One and Done" (Science Magazine, April 16, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights a troubling statistic about the biotechnology industry: between 1950 and 2011, 56% of drug companies that received FDA approval managed to do so only once, suggesting that "second acts in the biotech business are hard." The piece uses Pharmacyclics and its CEO Robert Duggan as a case study, expressing skepticism about the company's long-term prospects despite its billion-dollar success with a "lucky drug" (Ibrutinib/Imbruvica). 

The author reveals clear bias in the analysis, immediately dismissing Duggan's decision-making capabilities upon learning he's a major donor to the Church of Scientology. The tone suggests that the writer believes Pharmacyclics' success is largely attributable to luck rather than strategic acumen, and questions whether the company can achieve sustainable, long-term success beyond this single breakthrough drug.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent history proved dramatically different from the article's pessimistic assessment:

**Pharmacyclics' Actual Trajectory:**
- In **March 2015** (less than a year after this article), Pharmacyclics was acquired by **AbbVie for $21 billion**, representing one of the largest biotech acquisitions in history
- Ibrutinib (Imbruvica) became a blockbuster drug with peak annual sales exceeding $5 billion
- Rather than being a "one-hit wonder," Imbruvica received multiple FDA approvals across different indications (CLL, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, marginal zone lymphoma, and chronic graft-versus-host disease)
- The drug established an entirely new class of BTK inhibitors that transformed treatment paradigms for B-cell malignancies
- Many of these additional approvals came **after** the 2014 article was published, directly contradicting the "one and done" narrative

**Industry Context:**
- The BTK inhibitor class became highly competitive with multiple successful drugs (acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, etc.)
- The single-approval statistic likely reflected survivor bias and the long drug development timelines rather than inherent industry limitations

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Wrong:**
- **Fundamentally misjudged Pharmacyclics' trajectory**: Predicted they couldn't achieve long-term success, but AbbVie's $21B acquisition validated their strategy
- **Underestimated Ibrutinib's potential**: The drug proved far more valuable than a single "lucky" approval
- **Questionable causal analysis**: Assumed Duggan's Scientology affiliation correlated with irrational decision-making, yet his company delivered extraordinary returns
- **Industry generalization**: The "56% one-and-done" statistic proved misleading as the context (additional approvals for same drugs, M&A activity, extended timelines) wasn't fully considered

**What Held True:**
- **Biotech remains challenging**: Drug development is indeed difficult, and many companies do struggle with follow-up successes
- **Blockbuster drugs drive value**: Ibrutinib's success did fundamentally drive Pharmacyclics' valuation, as predicted

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 7/9**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile for interest. While it demonstrated significant flaws in analysis, it serves as a valuable cautionary tale about:
- The dangers of mixing personal bias with business analysis
- How rapidly fortunes can change in biotech
- The importance of recognizing that genuine innovation can create sustained value
- The fallibility of statistical generalizations without proper context

The dramatic divergence between the article's pessimistic predictions and reality, combined with the billion-dollar stakes and fascinating human drama around Duggan's unconventional background, makes this a compelling piece of biotech history that offers enduring lessons about hubris in analysis.
