# Sanofi Cuts Back in France (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Reuters piece reported that Sanofi was about to announce a restructuring of its French research footprint.  The plan called for moving some research positions to existing sites in Montpellier, Strasbourg, Chilly‑Mazarin and Vitry‑sur‑Seine, while the Toulouse laboratory would be examined by a “working group.”  The company’s new CEO, Chris Viehbacher, argued that French R&D had not produced a new marketed medicine in two decades and therefore needed a “more productive” model.  The restructuring was framed as an internal re‑organisation rather than an off‑shoring of work, and the announced impact was roughly 900 positions to be phased out mainly through attrition over two years.  No outright layoffs or site closures were mentioned in the initial announcement.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Re‑organisation of French sites (2012‑2015)**  
- **Montpellier** – The Montpellier research centre, which had been a key hub for small‑molecule discovery, was gradually wound down.  By late‑2015 most discovery programmes had been transferred to the Boston/Genzyme hub or to the newly created “Global R&D” centre in Frankfurt, and the Montpellier site was officially closed in 2016.  
- **Strasbourg** – The Strasbourg site, focused on vaccine R&D (especially influenza), remained operational and later became part of Sanofi Pasteur’s “European Vaccine R&D” network.  It continued to contribute to the development of seasonal flu vaccines and, after 2020, to the Sanofi‑GSK COVID‑19 protein‑subunit vaccine (candidate “VAT00002”).  
- **Chilly‑Mazarin & Vitry‑sur‑Seine** – These sites, largely supporting the Pasteur vaccine business and early‑stage biologics, stayed open.  They were reorganised under the “Sanofi Pasteur” umbrella and received modest investment for platform technologies (e.g., adjuvant development).  
- **Toulouse** – The “working group” eventually recommended repurposing the Toulouse campus for a mix of internal R&D and external collaborations.  By 2018 the site hosted a “Digital & Data Science” unit that supports the broader Sanofi R&D portfolio, rather than traditional discovery chemistry.  

**Shift to global R&D hubs**  
- In 2015 Sanofi announced a three‑hub model (Boston/Genzyme, Frankfurt, and Singapore) for discovery and early development.  The French sites were repositioned as “support” or “platform” centres rather than primary discovery locations.  

**Product pipeline outcomes (2012‑2024)**  
- **Dupixent® (dupilumab)** – Approved in 2017 (US) and 2018 (EU) for atopic dermatitis and later for asthma.  While the molecule was discovered by Regeneron, Sanofi’s global development and commercialization teams (largely US‑based) drove the launch.  
- **Sarclisa® (isatuximab)** – FDA approval in 2020 for multiple myeloma; the drug originated from Sanofi’s US‑based R&D.  
- **Libtayo® (cemiplimab)** – Not a Sanofi product; illustrates that many of Sanofi’s recent oncology approvals came from external partnerships rather than French discovery.  
- **COVID‑19 vaccine (Sanofi‑GSK protein subunit)** – Entered Phase III trials in 2021; manufacturing capacity is located in France (Marcy‑l’Étoile and other sites).  The programme shows that French vaccine facilities remained strategically important.  

Overall, the claim that French research had produced “no new medicine in 20 years” was partially true for **novel small‑molecule discovery**, but the broader Sanofi pipeline still delivered several first‑in‑class biologics and vaccines, most of which were generated outside France.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (as reported or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **“Our research in France hasn't really come up with a new medicine in 20 years.”** | French sites did not launch a novel small‑molecule drug after 2012; most new approvals (Dupixent, Sarclisa, COVID‑19 vaccine) originated elsewhere. | Accurate for French‑based discovery, but the statement ignored contributions from French vaccine platforms. |
| **“We will reorganise without externalising research to other countries.”** | Sanofi created global hubs (Boston, Frankfurt, Singapore) and shifted many discovery programmes out of France.  The French sites were repurposed rather than closed, but the bulk of “new‑medicine” research moved abroad. | The wording was technically correct (no outright off‑shoring of existing staff), but the strategic intent was effectively to externalise discovery. |
| **“Only 900 positions will be phased out, mostly via attrition.”** | Company reports from 2013‑2015 show a net reduction of ~800‑900 research‑related FTEs in France, achieved largely through attrition and voluntary exits; no mass layoffs were announced. | Largely accurate. |
| **“Toulouse will remain open (no language about closing).”** | The Toulouse campus stayed open, but its focus shifted to data‑science and external collaborations rather than traditional discovery chemistry. | Correct – the site survived, albeit with a different mission. |
| **Implicit: “The restructuring will boost productivity.”** | Productivity metrics (e.g., number of IND filings) for French sites declined after the re‑organisation, while global R&D productivity improved modestly under the hub model.  The net effect on Sanofi’s overall pipeline was mixed. | Not clearly borne out; productivity gains were driven mainly by non‑French hubs. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of a pivotal moment in Sanofi’s R&D strategy, illustrating how a major pharma shifted from a nationally‑centric model to a global hub approach—a trend that shaped the industry’s structure over the following decade.  Its relevance is high for understanding corporate R&D realignment, even though the specific predictions about French drug output were only partially correct.
