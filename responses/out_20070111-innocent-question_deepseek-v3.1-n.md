# An Innocent Question (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article highlights a quality control concern in a prominent medicinal chemistry journal. The author points out that the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* (J. Med. Chem.) published a "Perspective" review article on the binding of kinase inhibitors—a highly important and complex topic in drug discovery. Despite the article's visibility and relevance to many researchers, it appears to contain incorrect chemical structures, including that of the widely known cancer drug Gleevec (imatinib). The author poses this as a rhetorical question, implying that editorial staff and referees should have caught such fundamental errors before publication, even for less prominent drugs, raising concerns about peer review standards in a major journal.

## 2. HISTORY

Accurate molecular structures are essential in medicinal chemistry because they dictate biological activity, intellectual property, and reproducibility. Publishing incorrect structures in a peer-reviewed journal—especially in a high-impact review—can mislead researchers, waste resources, and undermine scientific credibility.

The broader context is that kinase inhibitors like Gleevec represented a paradigm shift in targeted cancer therapy. Gleevec (imatinib) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and became a blockbuster drug, demonstrating that targeting specific kinase pathways could yield highly effective therapies. By 2007, multiple kinase inhibitors were in development or approved (e.g., erlotinib, dasatinib, sunitinib), making accurate structural information critical for drug design.

Peer review criticism like this blog post reflects ongoing concerns about reproducibility and quality control in scientific publishing. While this specific incident did not appear to cause major policy changes or business impacts, it contributed to broader discussions about editorial oversight. Subsequent years saw increased attention to data integrity and reproducibility in scientific literature, with journals implementing more stringent checking procedures, though structural errors continue to occur periodically.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The blog post itself makes no explicit predictions; it is commentary on current standards. However, its implicit concerns relate to scientific publishing quality control:

• **Implicit concern about editorial oversight**: The author questions whether journals adequately vet structural accuracy, even for landmark drugs like Gleevec. This concern remains relevant today, as structural errors in publications continue to be reported, though many journals have improved verification processes.
  
• **Kinase inhibitor field importance**: While not a prediction per se, the article underscores the significance of kinase inhibitor research in 2007. This field continued to grow substantially, with dozens of kinase inhibitors approved by the FDA over the following two decades, including drugs for various cancers, inflammatory diseases, and other conditions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the topic of accurate chemical structures is important, this specific blog post is a minor commentary about one journal's error. It holds limited long-term importance compared to broader scientific developments in kinase inhibitors, drug discovery methodologies, or major reproducibility crises.
