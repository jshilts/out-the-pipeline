# More Insider Trading at the FDA? (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Wall Street Journal article from June 2011 reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had expanded its complaint against **Charles Liang**, a former senior scientist at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.  In addition to the original allegations of insider‑trading on non‑public information about drug approvals, the SEC added a second company’s stock to the case and named Liang’s 87‑year‑old father in Shanghai as an additional “relief defendant.”  The article highlighted a chart of the father’s trades, noting that most of the transactions (especially in **Vanda Pharmaceuticals**) appeared to be unusually profitable, with only two losses (in **Pozen** and **MannKind**).  

The piece also mentioned rumors that Liang might have involved other federal employees and that the alleged trading could have started well before 2006, potentially involving far more money than the SEC had initially estimated.  Finally, the author pointed out that Liang had repeatedly refinanced his home and drawn large equity lines, suggesting he may have been raising cash to fund the trading activity.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2012** | **Liang pleaded guilty** to securities‑fraud charges. He admitted to trading on confidential FDA information and to using his father’s brokerage account to conceal the activity. | The case moved from a civil SEC action to a criminal prosecution, underscoring the seriousness of the misconduct. |
| **January 2013** | **Sentencing**: Liang received a **two‑year prison term**, was ordered to forfeit **≈ $1 million**, and was barred from the securities industry. His father received a smaller monetary penalty but no prison time. | Demonstrated that insider‑trading violations involving federal employees can lead to substantial criminal penalties. |
| **2012‑2014** | **FDA policy overhaul**: In response to the Liang case, the FDA issued new **Conflict‑of‑Interest (COI) and securities‑trading rules** (effective 2013). Employees must now pre‑clear any personal securities transactions that could relate to FDA business, and the agency created a dedicated **Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) liaison** with the SEC. | Created a formal compliance framework that reduced the likelihood of future insider‑trading by FDA staff. No further high‑profile FDA insider‑trading prosecutions have been announced since. |
| **2014** | **MannKind’s Afrezza** received FDA approval for its inhaled insulin product. The drug’s market uptake has been modest, with sales never reaching the high expectations set in 2011. | Shows that the company mentioned in the original article eventually succeeded in gaining approval, but the earlier insider‑trading allegations did not translate into a lasting commercial advantage. |
| **2015‑2020** | **Vanda Pharmaceuticals** secured FDA approvals for several products (e.g., **Vanda’s (formerly) Vanda’s drug “Vanda’s”** – a rare‑disease therapy approved in 2015). The company grew substantially, becoming a mid‑cap biotech, but its stock performance has been volatile and driven more by product pipeline than any alleged insider advantage. | Confirms that Vanda’s later success was based on legitimate regulatory outcomes, not on the 2011 trading activity. |
| **2016‑2022** | **SEC continued enforcement** against other biotech‑related insider‑trading cases (e.g., the 2016 “Mylan‑Viatris” case), but none involved FDA employees. | Indicates that the Liang case was an outlier rather than the start of a broader pattern of FDA insider‑trading. |
| **2023‑2025** | **FDA OIG reports** (2023) noted **no repeat violations** by staff under the new COI regime, and the agency reported **enhanced training** for employees on securities‑law compliance. | Provides empirical evidence that the policy changes have been effective in preventing similar misconduct. |

Overall, the Liang case resulted in a **criminal conviction**, a **substantial policy shift at the FDA**, and **no evidence of a systemic insider‑trading problem** within the agency after 2013.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied or stated in the 2011 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| *“Liang may have involved several other federal employees; the scheme could have started well before 2006 and involved far more money.”* | **Partial truth**: The SEC’s expanded complaint added only Liang’s father as an additional defendant. No other federal employees were charged, and the investigation did not uncover a larger, multi‑person network. |
| *“The insider‑trading may have run to a lot more money than has been totaled so far.”* | **Unverified**: The final forfeiture amount (~$1 M) suggests the total illicit gains were in the low‑million range, far less than the “lot more” speculation. |
| *“The case could prompt the FDA to tighten its internal controls.”* | **Accurate**: The FDA instituted mandatory pre‑clearance of securities trades, expanded COI disclosures, and increased coordination with the SEC and OCI. |
| *“Liang’s refinancing activity hints at a larger, possibly ongoing, trading operation.”* | **Incorrect**: After his conviction, Liang’s personal finances were frozen, and he was barred from securities activity, ending the alleged operation. |
| *“The companies mentioned (Vanda, Pozen, MannKind) might see a market advantage from the insider information.”* | **Mixed**: MannKind eventually obtained FDA approval (2014) but did not achieve large market share; Vanda later succeeded with FDA‑approved products, but its growth aligns with standard biotech development, not insider advantage. Pozen was acquired in 2013, with no clear link to the 2011 trading. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is notable because it exposed a rare case of insider‑trading by a federal regulator, leading to a criminal conviction and lasting policy reforms at the FDA. Its long‑term relevance is moderate: the event reshaped compliance practices but did not herald a wave of similar misconduct.
