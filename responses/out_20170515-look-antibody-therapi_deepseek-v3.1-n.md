# A Look at Antibody Therapies (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the growing dominance of antibody therapies in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly highlighting how monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are increasingly occupying spots on best-selling drug lists. The piece references Bruce Booth's LifeSciVC column about antibody discovery technologies, noting that five antibodies had already been FDA-approved in 2017 by mid-May, and that mAb projects had approximately double the clinical success rate compared to small-molecule drugs (with even better odds outside oncology).

The article focuses significantly on Medarex's UltiMab transgenic technology platform, which had produced ten approved antibody drugs—more than any other human antibody platform at the time. Bristol-Myers Squibb's $2.6 billion acquisition of Medarex in 2009, initially viewed skeptically, proved enormously successful, particularly due to nivolumab (Opdivo), a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor that achieved $2.6 billion in US sales in 2016 and was projected to reach over $12 billion within five years.

Additionally, the article discusses the challenges in antibody drug development, including attempts to use biophysical properties and in vitro assays to predict clinical success—approaches that showed limited correlation with actual outcomes. The author emphasizes that despite technological advances in antibody production, deep understanding of disease biology remains the critical rate-limiting factor for pharmaceutical success.

## 2. HISTORY

**Antibody Therapy Market Growth:** The trend of antibodies dominating best-selling drug lists has continued and accelerated since 2017. Humira (adalimumab), an anti-TNFα antibody, became the world's top-selling drug for multiple years, demonstrating the sustained commercial success of antibody therapies well beyond the article's publication.

**Opdivo (Nivolumab) Performance:** The article's projection for Opdivo proved largely accurate, though timing varied. Opdivo's global sales exceeded $7 billion in 2020 and have remained among the top-selling oncology drugs globally, though the $12 billion projection within five years (by 2021-2022) may have been slightly optimistic depending on market conditions and competition from other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The drug became a cornerstone of immuno-oncology treatment across multiple cancer types.

**Medarex Platform's Continued Success:** The Medarex UltiMab platform that produced Opdivo continued generating clinical value. The acquisition indeed proved to be one of biotech's most successful, validating the article's assessment that skepticism about Medarex's management shouldn't obscure the scientific platform's productivity.

**Antibody Approval Trends:** Since 2017, the FDA has approved numerous antibody therapies across therapeutic areas including oncology, immunology, infectious diseases, and rare diseases. The higher success rate of antibody drugs compared to small molecules has continued, particularly in oncology where multiple new checkpoint inhibitors and targeted antibodies have entered the market.

**Disease Biology Recognition:** The article's emphasis on disease biology understanding as the rate-limiting factor has been repeatedly validated. Failed Phase II trials due to incorrect target selection have continued to plague both antibody and small-molecule development, reinforcing that technological platform superiority cannot overcome fundamentally flawed biological hypotheses.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Antibody Market Dominance**: The prediction that antibodies would continue taking spots on best-selling drug lists was highly accurate. Antibody therapies have maintained their position as major revenue drivers in the pharmaceutical industry, with multiple antibodies reaching blockbuster status.

• **Opdivo Sales Growth ($12B+ within five years)**: This prediction was directionally correct but timing-dependent. Opdivo achieved substantial global sales, though competitive pressure from other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and market dynamics may have affected the exact trajectory toward the $12 billion mark within the specific five-year window.

• **Continued Platform Success**: The assessment that Medarex's platform represented lasting value was correct. The platform's productivity continued to be recognized, and the BMS acquisition proved strategically sound.

• **Disease Biology as Rate-Limiting Factor**: This insight proved prescient. Subsequent drug development failures have consistently demonstrated that superior technology cannot overcome flawed biological understanding, whether for small molecules or biologics.

• **Limited Predictive Value of Biophysical Assays**: The article's skepticism about biophysical scoring systems for predicting antibody success has been largely validated. The field has continued struggling to establish robust preclinical-to-clinical translation metrics.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates strong analytical insight by recognizing the fundamental importance of disease biology over technological platform superiority, a perspective that has aged well. The Medarex case study and accurate assessment of antibody therapies' continuing market trajectory make it historically interesting and relevant.
