# A Low-Cholesterol Vaccination? (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a cholesterol-lowering vaccine targeting PCSK9 that showed efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol in mice and macaques, published in the journal *Vaccine*. At the time, two PCSK9 antibody therapies—Praluent (alirocumab) and Repatha (evolocumab)—were already on the market and successfully lowering LDL levels, though their long-term outcomes remained unproven. The author raises key considerations: while a vaccine could offer advantages such as one-time dosing and potentially lower cost compared to repeated antibody injections, it would lack the reversibility of antibody therapies (you cannot "turn off" a vaccine response). The researchers suggested vaccines might be particularly valuable in developing countries and could address issues like patient compliance and immune responses against therapeutic antibodies. However, the author urges caution, citing the need to observe the long-term safety of PCSK9 inhibition before pursuing irreversible vaccine approaches, referencing Chesterton's fence principle about not removing biological functions without understanding their full evolutionary purpose.

## 2. HISTORY

**PCSK9 Antibody Outcomes (Praluent and Repatha):** Both drugs received FDA approval in 2015 and demonstrated long-term cardiovascular benefits. The FOURIER trial (2017) showed Repatha reduced cardiovascular events by 15% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The ODYSSEY Outcomes trial (2018) showed Praluent reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 15% in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Both drugs proved safe with minimal serious adverse events over several years of follow-up.

**PCSK9 Vaccine Development:** The vaccine approach discussed in the article failed to advance to clinical trials. The theoretical advantages (lower cost, one-time dosing) were outweighed by safety concerns about irreversible PCSK9 inhibition and the proven efficacy and manageable safety profile of the antibody therapies. No PCSK9 vaccine has reached Phase I trials as of 2024.

**Market Uptake:** Praluent and Repatha faced slow initial adoption due to high costs (approximately $14,000 annually initially) and insurance coverage challenges. Prices have since decreased significantly (to roughly $5,000-6,000 annually), and both drugs have achieved broader patient access and prescription volumes, though they remain primarily used as second or third-line therapies after statins and ezetimibe.

**Regulatory and Policy:** In 2021, the FDA approved inclisiran (Leqvio), a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy targeting PCSK9, offering twice-yearly dosing—a middle ground between daily pills and injectable antibodies. This represents an alternative long-acting approach that addresses some of the cost and compliance issues without the irreversibility concerns of vaccines.

**Business Outcomes:** Amgen (Repatha) and Sanofi/Regeneron (Praluent) both achieved blockbuster status with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion. Novartis entered the market with inclisiran in 2022 and has been expanding its market share.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Article prediction:** "Whether [PCSK9 antibodies] have the desired long-term outcomes remains to be seen; there's no other way to find out than to wait and watch."
  - **Outcome:** The long-term outcomes were established by 2017-2018 through large cardiovascular outcomes trials that demonstrated significant cardiovascular event reduction with acceptable safety profiles.

• **Article implication:** The vaccine might be particularly useful in developing countries due to cost advantages over antibody therapies.
  - **Outcome:** This did not materialize. The vaccine never advanced to clinical trials, and cost-effective oral therapies (statins) remain the standard of care globally. PCSK9 inhibitors are still too expensive for most developing country healthcare systems, even with reduced pricing.

• **Article concern:** Vaccine's irreversibility could be problematic compared to controllable antibody therapy discontinuation.
  - **Outcome:** This concern proved valid as no PCSK9 vaccine reached clinical development, likely due to these safety considerations.

• **Author suggestion:** Watch antibody performance for a few years before pursuing vaccine approaches more aggressively.
  - **Outcome:** This conservative approach was adopted by the field. Antibody therapies demonstrated safety and efficacy, obviating the need for riskier vaccine approaches while opening the door for alternative long-acting therapies like siRNA (inclisiran).

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6**

The article demonstrates moderate-to-high interest by correctly identifying the key trade-offs between vaccine and antibody approaches to PCSK9 inhibition while foreshadowing the eventual market dynamics between different therapeutic modalities (later including siRNA therapies). However, it missed the eventual success of the antibody therapies in proving long-term cardiovascular benefits, and the vaccine approach it highlighted completely failed to advance in development.
