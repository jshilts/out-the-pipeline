# Pfizer Slowly Shrinks in Groton (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Pfizer's continued workforce reductions at its Groton and New London campuses in Connecticut. By February 2013, Pfizer had cut its local workforce from a peak of 6,000 employees to approximately 3,300, which was part of broader downsizing that began two years prior and initially targeted reducing the workforce to around 3,400. The company was also struggling to sell vacant buildings in the region.

A significant factor in the Groton reduction was Pfizer's strategic relocation of drug discovery operations to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the company was building a new research facility near Novartis's expanding campus. The author, Derek Lowe, observes this as part of a broader trend of biomedical infrastructure growth in the Cambridge area, noting the continuous construction of academic and scientific facilities since his arrival five years earlier.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following the 2013 article, Pfizer's strategic consolidation in Cambridge materialized as planned. The company completed construction of its Cambridge research facility and established it as a major hub for drug discovery operations. This relocation was part of broader industry trends showing pharmaceutical companies concentrating R&D operations in major biotech clusters like Cambridge/Kendall Square.

The Groton facility has continued operating as part of Pfizer's network, though at reduced capacity. Pfizer maintained manufacturing and some research functions at the Connecticut site while centralizing discovery research in Massachusetts. This geographic consolidation strategy reflected industry-wide patterns where pharmaceutical companies were optimizing their footprints by concentrating discovery research in biotech hubs with greater access to academic collaborations and talent pools.

The broader Connecticut pharmaceutical landscape saw continued challenges. The article's mention of difficulties selling vacant buildings proved prescient - the region faced ongoing struggles with commercial real estate market conditions. However, some facilities eventually found alternative uses, including conversions for other industrial or commercial purposes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The analysis found no explicit predictions in the article. The author primarily reported on ongoing corporate restructuring and made observational comments about construction activity in Cambridge, but did not venture specific forecasts about outcomes or future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article serves as a contemporaneous snapshot of pharmaceutical industry consolidation patterns, providing useful context about Pfizer's geographic realignment during a period of restructuring. However, it represents a routine corporate restructuring report without broader implications for the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries, making it moderately interesting as historical context but not particularly significant for long-term analysis.
