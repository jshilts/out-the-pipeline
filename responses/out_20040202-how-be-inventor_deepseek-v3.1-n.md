# How to Be an Inventor (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary on inventorship in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, focusing on who gets credited on drug patents. The author argues that luck plays a significant but underappreciated role in drug discovery, since researchers cannot predict which compounds will become successful drugs at the start of a project. Consequently, it's difficult to know who will ultimately be listed as inventors when work begins.

The article explains that to be an inventor, one must make a distinct, non-obvious contribution to the claimed invention. Those merely following others' instructions without generating their own ideas—the "pair of hands"—should not be listed as inventors. The author advocates giving researchers room to develop their own ideas, which benefits both inventorship claims and research quality. The piece concludes by discussing patent filing costs, acknowledging that while US researchers don't receive profit shares from patents, they also don't pay filing fees, which the author views as a reasonable business cost.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2004 article, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have continued grappling with inventorship issues, though the fundamental legal framework has remained largely unchanged. The core requirement that inventors must contribute to the "conception" of the invention—not merely reduction to practice—continues to govern patent law in most jurisdictions including the US.

The issue became increasingly complex with the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning in drug discovery. Courts and patent offices have struggled with whether AI systems can be named as inventors, with cases like Thaler v. Vidal (2022) affirming that only natural persons can be inventors under current US law. This has implications for modern drug discovery pipelines where AI plays significant roles in identifying targets and designing compounds.

Collaborative research models have expanded, with multi-institutional partnerships creating more complex inventorship scenarios. The Bayh-Dole Act framework mentioned in the article continues to govern university-industry patent ownership in the US, though debates persist about whether this optimally incentivizes innovation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained no explicit predictions about future developments. It was purely explanatory and observational rather than forward-looking, focusing on the then-current state of inventorship practices. The author's main goal was to educate readers about how inventorship works rather than forecasting how it might evolve.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article provides practical insights into biotech/pharma patent practices, its scope is relatively narrow and specialized, focusing primarily on internal industry processes rather than broader scientific or patient impact. The discussion has limited relevance to those outside patent law or drug discovery research.
