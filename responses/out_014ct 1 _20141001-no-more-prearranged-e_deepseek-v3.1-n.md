# Analysis of "No More Prearranged Editors at PNAS" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) eliminating its "Prearranged Editor" (PE) submission route as of October 1, 2014. This route had been created in 2010 as a successor to the eliminated "member Communicated" system, intended for exceptional interdisciplinary papers or those "ahead of their time" that needed special editorial attention.

Despite being designed for rare use cases, the PE process had become surprisingly popular - over 11,000 papers had been submitted through this route since its implementation. The journal acknowledged that while some papers genuinely benefited from this special handling, "the vast majority likely did not," leading to the decision to discontinue the practice. This change brought PNAS more in line with standard submission processes used by other major journals in the field.

## 2. HISTORY

The elimination of the PE route in 2014 was part of a broader evolution at PNAS toward more transparent and standardized editorial processes. In the subsequent years:

**Immediate Aftermath (2014-2016):** PNAS completed its transition to standard direct submission processes, eliminating the final "odd routes" mentioned in the article. The journal maintained its reputation for publishing high-impact research while operating more conventionally.

**Longer-term Developments (2017-2024):** PNAS continued as a premier multidisciplinary journal but faced increasing competition from new open-access journals and mega-journals (PLOS ONE, Nature Communications, etc.). The broader publishing landscape underwent significant changes:

- Open access mandates from funders accelerated
- Preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv) gained prominence
- Concerns about peer review quality became more prominent
- The "reproducibility crisis" led to increased scrutiny of published research

PNAS adapted by introducing initiatives like transparent peer review options and enhanced reporting standards, but it no longer stood out for unusual submission pathways.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the article got right:**
- The prediction that PNAS would become "very much like the rest of the field" proved accurate. The journal did standardize its submission processes and operated more conventionally in subsequent years.
- The acknowledgment that the PE system was being overused was validated by its discontinuation.

**What the article missed:**
- The broader transformation of scientific publishing wasn't fully anticipated. The rise of preprints, open peer review, and registered reports represented more fundamental changes than just PNAS process standardization.
- The long-term impact on PNAS's competitive position: while it remained prestigious, it faced new challenges from innovative publishing models and mega-journals that the article didn't predict.
- The importance of transparency and reproducibility concerns that would dominate later discussions about scientific publishing.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3/9**

This article ranks in the bottom 40% of interest (decile 3). While it documented an important institutional change at a major journal, the topic was fairly niche - mainly relevant to scientists who published in PNAS or followed journal policies closely. The change itself was more administrative than transformative, representing institutional cleanup rather than fundamental innovation in scientific publishing.

The article lacked broader analysis of publishing trends, didn't connect to larger themes about scientific communication, and has limited relevance to the biotechnology industry focus mentioned in the prompt. Ten years later, this reads more like institutional housekeeping rather than a significant development in scientific publishing. The real story would have been about the broader shifts in how science is communicated and validated - topics this piece barely touched upon.
