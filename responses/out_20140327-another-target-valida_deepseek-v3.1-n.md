# Another Target Validation Effort (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the launch of the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation (CCTV), a collaboration between GSK, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The initiative aimed to combine expertise in genomics, proteomics, chemistry, and disease biology to improve target validation—the critical process of determining whether a biological target is genuinely involved in a disease and suitable for drug development. The collaboration would leverage Sanger's genetics expertise, EMBL-EBI's bioinformatics capabilities, and GSK's drug discovery and translational medicine experience. Notably, the effort planned to make its data openly available to the scientific community. The author expresses cautious optimism about the initiative while questioning who would validate the validators themselves, and suggesting that multiple independent efforts might be more valuable than a single large-scale initiative.

## 2. HISTORY

The Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation (CTTV) became operational and made significant contributions to open science in drug discovery. The collaboration launched the **Open Targets** platform (www.opentargets.org), which integrated genetic, genomic, and chemical data to systematically prioritize drug targets across multiple diseases. By 2017, the partnership expanded to include Biogen, and later Bristol Myers Squibb joined as well, broadening the scope beyond GSK alone.

The Open Targets platform has provided systematic evidence for thousands of potential drug targets, combining data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene expression, protein interactions, and other sources. This has enabled researchers worldwide to prioritize targets based on genetic evidence—one of the strongest predictors of drug success. The initiative maintained its commitment to open data, with most findings publicly accessible, accelerating research across academia and industry. Several programs and drug discovery efforts have leveraged Open Targets data for target prioritization decisions. However, measuring direct impact on FDA-approved drugs remains challenging due to the long timelines of drug development, which typically take 10-15 years from target identification to approval. The platform continues operating as of 2024, serving as a key resource for systematic target validation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Information gathered by this effort will be open to the rest of the scientific community"** - This prediction proved accurate. Open Targets became a genuinely open platform, providing public access to target-disease evidence through web interfaces, APIs, and downloadable datasets, serving thousands of researchers globally.

• **"Wishing it ten times larger" and preferring "nine other independent efforts"** - The author's preference for multiple independent efforts partially materialized. While no exact replication occurred, complementary initiatives emerged, including various academic target validation consortia and pharmaceutical companies' internal systematic target validation programs. However, Open Targets remained the most comprehensive open systematic target validation effort.

• **"Quis validet ipsos validares" (Who will validate the validators?)** - This concern about validation methodology remained relevant. The field continued evolving validation approaches, with subsequent research showing mixed success rates for genetically-validated targets. Some targets with strong genetic evidence still failed in clinical trials, while others succeeded, confirming that genetic validation improves odds but doesn't guarantee success—the fundamental challenge the author identified persisted.

• **Implicit prediction that target validation would remain critically important** - This proved prescient. The 2010s and 2020s saw increasing recognition that poor target validation is a major cause of drug development failure, leading to greater investment in systematic approaches like those pioneered by CTTV/Open Targets.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article identified a genuinely important initiative in systematic target validation that did produce lasting impact through Open Targets, but the specific GSK-EMBL-Sanger collaboration was one of several similar movements toward data-driven drug discovery rather than a singular transformative event.
