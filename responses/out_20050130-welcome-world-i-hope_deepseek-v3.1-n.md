# Welcome to the World, I Hope (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article expresses hope that Iraq's 2005 election would lead to greater stability, enabling Middle Eastern countries to increase their participation in global scientific research. The author notes that while many countries in the region have significant financial resources (particularly the Gulf States), they remain largely absent from the scientific literature. Israel serves as a notable exception to this trend. The piece cites Cuba as an example of how countries without great wealth can still develop strong biotech and vaccine expertise when they strategically focus their scientific efforts. The author argues that the Middle East's underrepresentation in science represents a wasted human potential that could benefit both regional development and global scientific progress.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in 2005, the Middle East did experience some significant developments in scientific research, though progress varied considerably across countries:

**Iraq:** Scientific infrastructure largely collapsed during the subsequent years of conflict and instability following the 2005 election, with many researchers leaving the country and academic institutions struggling to function.

**Gulf States:** Substantial investment in science and technology began, particularly after 2008-2010. The UAE established Masdar City and various research institutes, while Saudi Arabia launched King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in 2009 with a $20 billion endowment. Qatar also invested heavily in Education City and research partnerships with Western universities.

**Iran:** Despite international sanctions, Iran maintained and expanded its scientific output, becoming one of the region's most prolific countries in terms of research publications, particularly in fields like nanotechnology, biomedical sciences, and engineering.

**Regional Publications:** By the 2010s, Middle Eastern countries showed measurable increases in scientific publication output, though still lagging behind many other regions. Turkey, Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia became the most significant contributors.

**Biotechnology:** The region developed some notable biotechnology capabilities, with countries like Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey establishing biotech sectors that contributed to regional vaccine production capabilities, which became particularly visible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Iraq joining scientific research:** The author hoped Iraq's 2005 election would enable scientific participation. **Outcome:** The opposite occurred - Iraq's scientific infrastructure was devastated by ongoing conflict, leading to significant brain drain and institutional collapse.

• **Gulf States funding serious projects:** The author noted Gulf States could bankroll major scientific projects but weren't doing so. **Outcome:** This prediction proved partially accurate - starting around 2008-2010, Gulf States did begin major investments in research infrastructure and universities, though the scale and success varied by country.

• **Middle East remaining a "desert for science":** The author described the region (except Israel) as scientifically underdeveloped. **Outcome:** While the Middle East still lags behind many other regions, there has been measurable improvement in research output, particularly from Turkey, Iran, Egypt, and the Gulf States since 2005.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article has limited lasting value as its main topic (Iraq's 2005 election enabling science) was disconnected from the subsequent reality of Iraq's scientific decline. While it accurately identified the Middle East's general scientific underdevelopment, this was already widely recognized by 2005 and the piece didn't provide novel analysis or predictions that proved prescient.
