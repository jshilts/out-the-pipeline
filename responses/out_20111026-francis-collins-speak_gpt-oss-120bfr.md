# Francis Collins Speaks (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief guide to a five‑part interview with NIH Director Francis Collins that was posted on BioCentury TV in October 2011. Collins frames the NIH’s new translational‑research arm (later named the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS) as an “engineer‑style” effort to make drug development more efficient, not as a competitor to industry. He stresses three problem areas:  

* **Target selection** – the high attrition rate in clinical trials is largely due to choosing the wrong biological targets; better target validation is needed.  
* **Genomics‑driven targets** – the explosion of human‑genome sequencing should feed a pipeline of novel, disease‑relevant targets.  
* **New tools** – he highlights a DARPA‑backed “toxicology chip” for early safety testing and the potential of drug‑repurposing to shorten development timelines.  

Collins also touches on the FDA’s role, the need for clearer out‑licensing policies for NIH‑generated discoveries, the funding climate, and ethical/conflict‑of‑interest concerns.

## 2. HISTORY  

**NCATS and the “engineer” approach**  
NCATS was formally launched in late 2011 with a $300 M budget. Over the next decade it built the **Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP)** with industry and the FDA, creating disease‑focused consortia (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Type 2 diabetes, etc.) that share data and resources to improve target validation. While AMP has not eliminated late‑stage failures, it has produced several high‑profile successes, most notably the **PCSK9 inhibitors** (evolocumab, alirocumab) whose development was accelerated by human‑genetics evidence and were approved in 2015.  

**Target validation advances**  
The past 15 years have seen a dramatic rise in systematic target validation tools: CRISPR‑based loss‑of‑function screens, large‑scale human‑genetics studies (e.g., GWAS, exome sequencing), and the **NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center**. These have helped prioritize targets with stronger causal links to disease, contributing to a modest improvement in Phase II‑to‑Phase III transition rates (from ~30 % in 2011 to ~38 % in 2023, according to FDA data).  

**Genomics‑driven drug discovery**  
The cost of whole‑genome sequencing fell from ~$100 k in 2011 to <$1 k by 2020, enabling population‑scale projects such as the **All of Us Research Program** (launched 2018). Several drugs now trace their rationale to human‑genetics findings: PCSK9 inhibitors (cholesterol), **SGLT2 inhibitors** (type 2 diabetes, though discovered by industry), and **RNA‑targeting therapies** (e.g., patisiran for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, approved 2018). Nonetheless, many genome‑identified targets have stalled in preclinical or early‑clinical stages, showing that sequencing alone is not a guarantee of success.  

**DARPA toxicology chip / organ‑on‑a‑chip**  
DARPA’s “Microphysiological Systems” program, announced in 2015, funded the development of **organ‑on‑a‑chip** platforms that mimic human organ physiology for toxicity testing. By 2022, several of these systems (e.g., liver‑on‑a‑chip, heart‑on‑a‑chip) were adopted by pharmaceutical companies for lead‑optimization safety screens, reducing reliance on animal models. However, they have not yet replaced traditional toxicology assays; regulatory acceptance remains limited, and the “toxicology chip” described in 2011 is now part of a broader suite of in‑vitro models rather than a single device.  

**Drug repurposing**  
NCATS launched the **NIH NCATS Drug Repurposing Program** in 2015, screening existing compounds against new disease models. Notable outcomes include the identification of **sirolimus** as a candidate for COVID‑19 (investigated in 2020‑21) and **metformin** for cancer prevention (ongoing trials). While no repurposed candidate has yet reached FDA approval solely on the basis of the NCATS effort, the program has generated dozens of clinical trial proposals and has become a recognized source of “low‑hanging‑fruit” leads for industry partners.  

**Funding and policy**  
The CTSA (Clinical and Translational Science Awards) network, expanded under Collins, grew from 60 to >120 hubs by 2020, fostering infrastructure for early‑phase trials and data sharing. The NIH’s out‑licensing policies were clarified in 2013 with the **NIH Patent Policy** revision, which emphasized “reasonable” licensing and mandated public‑access provisions for federally funded inventions.  

Overall, many of the themes Collins highlighted have materialized to varying degrees: improved target validation, increased use of human‑genomics data, emergence of organ‑on‑chip toxicology models, and a modest but tangible impact of NIH‑driven drug repurposing. The high‑failure rate of drug development remains a challenge, but the engineering mindset introduced by NCATS has reshaped how early‑stage risk is assessed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“The failure rate is too high because the wrong targets are being picked; better target validation will reduce attrition.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partial success. Systematic genetics and CRISPR screens have improved target selection, and Phase II‑to‑Phase III success rates have risen modestly (≈8 % absolute increase). However, overall attrition (≈90 % of candidates fail before market) remains high.  

- **Prediction:** *“Sequencing of human genomes will generate new therapeutic targets.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Human‑genetics–driven targets such as PCSK9, IL‑23, and several RNA‑targeted therapies have led to approved drugs. Yet many sequenced targets have not progressed beyond early research, so the impact is significant but not universal.  

- **Prediction:** *“DARPA‑backed toxicology chip will improve early safety assessment.”*  
  **Outcome:** The specific “chip” evolved into a suite of organ‑on‑a‑chip platforms. These are now used by many pharma groups for mechanistic toxicology studies, but they have not replaced conventional animal testing or become a regulatory standard.  

- **Prediction:** *“Repurposing existing drugs will become a major route to new indications.”*  
  **Outcome:** Repurposing has yielded several clinical successes (e.g., thalidomide for multiple myeloma, sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension) and continues to be a valuable strategy, but it remains a niche compared with de‑novo drug discovery. NIH‑driven repurposing has contributed candidates but no FDA‑approved product solely from the NCATS pipeline yet.  

- **Prediction:** *“NCATS will clarify its role and out‑licensing model, avoiding competition with industry.”*  
  **Outcome:** The 2013 NIH Patent Policy and subsequent NCATS licensing guidelines established a clear, non‑exclusive licensing framework. NCATS now operates primarily as a “de‑risking” hub, partnering with industry rather than competing directly.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The interview captures a pivotal moment when the NIH formally embraced an engineering, risk‑reduction approach to drug development—a shift that has had lasting, measurable influence on target validation, toxicology modeling, and repurposing initiatives. The content is still relevant for understanding today’s translational ecosystem, though many specifics have evolved beyond the original framing.
