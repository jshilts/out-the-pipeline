# More on Pharma Stock Buybacks (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post laments the scale of share‑repurchase programmes in large biopharma firms.  The author notes that, in the two‑year window ending 2012, buybacks exceeded the NIH budget, were several‑fold larger than venture‑backed M&A, and dwarfed the total venture capital invested in biotech.  The piece argues that buybacks only make sense when a company is truly undervalued and has no better use for cash.  Because many firms are instead using excess cash to repurchase stock rather than fund internal R&D or early‑stage innovation, the author questions the long‑term sustainability of the model and suggests that even a modest fraction of the buyback pool (e.g., 5 %) could dramatically expand funding for startups and pre‑competitive consortia.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of buybacks after 2012**  
- From 2013 onward, the total amount of share repurchases by large biopharma companies continued to rise, driven by low interest rates, the 2017 U.S. corporate‑tax cut (which increased after‑tax cash), and a broader market trend that treated buybacks as a primary tool for returning capital to shareholders.  
- Industry data (e.g., S&P Pharma & Biotechnology Index reports) show annual buyback volumes climbing from roughly **$30 billion in 2012** to **over $80 billion by 2022**.  The upward trajectory peaked in 2021‑2022 when many firms announced multi‑year repurchase authorisations exceeding $10 billion each.  

**Impact on R&D spending**  
- Despite the surge in buybacks, R&D intensity (R&D spend as a % of revenue) for the top 20 biopharma firms remained relatively flat, hovering around 15‑18 % of sales.  Some companies (e.g., Gilead, Amgen) increased R&D budgets modestly, but the bulk of excess cash was still directed to buybacks or dividends.  
- The “pipeline productivity” concerns highlighted in the 2012 post persisted.  A 2020 analysis by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) found that the number of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved per $10 billion of R&D spend had not improved markedly since the early 2010s.  

**Venture‑capital environment**  
- Venture capital for biotech grew steadily after 2012, reaching **≈ $30 billion annually by 2022**, roughly a third of the annual buyback totals.  While the absolute amount of VC funding increased, it never approached the scale of the buyback pool, confirming the author’s point that a small re‑allocation could have a sizable effect.  
- A few limited‑scope initiatives attempted to redirect capital (e.g., the **NIH‑funded “Accelerating Medicines Partnership”** and private “pre‑competitive consortia” such as the **COVID‑19 Therapeutics Accelerator**), but no systematic mechanism to divert a fixed percentage of buybacks into early‑stage biotech materialised.  

**Regulatory and policy developments**  
- The SEC introduced tighter disclosure rules for share‑repurchase programmes in 2014, requiring companies to report the number of shares repurchased each quarter.  This increased transparency but did not curb the overall volume.  
- The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, effectively raising after‑tax cash and making buybacks even more attractive.  No legislation specifically targeted the biotech sector’s buyback practices.  

**Business outcomes**  
- Some high‑profile firms that relied heavily on buybacks later faced market corrections when pipeline setbacks emerged (e.g., **Valeant/ Bausch Health** in 2015‑2016, **Mylan** in 2019).  Their stock prices fell sharply despite prior buyback activity, underscoring the limited protective effect of repurchases.  
- Conversely, companies that combined buybacks with robust pipeline progress (e.g., **Regeneron**, **Vertex**) continued to see strong total‑shareholder returns, suggesting that the “undervalued + no‑better‑use” condition sometimes held true.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction (2012) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Buybacks would continue to grow unless firms found better uses for cash.** | Buybacks expanded dramatically through the 2010s, reaching > $80 billion annually by 2022. No major shift toward alternative capital deployment occurred at the industry level. | Accurate in magnitude; the “better use” alternative never materialised at scale. |
| **A modest (≈ 5 %) re‑allocation of buyback funds could transform early‑stage biotech financing.** | No systematic policy or industry‑wide mechanism redirected buyback cash. Venture funding grew, but largely from traditional LP sources, not from repurchase pools. | Not realized; the suggestion remains a hypothetical. |
| **Buybacks would not reliably boost stock performance.** | Empirical studies (e.g., Harvard Business School, 2018) found that, on average, biotech share repurchases did not generate abnormal long‑term returns; many firms under‑performed after large buyback announcements. | Confirmed; the lack of correlation persisted. |
| **If firms cannot earn higher returns internally, their business model is questionable.** | Some firms with persistent pipeline failures (e.g., **Valeant**, **Mylan**) saw market value erosion and were forced into restructuring or acquisition. Others (e.g., **Regeneron**) maintained strong pipelines and justified buybacks. | Mixed: the prediction held for poorly performing companies but not universally. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece captures a pivotal financial debate that has shaped biopharma capital allocation for the past decade; its relevance to R&D funding, market dynamics, and policy makes it notably interesting, though the arguments are largely qualitative.
