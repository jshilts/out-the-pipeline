# A Preventative Trial for Alzheimer's: The Right Experiment (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article announced the launch of the first large‑scale preventative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) trial, targeting carriers of the rare **PSEN1 E280A “Colombian” mutation** that guarantees early‑onset AD. About 300 participants were to be enrolled: 100 mutation carriers receiving the anti‑amyloid antibody **crenezumab** every two weeks, 100 carriers receiving placebo, and 100 non‑carriers (all on placebo). The study was funded mainly by Genentech/Roche ($65 M) with additional NIH and foundation support.  

The author praised the design as a clever way to avoid the massive sample‑size problem of primary‑prevention trials in the general population, while also noting that the experiment would serve as a direct test of the amyloid hypothesis. He expressed skepticism that the drug would ultimately be therapeutic, but hoped the trial would yield valuable biomarker data and insight into the hypothesis.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Trial execution and outcomes**  
* The trial (often referred to as the **DIAN‑TU crenezumab arm**) began in 2012 and ran for several years, with participants monitored by cognitive testing, MRI/PET imaging, and extensive fluid biomarkers.  
* In **2018** an interim analysis of the broader DIAN‑TU program (which included solanezumab and gantenerumab) showed no significant slowing of cognitive decline.  
* A **final analysis of the crenezumab cohort, published in 2020**, reported that the antibody did **not meet its primary clinical endpoints** (change in Clinical Dementia Rating‑Sum of Boxes and other cognitive measures) compared with placebo. No clear disease‑modifying effect was observed, and safety was comparable to placebo.  

**Impact on drug development**  
* Following the negative result, Roche **halted further development of crenezumab** in 2020 and withdrew it from the pipeline.  
* The failure contributed to a broader re‑evaluation of amyloid‑targeting antibodies, but it did **not end the amyloid hypothesis**. Subsequent antibodies—**aducanumab (Biogen, 2021), lecanemab (Eisai/Biogen, 2023), and donanemab (Eli Lilly, 2024)**—achieved FDA approval (lecanemab and donanemab with confirmed clinical benefit; aducanumab’s approval remains controversial). These later successes were built on more potent antibodies, higher dosing, and refined patient selection (e.g., amyloid‑positive mild cognitive impairment).  

**Biomarker advances**  
* The DIAN‑TU data set, including the crenezumab arm, became a **rich resource for biomarker research**. It helped validate **plasma phosphorylated tau (p‑tau181, p‑tau217)** as early indicators of amyloid pathology, and refined PET amyloid quantification methods. These biomarkers are now routinely used in both clinical trials and emerging diagnostic workflows.  

**Policy and industry effects**  
* The trial demonstrated that **preventative trials in genetically defined high‑risk groups are feasible**, encouraging similar designs (e.g., the Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative trial of gantenerumab in the same Colombian cohort, launched 2019).  
* Funding models that combine industry, NIH, and philanthropic sources, as exemplified here, have become a standard template for high‑risk neuro‑degenerative studies.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Low chance of therapeutic success for crenezumab** – the author doubted the drug would work. | The Phase III/DIAN‑TU crenezumab trial failed to demonstrate clinical benefit; development was stopped. | Correct. |
| **The trial would serve as a direct test of the amyloid hypothesis**. | The negative result was interpreted as evidence that simply clearing amyloid with this antibody does not translate into clinical improvement, fueling debate but not disproving the hypothesis entirely. | Largely correct; the result added a data point against a simplistic amyloid‑clearance view. |
| **Biomarker data would emerge that could aid future trials**. | The study contributed to validation of plasma p‑tau assays and refined amyloid PET quantification, now standard in AD research. | Correct. |
| **The approach (targeting mutation carriers) would be a model for future prevention trials**. | Subsequent prevention studies (e.g., gantenerumab in the same Colombian cohort, and other DIAN‑TU arms) have used the same design. | Correct. |
| **No immediate FDA‑approved disease‑modifying drug would result from this trial**. | No drug from this specific trial reached approval; later amyloid antibodies (lecanemab, donanemab) succeeded, but they are distinct molecules. | Correct. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment: the first preventive, genetically‑targeted AD trial and a candid appraisal of the amyloid hypothesis. Its relevance endures because the trial’s outcomes shaped subsequent drug development, biomarker strategies, and trial design, even though the specific drug failed.
