# Surely You Have Something Else to Do (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a short, opinion‑style commentary aimed at organic chemists who shy away from reactions that require “gaseous reagents.”  Apart from the routine hydrogenations, the author lists a handful of under‑used gas‑based transformations—metal‑catalysed carbonylations (CO insertion), aminations with ammonia, additions of acetylene, sulfonylations with sulfur dioxide, and, by extension, photochemical and electrochemical processes that often need specialised equipment (cylinder regulators, glove‑box‑type setups, etc.).  The tone is informal: the author suggests that the extra logistical hassle discourages many practitioners, even though the chemistry can be powerful, and invites readers to propose other neglected gas‑phase reactions.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Carbonylation (CO)  
* **Flow chemistry** – Since ~2014, continuous‑flow reactors have become the work‑horse for handling CO safely.  Groups such as Jensen (MIT) and Ley (Cambridge) demonstrated scalable carbonylative couplings (e.g., palladium‑catalysed carbonylative Suzuki, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions) in micro‑reactors that contain the gas in sealed channels, dramatically reducing exposure risk.  Commercial flow platforms (e.g., Vapourtec, Syrris) now ship with CO‑compatible modules, and many pharma process chemists use them for late‑stage carbonylations.  
* **CO surrogates** – Parallel to flow, a wave of “masked CO” reagents (e.g., Mo(CO)₆, 1,2‑dihalo‑ethanes, formic acid derivatives, and the solid “CO‑releasing molecules” (CORM‑1, CORM‑2)) entered the literature.  These allow bench‑top carbonylations without a cylinder, though they are generally limited to small‑scale discovery rather than large‑scale manufacturing.  
* **Industrial uptake** – Large‑scale carbonylations (e.g., synthesis of ibuprofen, naproxen, and various acrylates) continue to rely on traditional CO plants, but safety upgrades (automated leak detection, inert gas blankets) have become standard after several high‑profile incidents in the 2010s.

### Ammonia (NH₃)  
* **Buchwald‑Hartwig amination with NH₃** – In 2014, Hartwig and co‑workers reported a palladium‑catalysed protocol that couples aryl halides directly with gaseous NH₃ to give primary anilines.  The method was later adapted to flow and to solid‑NH₃ generators (e.g., ammonium carbamate) to avoid handling pressurised gas.  
* **Electrochemical amination** – Recent electrochemical approaches (e.g., Baran 2020) use NH₃ as the nitrogen source in reductive couplings, again favouring flow cells that can safely introduce the gas.  
* **Commercial impact** – Primary aniline synthesis via direct NH₃ carbonylation has not displaced the classic nitration‑reduction route at scale, but the gas‑phase methods are now routine in medicinal‑chemistry labs for rapid analogue generation.

### Acetylene (C₂H₂)  
* **Catalytic hydrofunctionalisation** – After 2011, several catalytic systems (gold, copper, nickel) were reported for regio‑selective addition of nucleophiles (e.g., amines, alcohols) to acetylene, enabling concise routes to vinyl‑functional groups.  However, the high explosion risk of acetylene kept most academic labs from routine use.  
* **Polymer and material chemistry** – Acetylene‑based click reactions (e.g., thiol‑yne) have found niche use in polymer cross‑linking, but the broader synthetic community still prefers safer alkyne surrogates (e.g., propargyl bromide).  

### Sulfur dioxide (SO₂)  
* **DABSO and related surrogates** – In 2014, DABSO (1,4‑diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane‑SO₂) was introduced as a solid, bench‑stable source of SO₂.  It sparked a surge of sulfonylation reactions (e.g., aryl‑SO₂‑aryl couplings, sulfonamide formation) that previously required gas handling.  By 2020, dozens of papers used DABSO, and several commercial kits now ship with it.  
* **Industrial scale** – Large‑scale production of sulfonyl‑containing APIs still uses gaseous SO₂ in continuous reactors, but the safety record has improved thanks to closed‑system designs and real‑time monitoring.

### Photochemistry  
* **Photoredox explosion** – Starting around 2012, visible‑light photoredox catalysis (MacMillan, Yoon, Nicewicz) exploded, delivering C–C, C–N, and C–O bond formations under mild conditions.  The field grew from a handful of papers to >10 000 publications by 2023, with dedicated photoreactors (LED arrays, flow photochemistry platforms) becoming standard lab equipment.  The original “do something else” attitude has largely vanished.  

### Electrochemistry  
* **Modern electrosynthesis** – The 2010s saw a renaissance in synthetic electrochemistry, driven by inexpensive potentiostats (e.g., ElectraSyn) and the ability to run reactions in sealed vials or flow cells.  Notable successes include the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols to carbonyls (Baran 2019) and the decarboxylative C–C couplings (Waldmann 2020).  Companies such as Merck and Pfizer now have dedicated electrochemistry teams, and the technology is being piloted for scale‑up (e.g., production of a key intermediate for an antiviral drug in 2022).  

### Overall Impact  
The article’s core observation—that logistical hurdles suppress the use of gaseous reagents—has been addressed through three converging trends: (1) **flow and micro‑reactor technology** that isolates the gas; (2) **solid or liquid surrogates** that release the gas in situ; and (3) **instrumentation advances** (LED photoreactors, benchtop potentiostats) that lower the barrier to entry.  While the gases themselves remain hazardous, the community has largely embraced safer work‑flows, and many of the reactions once considered “exotic” are now routine in medicinal‑chemistry and process‑development labs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit/Explicit prediction in the article | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Chemists will start using more gas‑phase reactions (CO, NH₃, acetylene, SO₂) despite the handling inconvenience.** | Partial fulfillment.  CO and NH₃ have seen notable uptake in flow and with surrogate reagents; acetylene remains niche due to safety; SO₂ use has been mainstreamed via solid surrogates (DABSO). |
| **Photochemistry will remain a “do‑something‑else” area.** | Strongly contradicted.  Visible‑light photoredox became a dominant methodology, with dedicated equipment now commonplace. |
| **Electrochemistry will stay marginal.** | Contradicted.  Electrochemical synthesis has grown rapidly, with commercial devices and several industrial scale‑ups by the early 2020s. |
| **The “higher activation barrier” (logistical) will keep these methods from widespread adoption.** | Overcome.  Engineering solutions (flow reactors, sealed cartridges, surrogate reagents) have lowered the practical barrier, leading to broader adoption. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of a cultural bottleneck in synthetic chemistry that turned out to be a catalyst for a wave of methodological and engineering innovations (flow chemistry, surrogates, photoredox, electrosynthesis).  Its relevance persists because the same logistical mindset still shapes how new technologies are adopted.
