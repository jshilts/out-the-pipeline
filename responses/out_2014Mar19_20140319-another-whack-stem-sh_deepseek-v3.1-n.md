# Analysis of "Another Whack at the Stem Shortage Myth" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine article by Derek Lowe dismantled the pervasive narrative of a critical shortage of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workers in the United States. Drawing heavily from Michael Teitelbaum's research and numerous other data sources, Lowe argued that claims of STEM shortages were largely manufactured by special interests—primarily technology companies seeking to flood the labor market with workers to suppress wages, universities hungry for research funding, and immigration lawyers profiting from work visa applications.

The article presented compelling evidence: U.S. higher education was producing 100-200% more STEM graduates than available job openings, real wages in science and engineering fields remained flat or grew slowly (contrary to what genuine shortages would produce), and unemployment rates in STEM fields equaled or exceeded those in comparably-skilled occupations. Lowe characterized the "STEM shortage" narrative as a myth that refuses to die, despite repeated factual debunking, because it serves powerful economic and institutional interests.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) revealed a far more complex and nuanced reality than either the "shortage myth" or "no shortage" camps fully captured:

**Employment Trends:** The tech sector experienced unprecedented growth, particularly from 2014-2021, creating massive demand for software engineers, data scientists, and AI/ML specialists. However, this demand was highly concentrated geographically (San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Austin, NYC) and occupationally specific. Meanwhile, traditional "hard science" fields like chemistry, biology, and physics continued to face oversupply relative to academic and industrial research positions.

**Wage Dynamics:** Tech salaries, especially for software engineers at major companies, skyrocketed. Senior engineers at Google, Facebook, and startups regularly commanded $300,000-500,000+ total compensation packages. However, wages in non-computer science STEM fields remained relatively stagnant. This created a bifurcated market: extreme shortages and wage inflation in specific tech roles, continued surplus in traditional sciences.

**COVID-19 Impact:** The pandemic accelerated digital transformation, further increasing demand for tech workers while potentially depressing other STEM sectors. Remote work enabled geographic salary arbitrage but also intensified competition for top talent.

**Data Science and AI Boom:** Starting around 2015-2016, the emergence of data science and machine learning created entirely new categories of high-demand roles that didn't exist when the original article was written, somewhat validating the need for more advanced technical education.

**Immigration Policy:** The Trump administration's H-1B restrictions (2017-2020) reduced the very supply of foreign workers that the original article accused companies of using to suppress wages, yet tech wages continued rising, suggesting authentic demand pressure.

**Education Response:** Universities dramatically expanded computer science programs. Many liberal arts colleges began requiring coding courses, and coding bootcamps proliferated, attempting to meet perceived demand.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the article got right:**

- **Wage suppression thesis partially validated:** Major tech companies faced multiple class-action lawsuits and government investigations regarding wage-fixing collusion (though these mainly involved agreements not to poach rather than immigration exploitation)
- **Special interests driving the narrative:** Tech lobbyists consistently pushed for expanded H-1B visas and STEM education funding, confirming the article's analysis of stakeholder incentives
- **Oversupply in traditional sciences:** Biology, chemistry, and physics PhDs continued facing limited academic/research positions relative to graduates produced
- **Data manipulation:** Companies and advocacy groups continued presenting misleading statistics about STEM shortages well into the 2020s

**What the article underestimated:**

- **Degree of tech labor market tightness:** The explosion in demand for software engineers, particularly in AI/ML, cybersecurity, and cloud computing, created genuine shortages in specific skill areas
- **Geographic concentration:** The analysis didn't fully anticipate how tech jobs would concentrate in specific metro areas, creating local shortages and surpluses simultaneously
- **Skill specificity:** The lumping together of "STEM" masked critical differences—surplus in some fields, shortage in others
- **Emergence of new disciplines:** The article couldn't predict the rise of data science, AI ethics, cybersecurity, and other fields requiring technical expertise
- **Wage bifurcation:** The assumption that wage trends would be uniform across STEM proved incorrect—tech salaries diverged dramatically from other sciences

**What the article may have missed entirely:**

- **The COVID acceleration:** The pandemic's impact on digital adoption reshaped labor markets globally
- **The AI boom's labor implications:** Large language models and AI tools created both new job categories and potential displacement effects
- **Remote work's democratizing effect:** Distributed work arrangements changed the geographic calculus of labor supply and demand

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile for long-term interest and importance. While the specific STEM shortage debate has evolved considerably, the fundamental analytical framework—questioning journalistic narratives, examining who benefits from particular policy framings, and scrutinizing the gap between corporate rhetoric and labor market data—remains highly relevant.

The skepticism toward corporate-funded "crisis" narratives presaged later scrutiny of tech industry self-promotion. The article's methodological approach—combining quantitative labor data with political economy analysis of stakeholder interests—anticipates the kind of critical thinking increasingly necessary in evaluating claims about "skills gaps," "innovation crises," and other policy justifications.

However, the score is limited to 7 rather than higher because:
- The analysis proved overly broad in lumping all STEM fields together
- It underestimated genuine labor shortages in specific high-tech areas
- The historical moment has moved on to different concerns (AI ethics, job displacement, remote work arrangements)

Nonetheless, as a case study in how to critically evaluate policy narratives and corporate rhetoric, and as a reminder that labor market discussions require sectoral and geographic specificity, the article remains valuable and prescient in its core methodological approach, even where its specific predictions proved incomplete.
