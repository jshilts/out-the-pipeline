# PARP Inhibitors Come Through (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary by Derek Lowe described the chaotic state of the PARP‑inhibitor field. At that point several large pharma programs had stumbled: Sanofi’s iniparib turned out not to be a true PARP inhibitor and failed; AstraZeneca’s olaparib had shown activity only in BRCA‑mutated ovarian cancer; Merck and Pfizer had out‑licensed their candidates (later known as niraparib and rucaparib) to smaller companies; and Medivation had bought Biomarin’s talazoparib.  

Lowe highlighted a new, positive Phase III result from Tesaro (the ex‑Merck compound, correctly called **niraparib**) that showed progression‑free survival benefits across three genetic sub‑groups of ovarian cancer, not just BRCA‑mutants. He argued that the “me‑too” nature of the multiple PARP drugs could be valuable, and that the field was finally moving from “unproven” to “clinically validated.”

## 2. HISTORY  

### FDA approvals and label expansions (2014‑2025)  
| Drug (company) | First FDA approval (indication) | Major later approvals (by Dec 2025) |
|---|---|---|
| **Olaparib** (AstraZeneca) | 2014 – ovarian cancer with germline BRCA mutation (maintenance) | 2018 – metastatic breast cancer (germline BRCA); 2020 – pancreatic cancer (germline BRCA); 2022 – metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (HRR‑deficient). |
| **Rucaparib** (Clovis Oncology) | 2016 – recurrent ovarian cancer (BRCA‑mutated) | 2020 – mCRPC (HRR‑deficient); 2022 – maintenance therapy for advanced ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA status (ARIEL3). |
| **Niraparib** (Tesaro → GSK) | 2017 – maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer (all-comers) after response to platinum chemotherapy (PRIMA trial) | 2020 – first‑line maintenance for advanced ovarian cancer (all‑comers, PAOLA‑1 combination with bevacizumab); 2021 – FDA approval for mCRPC (HRR‑deficient). |
| **Talazoparib** (Medivation → Pfizer) | 2018 – metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutation | 2020 – FDA approval for metastatic pancreatic cancer (BRCA‑mutated) in combination with pembrolizumab (Phase II data); 2023 – FDA approval for mCRPC (HRR‑deficient). |

### Clinical impact  
* **Efficacy** – Across the four agents, large Phase III trials consistently demonstrated median progression‑free survival (PFS) improvements of 2–5 months versus standard chemotherapy or placebo, with overall survival benefits emerging in several indications (e.g., olaparib in mCRPC, talazoparib in breast cancer).  
* **Broadening beyond BRCA** – The early belief that PARP inhibitors only worked in BRCA‑mutated tumors proved too narrow. Trials such as PRIMA (niraparib) and PAOLA‑1 (olaparib + bevacizumab) showed statistically significant PFS in patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores or even in the overall population, confirming Lowe’s speculation that “niraparib worked very well indeed in the BRCA patients, but showed significance in others as well.”  

### Market and corporate outcomes  
* **Tesaro** was acquired by **GlaxoSmithKline** in 2018 for ≈ $5.1 bn, largely to secure niraparib (now marketed as **Zejura**). GSK has since generated > $2 bn in annual sales from niraparib (2023).  
* **Clovis Oncology** struggled financially after a 2019 FDA hold on rucaparib for prostate cancer, but the drug’s eventual approval in 2020 revived the pipeline; however, Clovis remains a small‑cap with modest revenues (< $200 m/yr).  
* **AstraZeneca** built a robust PARP franchise; olaparib (Lynparza) contributed > $3 bn in 2023 sales and supported the company’s “precision‑medicine” narrative.  
* **Pfizer/Medivation** integrated talazoparib (Talzenna) into its oncology portfolio; sales peaked at ≈ $1 bn in 2022 before plateauing as competition intensified.  
* **Overall market** – By 2025, the global PARP‑inhibitor market is estimated at > $10 bn annually, with four FDA‑approved agents covering ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Combination regimens (e.g., olaparib + bevacizumab, niraparib + immune checkpoint inhibitors) are in late‑stage trials, indicating continued growth.

### Policy and guideline changes  
* **NCCN and ESMO** guidelines incorporated PARP inhibitors as standard maintenance therapy for high‑grade serous ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA status (2020 onward).  
* **Companion diagnostics** (e.g., Myriad myChoice HRD test) became reimbursable in the U.S. and EU, facilitating broader patient selection.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | Reality (2025) |
|---|---|
| **Niraparib (mis‑named “neraparib”) would show benefit in non‑BRCA ovarian patients.** | Confirmed. PRIMA (2020) and subsequent real‑world data show PFS benefit across all HRD statuses; FDA label is for all‑comers. |
| **“Me‑too” PARP inhibitors would each find a niche and be valuable.** | Largely true. Four agents now occupy distinct market niches (maintenance vs. treatment, different cancer types, combination strategies). Competition has driven price pressure but also expanded indications. |
| **PARP inhibitors would eventually be combined with other agents, revealing differences.** | Ongoing and successful. Olaparib + bevacizumab (PAOLA‑1) and niraparib + pembrolizumab (Phase III trials) have shown additive efficacy; differential toxicity profiles (e.g., hematologic toxicity with niraparib) influence combination choices. |
| **The field was “unproven” but would become validated soon.** | Accurate. By 2025, PARP inhibition is an established therapeutic class with multiple FDA approvals and guideline endorsements. |
| **Companies developing PARP inhibitors were “wasteful” and would suffer.** | Not borne out. While some small firms (e.g., Clovis) faced financial strain, the major players (AstraZeneca, GSK, Pfizer) have turned the class into profitable assets. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment just before the class’s breakthrough; its hindsight analysis is highly relevant to understanding how a once‑dubious modality became a cornerstone of precision oncology.
