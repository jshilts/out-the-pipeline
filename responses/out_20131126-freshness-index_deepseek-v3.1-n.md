# The Freshness Index (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 blog post discusses the "Freshness Index"—a metric measuring what percentage of a pharmaceutical company's sales comes from products approved within the previous five years. The article references two different analyses: one by Bernard Munos showing Novartis leading with 19% "fresh" sales, followed by GSK (12%), J&J (11.8%), and Pfizer (10%). A newer analysis using stricter criteria (products approved since 2010 only) showed J&J leading with 23.4%, followed by Novartis (17.8%) and Novo Nordisk (13.6%). The author notes that Eli Lilly ranked at the bottom in both analyses (0.8% in the stricter assessment), expressing concern about this situation alongside other major companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Merck, and Sanofi also showing low single-digit freshness scores. The post highlights how different cutoffs significantly affect these assessments.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, the pharmaceutical industry landscape evolved significantly, though many underlying challenges persisted. **Eli Lilly**, the article's main concern with only 0.8% fresh sales in 2013, experienced a remarkable transformation. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, Lilly successfully revitalized its pipeline, particularly with diabetes drugs Trulicity (approved 2014) and Mounjaro (2022), as well as cancer therapies like Verzenio (2017). The company's strategic focus on innovative therapies paid off, with its stock performance significantly outpacing peers during 2020-2024.

**Novartis** maintained relatively strong pipeline productivity, continuing to rank well in freshness metrics through the late 2010s. **Johnson & Johnson** successfully navigated patent cliffs and maintained innovation, particularly in oncology and immunology. **Pfizer** faced significant patent expirations but partially offset losses through COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) success in 2020-2022, though this created debate about whether pandemic products should count in traditional freshness metrics.

**AstraZeneca**, another concern in 2013, staged a notable turnaround under Pascal Soriot's leadership (CEO since 2012), rebuilding its pipeline and achieving several major approvals, particularly in oncology. **GSK** continued to face pipeline challenges through much of the 2010s, leading to restructuring efforts.

The broader industry trend showed that while some companies successfully addressed their freshness index problems, the fundamental challenge of replacing blockbuster drugs facing patent expiration remained persistent across most major pharmaceutical firms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made one implicit prediction:

• **Eli Lilly's poor freshness index "can't be good, and it isn't"** - The author implied Lilly would face ongoing challenges due to lack of recent product approvals. However, this prediction proved partially incorrect. While Lilly did face several difficult years immediately following 2013 (including patent cliffs and pipeline setbacks), the company successfully reinvented itself by the late 2010s with major approvals in diabetes and oncology, ultimately becoming one of the industry's strongest performers by the early 2020s.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3**

This article addresses a moderately interesting but somewhat narrow operational metric that mainly concerns pharmaceutical industry analysts and investors rather than broader scientific or public health implications.
