# More Bacterial Targets Than You Know (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2017 *Nature Chemical Biology* paper from a multi-institutional collaboration (Broad Institute, Harvard, MGH, Chicago, Argonne) presenting BRD4592, an allosteric inhibitor of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* tryptophan synthase. The authors challenge the conventional wisdom that antibacterial drugs must target essential bacterial pathways. Instead, they demonstrate a compound targeting tryptophan synthase—an enzyme conditionally essential during infection but not required for *in vitro* bacterial growth.

BRD4592 emerged from a phenotypic screen rather than rational design and binds at an allosteric site, making it mechanistically complex. The compound increases enzyme stability and substrate affinity while paradoxically inhibiting activity by trapping reaction intermediates and stabilizing enzyme-product complexes. Although BRD4592 itself has poor drug-like properties (rapid metabolic clearance prevents mouse efficacy), it represents a proof-of-concept for expanding antibacterial target space beyond traditionally essential pathways.

## 2. HISTORY

The publication represents early-stage academic research rather than a therapeutic breakthrough. Since 2017, this specific work appears to have remained at the preclinical research stage—BRD4592 or close derivatives have not progressed to clinical trials, and no FDA-approved tuberculosis drugs based on this chemical series or target have emerged.

However, the broader strategy of targeting conditionally essential pathways has gained traction in antibacterial drug discovery. The concept of "conditionally essential" targets—proteins that bacteria require specifically during infection but not in laboratory culture—has influenced thinking about target selection, though practical implementation remains challenging due to the difficulty of modeling infection-relevant conditions in screening assays. The approach of phenotypic screening for antibacterial compounds (rather than target-based screening) has continued, but the more revolutionary applications have been limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Let's see if someone can make something of this chemical series, or of the target in general."**  
  - Outcome: No publically reported advancement of the BRD4592 chemical series into clinical development. The target (tryptophan synthase) remains unvalidated in humans, as no drug targeting it has reached clinical trials or market approval for tuberculosis or other bacterial infections. The prediction has not been fulfilled.

• **"We'd better come to grips with these things [conditionally essential targets]"**  
  - Partial success: The concept has received broader discussion in the field, but practical exploitation remains limited. While the scientific community recognizes the theoretical value, implementing drug discovery against conditionally essential targets remains technically challenging. Most antibacterial drug development continues to focus on classically essential targets (cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, DNA replication).

• **"We're going to need all the help we can get against resistant bacteria"**  
  - Reality confirmed: Antimicrobial resistance has continued to worsen, making the need for new antibiotics more urgent. However, the specific research direction highlighted in this article has not yet contributed to addressing that need with clinical therapies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the paper highlighted an scientifically interesting finding about allosteric inhibition and conditionally essential targets, it did not translate into practical therapeutic advances or fundamentally change antibacterial drug discovery paradigms. The article remains a niche research report rather than a landmark contribution.
