# Engaging the Public? (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2010 commentary critiques a Nature Structural and Molecular Biology editorial about science outreach. The author agrees with the premise that scientists should engage the public but describes the Nature editorial's recommendations (gauging audience knowledge, avoiding jargon, using analogies) as "sound, if still rather boring" and largely outdated. The commentary particularly mocks suggestions about seeking support from public officials and mentions of institutions hosting seminars as inadequate and reminiscent of 1976-era approaches. The piece argues that meaningful public engagement should primarily occur online and on television, noting the author's own blog receives 350,000-400,000 page views monthly from both scientists and non-scientists. The author advocates for focusing science communication on conveying what scientific research actually feels like—the uncertainty, failed hypotheses, verification work, and surprising results—rather than just teaching detailed facts, as this would help the public understand how science really works rather than the compressed, overconfident version often portrayed in media.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2010 commentary, significant developments occurred in science communication and public outreach:

**Digital Expansion**: Social media platforms became dominant channels for science communication. Platforms like Twitter emerged as major venues for scientists to engage with the public, with hashtags like #SciComm gaining traction. By the mid-2010s, thousands of scientists maintained active Twitter presences.

**Blogging and Online Platforms**: Science blogging expanded significantly beyond the 350,000-400,000 monthly views mentioned in 2010. Major platforms like Scientific American's blog network, Discover Magazine's blogs, and independent science blogs proliferated. New formats emerged including podcasts, YouTube channels, and TikTok science content.

**SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic from 2020-2023 created unprecedented demand for accessible science communication as the public urgently sought to understand virology, epidemiology, and vaccine development. This amplified both the importance and challenges of effective science outreach.

**Backfire Effects and Misinformation**: Research increasingly showed that simply presenting facts could sometimes harden misconceptions rather than correct them. Studies demonstrated that scientific literacy alone didn't necessarily correlate with acceptance of scientific consensus on controversial topics like evolution or climate change.

**Evidence-Based Outreach Methods**: Literature grew on effective science communication strategies, including framing techniques, narrative approaches, and addressing identity-protective cognition. Organizations like COMPASS developed training programs for scientists to communicate more effectively.

**Institutional Initiatives**: Universities and research institutions increasingly invested in science communication training and public engagement offices, validating the commentary's call for reaching broader audiences.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The commentary included several explicit and implicit predictions about science communication:

• **Prediction**: That science outreach needed to primarily happen online and on television where people actually spend time
  - **Outcome**: ✅ **Accurate**. Online platforms (social media, blogs, podcasts, YouTube) became the dominant channels for science communication in the subsequent decade, while traditional institutional seminars and official statements became less central.

• **Prediction**: That personal websites and blogs would be more effective than institutional approaches
  - **Outcome**: ⚠️ **Mixed**. While personal blogs and social media accounts became important, many successful science communicators leveraged institutional platforms (university blogs, Scientific American, The Conversation) and professional organizations. The distinction between personal and institutional became blurred rather than zero-sum.

• **Prediction**: That people with no science background would continue reading science blogs and learning about research
  - **Outcome**: ✅ **Accurate**. The audience for science content online expanded dramatically, though engagement varied greatly by platform and format.

• **Prediction**: That teaching what science *feels* like (uncertainty, failed experiments, verification) would be more valuable than teaching detailed facts
  - **Outcome**: ⚠️ **Partially validated**. While research on science communication effectiveness supported emphasizing the process of science, conveying detailed scientific facts remained important, and the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the public needed both factual information and understanding of scientific uncertainty.

## 4. INTEREST 
**Score: 6/9**

This commentary touched on themes that became increasingly important over the next decade—the shift from traditional to digital outreach and the need to convey not just facts but the process of scientific work. However, it was more prescient about *how* science communication should happen (online) rather than identifying truly novel conceptual frameworks.
