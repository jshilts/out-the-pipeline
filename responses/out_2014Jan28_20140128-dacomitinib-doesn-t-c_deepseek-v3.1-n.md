# Analyzing “Dacomitinib Doesn't Come Through” (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article reported on Pfizer’s dacomitinib, an irreversible pan-HER kinase inhibitor, failing two Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The piece noted that while Phase II data looked more promising, the compound missed its survival endpoints, making it an expensive and telling disappointment within Pfizer’s oncology portfolio. The author highlighted that even large pharmaceutical companies regularly experience high-profile clinical failures, countering the narrative that late-stage oncology wipeouts are limited to small companies.

In technical terms, dacomitinib targeted the cysteine residue Cys773 at the edge of the ATP binding pocket across the HER kinase family. The miss prompted a retrospective review to understand why it failed and whether actionable patient subsets could be salvaged from the data.

## 2. HISTORY

Despite the early 2014 Phase III failures in NSCLC, dacomitinib’s story did not end there:
- **NSCLC (primary failure):** The two Phase III trials referenced (ARCHER 1009 and ARCHER 1023) for second-line NSCLC indeed missed their primary endpoints, confirming the article’s immediate conclusion.
- **Resurrection in a different indication:** Pfizer pivoted to **first-line EGFR-mutant NSCLC**. The **ARCHER 1050** Phase III trial compared dacomitinib to gefitinib (an older EGFR inhibitor) in previously untreated patients with EGFR-activating mutations. This trial met its primary endpoint, showing significantly improved progression-free survival versus gefitinib.
- **Regulatory approval:** Based on ARCHER 1050, dacomitinib received approval in several jurisdictions (including the U.S. FDA in 2018, EMA, and others) as **VIZIMPRO®** for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant metastatic NSCLC.
- **Clinical adoption:** Post-approval, clinical uptake has been modest. Osimertinib (a third-generation EGFR inhibitor) often dominates first-line therapy due to superior brain penetration, better tolerability, and durable responses; dacomitinib has remained a less-used alternative.
- **Mechanism revisited:** The drug’s broad anti-HER activity (pan-HER) and irreversible binding did prove useful in a *narrow, biomarker-defined population* (EGFR mutants), but it failed where broader inhibition mattered (unselected NSCLC).
- **Later setbacks:** Dacomitinib did not succeed in other solid tumors; for example, it missed survival endpoints in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, reinforcing that its utility remains largely confined to EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Correct predictions:**
  - The article correctly stated that dacomitinib would not be the blockbuster “drug that Pfizer hoped for” in NSCLC—i.e., a broadly successful agent in unselected or second-line patients.
  - The speculation about “identifiable patient subsets that might be worth following up on” was prescient. The pivot to first-line EGFR-mutant patients (a genomically defined subgroup) led to approval, validating the idea that biomarker selection could salvage value from a failed program.

- **Incorrect or incomplete predictions:**
  - The article stopped short of predicting a successful resurrection for any subset; the tone suggested terminal failure rather than a narrowing to a niche indication and eventual regulatory approval.
  - It did not foresee that first-line EGFR-mutant trials would provide a viable path forward; at the time, development appeared moribund.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 4/9** (Moderately interesting)

**Rationale:**
- **Why not higher:** The article captured a common event in oncology drug development—Phase III failure—albeit for a large pharma product. While dacomitinib was ultimately approved in a narrow indication, it did not redefine the standard of care or generate blockbuster revenue.
- **Why not lower:** It illustrates several enduring themes: the unpredictability of clinical translation despite promising Phase II data; the strategic importance of biomarker-enriched populations in rescuing failed drugs; and the competitive dynamics in targeted oncology where later, better-tolerated agents (e.g., osimertinib) can overshadow earlier entrants even when efficacy is improved. The case also highlights that “failure” can be nuanced—commercial failure can coexist with regulatory approval.
