# Teaching Chemistry, According to the Press (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief 2015 commentary critiquing how journalism covers chemistry education. It references a Chemjobber blog post that highlighted media misrepresentations about how chemistry is taught, particularly questioning a claim that Emory University doesn't teach students about chemical bonds until their sophomore year. The author expresses skepticism about whether this claim accurately represents chemistry pedagogy, suggesting it's likely another example of media misunderstanding or misrepresenting scientific education—similar to how newspapers often demonstrate limited understanding of chemistry itself.

## 2. HISTORY

After publication in April 2015, the broader issue of accurate science journalism continued to be relevant within chemistry education circles, though no dramatic policy changes at Emory or elsewhere were publicly documented. Chemjobber (the chemistry careers and industry blog referenced) remained an active voice in chemistry community discussions until it ceased regular posting around 2019. Post-2015, concerns about scientific literacy in journalism persisted, with various studies (such as those from the American Association for the Advancement of Science) continuing to document gaps in public understanding of basic scientific concepts. However, there's no specific evidence that this particular critique led to substantive changes in how Emory or other institutions structure introductory chemistry curricula.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions. Its focus was retrospective critique rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a niche commentary about chemistry education coverage with very limited broader relevance or impact. While the general topic of science journalism accuracy remains important, this specific article addresses a minor, localized issue without wider implications.
