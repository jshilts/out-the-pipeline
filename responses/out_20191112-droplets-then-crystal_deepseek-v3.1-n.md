# Droplets, Then Crystals (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the fundamental process of crystallization, particularly in pharmaceutical manufacturing, using ibuprofen as a case study. The author highlights that despite centuries of crystallization experience, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. A new paper revealed that ibuprofen undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (spinodal decomposition, known as "oiling out") before crystallizing. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies showed that molecules in these liquid droplets are nearly as densely packed as in the solid crystal form, just lacking the orderly lattice arrangement. This dense liquid phase appears to be a crucial intermediate step for crystallization to occur.

The article speculates whether this phenomenon could be exploited to create novel liquid drug formulations that are nearly as concentrated as crystals but dissolve more readily. The author raises questions about the feasibility and stability of such formulations, concluding that the field lacks sufficient understanding to predict outcomes.


## 2. HISTORY
My analysis is constrained by the prompt instruction that I do not have internet access, and I cannot confidently provide specific details about developments in liquid-liquid phase separation and crystallization research since 2019. Without verification, I cannot accurately report on subsequent research papers, industry applications, regulatory approvals, or commercial developments in this area.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
Unfortunately, I do not have sufficient verified information to evaluate whether the predictions and questions raised in the article have materialized. My analysis would be speculative rather than fact-based.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**
The article has above-average interest due to its focus on fundamental mechanisms underlying pharmaceutical manufacturing, but it deals with a specialized topic that may have limited broader impact or immediate practical applications.
