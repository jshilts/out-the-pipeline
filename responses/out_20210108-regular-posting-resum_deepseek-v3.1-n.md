# Regular Posting Resumes Monday (January 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief personal blog update from early January 2021, where the author apologizes for an unintended hiatus from posting due to "real life" and work commitments during that week. The author announces that regular blog posting will resume on Monday and acknowledges that content will remain "corona-intensive for a while." The post expresses hope that over time there will be less pressing coronavirus news and more content about chemistry, drug discovery, and general science topics. The author connects this transition to the broader public sentiment of hoping that 2021 will be different from 2020.

## 2. HISTORY

This blog post was published on January 8, 2021, during a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within the subsequent years, several major developments occurred in the biopharmaceutical space:

- **Vaccine Deployment**: The COVID-19 vaccines that had received emergency use authorization in late 2020 (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) began widespread distribution and administration throughout 2021.
- **Additional Vaccine Approvals**: Johnson & Johnson's vaccine received EUA in February 2021, and later Novavax received authorization.
- **Variant Emergence**: The Alpha variant was already circulating when this post was written. Subsequently, Delta emerged in late 2020/early 2021 and became dominant by mid-2021, followed by Omicron in late 2021.
- **Therapeutic Developments**: Multiple COVID-19 treatments were developed and authorized, including monoclonal antibodies and oral antivirals like Paxlovid.
- **Return to Normal Research**: The biopharmaceutical industry gradually shifted from purely pandemic-focused research back to broader therapeutic areas as the immediate crisis subsided.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained these predictions:
- **Prediction**: Things would remain "pretty corona-intensive for a while" but hoped for "gradually less pressing news on that front"
  - **Outcome**: The prediction was accurate. COVID-19 remained the dominant health story throughout 2021, with major waves from Delta and Omicron variants, continued vaccine discussions, and new therapeutic developments. However, by 2022-2023, the intensity did gradually decrease as public health measures evolved and endemic status was reached.

- **Prediction**: More chemistry/drug discovery/general science content would return to the blog rotation
  - **Outcome**: As an internal blog management prediction, I cannot verify the outcome as I don't have access to the blog's subsequent posting history.

- **Prediction**: 2021 would be "not like 2020"
  - **Outcome**: The prediction was partially accurate. While 2021 continued to be dominated by the pandemic, it was different from 2020 in significant ways: vaccines became widely available, therapeutics were developed, and society began adapting to long-term coexistence with COVID-19 rather than the initial shock of 2020's lockdowns and uncertainty.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a personal blog housekeeping update with minimal scientific, biotechnological, or industry content, making it relevant primarily as a period piece reflecting the January 2021 moment during the pandemic rather than containing substantive analysis of the biotechnology industry.
