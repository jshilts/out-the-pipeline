# Virtual Pharma, Revisited (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the recurring debate about whether large pharmaceutical companies should eliminate internal R&D and rely entirely on in-licensing drug candidates from external sources. It references John LaMattina (former head of R&D at Pfizer), who weighed in on this "virtual pharma" model. The author expresses skepticism about whether such an approach could actually work, noting that if it were viable, major pharmaceutical companies would have likely already adopted it after running the numbers. The piece positions this as a perennial question in the industry that surfaces regularly but never seems to gain traction in practice.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2011 article, large pharmaceutical companies largely maintained their internal R&D operations rather than shifting to pure virtual models. However, several trends emerged:

**Hybrid models dominated**: Pharma companies increasingly adopted hybrid approaches - maintaining core internal R&D while significantly increasing external partnerships, academic collaborations, and licensing deals. Companies like Pfizer, Novartis, and Roche continued substantial internal research while also pursuing external innovation.

**Biotech acquisition wave**: The 2010s saw major pharma companies acquire promising biotech firms rather than just licensing individual compounds. Examples include Roche's acquisition of Genentech (completed 2009, but integration continued), AstraZeneca's $15.6 billion purchase of MedImmune (2007), and numerous smaller acquisitions throughout the decade.

**R&D productivity challenges persisted**: Despite various strategic approaches, R&D productivity remained a significant challenge across the industry. The cost to develop a new drug continued climbing, with estimates reaching $2.6-2.8 billion per approved drug by the late 2010s.

**Notable failures of pure virtual models**: Companies that attempted more extreme virtual approaches generally struggled. The article's skepticism about pure virtual pharma proved largely justified - no major pharma company successfully transitioned to a completely external R&D model while maintaining innovation leadership.

**Real-world evidence of internal R&D necessity**: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the value of internal R&D capabilities, as companies with strong vaccine platforms (like Pfizer working with BioNTech, Moderna, and others) could rapidly respond. Pure virtual companies would have lacked the infrastructure for such rapid development and manufacturing scale-up.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains implicit predictions:

• **That major pharma companies wouldn't adopt pure virtual R&D models** - ✓ ACCURATE. No major pharmaceutical company eliminated internal R&D entirely in favor of pure in-licensing

• **That if the virtual model worked, companies would have already adopted it** - ✓ MOSTLY ACCURATE. The model didn't prove viable at scale, though hybrid approaches became more common

• **That "running the numbers" would show the virtual approach doesn't work** - ✓ ACCURATE. Evidence from the subsequent decade suggests pure virtual models don't scale effectively for major pharmaceutical companies

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article addresses a fundamental strategic question that remained relevant throughout the following decade, but the discussion stayed somewhat surface-level and the skepticism expressed was already widely shared among industry observers.
