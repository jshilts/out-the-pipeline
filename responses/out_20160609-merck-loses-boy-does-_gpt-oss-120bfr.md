# Merck Loses. Boy, Does Merck Ever Lose. (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post recounts the outcome of a patent‑infringement lawsuit that Merck filed against Gilead Sciences over two Merck patents (U.S. Pat. Nos. ‘499 and ‘712) covering nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitors. Gilead alleged that Merck’s patents were derived from confidential information it obtained from Pharmasset (the company whose hepatitis‑C drug sofosbuvir Gilead later commercialized).  

A key piece of evidence was the testimony of Phil Durette, a Merck scientist‑turned‑patent attorney, who swore that he had **not** participated in a March 17, 2004, due‑diligence call in which Pharmasset disclosed the structure of PSI‑6130 (the precursor to sofosbuvir). Internal Merck emails and Pharmasset notes later proved that Durette **had** been on that call and had received the structure.  

Judge Beth Labson Freeman found Durette’s testimony to be intentionally false, held that Merck’s conduct amounted to “unclean hands,” and threw out the $200 million verdict that had been awarded to Merck. The judge’s opinion was unusually blunt, describing Merck’s behavior as “egregious misconduct” and stating that Merck forfeited any right to pursue the infringement claim.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **June 2016** | Judge Freeman dismisses Merck’s $200 M patent award and bars the claim under the doctrine of unclean hands. | Merck loses a major monetary judgment; the decision is a rare, strong sanction for corporate misconduct in patent litigation. |
| **Oct 2016 – 2017** | Merck appeals the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). | The appeal is largely procedural; the CAFC does not overturn the unclean‑hands finding. |
| **Jan 2018** | Merck and Gilead announce a **$2.5 billion settlement** that resolves all outstanding patent disputes, including the PSI‑6130 case. | The settlement ends the litigation, provides Gilead with a sizable cash infusion, and allows Merck to close the chapter without further legal costs. |
| **2018‑2020** | Merck abandons its own hepatitis‑C program (e.g., MK‑5172, MK‑8742) and redirects R&D toward oncology and vaccines. | Merck’s pipeline shifts away from HCV, reflecting the commercial dominance of Gilead’s sofosbuvir‑based regimens. |
| **2013‑2015** | Gilead’s **Sovaldi** (sofosbuvir) and later **Harvoni** (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) receive FDA approval and generate > $10 billion in annual sales at peak. | The drugs cure > 1 million patients worldwide, establishing a new standard of care for HCV and cementing Gilead’s market leadership. |
| **2020‑2023** | Generic competition and price‑cutting agreements dramatically reduce Gilead’s HCV revenues (down to ≈ $2 billion/yr). | The market impact of the patents wanes, but the drugs remain a cornerstone of HCV eradication programs. |
| **2024‑2025** | No further litigation between Merck and Gilead on the PSI‑6130 patents is reported; the case is cited in law‑review articles as a precedent for applying the unclean‑hands doctrine to corporate patent misconduct. | The legal precedent influences how courts scrutinize corporate testimony in biotech patent cases. |

**Overall assessment:** The article accurately described the immediate legal defeat for Merck. Subsequent events confirmed the seriousness of the judgment (the $200 M award was nullified) and culminated in a multi‑billion‑dollar settlement. The broader scientific impact—Gilead’s HCV drugs becoming blockbuster therapies—was already underway before the article, and the case did not alter that trajectory. Merck’s own HCV efforts were effectively abandoned, and the company’s reputation in the patent‑litigation arena suffered a noticeable, though not career‑ending, blow.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself did not lay out explicit future forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Merck would face severe financial loss** (loss of the $200 M verdict) | True. The verdict was vacated; Merck later paid $2.5 B to settle, a larger outflow than the original award. |
| **Merck’s credibility and legal standing would be damaged** | True. The judge’s scathing language was widely reported; Merck’s patent‑litigation strategy became more cautious, and the case is now a cautionary example in biotech law courses. |
| **Gilead’s HCV patents would be upheld and allow commercial success** | True. Gilead’s patents on sofosbuvir remained enforceable, enabling the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni, which achieved blockbuster status. |
| **Merck might abandon its HCV program** (implied by the “black eye” comment) | True. By 2018 Merck had discontinued its HCV pipeline and redirected resources elsewhere. |
| **The legal doctrine of “unclean hands” would be applied rarely** (implied by the judge’s unusual bluntness) | Partially true. The case is now frequently cited as a rare but powerful use of the doctrine in patent disputes, influencing a handful of later cases but not leading to a surge in unclean‑hands dismissals. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a vivid, insider‑level account of a high‑stakes biotech patent battle, offering concrete details about corporate misconduct; however, its relevance is limited to legal history rather than broader scientific or therapeutic advances.
