# A New Book on Scaffold Hopping (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reviews a newly published book titled "Scaffold Hopping in Medicinal Chemistry" edited by Nathan Brown from the Institute of Cancer Research in London. The book contains eighteen chapters organized into three main sections: five chapters on identifying and characterizing scaffolds, ten chapters on computational approaches to scaffold-hopping, and three case histories.

The author explains that scaffold identification is inherently subjective - what one chemist recognizes as a core structure, another might classify differently. The article notes that even computationally identifying maximum common substructures is challenging (not solvable in polynomial time). The practical definition offered for scaffold-hopping is empirical: a change significant enough that most chemists would draw a new Markush structure. The primary motivations for scaffold hopping are to escape patent constraints, improve selectivity, or enhance ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties while potentially retaining structure-activity relationship (SAR) knowledge from the original series.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2014 article, scaffold hopping and computational drug design have become increasingly central to pharmaceutical development, but with mixed real-world outcomes.

**Computational Methods Maturation**: The computational approaches mentioned in the book have evolved significantly. Structure-based drug design, molecular docking, and free-energy perturbation calculations have become standard tools in major pharmaceutical companies. However, the maximum common substructure problem remains computationally challenging, though improved algorithms and increased computing power have made practical applications more feasible.

**Impact on Drug Discovery**: Scaffold hopping has contributed to several FDA-approved drugs, particularly in kinase inhibitor development where scaffold modifications helped address selectivity and resistance issues. Drugs like osimertinib (Tagrisso) for EGFR-mutant lung cancer demonstrate successful scaffold modifications that maintained target activity while improving properties. However, many scaffold-hopping efforts have failed in clinical trials due to unforeseen off-target effects or unexpected ADMET issues.

**Industry Adoption**: By 2024, scaffold hopping is standard practice in drug discovery, with computational chemistry groups at all major pharmaceutical companies. Companies like Schrödinger, ChemAxon, and others developed commercial software platforms specifically for scaffold-based drug design. Academic groups, including Nathan Brown's team, continued publishing extensively on scaffold-hopping methodologies.

**Patent Landscape**: The patent-driven motivation for scaffold hopping became even more critical as pharmaceutical patent cliffs intensified. Successfully hopping scaffolds allowed companies to develop follow-on drugs with improved profiles while working around intellectual property constraints.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article suggested that scaffold hopping would remain important for three main reasons. Here's how those predictions compare to reality:

• **"To work out of a patent corner"**: ✅ **Confirmed**. Patent circumvention became even more significant as blockbuster drugs went off-patent and companies sought next-generation therapeutics. This remains a primary driver for scaffold-hopping efforts in 2024.

• **"To fix selectivity"**: ✅ **Confirmed**. Selectivity optimization through scaffold modifications has been crucial, especially for kinase inhibitors and GPCR-targeted drugs. The rise of polypharmacology understanding made selectivity even more important than anticipated in 2014.

• **"To get better ADMET properties"**: ✅ **Confirmed**. ADMET optimization through scaffold changes became increasingly important as drug discovery shifted toward more challenging targets. However, the unpredictability mentioned in the article ("might wipe out primary activity or pick up more issues") proved accurate - many failed programs resulted from unsuccessful ADMET optimization attempts.

The book's focus on computational approaches proved prescient, as computational chemistry became indispensable to pharmaceutical research, though the complexity of scaffold hopping remained higher than initially hoped.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article and book identified a genuinely important technique in medicinal chemistry that has maintained relevance and grown in sophistication over the subsequent decade. Scaffold hopping evolved from a niche concept into a standard drug discovery strategy with concrete impacts on approved therapeutics and pharmaceutical industry practices.
