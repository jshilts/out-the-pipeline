# Those Me-Too Drugs (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article challenges the widespread criticism that "me-too drugs" represent uninnovative copycat products developed by pharmaceutical companies seeking easy profits after a first-in-class drug proves successful. Drawing on a *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* study covering 94 therapeutic classes from the 1960s through 2007 (287 follow-on drugs total), the author argues that the timing data contradicts this narrative.

Key evidence presented: the lag time for second entrants has dropped dramatically from over 9 years in the 1970s to just 1.7 years by the 2000s. Given typical drug development timelines of 10-15 years, this means follow-on drugs must begin development before the first-in-class drug is approved. The data shows that 90% of the time since the early 1990s, a second drug had already filed for clinical trials before the first was approved, and 64% had already started Phase III. Patent filings tell a similar story—90% of new drug classes had follow-on drugs with patent filings before first-in-class approval.

The author, writing from industry experience since 1989, concludes that multiple companies typically pursue similar therapeutic approaches simultaneously once a new idea becomes plausible, creating a competitive race to market rather than low-risk imitation of proven breakthroughs.

## 2. HISTORY

The foundational research methodology and data sources used in the 2011 article (Grabowski et al., *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery*, 2011) became widely cited in subsequent policy debates about pharmaceutical innovation, generic competition, and drug pricing.

**Regulatory and Policy Developments:**
- The FDA's approach to follow-on drugs evolved, particularly with the 2010 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act pathway for biosimilars and the ongoing implementation of generic drug programs
- Payor strategies increasingly emphasized therapeutic interchangeability and formulary management that treats drugs within a class as largely equivalent when appropriate
- Drug pricing debates (2015-2020) frequently invoked arguments about "valuable differentiation" versus "excessive pricing for minor modifications"

**Business and Market Response:**
- Pharmaceutical companies continued parallel development strategies, with high-profile examples including the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors (Keytruda approved 2014, Opdivo 2014, others followed rapidly)
- The CAR-T cell therapy space saw multiple companies pursuing similar approaches simultaneously (Kymriah approved 2017, Yescarta 2017)
- The accelerated approval pathway and breakthrough therapy designation (2012) compressed development timelines further, intensifying parallel development

**Academic Research Follow-up:**
- Subsequent studies continued examining first-in-class versus follow-on drug economics, generally confirming that parallel development is common
- Research on differentiation benefits showed mixed results—some classes demonstrated meaningful patient benefit from multiple options, while others showed minimal clinical differentiation
- The "me-too drug" debate became more nuanced, distinguishing between genuine therapeutic advances and purely commercial differentiation strategies

However, I cannot confidently claim specific clinical outcomes, market share data, or detailed business performance metrics for individual drugs mentioned or companies referenced in the article's context without access to proprietary databases or comprehensive post-2011 outcome tracking.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: That the pattern of parallel development would continue and that the "race to market" characterization would become the accepted understanding rather than the "copycat" narrative.

**Actual outcome**: Mixed. The pharmaceutical industry did continue parallel development patterns, particularly in high-value therapeutic areas like oncology and immunology. However, the public and policy debate about "me-too drugs" did not fully resolve—arguments about innovation versus imitation continued through the 2010s, often in the context of drug pricing controversies. Payors and health economists increasingly accepted that multiple drugs in a class could provide value through competition and patient-specific responses, while some critics maintained that minor molecular modifications represented insufficient innovation.

**Prediction**: The authors anticipated their data would shift the broader conversation about pharmaceutical innovation and the value of follow-on drugs.

**Actual outcome**: The Grabowski et al. paper became a standard citation in discussions of pharmaceutical R&D patterns, but it did not end the debate. The tension between viewing pharmaceutical companies as pursuing parallel innovation versus engaging in derivative "patent clustering" remained unresolved through the decade, with different stakeholders emphasizing different aspects of the same data.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article provides empirically grounded insight into pharmaceutical R&D dynamics that challenges popular narratives, with quantitative timing data that reveals the reality of parallel drug development. While focused on a specific industry debate, the methodological approach and findings have broader implications for understanding innovation patterns in regulated competitive markets.
