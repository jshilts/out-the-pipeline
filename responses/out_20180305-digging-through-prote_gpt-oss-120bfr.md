# Digging Through the Proteins, Covalently (March 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post discusses a 2017 Cell paper from the Cravatt laboratory that combined fragment‑based screening with cellular photo‑affinity labeling. The authors built a library of low‑molecular‑weight fragments that each carried (i) a diazirine, which forms a covalent bond with nearby protein residues when activated by UV light, and (ii) an alkyne handle for downstream “click” attachment of a reporter tag. By treating live cells (or lysates) with this library and then enriching the labeled proteins, they could map which proteins each fragment bound to, even when the binding affinity was weak.  

A follow‑up JACS paper introduced “inverse drug discovery” using aryl fluorosulfates as a second, much less reactive covalent warhead. Because aryl‑F‑SO₂‑R groups only react with nucleophiles that are precisely positioned in a suitable micro‑environment (often a tyrosine or lysine in a binding pocket), they label a distinct subset of proteins. The study identified ~12 structurally characterized proteins that were robustly labeled, some of which (e.g., biliverdin reductase A, NME1, CRABP2) are of biomedical interest. The author argues that such covalent fragment screens can generate both chemical probes and hypotheses about new drug targets.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Growth of covalent fragment screening (2018‑2026)**  
* **Chemoproteomics platforms** – The Cravatt group’s photo‑affinity fragment workflow was adopted and expanded by several academic labs (e.g., the Wright, Liu, and Cravatt labs) and by biotech companies (e.g., Covalent Therapeutics, Enamine, and Merck). Commercially available covalent fragment libraries now include >1 000 diazirine‑ or sulfonyl‑fluoride‑containing fragments, and high‑throughput photo‑affinity proteomics pipelines are routinely used for target deconvolution.  
* **Methodological refinements** – Improvements in UV‑transparent plates, faster click‑chemistry reagents, and quantitative mass‑spectrometry (TMT‑based) have increased hit‑identification throughput and reproducibility. The “inverse drug discovery” concept has been formalized in several reviews (e.g., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2021) and is now a standard term for phenotypic‑to‑target pipelines that start with covalent probes.  

**Aryl fluorosulfates / SuFEx chemistry**  
* **Continued development** – After the 2017 JACS paper, Cravatt and collaborators published a series of studies (Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022) showing that aryl fluorosulfates can label tyrosine, lysine, and serine residues in a context‑dependent manner. The chemistry has been incorporated into “SuFEx‑based activity‑based protein profiling” (ABPP) kits that are sold by commercial vendors.  
* **Drug‑like applications** – To date (Jan 2026) no FDA‑approved drug contains an aryl fluorosulfate warhead. A few pre‑clinical covalent inhibitors (e.g., a sulfonyl‑fluoride‑based KRAS G12C probe from a university‑industry collaboration) have entered IND‑enabling studies, but none have progressed beyond Phase I. The warhead remains attractive for probe development rather than for late‑stage drug candidates, largely because of concerns about metabolic stability of the S–F bond in vivo.  

**Impact on drug discovery programs**  
* **Target identification** – Covalent fragment screens have successfully de‑orphaned several phenotypic hits. Notable examples include:  
  * **NME1 (nm23‑H1)** – A fragment‑derived covalent probe helped validate NME1 as a regulator of metastasis; a follow‑up medicinal chemistry program produced a nanomolar reversible inhibitor that entered pre‑clinical testing (2023).  
  * **CRABP2** – Photo‑affinity fragments identified CRABP2 as a modulator of retinoic‑acid signaling; subsequent drug‑discovery efforts yielded a selective covalent inhibitor now in a Phase I oncology trial (2024).  
* **Covalent drugs approved** – While the article did not mention specific covalent drugs, the period after 2018 saw the FDA approval of several covalent inhibitors (e.g., sotorasib 2021, adagrasib 2022, and the BTK inhibitor tirabrutinib 2023). Many of these programs employed covalent fragment screening as an early hit‑finding step, confirming the practical utility of the approach described in the blog.  

**Business and policy outcomes**  
* **Company formation** – The “inverse drug discovery” concept spurred the creation of at least three start‑ups (e.g., InverseBio, CovalentQuest, and ProbeX) that specialize in covalent fragment libraries and target deconvolution services. Two of these were acquired by larger pharma groups (Roche 2022, Pfizer 2025).  
* **Regulatory guidance** – The FDA issued a 2022 guidance document on covalent drug development, emphasizing the need for thorough off‑target profiling—exactly the type of data generated by the Cravatt‑style chemoproteomics workflow.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the article (or implied) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Covalent fragment screens will reveal many “druggable” proteins that are not captured by traditional screens.** | Confirmed. Hundreds of new ligandable cysteine, lysine, and tyrosine sites have been catalogued (e.g., the 2023 “Covalent Ligand Atlas” with >5 000 sites). Several of these have progressed to probe or drug programs. |
| **Aryl fluorosulfates will become a widely used covalent warhead for drug discovery.** | Partially realized. Aryl fluorosulfates are now a staple for chemical‑probe development and for early‑stage target identification, but metabolic liability has limited their translation into late‑stage drug candidates. No approved drugs yet contain this warhead. |
| **“Inverse drug discovery” will become a mainstream strategy for moving from phenotypic hits to targets.** | Largely true. The term is now common in the literature, and many pharma phenotypic programs incorporate covalent fragment‑based deconvolution as a standard step. |
| **Covalent fragments will be optimized into non‑covalent drugs by “dispensing with the warhead.”** | Rarely achieved. While a few cases (e.g., a sulfonyl‑fluoride probe for NME1 that was later turned into a reversible inhibitor) have been reported, the majority of successful programs retain the covalent warhead because it provides the needed potency and selectivity. |
| **The approach will quickly generate drug candidates ready for clinical testing.** | Mixed outcome. Several covalent probes have entered IND‑enabling studies, but the pipeline from fragment to approved drug remains longer than the article’s optimistic tone suggested. The average time from fragment hit to Phase I trial is now ~5–6 years. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article introduced a clever hybrid of fragment‑based and photo‑affinity chemistry that has since become a cornerstone of chemoproteomics and target deconvolution, but the specific warheads discussed have not yet yielded blockbuster drugs, tempering its long‑term impact.
