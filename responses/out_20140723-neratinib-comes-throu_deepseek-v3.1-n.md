# Neratinib Comes Through For Puma (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary describes Puma Biotechnology's dramatic stock surge following unexpectedly positive Phase III results for neratinib, a HER2/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor for breast cancer treatment. The article notes the company's stock jumped from the $50-60 range to over $220 per share after hours following the trial results announcement. The author highlights Puma's business model of licensing oncology candidates that larger companies like Pfizer had discontinued (Pfizer had previously dropped neratinib during an oncology portfolio review). The compound represents an irreversible kinase inhibitor targeted at HER2-positive breast cancer patients, positioning it as a potential alternative to existing therapies like Herceptin.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the July 2014 Phase III results announcement, neratinib continued through the regulatory pathway:

**Regulatory Timeline:**
- July 2014: Positive Phase III data announced for extended adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer
- July 2017: FDA approved neratinib (brand name NERLYNX) for extended adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer in adults who have previously been treated with trastuzumab-based therapy
- The approval was based on the ExteNET trial showing improved invasive disease-free survival

**Clinical and Commercial Outcomes:**
- The drug reached the market as intended, fulfilling the article's implied trajectory
- However, neratinib faced significant tolerability challenges in practice, with diarrhea being a prominent side effect that affected patient uptake and management
- The drug found its place in the treatment algorithm but did not revolutionize breast cancer therapy or displace trastuzumab (Herceptin) as the cornerstone of HER2-positive treatment
- Development continued for other indications and combination strategies

**Business Impact:**
- Puma Biotechnology achieved its primary goal of bringing a discarded compound to market
- However, the company faced ongoing challenges with commercial uptake due to side effect profiles and competition from other HER2-targeted agents
- The stock price volatility continued as commercial performance met with the realities of oncology drug competition

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implied success for neratinib approval pathway**: ✓ **LARGELY ACCURATE**. The drug did achieve FDA approval in 2017, validating the positive Phase III results.

• **Success for Puma's business model of reviving discarded compounds**: ✓ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**. Puma succeeded in bringing a compound to market, but the model's long-term viability faced challenges due to competition and market access realities.

• **Implicit assumption of significant patient benefit and uptake**: ⚠ **MIXED OUTCOME**. While patients did benefit from another treatment option, the drug's side effect profile (particularly severe diarrhea requiring proactive management) limited broader adoption compared to initial expectations.

• **Implied validation of irreversible kinase inhibitor approach**: ✓ **REASONABLY ACCURATE**. The mechanistic approach proved viable, though it did not create a paradigm shift in HER2-targeted therapy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While the article captures an important moment in drug development and illustrates the biopharma investment model well, the long-term impact was more modest than the dramatic stock movement suggested. The drug succeeded in reaching patients but faced the typical challenges of oncology drug competition and tolerability issues that tempered initial enthusiasm.
