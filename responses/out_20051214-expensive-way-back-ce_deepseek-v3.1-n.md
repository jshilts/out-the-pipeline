# An Expensive Way Back for Celebrex (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Pfizer's decision to launch a massive $100 million clinical trial to defend its COX-2 inhibitor drug Celebrex in the wake of the Vioxx withdrawal scandal. The study, to be conducted at the Cleveland Clinic under Dr. Steve Nissen, would compare Celebrex against naproxen and ibuprofen in 20,000 high-cardiac-risk arthritis patients, with results expected by 2009.

The article notes that Pfizer's size and financial resources made it one of the few companies capable of funding such an expensive trial. Merck had previously claimed such a study couldn't be run, but Pfizer's move was seen as potentially necessary to demonstrate Celebrex didn't share Vioxx's cardiac risks. If successful, Pfizer could dominate the remaining COX-2 market over competitors like Novartis's Prexige, though the company would need to prove both safety and superior efficacy over cheaper alternatives.

## 2. HISTORY

**The PRECISION trial and its outcomes:**
The large cardiovascular outcomes trial (PRECISION - Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen Or Naproxen) was indeed conducted and eventually completed. Final results showed that celecoxib (Celebrex) was non-inferior to ibuprofen and naproxen regarding cardiovascular safety at moderate doses, though long delays occurred during the trial.

**Celebrex's subsequent trajectory:**
Celebrex remained on the market with FDA approval and maintained significant prescription volume, though the entire COX-2 inhibitor class faced continued scrutiny and safety concerns. The drug did not achieve the hoped-for market dominance suggested in the article, as safety concerns and cheaper alternatives limited its uptake despite the favorable trial outcome.

**Market dynamics:**
The COX-2 inhibitor market never fully recovered to pre-Vioxx levels. Generic versions of older NSAIDs maintained substantial market share, and physicians remained cautious about prescribing COX-2 selective inhibitors even after PRECISION results were published.

**Regulatory and policy impact:**
The episode contributed to strengthened FDA post-market surveillance requirements and increased scrutiny of cardiovascular safety for all NSAIDs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The study would finish by 2009
  - **Reality**: The PRECISION trial faced significant delays and was not completed until much later (results published 2016)

• **Prediction**: Pfizer would "own the market" if Celebrex proved safer than cheaper alternatives
  - **Reality**: While Celebrex remained available and commercially viable, it never achieved market dominance. Prescription patterns remained conservative due to persistent safety concerns

• **Prediction**: Novartis would need to run similar large trials for Prexige to compete
  - **Reality**: Prexige (lumiracoxib) faced its own regulatory challenges and was never approved in the US

• **Prediction**: The trial cost of $100 million would be prohibitive except for very large companies
  - **Reality**: This was accurate - very few companies could have undertaken such a large cardiovascular outcomes trial, validating the article's assessment of pharmaceutical industry economics

• **Prediction**: Being "humungous" was an asset for Pfizer in this situation
  - **Reality**: This proved correct; Pfizer's scale and resources enabled a trial few companies could finance

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important moment in pharmaceutical safety regulation and industry crisis management. While it focused on what was then current events, the underlying story—how drug companies respond to safety scandals and the economics of large clinical trials—remains relevant to understanding pharmaceutical industry dynamics.
