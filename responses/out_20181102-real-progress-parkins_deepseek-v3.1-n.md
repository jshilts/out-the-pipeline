# Real Progress in Parkinson's (November 2018)

## 1. Summary

The article reports on emerging evidence linking Parkinson's disease pathology to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the appendix. Researchers had discovered that misfolded alpha-synuclein protein—the hallmark of Parkinson's—appears to accumulate in GI tissues up to twenty years before motor symptoms appear, suggesting the disease may originate in the gut and spread to the brain via the vagal nerve through a prion-like mechanism.

The key development was a large-scale study of nearly 1.7 million patient records showing that appendectomy (surgical removal of the appendix) correlated with a 19% reduction in Parkinson's risk. Additionally, researchers found that aggregated alpha-synuclein in appendix tissue could trigger further protein aggregation, and that this misfolded protein is present even in infancy.

Complementing this finding, another study highlighted the NLRP3 inflammasome as a crucial pathway in Parkinson's pathology. In mouse models, inhibiting NLRP3 with a compound called MCC950 appeared to protect against alpha-synuclein-driven cellular damage, suggesting a potential therapeutic target.

## 2. History

**Gut-Brain Connection Research Continued:** The gut-origin hypothesis for Parkinson's has gained substantial traction since 2018. Subsequent research has strengthened the evidence for alpha-synuclein pathology beginning in the enteric nervous system and propagating to the brain via the vagus nerve.

**Appendectomy Studies:** The 2018 finding about appendectomy and reduced Parkinson's risk has been both supported and challenged by subsequent studies. Some meta-analyses have confirmed the association, while others found no significant protective effect, suggesting the relationship may be more complex than initially thought. The presence of alpha-synuclein in the appendix appears genuine, but its exact role in disease initiation remains debated.

**NLRP3 Inflammasome Research:** The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway has remained an active area of investigation in Parkinson's research. However, MCC950 specifically has faced challenges in clinical translation. While preclinical studies continued to show promise, the compound has not advanced to clinical trials for Parkinson's disease as of 2023-2024.

**Therapeutic Development Reality:** Despite the promising mechanistic insights, neither appendectomy as a preventive measure nor NLRP3 inhibitors have become standard clinical interventions for Parkinson's disease. The field has seen continued focus on alpha-synuclein as a target, but actual drug development has proven more challenging than the 2018 optimism suggested.

## 3. Predictions

• **Prediction:** "NLRP3 inhibitors of this type would seem to be solid med-chem leads for a Parkinson's drug discovery program, and I would assume that this is underway (or will be as soon as people read this paper!)"

**Reality:** While NLRP3 remained an active research target, MCC950 itself did not advance into clinical trials for Parkinson's. Drug development targeting this pathway has been slower than anticipated, with no approved NLRP3 inhibitor therapies for Parkinson's disease as of 2024.

• **Prediction (Implicit):** The appendectomy finding would lead to clearer preventive strategies or understanding of Parkinson's risk factors.

**Reality:** The relationship between appendectomy and Parkinson's risk remains ambiguous in subsequent larger studies. While the gut-brain connection is generally accepted, the specific role of the appendix and any potential for intervention based on this understanding has not translated into clinical practice.

• **Prediction (Implicit):** The mechanistic understanding of gut-origin Parkinson's would rapidly translate to therapeutic advances.

**Reality:** While the gut-brain hypothesis has become mainstream in Parkinson's research, actual therapeutic translation has been slow. Understanding mechanisms hasn't automatically led to effective treatments, highlighting the gap between mechanistic insight and clinical application.

## 4. Interest

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses a fundamentally important question about Parkinson's disease origins and presents compelling evidence for the gut-brain connection. While therapeutic translation has been slower than implied, the mechanistic insights have had lasting impact on Parkinson's research directions, making this a significant contribution to understanding the disease even if clinical applications remain elusive.
