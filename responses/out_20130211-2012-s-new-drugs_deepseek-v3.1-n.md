# 2012's New Drugs (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on the 39 new drugs approved by the FDA in 2012, noting it was "a good year, by almost any measure." The author raises the central question of whether this increase represents a one-time spike or the beginning of a long-anticipated turnaround in drug approvals. The article suggests that if sustained, such growth would be as much a "regulatory phenomenon" (faster reviews) as a scientific advance.

## 2. HISTORY

FDA drug approvals continued to show strength after 2012, with notable trends:
- **2013-2015 averages**: Approvals remained elevated compared to pre-2012 levels (around 27-41 annually), validating the author's question about sustained improvement
- **2014**: 41 approvals maintained momentum
- **2015**: 45 approvals marked another strong year  
- **2018**: Record 59 novel drug approvals
- **Long-term trend (2010-2020)**: The period 2012-2020 showed historically high approval rates averaging ~40 per year, compared to previous decades averaging 20-30 annually

**Regulatory factors proved significant**: The FDA's regulatory environment did evolve as suggested, with programs like breakthrough therapy designation (created 2012), priority review, and accelerated approval pathways contributing to faster review times and increased approvals for serious conditions.

**Pricing and access concerns grew**: While approvals increased, public policy debates intensified around drug pricing, leading to congressional hearings and proposed legislation, though major federal policy changes remained limited through the 2010s.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries experienced substantial growth in market capitalization and R&D investment during this period, though many approved drugs faced scrutiny over pricing and real-world patient access challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's central prediction was framed as a question:

• **"Whether this was a one-time spike, or the start of a long-awaited turnaround"**
  - **Actual outcome**: Data shows 2012 was indeed the start of sustained higher FDA approval rates through the 2010s, with multiple years exceeding 40 approvals and 2018 reaching a record 59

• **"If the latter, I think it will be as much of a regulatory phenomenon as a scientific one"**  
  - **Actual outcome**: Regulatory changes (breakthrough therapy designations, accelerated pathways, priority review) did play a major role in sustaining higher approval numbers, alongside scientific advances in targeted therapies and biologics

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a genuine inflection point and raised the right questions about whether regulatory factors would sustain higher drug approval trends, which proved prescient as the 2010s saw historically elevated FDA approval rates driven substantially by regulatory pathway evolution.
