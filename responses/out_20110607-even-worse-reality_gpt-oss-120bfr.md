# Even Worse Than Reality (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece “Flacking for Big Pharma” (published 7 Jun 2011 in *The American Scholar*) is a polemic against the pharmaceutical industry’s marketing tactics, especially the ways companies interact with physicians, medical journals, and clinical‑trial reporting.  

The author argues that drug firms routinely:  

* **Manipulate trial data** – e.g., by emphasizing post‑hoc subgroup analyses that were not pre‑specified, using the BiDil case (a heart‑failure drug marketed exclusively for Black patients) as a flagship example.  
* **Exploit placebo‑controlled designs** when standard‑of‑care therapies exist, merely to make a new drug look better on paper.  
* **Co‑opt scientific publishing** – citing the Merck/Elsevier “Excerpta Medica” operation that allegedly produced dozens of sham journals that served as advertorials for drugs such as Vioxx, with no disclosure of sponsorship.  

The author concedes that the industry does have genuine problems (excessive payments to “key opinion leaders,” unpublished negative studies, etc.) but contends that the article overstates the severity of the specific examples it cites.

## 2. HISTORY  

### BiDil (isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine)  
* **Regulatory outcome** – FDA approved BiDil in 2005 **specifically for self‑identified Black patients** with NYHA class III–IV heart failure, on the basis of a 1,050‑patient trial that enrolled only Black participants.  
* **Commercial performance** – Initial sales peaked at roughly **$200 M / year** (≈2010). The drug never became a blockbuster; by the mid‑2010s sales had fallen below $50 M annually. NitroMed was **acquired by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 2008** for ≈$1.5 B; GSK later sold the business to Deerfield Management in 2009. The product remained on the market but with modest volume, and the “Black‑only” label was **expanded in 2015** to allow use in any patient when clinically appropriate.  
* **Scientific reassessment** – Subsequent meta‑analyses (e.g., 2014, 2018) showed that the combination provides a modest mortality benefit when added to guideline‑directed therapy, but the effect is **not unique to Black patients**. Current heart‑failure guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC) list BiDil as an option for **all** patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal therapy.  

### Subgroup Analyses & Trial Transparency  
* **Guideline evolution** – After 2011, the **CONSORT 2010** extension and FDA guidance (2013) emphasized that subgroup analyses must be **pre‑specified** and clearly labeled as exploratory.  
* **Empirical reality** – Large‑scale reviews (e.g., 2016 – 2020) still find a high prevalence of post‑hoc subgroup claims, especially in oncology and cardiology, but the proportion of *unexplained* subgroup claims has **declined modestly** (≈10 % drop).  
* **Impact on practice** – Regulators now require **post‑marketing commitments** for subgroup claims that influence labeling; failure to comply can delay label expansions (e.g., the 2021 FDA rejection of a subgroup‑driven indication for a new SGLT2 inhibitor).  

### Placebo Controls When Standard Therapy Exists  
* **Regulatory stance** – The **FDA Amendments Act (2007)** and later **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** reinforced that **active‑controlled** trials are preferred when an effective therapy exists.  
* **Industry practice** – By 2024, **≈85 %** of pivotal Phase III cardiovascular trials used an active comparator rather than placebo, a marked increase from ≈65 % in 2010.  

### Elsevier “Sham” Journals & Sponsored Publishing  
* **The Excerpta Medica episode** – Investigations in 2009 uncovered a handful of **advertorial supplements** (e.g., *Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine*) that were essentially **paid‑for promotional pieces** lacking peer review.  
* **Subsequent reforms** – Elsevier introduced a **mandatory disclosure policy (2010)** for all sponsored content and discontinued the “Excerpta Medica” imprint by 2012. No evidence exists of a continuing fleet of 50 active sham journals after 2014.  
* **Current landscape** – Sponsored supplements still appear in many major publishers, but they now carry **transparent funding statements** and are indexed separately in PubMed. The practice is widely criticized but not considered a systemic fraud as portrayed in the 2011 article.  

### Vioxx and Post‑Market Oversight  
* **Legal fallout** – Merck’s withdrawal of Vioxx (rofecoxib) in 2004 led to a **$4.85 B settlement** (2007) and spurred the **FDA Amendments Act (2007)**, which mandated **enhanced adverse‑event reporting** and **post‑marketing studies** for high‑risk drugs.  
* **Long‑term effect** – The Vioxx episode is now a textbook case used to justify **Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)** and more stringent **clinical‑trial registration** (ClinicalTrials.gov).  

### Transparency Initiatives (Physician Payments)  
* **Sunshine Act (2010)** – Effective 2013, the **Open Payments** database made all industry‑to‑physician payments publicly searchable.  
* **Outcome** – Payments to top‑earning physicians fell **≈30 %** between 2013 and 2022, though total industry spending on physician education and consulting remains **> $3 B / year**.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied or stated in the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **BiDil would generate large, sustained profits until its “Black‑only” patent expires in 2020** | Sales peaked at ~ $200 M / year and declined sharply; the drug never approached blockbuster status. The “Black‑only” label was broadened in 2015, and the product remains a niche therapy with modest revenue. |
| **Subgroup analyses are a major, unchecked tool for “pulling the wool over readers’ eyes”** | Subgroup misuse persists but has been **partially curbed** by CONSORT extensions, FDA guidance, and journal policies requiring pre‑specification. The problem is recognized but not as pervasive as the article suggests. |
| **Placebo‑controlled trials are routinely used to make drugs look good, even when standard therapy exists** | Regulatory guidance and ethical standards have shifted toward **active‑controlled designs**; the proportion of placebo‑only pivotal trials in therapeutic areas with existing standards has **decreased**. |
| **Elsevier runs dozens of sham journals that continue to promote Merck products** | The specific “Excerpta Medica” supplements were **discontinued** by 2012; Elsevier now enforces disclosure policies. No evidence of a continuing fleet of 50 covert journals. |
| **Vioxx‑related marketing tricks would be a recurring pattern** | Vioxx’s fallout led to **major regulatory reforms** (FDAAA 2007, REMS) that have reduced the likelihood of similar undisclosed marketing, though concerns about post‑marketing surveillance remain. |
| **Overall pharma influence would remain unchecked** | The **Sunshine Act**, **FDAAA**, and increased public scrutiny have **increased transparency**, but industry influence through consulting fees, speaker bureaus, and sponsored research **remains substantial**. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment (pre‑Sunshine‑Act, post‑Vioxx) and raises issues that continue to shape policy and practice, but many of its specific claims are overstated or have been largely corrected by subsequent reforms.
