# Worst Lecture of All, Or Greatest? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the infamous 1983 lecture given by urologist G.S. Brindley, who was a pioneer in erectile dysfunction research and discovered the first useful therapies for this condition. The Science blog post frames it as either the "worst lecture of all" or potentially "the greatest," depending on perspective. The author references a memoir describing how Brindley chose an unconventional method to present his discoveries to the world—apparently demonstrating his findings in a way that left absolutely no doubts about their effectiveness. The article positions this as a memorable Friday post about a bold scientific presentation that became legendary in medical circles for its unorthodox approach.

## 2. HISTORY
The referenced 1983 Brindley lecture at the Urology Section of the American Urological Association meeting has become part of medical folklore. Brindley, a respected British physiologist, indeed pioneered pharmacological treatments for erectile dysfunction, specifically through intracavernosal injections of vasodilating drugs like papaverine. His research led to the development of the first effective medical treatments for erectile dysfunction, which later evolved into the oral medications that became widely available, most famously sildenafil (Viagra) in 1998.

The method of demonstration in his lecture—reportedly involving self-injection and live demonstration—was certainly unorthodox but effectively proved his point about the rapid onset and efficacy of the treatment. In the years following, intracavernosal injection therapy did become an established medical treatment for erectile dysfunction, though it was largely supplanted by oral PDE5 inhibitors after their introduction in the late 1990s. Brindley's research laid important groundwork for what became a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical market and helped destigmatize the medical treatment of sexual dysfunction. The incident became a well-known anecdote in medical education about scientific dedication and unconventional presentation methods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article makes no direct predictions—it's primarily a historical retrospective about a memorable scientific moment.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

This piece serves as light weekend content rather than rigorous scientific analysis, providing an amusing anecdote about scientific showmanship without broader implications for understanding biotechnology industry trends or developments.
