# A Call For Better Mouse Studies (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2014 commentary highlights the systemic problems in preclinical mouse studies, particularly in ALS research. The article focuses on work by Steve Perrin at the ALS Therapy Development Institute, who demonstrated significant discrepancies in attempted replications of putative ALS drugs. The main issues identified are poorly conducted mouse studies and fundamental problems with the mouse models themselves.

Key problems include lack of rigorous assessment of animals' physical and biochemical traits, insufficient characterization of disease symptoms and death timing, absence of mathematical models for experimental design, and inadequate statistical models to minimize experimental noise. The article specifically addresses problems with TDP43-mutant mouse models, noting that while they show some ALS-like features (motor neuron loss, protein aggregation, muscle atrophy), these mice don't actually display progressive paralysis like human patients. Instead, they die from acute bowel obstruction caused by gut smooth muscle deterioration, making survival studies largely irrelevant to human disease.

The author (Derek Lowe) emphasizes that the emphasis on translational research in academia is likely to exacerbate these problems, as many labs lack the necessary expertise to conduct proper rodent studies.

## 2. HISTORY

**Changes in Research Practices:**
Following the 2014 critique and similar concerns across biomedical research, there has been notable movement toward improving preclinical research quality:

- **NIH Initiatives**: In 2014, NIH began emphasizing rigor and reproducibility, with Francis Collins and Lawrence Tabak publishing influential papers on the topic. NIH now requires grant applications to address scientific rigor, authentication of key biological resources, and consideration of sex as a biological variable.

- **Improved Guidelines**: Organizations like the ALS Therapy Development Institute continued developing better preclinical guidelines. More journals now require detailed reporting of preclinical studies, including power calculations, randomization, and blinding.

- **Replication Crisis Awareness**: The broader replication crisis in science (not limited to ALS) has led to increased scrutiny of animal studies across therapeutic areas.

**ALS Clinical Research Subsequent Developments:**
- **Continued Clinical Failures**: Between 2014-2024, numerous ALS clinical trials failed, including major studies of compounds that showed promise in mouse models but failed in humans (such as various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory approaches).

- **TDP43 Research**: While TDP43 remains a important protein in ALS research, the mouse models have remained problematic. Subsequent research has focused more on patient-derived cells, organoids, and human post-mortem tissue studies.

- **Riluzole and Edaravone**: Riluzole (approved 1995) and Edaravone (approved 2017) remained the only FDA-approved ALS treatments through much of this period, with modest effects on survival (riluzole extends life by 3-6 months, edaravone shows modest slowing of decline).

- **AMX0035**: In 2022, FDA approved AMX0035 (sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol) based on modest clinical benefit, though questions remain about its efficacy and mechanism.

**Broader Preclinical Reform:**
- **Consortium Approaches**: Groups like the Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative have adopted more standardized, multi-site validation approaches.
- **Publication Standards**: Journals increasingly require ARRIVE guidelines for animal research reporting.
- **Industry Adaptation**: Pharmaceutical companies have become more selective about which mouse data to advance into clinical development, though the fundamental challenges persist.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

**• Improved Guideline Adoption**: The article predicted that following ALS TDI guidelines would reduce false positives and prevent unwarranted clinical trials.
- **Reality**: Guidelines have been increasingly adopted, but major challenges remain. Clinical trial failures in ALS have continued at high rates, suggesting either insufficient guideline adoption or that guideline improvements alone cannot solve fundamental model validity problems.

**• Academic Labs Would Struggle with Translational Research**: The article predicted that academic labs' emphasis on translational research would land them in trouble due to poor rodent study practices.
- **Reality**: This has been partially borne out. Many academic drug discovery programs have struggled, though some institutions have invested in better preclinical infrastructure. The fundamental tension between academic discovery and rigorous drug development remains.

**• TDP43 Models Would Prove Problematic**: While not explicitly a prediction, the article implied that TDP43-mutant mice wouldn't be predictive for drug development.
- **Reality**: This concern proved valid. TDP43 remains important in understanding ALS mechanisms, but drugs developed primarily based on these mouse models have generally not succeeded in human trials.

**• Better Experimental Design Math Would Help**: Implied prediction that mathematical models and statistical rigor would improve preclinical outcomes.
- **Reality**: Better statistical practice has helped reduce false positives, but hasn't solved the fundamental problem of poor model translatability in many disease areas.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a critical, ongoing problem in biomedical research that has become even more relevant with the increased focus on translational research and growing awareness of the replication crisis. It highlighted specific, actionable issues in ALS research that generaliz to many therapeutic areas and predated many of the institutional reforms that followed.
