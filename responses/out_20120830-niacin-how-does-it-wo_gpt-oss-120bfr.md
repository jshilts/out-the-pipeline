# Niacin: How Does It Work, Anyway? (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted niacin’s long‑standing reputation as a “four‑in‑one” lipid‑modifying agent—lowering LDL‑cholesterol and triglycerides while raising HDL‑cholesterol and suppressing free fatty acids (FFAs).  The author explained that the drug’s clinical use is limited by a flushing reaction that occurs at the high doses needed for lipid effects.  Flushing is mediated by the G‑protein‑coupled receptor GPR109A (also called HCA2) through a prostaglandin cascade.  Early animal work suggested that the same receptor might also be required for niacin’s lipid‑beneficial actions, because GPR109A‑knockout mice lost both flushing and FFA suppression.

A new human study (published in *Science Translational Medicine* in 2012) tested two selective GPR109A agonists—MK‑1903 (Arena Pharmaceuticals) and SCH‑900271.  Both reproduced the acute FFA‑lowering and flushing but failed to produce chronic FFA suppression or the downstream improvements in LDL, HDL, or triglycerides seen with niacin.  The authors concluded that niacin’s lipid‑modifying effects must involve a pathway independent of GPR109A, and that the earlier hypothesis linking the receptor to both flushing and lipid benefits was likely wrong.  The piece also reminded readers of a failed niacin‑plus‑statin trial (the “niacin‑and‑statin” study) that had to be stopped because of a trend toward harm rather than benefit.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Major outcome trials after 2012**  
* **HPS2‑THRIVE (2014)** – A large, double‑blind trial of extended‑release niacin combined with the flushing‑reducer laropiprant (DP1 antagonist) added to intensive statin therapy. The study was stopped early for futility; there was no reduction in major vascular events and a modest increase in serious adverse events (e.g., bleeding, infections, new‑onset diabetes).  
* **AIM‑HIGH (published 2011, but its results continued to shape practice)** – Showed no incremental benefit of niacin on top of statins despite favorable lipid changes.

**Regulatory and clinical impact**  
* In 2016 the U.S. FDA removed the indication for prescription niacin (Niaspan®) for cardiovascular risk reduction, limiting its label to treatment of severe hypertriglyceridaemia when other options are unsuitable.  
* Prescription niacin sales collapsed from > $1 billion in the early 2000s to < $100 million by 2020, and most cardiology guidelines now list niacin as a “class III” (not recommended) therapy for primary or secondary prevention.

**GPR109A‑targeted drug development**  
* **MK‑1903** (Arena) and **SCH‑900271** never progressed beyond early‑phase safety studies; the lack of lipid benefit confirmed the 2012 human data.  
* A few GPR109A agonists (e.g., **acipimox**, **nicotinic acid‑derived compounds**) have been explored for dermatologic or inflammatory indications, but none have reached the market for cardiovascular use.  
* Research on GPR109A shifted toward its anti‑inflammatory role in the gut and skin rather than lipid modulation.

**Broader scientific view**  
* Subsequent mechanistic work (2015‑2022) identified additional pathways—such as inhibition of hepatic diacylglycerol O‑acyltransferase‑2 (DGAT2) and modulation of adipocyte lipolysis via non‑GPR109A receptors—that may explain niacin’s modest LDL/HDL effects.  However, these mechanisms have not revived clinical enthusiasm because the net cardiovascular benefit remains unproven.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2012 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Niacin’s lipid‑lowering effects are not mediated by GPR109A.** | Confirmed.  The GPR109A agonists MK‑1903 and SCH‑900271 lowered FFAs acutely but did **not** improve LDL, HDL, or triglycerides chronically. |
| **Selective GPR109A agonists will not replicate niacin’s cardiovascular benefits.** | Accurate.  No GPR109A‑only drug has been approved for dyslipidaemia; development programs were halted after early‑phase failures. |
| **Flushing‑reduction strategies (e.g., laropiprant) will not rescue niacin’s clinical utility.** | HPS2‑THRIVE showed that even when flushing was largely eliminated, adding niacin to statins provided no cardiovascular benefit and added safety concerns. |
| **A niacin‑plus‑statin regimen could be harmful.** | The earlier “niacin‑and‑statin” trial referenced (AIM‑HIGH) and later HPS2‑THRIVE both demonstrated a neutral or slightly adverse effect on outcomes, supporting the author’s warning. |
| **Further research will uncover a new, non‑GPR109A pathway responsible for niacin’s lipid effects.** | Partial progress: studies identified alternative hepatic and adipocyte mechanisms, but none have translated into effective, approved therapies. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of a pivotal moment when a long‑used drug was being re‑evaluated; its discussion of mechanistic uncertainty and the failure of next‑generation agonists foreshadowed the eventual clinical decline of niacin, making it moderately interesting for historians of cardiovascular pharmacology.
