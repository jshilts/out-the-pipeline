# Where's All That Money Going? (Pharma Edition) (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines what major pharmaceutical companies were doing with repatriated corporate earnings following the 2017 US tax reform. The author notes that large pharma companies had significant overseas profits they previously avoided bringing back to the US under higher tax rates, referencing Pfizer's past attempts at deals with AstraZeneca and Allergan to access foreign cash.

The author observes that rather than pursuing major M&A activity as many expected, pharmaceutical companies were primarily using repatriated funds for massive share buyback programs. Companies like Pfizer, Merck, AbbVie, and Amgen each announced $10 billion buyback plans - amounts larger than their total R&D budgets. The article criticizes this approach in an R&D-driven industry, arguing that it suggests companies believe they can earn better returns buying their own stock than by investing in research.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following the 2017 tax reform, several key trends emerged:

**Share buybacks continued at high levels:** Major pharma companies maintained substantial buyback programs through 2018-2020, though the COVID-19 pandemic shifted some priorities.

**M&A activity eventually accelerated:** While slow initially, pharmaceutical M&A did pick up, with notable deals including Bristol-Myers Squibb's $74 billion acquisition of Celgene (2019), AbbVie's $63 billion acquisition of Allergan (2019), and numerous smaller biotech acquisitions.

**R&D investment patterns:** Most large pharma companies maintained or moderately increased R&D spending, but the dramatic increases some hoped for from tax reform didn't materialize. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue remained relatively stable at major firms.

**Drug development outcomes:** The period saw continued mixed results in drug development - some notable approvals (including breakthrough cancer immunotherapies and rare disease treatments), but also significant clinical trial failures that reinforced the inherent risks of pharmaceutical R&D.

**Public policy response:** By 2021, concerns about share buybacks led to proposals for taxes on buybacks and other measures to encourage more productive corporate investment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1: More M&A activity later in the year**
- **Outcome:** ✅ Partially accurate - M&A activity did increase in 2018-2019, though not as immediately as some expected when the article was written in February 2018.

**Prediction 2: Companies would continue buying back shares rather than investing in research**
- **Outcome:** ✅ Accurate - Share buybacks remained a major use of funds throughout 2018-2020, though exact amounts varied by company and year.

**Prediction 3: Limited increase in R&D spending**
- **Outcome:** ✅ Accurate - Most major pharma companies did not dramatically increase R&D spending as a result of tax reform, maintaining relatively stable R&D-to-revenue ratios.

**Prediction 4: Tax reform would not deliver on promises of spurring US investment**
- **Outcome:** ✅ Accurate - Studies showed limited evidence that the tax reform significantly increased productive investment in the US economy compared to other uses of repatriated funds.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **7/10**

This article effectively identified a recurring tension in pharmaceutical industry finance - balancing shareholder returns through buybacks versus long-term R&D investment. It presciently challenged optimistic claims about tax reform's immediate benefits for research and development.

**Note:** The analysis reflects developments through late 2023. While the broad trends are well-documented, specific buyback amounts, R&D ratios, and M&A timelines varied by company and year.
