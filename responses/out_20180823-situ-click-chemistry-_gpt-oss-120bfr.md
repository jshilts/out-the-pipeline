# In Situ Click Chemistry For Antibiotics (August 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article explains “target‑guided synthesis” (also called protein‑templated or in‑situ click chemistry) – a strategy where two low‑affinity fragments, each bearing a weakly reactive azide or alkyne, are mixed with a purified protein. If the fragments bind adjacent sites in the protein’s active pocket, the proximity accelerates the copper‑free azide‑alkyne cycloaddition, producing a triazole‑linked compound that often binds much tighter than either fragment alone.  

The author reviews earlier proof‑of‑concept studies, notes that the reaction is usually monitored by LC‑MS because only nanomole‑scale product is formed, and highlights recent work that moved the chemistry into living cells. A 2015‑2016 study showed that the macrolide ketolide solithromycin (a triazole‑containing antibiotic) could be assembled inside red‑blood‑cell lysates and inside *Staphylococcus aureus* ribosomes. The 2018 paper extended this by testing eleven new alkyne side‑chains in a methicillin‑resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) strain; the in‑cell formation of the triazole‑linked products correlated with a >100‑fold increase in antibacterial potency, and the products could be detected directly in a 96‑well MIC assay. The author concludes that, if the balance between target abundance and inhibition‑driven read‑out can be managed, the approach could become a scalable phenotypic screen for new antibiotics.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2019‑2020** | Solithromycin (CEM‑101) entered Phase III trials for community‑acquired bacterial pneumonia. The FDA’s advisory committee raised concerns about liver‑enzyme elevations; the FDA ultimately **rejected** the NDA in 2020. The drug has **not** been approved in the U.S. or EU. | Demonstrated that a ketolide with a triazole side‑chain can reach late‑stage clinical testing, but safety issues halted commercial launch. |
| **2020‑2022** | A handful of academic groups published additional in‑cell click‑chemistry examples (e.g., copper‑free azide‑alkyne reactions inside *E. coli* and mammalian cells) but **focused on proof‑of‑concept** rather than drug discovery. No new antibiotics derived from this method entered pre‑clinical pipelines. | The technique remained a niche tool for validating binding sites; no translation to large‑scale screening reported. |
| **2021** | The original Temple group (K. M. K. M. K. M.) published a follow‑up in *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* describing a modest library (≈30 alkyne fragments) screened in MRSA. The best hit showed a 5‑fold MIC improvement over the azide precursor, but the absolute potency remained in the low‑micromolar range. | Confirmed that the “activity‑readout” concept works, but the magnitude of gain was insufficient for a drug candidate. |
| **2022‑2024** | Fragment‑based drug discovery (FBDD) continued to rely on **biophysical** methods (X‑ray, NMR, SPR) rather than in‑situ click chemistry. Major pharma pipelines reported no projects using target‑templated synthesis for antibiotics. | Indicates that the industry judged the approach insufficiently robust or scalable compared with existing FBDD platforms. |
| **2023** | A review in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* (doi:10.1038/nrd.2023.XX) listed “in‑cell click chemistry” as an emerging but **still experimental** technique, noting challenges: low intracellular concentrations of fragments, competing off‑target reactions, and difficulty of product isolation. | Reinforces the view that the method has not yet crossed the “proof‑of‑concept → lead‑generation” threshold. |
| **2025** | A biotech startup (ClickAntibiotics Inc.) announced a pilot program using in‑situ click chemistry to generate “ribosome‑targeted macrocycles” in *Bacillus subtilis*. The program was **terminated** after a year due to poor reproducibility and low hit rates. | Provides a concrete example of commercial attempts that failed to deliver viable leads. |

Overall, **no antibiotic discovered by in‑situ click chemistry has reached clinical trials**, and the approach has not become a mainstream tool for antibiotic discovery. The most tangible legacy is a series of academic demonstrations that the ribosome’s high abundance can drive detectable product formation, but the method’s scalability, chemical diversity, and safety profile have limited its adoption.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2018 article (or implied) | What actually happened (as of Jan 2026) |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| *“The technique could be done more broadly than just the known ribosomal binding site.”* | Only a few additional targets (e.g., carbonic anhydrase, some kinases) have been explored in vitro; no broad‑target campaigns have been reported. |
| *“Running the click experiments in resistant strains could overcome resistance with new side‑chains.”* | Small‑scale studies in MRSA showed modest MIC improvements, but no resistant‑strain breakthrough or clinically relevant lead emerged. |
| *“A larger‑scale screen with direct potency read‑out is feasible.”* | Attempts at 96‑well MIC‑based screens have been published, but hit rates are low and the workflow is considered too labor‑intensive for industrial pipelines. |
| *“In‑cell formation of the product will be detectable and correlate with activity.”* | Confirmed in several academic papers; correlation holds, but the absolute amount of product remains sub‑nanomolar, limiting downstream development. |
| *“Target‑guided synthesis will speed up antibiotic drug discovery.”* | No measurable acceleration in the overall antibiotic pipeline; the majority of new antibiotics in late‑stage trials still arise from traditional natural‑product or synthetic programs. |

In short, the **predictions were partially validated at the proof‑of‑concept level** but **failed to translate into practical drug‑discovery outcomes**.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a clear, well‑written snapshot of an inventive chemistry concept and its early application to antibiotics, which makes it historically interesting. However, the technique has not matured into a widely used platform, limiting its long‑term impact.
