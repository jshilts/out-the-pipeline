# Article Title (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The Financial Times reported that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) planned to sign up 10 academic "superstars" for long-term partnerships to develop medicines more effectively and cheaply, as the company was cutting back on costly in-house early-stage research. The article focuses on a comment made by Professor Mark Pepys, head of medicine at the Royal Free and University College Medical School in London, who had just finalized GSK's first such partnership to develop a treatment for a rare form of amyloidosis. When asked about the GSK strategy, Pepys stated: "We all agree that big pharma is useless at discovering new drugs and has to get its ideas from somewhere else."

The Science blog post where this appears presents this quote with what it calls "massive self-restraint" and minimal commentary, but the author clearly views this as a remarkable statement about GSK's apparent contempt for its own research employees. The post later includes an update suggesting that Pepys' remark may have been tongue-in-cheek and taken out of context by the newspaper.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2011 article, GSK's external innovation strategy evolved significantly:

- **GSK's Academic Partnerships**: The company continued and expanded its academic partnerships strategy. By 2015, GSK had established numerous academic collaborations beyond the initial amyloidosis partnership with Pepys. The company maintained this approach as part of its broader R&D restructuring.

- **Amyloidosis Drug Development**: The specific collaboration with Professor Pepys for amyloidosis treatment did not ultimately result in an approved drug that reached widespread clinical use. The rare amyloidosis field remained challenging, with Tafamidis (developed by Pfizer, approved 2019 in various markets) becoming one of the notable later treatments for certain forms.

- **GSK R&D Performance**: GSK's move away from internal early-stage research continued throughout the 2010s. The company faced mixed results - while it maintained a strong presence in vaccines and HIV therapies, its overall drug approval rate and innovative output continued to face industry criticism through the mid-2010s.

- **Industry-Wide Trend**: GSK's externalization strategy reflected a broader pharmaceutical industry trend. Between 2011-2020, major pharma companies increasingly relied on external innovation from biotech and academia, with many companies reducing internal discovery research. This "external innovation" model became standard industry practice.

- **GSK Organizational Changes**: GSK underwent significant restructuring, including spinning off its consumer healthcare business (Haleon) in 2022 and focusing R&D investments on priority therapeutic areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **GSK's plan to sign 10 academic "superstar" deals**: This prediction/hope by GSK's Patrick Vallance appears to have been at least partially realized, as GSK maintained an active academic partnership strategy throughout the 2010s. However, the exact number and success rate of these partnerships is difficult to verify from public information.

- **Implication that external innovation would solve pharmaceutical productivity issues**: This implicit prediction proved partially true - the industry did increasingly rely on external innovation, but pharmaceutical R&D productivity challenges persisted throughout the decade. FDA drug approvals fluctuated but didn't show dramatic sustained improvement.

- **That big pharma is "useless" at drug discovery without external input**: This cynical assessment proved too harsh. While many major companies did increase external partnerships, several maintained productive internal research programs that led to approved drugs.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **3/10**

This article is largely a vehicle for one provocative academic quote that was likely taken out of context. While it touches on important industry trends around pharmaceutical R&D externalization, it offers relatively limited insight into the actual dynamics of drug development or the specific outcomes of these strategies. The broader trend it references is significant, but the article itself provides little substantive analysis.
