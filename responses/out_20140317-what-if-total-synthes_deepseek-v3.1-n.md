# What If Total Syntheses Had Only 25 Steps to Work In? (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article presents a critical commentary on the field of total organic synthesis of natural products, sparked by a provocative paper by Johann Mulzer. The core argument is that total synthesis has been viewed by many in the chemical community as inefficient—requiring excessive time, resources, and talent for questionable practical value. Mulzer, himself a veteran of the Corey group with extensive total synthesis experience, acknowledges these criticisms and proposes a reorientation of the discipline. 

The key recommendation is establishing a "25-step limit" for synthetic routes. The argument posits that if a natural product target cannot be synthesized within approximately 25 steps, it should be abandoned rather than pursued through brute-force, inefficient approaches. This represents a shift in philosophy away from "heroic syntheses" of increasingly complex molecules regardless of step count, toward prioritizing streamlined, efficient routes that demonstrate genuine strategic innovation rather than sheer persistence.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this article's publication, the field of organic synthesis has indeed evolved significantly, though the 25-step rule has not been formally adopted as a universal standard. Several trends emerged that align with Mulzer's concerns:

The pharmaceutical industry shifted toward more pragmatic synthetic approaches, with fragment-based drug discovery and late-stage functionalization gaining prominence over de novo total syntheses for drug development. The focus moved toward "druggable" targets rather than molecular complexity for its own sake.

Notable total syntheses continued to be achieved, but with increasing emphasis on step economy and scalability. For example, the synthesis of Taxol and other complex natural products saw improved routes emphasizing strategic bond formation and protecting-group-free approaches, though many still exceeded 25 steps.

The emergence of C-H functionalization and photoredox catalysis provided new tools for shorter synthetic routes. These methodologies enabled transformations that previously required multiple steps, contributing to more efficient syntheses.

The field experienced a bifurcation: academic total synthesis increasingly focused on methodological innovation and natural products with demonstrated biological activity, while industrial synthesis prioritized practical routes for drug candidates. The "heroic synthesis" culture that Mulzer criticized has become less prominent in leading journals.

However, the 25-step limit did not become a rigid standard. Many important natural products with complex structures continued to be synthesized through longer routes when no shorter alternatives existed, particularly for compounds with significant therapeutic potential.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's discussion included several implicit and explicit predictions about the direction of total synthesis:

• **Prediction: Total synthesis would shift from "first synthesis" priorities to "short synthesis" priorities**
  **Reality**: This shift partially occurred. Step economy became an important consideration in synthetic planning, and shorter routes received greater recognition and publication priority. However, first syntheses of complex natural products continued to be highly valued, creating a mixed landscape.

• **Prediction: A 25-step limit would become a practical guideline for synthetic feasibility**
  **Reality**: This did not become a formal standard. The field adopted a more nuanced approach where longer syntheses required stronger justification based on either methodological innovation or biological importance. Complex targets like marine natural products and alkaloids continued to be pursued even when routes exceeded 25 steps.

• **Prediction: The "obsession to synthesize almost any natural product irrespective of its complexity and practical importance" would diminish**
  **Reality**: Partially accurate. While indiscriminate total synthesis became less common, synthesis of complex natural products continued, particularly those with potential medicinal value or structural novelty. The field became more selective rather than ceasing entirely.

• **Prediction: Synthesis would prioritize cascade reactions, intramolecular cycloadditions, and suitable starting materials over brute-force approaches**
  **Reality**: This prediction was largely fulfilled. Strategic bond disconnections and convergent synthesis became standard practice. New methodologies including organocatalysis, asymmetric catalysis, and C-H activation enabled more efficient routes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article addresses important questions about resource allocation and efficiency in organic synthesis that remain relevant today, but the specific 25-step proposal was too rigid and failed to account for cases where longer syntheses provide important scientific insights or access to valuable therapeutics.
