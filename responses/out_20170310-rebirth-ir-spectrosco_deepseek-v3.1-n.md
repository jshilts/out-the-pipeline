# A Rebirth for IR Spectroscopy? (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses how advances in nanotechnology could revive infrared (IR) spectroscopy as a routine analytical tool for organic chemists. While conventional IR spectroscopy requires specialized equipment and sample preparation, emerging nano-material surfaces exploit piezoelectric and plasmonic effects to enable real-time IR analysis directly from solutions or crude materials. The author cites recent research demonstrating picogram-level sensitivity with test compounds like indomethacin—performance far exceeding classical IR techniques. Potential applications include integration into flow chemistry, LC purifications, tandem analysis with mass spectrometry, and other analytical workflows. The author expresses optimism about these developments while raising practical concerns about sensor fouling, durability across solvents, and pH stability.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2017 article, IR spectroscopy experienced significant technological advancement, though perhaps not the widespread analytical revolution initially suggested. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy using nanostructured materials continued developing, with plasmonic substrates and metasurfaces reaching attomole-level sensitivity by 2019-2020. These nano-IR techniques found niche applications in single-molecule detection, biophysical studies, and advanced materials characterization. However, widespread adoption across routine organic chemistry laboratories remained limited. Commercial systems emerged targeting specialized research rather than general lab use, with costs typically $50,000-$200,000+ for complete setups, limiting accessibility. Flow chemistry applications have incorporated in-line IR monitoring, but competing techniques like Raman spectroscopy and NMR maintained dominance in reaction monitoring. Clinical applications remained experimental, with no FDA-approved diagnostic systems emerging from this technology. The field progressed technically, but practical barriers related to reproducibility, cost, and complexity constrained broad deployment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Integration into flow chemistry and LC purifications**
  - **Outcome**: Partial success. While IR monitoring in flow systems has been demonstrated, it remains limited to specialized applications rather than becoming standard practice. HPLC systems with in-line IR detection exist but are far from ubiquitous.

• **Prediction: Tandem analysis with mass spectrometry would emerge**
  - **Outcome**: Successful in research settings, but not widespread. Hyphenated IR-MS systems have been developed, offering complementary molecular information (IR for functional groups, MS for molecular weight), but these remain specialized tools due to complexity and cost.

• **Prediction: Extreme sensitivity (picogram range) would open new applications**
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Single-molecule IR detection has been achieved by 2020-2022 using plasmonic enhancement, with applications in catalysis research and biophysics.

• **Prediction: Sensors becoming tiny enough for diverse apparatus**
  - **Outcome**: Moderate success. While nanoscale IR probes have been fabricated, integration challenges limited deployment into standard analytical workflows.

• **Author's concerns about fouling and solvent/pH stability**
  - **Outcome**: These proved to be significant barriers. Surface contamination, degradation, and limited chemical compatibility prevented routine application under real-world conditions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article identified a meaningful technical trend that did develop into active research areas and specialized applications, but it was more impactful in fundamental science than routine analytical chemistry. While the technology advanced significantly, it didn't achieve the widespread adoption suggested by the article's hopeful tone.
