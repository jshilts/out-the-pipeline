# The Avastin Decision: A Reality Check (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary defends the FDA's decision to rescind conditional approval of Avastin (bevacizumab) for metastatic breast cancer. The author argues this was the correct regulatory action because clinical evidence showed the drug lacked meaningful efficacy in this indication, despite political accusations that the decision was cost-driven under Obama's healthcare plan. The piece emphasizes that FDA decisions should be based solely on safety and efficacy data, not cost considerations, and that conditional approvals must be revocable when post-marketing studies fail to confirm benefit. The author takes a science-based position that evidence should guide regulatory decisions, even when politically controversial.

## 2. HISTORY
The FDA's decision to withdraw Avastin's breast cancer indication in November 2011 (finalized after the initial December 2010 proposal) was based on follow-up studies showing minimal survival benefit (less than one month improvement) coupled with serious side effects including high blood pressure, bleeding, and heart problems. Despite the withdrawal, Avastin remained FDA-approved for other cancers including colorectal, lung, kidney, and brain cancers, where it demonstrated clearer clinical benefits.

The controversy continued after the withdrawal. Some patients and oncologists continued to use Avastin off-label for metastatic breast cancer, believing certain subgroups might benefit. However, subsequent meta-analyses and real-world evidence largely confirmed the FDA's assessment. Pharmaceutical manufacturer Genentech/Roche appealed the decision but ultimately lost. The drug maintained its blockbuster status in other approved indications, generating billions in annual revenue. This case became a landmark example of FDA's accelerated approval process working as designed—granting early access while requiring confirmatory trials, then withdrawing approval when evidence failed to support benefit. No significant policy changes resulted; rather, it reinforced the evidence-based approval framework.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction that conditional approvals must be revocable when they don't work out**: This proved accurate. The Avastin case demonstrated FDA's willingness to withdraw accelerated approvals when confirmatory trials fail, setting a precedent for future cases like several immunotherapy drugs that later faced similar scrutiny.

• **Implicit prediction that evidence would continue supporting the FDA decision**: Correct. Subsequent meta-analyses and real-world evidence consistently showed minimal benefit for metastatic breast cancer, validating the withdrawal decision.

• **Prediction that political attacks would not undermine evidence-based decision process**: Largely accurate. Despite political pressure, FDA maintained its regulatory standards, though off-label use continued. The basic regulatory framework survived political challenges.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article captures a critical regulatory precedent where evidence-based medicine successfully withstood political pressure, demonstrating that FDA's accelerated approval system can work as intended when confirmatory trials fail to show benefit.
