# Arguing on AI Drug Discovery (February 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article by Derek Lowe analyzes the debate surrounding Insilico Medicine's September 2019 claim of discovering a drug using AI generative methods. The controversy centers on a Nature Biotechnology paper where Insilico reported using generative deep learning models to identify a DDR1 kinase inhibitor. 

Critics Pat Walters and Mark Murcko from Relay Therapeutics challenged the significance of this work in a subsequent letter, pointing out that Insilico's best compound was structurally similar to the marketed kinase inhibitor Iclusig (ponatinib). They questioned whether the AI-generated molecule demonstrated genuine novelty, noting that it didn't show improved selectivity compared to existing compounds and that the simple chemical modifications suggested could have been proposed by human chemists without sophisticated AI. Insilico's authors (Zhavoronkov and Aspuru-Guzik) responded that their goal was to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of their generative approach rather than produce a fully optimized drug, acknowledging their compounds needed further development.

The article also discusses broader concerns about transparency in training datasets for generative models and expresses skepticism about the aggressive timelines promoted by companies like EQRx, which claimed AI advances would enable rapid drug development. Lowe formalized his skepticism about EQRx's ambitious claims with a public wager posted on Longbets.org.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2020 debate, both AI drug discovery and the companies involved have seen significant developments:

**Insilico Medicine's trajectory**: The company continued developing its generative AI platform and expanded its pipeline considerably. By 2024, Insilico has multiple drug candidates in clinical trials, with its lead compound for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) entering Phase II trials - representing one of the first AI-discovered drugs to reach this stage. The company went public via SPAC merger in 2023 and has built partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies, suggesting their generative chemistry approach has demonstrated sufficient promise to attract investment and collaboration.

**Broader AI drug discovery developments**: The period from 2020-2024 saw substantial investment and advancement in AI drug discovery platforms. Companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, and others have successfully advanced AI-designed drugs into clinical trials. However, the field has matured to recognize that AI tools work best as augmentation for medicinal chemists rather than full automation. The emphasis has shifted somewhat from generative novelty toward predictive ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties and synthesis planning.

**EQRx outcomes**: Contrary to the aggressive timelines promoted in 2020, EQRx faced significant challenges. The company's strategy of developing "fast follow-on" drugs at dramatically lower costs proved more difficult than anticipated. In 2023, EQRx was acquired by Revolution Medicines after struggling to deliver on its ambitious promises, essentially validating Lowe's skepticism about the feasibility of their claimed development speed.

**Scientific standards evolution**: The transparency concerns raised by Walters and Murcko have led to improved standards in publishing AI-generated molecular designs, with better documentation of training datasets and validation methodologies becoming more common.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Critics' concern that AI generative models weren't producing truly novel chemistry**: This has proven partially accurate - while AI tools have become valuable for drug discovery, they're often most effective for optimizing existing chemical scaffolds rather than creating entirely novel molecular frameworks. The most successful applications combine AI suggestions with human medicinal chemistry expertise.

• **Lowe's skepticism about EQRx's "ten drugs in ten years" timeline**: **Prediction validated**. EQRx was unable to deliver on these aggressive timelines and was acquired in 2023, demonstrating that computational advances alone couldn't overcome the fundamental complexity and timelines of drug development.

• **Concern about "race mode" and hype-driven AI drug discovery**: **Mixed outcome**. While the field has matured beyond purely demonstration-focused publications, significant hype around AI in drug discovery continues. However, there's been tangible progress with multiple AI-designed drugs now in clinical trials.

• **Prediction that generative models would need to suggest non-obvious structures to be valuable**: This has proven true - the most impactful AI applications in drug discovery have been in areas like predicting synthetic accessibility, ADMET properties, and binding affinity, rather than purely suggesting novel structures that expert chemists wouldn't consider.

• **Implicit prediction that transparency in training data would become crucial**: This has been validated, with better documentation standards now expected in computational chemistry publications.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in AI drug discovery's maturation, correctly identifying both the genuine potential and the concerning hype, while highlighting issues of validation and transparency that remain highly relevant. Its accurate prediction about EQRx's overreach demonstrates valuable scientific skepticism.
