# Call Your Office? K. C. Nicolaou, Call Your Office (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
This short 2009 blog-style commentary references an organic chemistry article in Organic Letters featuring a complex natural product called Alasmontamine A. The author (likely Derek Lowe, based on the characteristic writing style and "In the Pipeline" context) presents the molecule's intricate structure as intimidating and quips that natural products "scare me." The piece notes the compound appears to be a dimer, making it somewhat less daunting than it appears, but still highly challenging for synthetic chemistry. 

The central commentary critiques funding dynamics in natural products chemistry, suggesting that compounds like Alasmontamine A (which reportedly lacked significant biological activity) might still attract research funding if positioned under trending buzzwords like "green chemistry," "nanotech," or "alternative energy"—implying that hype and marketability sometimes drive funding decisions more than scientific merit or practical application.

## 2. HISTORY

**The 2009 Context and Subsequent Developments:**
This commentary reflects the post-2008 scientific funding environment where researchers faced intense pressure to justify work through immediate applicability or connection to "hot" fields. During this period, natural products chemistry was experiencing both challenges and revival.

**Alasmontamine A specifically:** A search of chemical literature databases reveals this natural product was indeed published around 2009 from work on *Alstonia* species plants. However, subsequent synthetic efforts targeting this specific molecule were limited. The field's focus shifted toward natural products with clearer therapeutic potential or novel mechanisms.

**Natural Products in Drug Discovery (2009-Present):** The period following 2009 saw significant evolution in natural product research:
- Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly deprioritized natural products discovery in favor of combinatorial chemistry and targeted drug design
- However, natural products continued contributing to antibiotic discovery (e.g., teixobactin discovery in 2015)
- There was growing recognition of natural products' unique structural complexity and biological relevance
- Computational methods and synthetic biology approaches revitalized natural product research in the 2010s

**Funding and Research Trends:** The commentary's critique proved somewhat prescient—funding agencies did increasingly emphasize translational potential and societal impact from 2010 onward. The specific buzzwords mentioned ("green chemistry," "nanotech," "alternative energy") did drive substantial research investment, though the connection to complex alkaloid synthesis like Alasmontamine A remained tenuous.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Explicit Predictions Made:**
- *The author primarily offered commentary rather than explicit predictions about future outcomes*

**Implicit Predictions/Concerns:**
- **Concerning funding priorities:** The suggestion that marketing compounds under trendy terms ("green chemistry," "nanotech," "alternative energy") could secure funding even without biological activity
  - **Outcome:** Partially accurate. Research funding during 2009-2020 increasingly emphasized translational potential and alignment with national priorities. However, funding agencies and review panels became more sophisticated at distinguishing genuine applications from opportunistic framing

- **Concerning synthetic chemistry capabilities:** The implication that Alasmontamine A represented synthetic challenges beyond contemporary capabilities
  - **Outcome:** Advances in synthetic methodology, particularly C-H functionalization and catalytic methods, enabled increasingly complex molecule synthesis through the 2010s. While Alasmontamine A itself didn't become a major synthetic target, analogous complex natural products were successfully synthesized

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
This brief commentary captures funding dynamics relevant to a specific historical moment (2009), but addresses a minor natural product without therapeutic potential and offers modest broader insights beyond its niche context.
