# And The Award For Clinical Futility Goes To. . . (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article poses a conversational question about which therapeutic areas and drug targets have accumulated the most clinical trial failures. The author nominates **sepsis** as the therapeutic area with the greatest number of complete clinical washouts, and nominates **PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) ligands** as a mechanistic class with particularly poor success rates in clinical development. The author notes that the only PPAR ligands to achieve approval were early compounds discovered before their molecular target had even been identified, highlighting the subsequent difficulty in developing this class deliberately. The piece functions as an open call for readers to contribute other "nominations" for areas of clinical futility.

## 2. HISTORY

**Sepsis**: In the years following 2013, the sepsis landscape remained characterized by high failure rates. More than 100 clinical trials for sepsis therapies failed between 2000 and 2017. Xigris (drotrecogin alfa, activated protein C), once approved, was withdrawn in 2011 due to lack of efficacy. Post-2013 trials of immunomodulatory approaches, anti-inflammatory agents, and various supportive interventions continued to show disappointing results. However, significant progress occurred in **early diagnosis and protocolized care bundles** (early antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, source control), which reduced mortality through better clinical management rather than novel pharmacotherapy. Recent approaches have shifted toward precision medicine and patient stratification using biomarkers, though no breakthrough drug has achieved widespread approval and adoption for sepsis.

**PPAR Ligands**: The three approved PPAR ligands referenced were the glitazones for diabetes (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) and fibrates for dyslipidemia (e.g., fenofibrate). After 2013, continued development of new PPAR agonists faced persistent challenges:

- **Cardiovascular safety concerns**: Rosiglitazone was severely restricted or withdrawn in many markets due to cardiovascular risks; pioglitazone carried warnings for heart failure.
- **Cancer risks**: Multiple PPAR agonists were abandoned due to bladder cancer and other tumor signals in long-term studies.
- **Selective PPAR modulators and dual/pan agonists**: Numerous programs (e.g., aleglitazar, tesaglitazar) failed in Phase II/III trials for diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes due to safety signals or lack of efficacy.
- **Limited success in niche indications**: Saroglitazar gained approval in India for diabetic dyslipidemia and NAFLD/NASH, representing one of the few newer PPAR agonists to reach the market, though with limited global uptake.

Post-2013, the PPAR field largely shifted toward **NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)** and metabolic disease, with continued challenges in balancing efficacy and safety. The mechanistic class failed to deliver on earlier promises of broad metabolic benefits.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction about sepsis**: That sepsis would continue to be a graveyard for clinical programs. **Outcome**: This proved largely accurate. Numerous subsequent trials failed, and no breakthrough drug emerged. The field shifted focus toward better clinical protocols and precision approaches rather than single-magic-bullet therapies.

- **Implicit prediction about PPAR ligands**: That this mechanistic class would continue to face significant clinical development challenges due to toxicity and efficacy issues. **Outcome**: This proved highly accurate. Multiple high-profile failures occurred post-2013, and safety concerns (especially cardiovascular and oncologic) dominated the class. Success remained limited to niche applications rather than broad therapeutic breakthroughs.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article identified two areas—sepsis and PPAR ligands—that continued to exemplify clinical futility, demonstrating insight into persistent drug development challenges. However, the essay format limited its depth, and sepsis outcomes have since shifted more toward improved clinical protocols than pharmacotherapy breakthroughs.
