# Lab of the Future! (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article from 2004 is a lighthearted thought experiment where the author, Derek Lowe, playfully imagines futuristic lab gadgets that could revolutionize chemistry work. The central example is the "Molecular Weight Grabber" - a hypothetical device resembling a magnetic stir bar retriever that could be dipped into a crude reaction mixture, set to a specific molecular weight, selectively capture compounds of that weight, then release them into another container. The author speculates this might be theoretically possible with "massively robust nanotechnology" using molecular-size torsion balances, while acknowledging the significant power requirements needed to overcome entropy. The piece invites readers to propose their own dream lab gadgets in the comments, with the constraint that suggestions should be thermodynamically possible and semi-plausible.

## 2. HISTORY

In the two decades since this article's publication, laboratory automation and technology have advanced significantly, though not along the specific "Molecular Weight Grabber" concept. Liquid handling robots, high-throughput screening platforms, and automated synthesis systems became widespread in pharmaceutical and biotechnology labs. Mass spectrometry technology improved dramatically, enabling rapid molecular weight determination and compound identification, though not the physical separation envisioned. 

Lab automation evolved toward workflow integration rather than discrete magical gadgets - robotic arms, automated incubators, and computerized data analysis became standard. Companies like Thermo Fisher, Agilent, PerkinElmer, and Hamilton Company expanded their lab automation offerings significantly during this period. The field moved toward integrated systems combining sample preparation, analysis, and data management rather than standalone "grabber" devices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Molecular Weight Grabber**: The specific gadget imagined - a dial-based device that physically sorts compounds by molecular weight - has not been realized. Mass spectrometry can determine molecular weights but doesn't separate compounds physically in the way described. Chromatography techniques (HPLC, UPLC) separate compounds but work on different principles.

• **Nanotechnology for Lab Equipment**: While nanotechnology advanced significantly, it didn't produce molecular torsion balance sorters as hypothesized. Instead, nanotechnology found applications in drug delivery, diagnostics, and materials science.

• **Lab of the Future**: Laboratories did become highly automated, but through integrated robotic systems rather than discrete magical gadgets. The vision underestimated the complexity of molecular recognition and separation, while overestimating how quickly such precise physical manipulation could be achieved.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This ranks as a moderately interesting historical curiosity - a lighthearted thought experiment that captures the 2004 mindset about lab automation possibilities. While it didn't predict specific technological developments accurately, it reflects the scientific imagination of the time and the gap between desired capabilities and actual technological evolution.
