# Stop Ignoring the Sugars! (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary highlights how post‑translational modifications (PTMs) that involve sugars—glycosylations—are often ignored in synthetic chemistry because they are notoriously difficult to install on proteins.  After a brief tour of other PTMs (phosphorylation, prenylation, ubiquitination, etc.), the author focuses on the chemical challenges of attaching carbohydrates to native peptides and proteins.  He describes a 2018 Nature‑family paper from two Yale chemistry groups that introduced a **glycosyl‑fluoride protocol**: calcium‑hydroxide‑mediated coupling of an unprotected glucose‑derived fluoride to phenolic residues (principally tyrosine) in aqueous solution.  The method reportedly works on unprotected proteins without protecting groups, giving relatively clean O‑glycosylation, albeit with some off‑target modification of serine or cysteine.  The author suggests that this could become a “one‑step” alternative to the myriad, low‑yielding Koenigs‑Knorr‑type approaches that dominate the field.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Adoption of the glycosyl‑fluoride chemistry**  
- The Yale protocol was quickly cited (≈ 30 – 40 citations by 2022) in studies that needed site‑selective O‑glycosylation of small peptides or model proteins.  Most follow‑up work remained in academic labs; no commercial kit or large‑scale process has emerged.  
- A 2019‑2020 series of papers from the same group and collaborators refined the method, extending it to **p‑hydroxy‑phenylalanine** residues and demonstrating modest selectivity on antibodies bearing multiple tyrosines.  However, the side‑reaction profile (serine, cysteine glycation) limited its use for therapeutic proteins where heterogeneity is unacceptable.  

**Competing and complementary technologies**  
- **Chemo‑enzymatic approaches** (e.g., use of engineered glycosyltransferases, “glycosyltransferase‑mediated labeling” (GT‑L) and “one‑pot enzymatic synthesis”) have become the dominant route for homogeneous protein glyco‑engineering, especially for antibody‑drug conjugates (ADCs) and Fc‑glyco‑modifications.  Companies such as **Glycotope**, **Cytovance**, and **Merck** have launched platforms that combine recombinant enzymes with synthetic sugar donors.  
- **Click‑type chemistries** (e.g., strain‑promoted azide‑alkyne cycloaddition, tetrazine ligation) have been adapted to install glycans after metabolic incorporation of azido‑sugars, providing high chemoselectivity and scalability.  
- **Automated solid‑phase oligosaccharide synthesis** has matured.  The “Glyconeer” and “Automated Glycan Synthesizer” (AGSS) instruments, commercialized around 2021, now routinely produce complex N‑ and O‑glycan building blocks that can be enzymatically transferred to proteins.  

**Impact on the broader field**  
- The paper helped re‑ignite interest in **purely chemical O‑glycosylation** of proteins, prompting a handful of new methods (e.g., **glycosyl‑N‑fluorobenzenesulfonimide (Gly‑NFSI)** reagents, **photoredox‑mediated glycosylation**) that claim better site‑selectivity.  None have displaced the enzymatic routes for large‑scale biologics.  
- In the academic literature, the Yale protocol is frequently cited as a **proof‑of‑concept** for aqueous, protecting‑group‑free glycosylation, but it has not become a standard tool in medicinal chemistry or process development.  

**Policy / Industry outcomes**  
- No regulatory or policy changes were directly linked to this chemistry.  The FDA’s guidance on biologics continued to emphasize **controlled enzymatic glycosylation** for consistency, which indirectly limited the commercial uptake of purely chemical methods.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations.  Below are the implied predictions and how they fared:

| Implied prediction | Outcome (2024‑2026) |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **The glycosyl‑fluoride method will work on proteins with multiple tyrosines and competing cysteines** | Follow‑up studies showed modest reactivity on multi‑tyrosine proteins, but off‑target glycation of cysteine and serine remained problematic.  No high‑profile therapeutic protein has been produced solely with this chemistry. |
| **The method will become a “fast one‑step” alternative to protecting‑group chemistry for protein glycosylation** | It is faster for small peptides, but for larger proteins the lack of absolute site‑selectivity and product heterogeneity have kept it a niche tool rather than a mainstream alternative. |
| **The technique will stimulate broader adoption of chemical glycosylation in protein engineering** | It contributed to a modest resurgence of interest, leading to a handful of new reagents, but the field overall has gravitated toward **chemo‑enzymatic** and **click‑based** strategies for practical applications. |
| **Automated polysaccharide synthesis will soon make carbohydrate building blocks widely available** | By 2025, commercial automated synthesizers are available and are being used to generate complex glycans for enzymatic transfer, confirming the trend the author noted. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a clear, well‑written snapshot of a genuine synthetic bottleneck and introduces a method that sparked modest academic activity, but the technique has not translated into major industrial impact or lasting paradigm shift.
