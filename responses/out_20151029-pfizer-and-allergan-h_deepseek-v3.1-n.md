# Pfizer and Allergan: Here We Go Again (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Pfizer's potential merger with Allergan, viewing it as another attempt by Pfizer to address its tax situation through corporate inversion - a strategy where a US company reincorporates overseas to reduce its tax burden. The author notes that Allergan (incorporated in Ireland) represents a more palatable target than some previous merger attempts because it doesn't have as large an R&D operation for Pfizer to dismantle, unlike the failed AstraZeneca takeover attempt. The piece characterizes this as continuation of Pfizer's long-standing strategy of growth through major acquisitions rather than through internal R&D, suggesting that CEO Ian Read had initially promised change but ultimately reverted to the company's established playbook. The article frames the merger talks as preliminary but inevitable, given Pfizer's need to deploy its massive overseas cash reserves while avoiding high US corporate tax rates.

## 2. HISTORY

The Pfizer-Allergan merger discussions did progress beyond preliminary talks, culminating in a $160 billion deal announced in November 2015 that would have created the world's largest pharmaceutical company. However, the merger never came to fruition. In April 2016, the US Treasury Department issued new regulations targeting corporate inversions, specifically designed to limit the tax benefits of such mergers. Just days later, Pfizer and Allergan announced they were terminating their merger agreement, with Pfizer paying Allergan a $150 million breakup fee to cover expenses.

Following the failed merger, Pfizer pursued a different strategy. In 2019, Pfizer merged its off-patent drug business (including older brands like Lipitor and Viagra) with generic manufacturer Mylan to form Viatris, while retaining its innovative and patented medications. This split approach allowed Pfizer to separate its mature products from its pipeline of new drugs. Notably, Pfizer became one of the leading COVID-19 vaccine developers, with its BioNTech-partnered mRNA vaccine generating tens of billions in revenue during the pandemic.

Allergan, meanwhile, was acquired by AbbVie in 2019 for $63 billion, primarily for its blockbuster Botox franchise and other cosmetic treatments. This acquisition did proceed successfully, creating a major player in immunology and aesthetics.

The corporate inversion trend that the article discussed was largely curtailed by policy changes and increased regulatory scrutiny, though some smaller transactions continued. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, somewhat mitigating the appeal of foreign reincorporation, though it maintained provisions designed to discourage inversions. Today, large-scale pharmaceutical mega-mergers still occur, but they typically focus more on therapeutic area consolidation and pipeline acquisition rather than pure tax optimization strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Pfizer will buy someone large and foreign**: The article predicted Pfizer would continue its acquisition strategy. While the Allergan deal failed, Pfizer did pursue major acquisitions including Viatris formation (2019) and the $11.6 billion acquisition of Biohaven (2022), showing the prediction was directionally correct - outcome: Mostly accurate ✓

• **The merger talks were preliminary and might not succeed**: The article characterized talks as early-stage, and indeed they ultimately failed due to regulatory intervention - outcome: Accurate ✓

• **This represents continued Pfizer strategy of growth via acquisition rather than R&D**: Pfizer did continue major acquisitions, including their significant COVID vaccine development (which involved buying into BioNTech technology) and other deals - outcome: Accurate ✓

• **Allergan was a preferable target because it wouldn't require dismantling large R&D**: The R&D consideration became moot as the deal collapsed, but Allergan ultimately merged successfully with AbbVie without major R&D disruption - outcome: Not fully testable as deal failed

• **Pfizer needs to deploy overseas cash reserves**: The article correctly identified tax and cash management as core drivers, accurately predicting Pfizer's motivation - outcome: Accurate ✓

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5**

The article demonstrates reasonable foresight about corporate acquisition trends and tax-driven mergers, but its significance is moderate since the specific deal it analyzed never materialized and regulatory changes soon reshaped the landscape.
