# You Wouldn't Be Lying About That, Would You? (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reports on an interview with John Jenkins, who was departing as director of the FDA's Office of New Drugs after 15 years. Jenkins revealed that it is "pretty frequent" for pharmaceutical companies to inaccurately represent their communications with the FDA when reporting to the public and investors. Specifically, companies would often portray FDA feedback more optimistically than warranted—such as making end-of-Phase II advice appear more favorable than it actually was, or downplaying deficiencies in Complete Response Letters (CRLs) when drugs are rejected. Some companies would even claim they were "caught by surprise" by FDA concerns that had actually been raised previously.

The article explains that these communications are not made public by the FDA, leaving companies to self-report, which creates opportunities for misrepresentation. The author argues this practice can mislead investors and patients, and contributes to a broader misunderstanding that FDA bureaucracy is the primary bottleneck in drug development. The article emphasizes that "the rate-limiting step for breakthroughs is the science"—not FDA approval—because early-stage research is inherently uncertain and time-consuming.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication, transparency in FDA-industry communications has evolved gradually, with several relevant developments:

**Information Disclosure Policies:**
- The FDA has increased transparency initiatives since 2017, but company communications remain largely self-reported. While the FDA publishes certain documents like approval letters and some meeting materials, CRLs and detailed communications typically remain confidential unless companies choose to disclose them.
- The 21st Century Cures Act (passed in 2016, implemented subsequently) and FDA Reauthorization Acts have maintained this fundamental structure, where industry disclosure remains voluntary.

**Regulatory Enforcement:**
- The SEC has taken enforcement actions in subsequent years related to companies misrepresenting FDA communications, but these cases remain relatively infrequent and typically require clear evidence of material misstatements affecting stock prices.
- The FDA itself has limited direct enforcement authority over how companies characterize their communications in public statements.

**Industry Patterns:**
- The practice described by Jenkins has persisted. Between 2017-2024, numerous instances occurred where companies issued optimistic interpretations of FDA feedback, particularly around CRLs and clinical trial guidance, with varying degrees of accuracy.
- Some have resulted in shareholder lawsuits when clinical programs later failed in ways that suggested earlier company statements were misleadingly positive.

**Market and Policy Developments:**
- No major legislative changes have fundamentally altered the disclosure structure Jenkins criticized. The core issue—voluntary disclosure with minimal penalty—remains in place.
- Investor awareness has increased, with experienced analysts applying greater skepticism to company characterizations of FDA communications.
- No significant expansion of mandatory FDA communication disclosure has been implemented, though FDA has increased publication of its own guidance documents and some meeting summaries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events. Instead, it described an ongoing problem (misrepresentation of FDA communications) and explained why the underlying regulatory structure enabled this behavior to continue without penalty. Jenkins's remarks were diagnostic rather than predictive, identifying a persistent issue rather than forecasting how it might change.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an important but narrow aspect of pharmaceutical regulation with limited broader public health implications. While it highlights a real problem in transparency, the issue affects primarily investors and has not led to major systematic changes, making it moderately interesting but not highly significant in terms of long-term importance or broad impact on the biotechnology field.
