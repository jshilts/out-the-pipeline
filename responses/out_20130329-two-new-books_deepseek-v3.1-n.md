# Two New Books (Mar 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 blog post highlights two newly released books relevant to drug discovery. The first is an expanded second edition of Copeland's *Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery*, which added chapters on residence time as a factor in enzyme inhibitor action and connections between in vitro enzymology and in vivo drug candidate selection factors. The second is a new medicinal chemistry textbook by Erland Stevens aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students, covering classic topics with references up to 2010, including fragment-based drug design, ion channel structures, and API synthesis screening methods.

## 2. HISTORY

Both books represented ongoing refinement of established drug discovery methodologies rather than revolutionary new approaches.

**Enzyme inhibitor evaluation methodology** has remained a cornerstone of drug discovery, with residence time (drug-target binding kinetics) becoming increasingly recognized as important for drug efficacy and duration of action. This concept has been particularly relevant in areas like kinase inhibitors and antiviral drugs, where prolonged target engagement can improve therapeutic outcomes.

**Medicinal chemistry education** has continued evolving, with fragment-based drug design maturing into a widely accepted hit-finding approach used by major pharmaceutical companies. The P2X4 ion channel mentioned remains an active but challenging drug target, with no approved drugs targeting this mechanism as of 2024, though research continues.

The fundamental approaches described in both books—quantitative enzymology, structure-based drug design, and medicinal chemistry principles—remain essential tools in pharmaceutical research, though supplemented by newer technologies like cryo-EM, AI-driven drug design, and more sophisticated screening methodologies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself made no explicit predictions about future developments. It served as a review of educational resources rather than a forward-looking commentary on biotechnology trends or drug development outcomes. Both books focused on established methodologies and recent (as of 2010-2013) developments rather than making speculative forecasts about the field's future direction.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While professionally competent reviews of useful technical books, this article's scope is limited—a brief announcement-style post about educational resources with minimal broader commentary on biotech industry trends, making it of narrow long-term interest beyond its immediate academic audience.
