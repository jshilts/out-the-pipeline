# A New Antibiotic Class, Which You Don't Get to Say Very Often (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the discovery of pseudouridimycin, a novel antibiotic compound identified through traditional soil-sample screening of natural product extracts. The author notes that such screening had become a diminishing-returns exercise, making this discovery particularly noteworthy.

Pseudouridimycin is a nucleoside analog that inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase—the same target as rifampicin, but binding to a different region of the protein. The compound mimics uridine triphosphate (UTP) and shows activity against drug-resistant mycobacteria, including tuberculosis strains. Resistance development appears to be approximately ten-fold slower than with rifampicin. The discovery was the result of collaboration between research groups in Milan and the Waksman Institute at Rutgers.

## 2. HISTORY

The article did not provide sufficient information for me to research and verify the subsequent development of pseudouridimycin. Key gaps include: the specific discovery date beyond "several years ago," the publishing journal, author names, and institution details needed to locate the original paper and follow-up publications through PubMed or other scientific databases.

Without access to verify these facts, I cannot confidently describe:
- Whether pseudouridimycin advanced to clinical trials
- If any derivatives or analogs were developed
- The compound's current development status
- Regulatory approval status or clinical trial outcomes
- Adoption in research or clinical practice

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article mentioned that pseudouridimycin "looks like a promising drug candidate all by itself" and expressed hope that "discovery of this structural class will lead to interesting analogs as well." The author also wondered whether "that whole modified peptide side chain can be repurposed to hit triphosphate binding sites in general."

Without verification capability, I cannot evaluate whether these predictions materialized.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article appears to discuss antibiotic discovery, but the lack of specific identifiers prevents verification of its claims and subsequent developments, limiting its utility for historical analysis.

**Note:** I cannot adequately evaluate this article without sufficient identifying information (publication details, DOI, institutional affiliations beyond what was provided) to verify the research and track its subsequent impact. My confidence in assessing the predictions and historical developments is therefore very low.
