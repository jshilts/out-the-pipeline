# Odd Peroxides Indeed (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a recent paper on perfluoroalkyl peroxides—compounds that combine organic groups with the notoriously reactive peroxide (O-O) functional group. The article contrasts these with conventional dialkyl peroxides, which are notoriously unstable, hazardous (shock/friction-sensitive, explosive), and thermally labile. The key surprise is that perfluoroalkyl peroxides turn out to be remarkably stable: they tolerate high temperatures (some up to ~200°C), are insensitive to shock and friction, and can even be distilled or melted without immediate violent decomposition.

Preparing these peroxides, however, requires extreme chemistry. Earlier routes used aggressive fluorinating agents like chlorine trifluoride, while the Berlin group's modern synthesis relies on elemental fluorine gas reacted with silver wool and the preparation of hypofluorites via CsF/F₂ at low temperatures, followed by trap-to-trap distillations around -150°C. The author notes the inherent dangers of working with elemental fluorine but emphasizes that the resulting perfluoroalkyl peroxides are bizarrely tame compared to their alkyl counterparts. Stability likely stems from endothermic, slow reactions of the perfluoroalkoxy radicals formed when the O-O bond cleaves. The article closes by speculating whether such compounds might become useful selective oxidants or remain chemical curiosities.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the 2019 article, I do not have specific evidence that perfluoroalkyl peroxides achieved broad industrial or pharmaceutical adoption. These compounds remain specialized materials, primarily of interest in academic fluorine chemistry and potentially for niche fluoropolymer applications where controlled radical generation is needed. The extreme synthesis hurdles (elemental fluorine handling, cryogenic purifications) make scale-up impractical for widespread use.

In the decade leading up to 2019 and after, fluorinated building blocks and reagents became more common in drug discovery (e.g., trifluoromethyl groups for metabolic stability and lipophilicity), but perfluoroalkyl peroxides did not become standard reagents in medicinal chemistry. Alkyl peroxides and hydroperoxides (non-fluorinated) continue to be avoided for safety reasons, while safer oxidant surrogates (e.g., Oxone, m-CPBA, peracetic acid, or photoredox-generated radicals) dominate in synthesis and industrial processes.

There is no indication that public policy changed due to these compounds, nor that they enabled new FDA-approved drugs. Their practical impact appears limited to academic mechanistic studies (radical kinetics, bond energetics, conformations) and perhaps very specialized materials science settings rather than therapeutic pipelines or widespread chemical manufacturing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The author speculated it "would be interesting to see what sort of reactivity they have as selective oxidants" and that "they may turn into familiar reagents if they do something useful, or they may just remain as chemical curiosities."
  - **Outcome**: High-barrier syntheses (elemental F₂, cryogenic purifications) likely prevented broad adoption as routine selective oxidants. Fluorinated peroxides remain chemical curiosities for specialists rather than fixture reagents in mainstream synthesis.

- **Overarching implication**: The author implied that making peroxides "tame" opens a path to new selective oxidation chemistry.
  - **Larger picture**: While fluorinated peroxides didn't transform oxidation practice, safer peroxide strategies advanced elsewhere—continuous-flow reactors, immobilized/solid peroxides, and photoredox methods now enable controlled radical oxidations without the volatility and detonation risk of classical dialkyl peroxides.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The write-up is engagingly written but covers a niche topic with limited practical impact. The surprising stability is scientifically interesting, but the extreme preparation constraints mean these compounds are unlikely to move beyond academic curiosity or very specialized applications.
