# Retrospective Analysis: Update on Alnylam (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" discusses the resurgence of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and RNA interference (RNAi) technology. The article highlights Alnylam's promising Phase III trial results for treating familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), where their drug demonstrated over 80% reduction in the disease-causing protein. 

Lowe contextualizes this development within the broader history of biotech hype cycles, noting the boom-bust-boom pattern that RNAi had experienced—from initial enthusiasm to skepticism and now renewed optimism. The article references MIT professor Robert Langer's observation that "The world went from believing RNAi would change everything to thinking it wouldn't work, to now thinking it will." Lowe speculates that if RNAi proves successful, it could trigger "creative destruction" in the pharmaceutical industry, potentially displacing small-molecule drugs and transforming the rare-disease business model toward genomic-based therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Aftermath (2014-2018):**
Alnylam's patisiran (the FAP drug mentioned) received FDA approval in August 2018, becoming the first RNAi therapeutic approved in the United States. This breakthrough validated the technology after decades of development. The company followed with additional approvals: givosiran (for acute hepatic porphyria) in 2019 and lumasiran (for primary hyperoxaluria type 1) in 2020.

**RNAi Industry Evolution:**
The major pharmaceutical companies initially cited in the article took divergent paths. Sanofi's $700M investment proved prescient as RNAi gained traction, while Roche eventually exited RNAi development despite the Santaris acquisition. The field consolidated around a few key players: Alnylam, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, and Dicerna (acquired by Novo Nordisk in 2021 for $3.3B).

**Clinical Landscape (2014-2024):**
By 2024, there are approximately 10 approved RNAi therapeutics globally. The technology found its strongest applications in rare genetic diseases affecting the liver, where delivery challenges are most tractable. However, the broader promise of RNAi for more common diseases remained constrained by delivery limitations—the fundamental challenge of getting RNA molecules to target tissues beyond the liver proved more difficult than anticipated.

**Unexpected Parallel Development:**
The article's brief mention of Moderna's mRNA work proved remarkably prescient. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated mRNA vaccine development, and by 2024, mRNA technology has achieved broader therapeutic success than RNAi, though the two technologies address fundamentally different therapeutic approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**

1. **RNAi therapeutic approval**: The prediction that Alnylam would achieve regulatory approval proved correct—patisiran was approved in 2018.

2. **Industry consolidation and investment**: The trend of large pharma companies investing in or acquiring RNAi companies continued, with Novo Nordisk's $3.3B acquisition of Dicerna being a notable example.

3. **Application to rare diseases**: The article's implication that RNAi would find success in rare diseases was accurate—the majority of approved RNAi drugs target orphan indications.

4. **Convergence of biological therapies**: Lowe correctly anticipated that success in one modality (RNAi) would inform development of others. The subsequent breakthroughs in mRNA vaccines and CRISPR gene editing partly built upon lessons learned from RNAi development.

**What the Article Got Wrong:**

1. **Scale of impact**: The article's suggestion that RNAi would trigger widespread "creative destruction" across the pharmaceutical industry proved overstated. While RNAi carved out an important niche, it did not displace small molecules or antibodies as dominant modalities.

2. **Timeline**: The implied timeline of rapid transformation ("come back in 25 years") underestimated how slowly breakthrough technologies diffuse through the pharmaceutical industry.

3. **Delivery solutions**: The article did not fully anticipate that delivery to extrahepatic tissues would remain a fundamental bottleneck limiting RNAi's broader application.

4. **Comparative success**: The article couldn't have known that mRNA technology would achieve greater commercial success sooner than RNAi, partly due to lower delivery barriers.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article merits high interest for several reasons. First, it captures the inflection point when RNAi transitioned from promising but unproven concept to clinically validated therapeutic modality. The author's balanced perspective—acknowledging past disappointments while recognizing genuine progress—provides a valuable template for evaluating emerging biotechnologies.

The article's broader insights about hype cycles in biotech and the pattern of "biology riding over the hill" resonate beyond RNAi to many platform technologies. The discussion of creative destruction in pharmaceuticals has proven prescient, even if the specific modalities driving change evolved differently than anticipated.

Most importantly, the article demonstrates clear historical consciousness about biotechnology development patterns—understanding that success often follows multiple rounds of failure and refinement. This nuanced perspective on scientific progress makes it more valuable than either pure hype or pure skepticism.

The article's compelling score stems from its capture of a genuine breakthrough moment, its thoughtful contextual analysis, and its surprisingly accurate anticipation of broader industry trends, even where specific predictions proved imperfect.
