# The Higher States of Bromine (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes newly synthesized high-oxidation-state bromine compounds published in a paper by Konrad Seppelt at Freie Universität Berlin. The author discusses the unusual nature of bromine in oxidation states beyond the familiar -1 (bromide), 0 (elemental bromine), +3, and +5. The focus is on bromyl fluoride (BrO₂F), a compound requiring extremely dangerous reagents like bromine pentafluoride and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which must be handled with extreme caution and specialized equipment. The synthesis involves condensing reagents at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196°C) and allowing warming to -78°C for reaction. The resulting compounds, including Br₃O₆⁺ triflate, are described as highly unstable - exploding when warmed past +10°C and requiring handling in specialized vacuum lines at small scale. The tone emphasizes the extreme hazards and specialist nature of this chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article was published in November 2019, these bromine compounds have remained highly specialized laboratory curiosities. As predicted by the article's cautious tone, there has been no widespread adoption or industrial applications. These substances continue to be studied primarily by small groups of inorganic chemists specializing in main-group chemistry.

Konrad Seppelt's research group and others in the field of fluorine chemistry have continued publishing on related hypervalent halogen compounds in specialized journals like *Angewandte Chemie*. However, these compounds have not transitioned beyond basic research into practical applications due to their extreme instability, toxicity, and difficulty in handling. No FDA-approved drugs, commercial products, or industrial processes have emerged using these particular high-oxidation-state bromine compounds. The research remains valuable primarily for fundamental understanding of chemical bonding and the limits of main-group element chemistry rather than for practical applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction (implicit)**: These compounds would remain highly specialized research materials without practical applications.
  - **Actual outcome**: ✓ Confirmed. The chemistry has remained confined to specialized academic labs with no scale-up or commercialization.

• **Prediction (implicit)**: Handling would require extreme precautions and specialized equipment.
  - **Actual outcome**: ✓ Confirmed. No simplified or safer preparation methods have emerged; these compounds remain dangerous to handle.

• **Prediction (implicit)**: Only highly specialized research groups would work with these materials.
  - **Actual outcome**: ✓ Confirmed. The field remains limited to a small number of fluorine chemistry specialists.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While fascinating from a chemical fundamental research perspective, this article describes chemistry so specialized and removed from practical applications that it has minimal broader impact beyond the small community of fluorine chemists studying main-group element extremes.
