# The Genomics Revolution Shows Up Late, But Shows Up (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines the PCSK9 story as the first real success of the genomics era in drug discovery. The author contrasts the initial hype around 1999-2000, when the human genome was sequenced and many expected an immediate flood of new drug targets, with the reality that it took until the mid-2010s for PCSK9 inhibitors to reach the market.

The article explains that PCSK9 was essentially unknown before 2003. After gain-of-function mutations were found to worsen LDL profiles, loss-of-function mutations were discovered that showed protective effects—validating PCSK9 as a therapeutic target. Small molecule approaches proved unworkable, so development shifted to antibodies. The first human dosing occurred in 2010, Phase III results came in 2013, and the drugs were approved based on LDL (surrogate endpoint) data. The article notes that definitive cardiovascular outcomes data had only recently been published at the time of writing.

The author acknowledges PCSK9 as genuinely successful—a drug reaching market in 11 years from target identification—but emphasizes that this represents essentially the only major genomics success story nearly two decades after the genome was sequenced, far fewer than initially expected.

## 2. HISTORY

**PCSK9 Inhibitor Approvals and Clinical Outcomes:**
- **Repatha (evolocumab)** by Amgen received FDA approval in August 2015
- **Praluent (alirocumab)** by Sanofi/Regeneron received FDA approval in July 2015
- Both were approved based on dramatic LDL-C reduction (surrogate endpoint)
- In March 2017 (just as this article was published), the FOURIER outcomes trial for Repatha demonstrated a 15% reduction in the primary cardiovascular endpoint and 20% reduction in heart attack/stroke/death—confirming clinical benefit, though the magnitude was somewhat less than some had hoped

**Subsequent Market Performance:**
- Despite efficacy, PCSK9 inhibitors faced significant access challenges due to high prices (approximately \$14,000 annually initially)
- Payer restrictions limited prescriptions primarily to very high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or established cardiovascular disease
- By 2018-2019, both drugs had relatively modest uptake compared to statins
- List prices were later reduced (Repatha to ~\$5,850 annually by 2018), improving access

**Additional Clinical Evidence:**
- ODYSSEY Outcomes trial for Praluent showed similar cardiovascular benefits (2018)
- Both drugs demonstrated safety over extended follow-up periods
- Combination with statins proved effective for patients who couldn't achieve LDL goals with statins alone

**Scientific Impact:**
- PCSK9 became a validated proof-of-concept for genomics-guided drug discovery
- The approach influenced subsequent target selection strategies across the industry
- However, as the article anticipated, similar genomics success stories remained relatively rare through the late 2010s

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article made or reported several predictions/expectations:**

• **"The brave new world is not the one we live in"** - This expressed skepticism that genomics would rapidly transform drug discovery. **OUTCOME**: Largely accurate. While PCSK9 succeeded, the genomics revolution did not produce the flood of new drugs initially expected in the early 2000s. The pace remained measured through the late 2010s.

• **Surrogate endpoints would remain crucial for cardiovascular drugs** - The article highlighted LDL as a successful surrogate. **OUTCOME**: Accurate. The PCSK9 story validated LDL as a surrogate endpoint, and this model continued to be used for lipid-modifying therapies. However, some debate continued about optimal surrogates.

• **The genomics era had "dawned" with PCSK9** - The article suggested this might be the beginning of more genomics successes. **OUTCOME**: Mixed. While some additional genomics successes emerged (e.g., RNA-targeting therapies, some cancer immunotherapies), the transformation was more gradual than revolutionary through 2020.

• **Alzheimer's disease lacked good surrogates** - Mentioned as a contrast to cardiovascular disease. **OUTCOME**: Accurate. Alzheimer's drug development continued to struggle with surrogate endpoints through the late 2010s and early 2020s, contributing to multiple trial failures.

• **PCSK9 might not work "quite enough" compared to expectations** - The author expressed slight disappointment in the magnitude of benefit. **OUTCOME**: Partially accurate. The 15-20% cardiovascular risk reduction was meaningful but indeed smaller than some had hoped, contributing to market access challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides valuable historical perspective on the PCSK9 breakthrough and accurately characterizes both the achievement and the broader disappointment in genomics-driven drug discovery timelines. It balances celebration of genuine scientific progress with realistic assessment of how drug development actually works, serving as a useful counterpoint to hype cycles. The timing (published just as FOURIER outcomes data emerged) makes it particularly insightful for understanding contemporary perspectives on what would become a major therapeutic class.
