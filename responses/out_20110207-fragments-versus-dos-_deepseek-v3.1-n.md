# Fragments Versus DOS: A Showdown (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Nature editorial debate between fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) and diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) as competing approaches to drug discovery. Fragment-based methods involve screening small, low molecular weight compounds (150-300 MW) and using structural information to build efficient binders through rational design. In contrast, DOS creates larger, structurally novel compounds that explore uncharted chemical space, often targeting undruggable biological targets.

The debate centers on their respective limitations: Abbott's Phil Hajduk criticized DOS compounds for being too large with undesirable properties, while Cambridge researchers countered that fragments only work with well-defined structural targets and struggle with protein-protein interactions. The author notes that both approaches have different strengths—fragments excel when targets and structures are known, while DOS may be better suited for phenotypic screening where specific targets are unclear.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2011, fragment-based drug discovery has demonstrated substantial real-world impact, while DOS has remained largely an academic pursuit with limited translation to approved medicines.

**Fragment-Based Drug Discovery Successes:**
- **Vemurafenib (Zelboraf)**: Approved by FDA in 2011 for BRAF-mutant melanoma, this drug originated from fragment screening by Plexxikon and has been widely adopted, generating hundreds of thousands of patient treatments.
- **Venetoclax (Venclexta)**: Approved in 2016 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, developed by AbbVie and Genentech through fragment-based approaches targeting BCL-2.
- **Erdafitinib (Balversa)**: Approved in 2019 for bladder cancer, developed by Janssen using fragment methods.
- Multiple other FBDD-derived drugs reached clinical trials, with several additional approvals in subsequent years.

**Industry Adoption**: Major pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Roche) and specialized biotechs (Astex, Vernalis, SensiQ) have established robust FBDD platforms. The approach became standard practice for challenging targets where structural information is available.

**Diversity-Oriented Synthesis Outcomes**: DOS remained primarily in academic settings with limited pharmaceutical industry uptake. While DOS libraries generated interesting chemical probes for basic research, few if any led to clinically approved drugs. The concerns about molecular weight and developability proved well-founded—DOS compounds generally failed to meet drug-likeness criteria required for clinical development.

**Technological Evolution**: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) targeting, a key area of contention, saw significant advances through fragments for specific targets, though challenges remain. Structural biology methods (especially cryo-EM) improved dramatically, benefiting fragment-based approaches that depend on structural information.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Fragment limitations against tough targets like PPIs**: The article expressed uncertainty whether fragments could effectively target protein-protein interactions. **Outcome**: Mixed results—some PPI targets proved tractable to fragments (e.g., BCL-2), while many others remained challenging, validating the original concern.

- **DOS compounds being "too large and undevelopable"**: This concern was articulated clearly. **Outcome**: Verified—DOS libraries generally failed to produce drug candidates due to poor drug-likeness properties.

- **Fragment approach requiring high-quality structural information**: This limitation was noted. **Outcome**: Confirmed—FBDD's success remained strongly correlated with structural biology capabilities, with companies investing heavily in X-ray crystallography and later cryo-EM.

- **Both techniques keeping each other's partisans on their toes**: **Outcome**: Partially realized—FBDD evolved significantly with industrial adoption, while DOS influenced fragment library design for increased three-dimensionality, but the anticipated productive competition was largely one-sided.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article correctly anticipated the divergent trajectories of FBDD and DOS, with fragments achieving substantial clinical success while DOS remained academic. The piece accurately identified key technical limitations and provided important strategic insights about drug discovery approaches at a critical time.
