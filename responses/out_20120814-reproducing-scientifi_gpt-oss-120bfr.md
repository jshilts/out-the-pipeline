# Reproducing Scientific Results – On Purpose (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article laments the chronic difficulty of reproducing cutting‑edge biomedical research and introduces the **Reproducibility Initiative (RI)** – a service launched by Science Exchange that would let authors pay a third‑party lab to repeat key experiments. Successful repeats would earn a “certification” that the results were independently verified, and the verification studies would appear in a dedicated **PLOS ONE Reproducibility Collection**. The author hopes the model will become standard practice, especially for work that is being commercialized or funded by grants and venture capital.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened to the Reproducibility Initiative?**  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2012‑2013** | The RI was launched; a small number of pilot projects (≈10–15) were submitted for verification. PLOS ONE published a “Reproducibility Collection” that featured a handful of these verification papers. | The effort generated media attention but remained a niche service; participation was limited because authors had to shoulder the cost and because many journals did not require or incentivize certification. |
| **2014‑2015** | NIH introduced the **Rigor and Reproducibility** policy, mandating that grant applications address reproducibility plans. Parallel community projects (e.g., the *Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology* and the *Center for Open Science*’s reproducibility studies) gained higher visibility. | The broader policy environment shifted focus from a commercial certification model to institutional requirements and open‑science tools (pre‑registration, data sharing, code repositories). |
| **2015‑2016** | Science Exchange re‑branded the service as **Science Exchange Reproducibility Services** and began offering “verification as a service” to biotech firms rather than academic authors. The original RI website was archived; the PLOS ONE Reproducibility Collection was not continued beyond the initial set of papers. | Adoption stayed modest; most verification work was performed internally by companies or through collaborative consortia rather than via the RI certification. |
| **2017‑2022** | The reproducibility movement matured: journals introduced *registered reports*, many funders required data‑availability statements, and large‑scale replication efforts (e.g., the *Reproducibility Project: Psychology* and *Cancer Biology*) produced mixed results. The RI model never became a standard “seal of approval.” | The original vision of a paid‑for, third‑party certification did not materialize as a norm. However, the RI helped raise awareness and demonstrated that independent verification could be packaged as a publishable unit. |
| **2023‑present** | Science Exchange continues to market reproducibility services to industry, but the academic community largely relies on open‑science practices (pre‑prints, data/code sharing, open‑lab notebooks) rather than a commercial certification. | The RI’s legacy is mainly historical – it contributed to the conversation that led to stronger journal policies and NIH guidelines, but it did not reshape the publishing ecosystem. |

**Bottom line:** The Reproducibility Initiative sparked early discussion and produced a limited set of verified studies, but it never achieved the widespread “new normal” the 2012 article envisioned. The reproducibility agenda moved forward through policy mandates, open‑science infrastructure, and community‑driven replication projects rather than through a paid certification model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several expectations. Below are the most explicit ones and how they fared:

- **Prediction:** *Authors will voluntarily pay for third‑party verification and display a certification alongside their papers.*  
  **Outcome:** Rare. Only a handful of groups ever used the service; most researchers rely on journal‑driven checks, data sharing, or community replication rather than a paid seal.

- **Prediction:** *Venture‑capitalists and grant agencies will treat the certification as a strong credibility signal.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. Funding agencies now require reproducibility plans (NIH, EU Horizon) but do not ask for external certifications. VC due diligence still focuses on data integrity, IP, and market potential, not on a specific “RI seal.”

- **Prediction:** *Leading publishers will link original articles to the verified version, creating a permanent, searchable record.*  
  **Outcome:** Limited. PLOS ONE linked its early verification papers, but most other publishers have not adopted a systematic linking system. Instead, many journals now encourage authors to post replication data in repositories (e.g., Figshare, OSF).

- **Prediction:** *The model will become the “New Normal” for groundbreaking scientific results.*  
  **Outcome:** The field moved toward open‑science practices (registered reports, data/code availability) rather than a commercial verification service. The “new normal” is now transparency and pre‑registration, not a paid certification.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  

The article is a useful snapshot of early‑stage reproducibility activism and foreshadows many later policy changes, but the specific initiative it championed never took hold, limiting its long‑term impact. Nonetheless, it helped catalyze broader discussions that shaped today’s reproducibility landscape.
