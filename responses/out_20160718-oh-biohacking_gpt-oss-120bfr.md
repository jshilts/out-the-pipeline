# Oh, Biohacking (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a skeptical commentary on the “biohacking” craze that had taken hold in Silicon Valley by 2016.  It focuses on Nootrobox, a venture‑backed startup (backed by Andreessen Horowitz) that sold nutraceuticals marketed as cognitive enhancers.  The author notes the company’s internal practice of a 36‑hour fast every week, arguing that there is no solid evidence that such fasting improves brain function and that any perceived boost is likely a placebo effect.  

The article then broadens the scope to the wider “biohacking” ecosystem: boutique clinics offering IV nutrient drips, prescription‑drug‑based nootropics, and even micro‑doses of psychedelics used by tech workers to “optimize” performance.  The author warns that the market is driven more by hype and clever marketing than by rigorous science, and that the culture of self‑experimentation may erode critical thinking among otherwise highly educated professionals.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Nootrobox → HVMN  
* **Rebranding (2017‑2018).**  Nootrobox renamed itself **HVMN** (Health Via Modern Nutrition) and shifted focus from a broad “smart‑drug” line to a narrower portfolio centered on **ketone esters**, MCT oil, and a few “performance” powders.  
* **Funding & growth.**  HVMN raised a total of ≈ $30 M (Series A in 2016, a $10 M round in 2018).  Sales peaked around 2019‑2020, driven by athletes and a niche “biohacker” community.  
* **Regulatory pressure.**  In 2020 the FDA issued warning letters to several supplement firms (including a HVMN‑affiliated product) for making unsubstantiated health claims about “enhanced cognition” and “fat loss.”  HVMN subsequently revised its marketing language to avoid disease‑treatment implications.  
* **Product line changes.**  The flagship **HVMN Ketone Ester** was discontinued in early 2022 after supply‑chain issues and a cost‑benefit analysis that showed limited repeat purchases.  The company now markets a smaller set of “energy” and “recovery” powders, plus a subscription‑based “bio‑membership” that bundles content, not products.  

### The broader biohacking market  
* **Growth but limited mainstream adoption.**  The global “nootropic” supplement market grew from ≈ $2 B in 2016 to ≈ $4.5 B in 2023 (source: market‑research reports).  However, the majority of sales remain in the “wellness” segment (vitamins, adaptogens) rather than true CNS‑active compounds.  
* **Clinical evidence.**  Large‑scale, placebo‑controlled trials of most over‑the‑counter “nootropics” (e.g., racetams, herbal blends) have not demonstrated consistent cognitive benefits in healthy adults.  The most robust data continue to be for **prescription‑only** agents such as modafinil and ADHD medications, which remain tightly regulated.  
* **Intermittent fasting.**  The 36‑hour fast popularized by Nootrobox never became a corporate norm.  Intermittent fasting (16:8, 5:2) entered mainstream nutrition advice, but systematic reviews (2021‑2024) conclude modest metabolic benefits and **no clear advantage for acute cognitive performance**.  
* **Regulatory crackdowns.**  Between 2021‑2024 the FDA and FTC sent over 150 warning letters to companies selling “nootropic” blends that contained undisclosed stimulants (e.g., DMAA, DMHA).  Some firms (e.g., TruBrain, Neurohacker Collective) voluntarily reformulated or withdrew products.  
* **Psychedelic micro‑dosing.**  By 2023 several cities (e.g., Denver, Oakland) de‑criminalized psilocybin, and a handful of biotech startups began clinical trials on micro‑dosing for mood and creativity.  No FDA‑approved product exists yet; the practice remains largely experimental and legally ambiguous.  

### Cultural impact  
* The “biohacker” label persists in niche conferences (e.g., **Biohacker Summit**, **Bulletproof Conference**) and in a small but vocal community on Reddit, Discord, and private meet‑ups.  
* Large tech firms have **not** institutionalized fasting or nootropic regimens; most corporate wellness programs focus on sleep, exercise, and mental‑health resources rather than experimental supplements.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Fasting (36 h) will boost workplace focus and become a common corporate practice.** | No evidence of adoption.  Intermittent fasting became a personal wellness trend, but the specific 36‑hour “Tuesday fast” never spread beyond a few anecdotal offices. |
| **Nootrobox’s nutraceuticals will achieve measurable cognitive benefits and likely dominate the market.** | The company rebranded, pivoted to ketone products, and never delivered clinically proven cognition‑enhancing results.  Market share stayed modest and later contracted. |
| **Biohacking (IV drips, Russian nootropics, micro‑dosed psychedelics) will become mainstream in Silicon Valley workplaces.** | IV nutrient “drips” remain a boutique service for a minority of high‑net‑worth clients; Russian‑sourced nootropics are still underground.  Micro‑dosing of psychedelics is discussed openly but remains illegal in most jurisdictions and is not a standard workplace perk. |
| **Regulators will eventually intervene against unsubstantiated claims.** | Accurate.  The FDA/FTC issued multiple warning letters (2020‑2024) and forced label changes; several companies exited the market or reformulated. |
| **The “biohacker” culture will drive a wave of scientifically validated products.** | Partially true.  Some companies (e.g., **HVMN**, **Bulletproof**) funded small clinical studies, but most products remain supported by weak or anecdotal evidence.  No breakthrough, FDA‑approved “smart‑drug” for healthy adults has emerged. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a vivid snapshot of an early‑stage cultural phenomenon and raises timeless questions about evidence‑based self‑optimization; however, its specific focus on Nootrobox and the extreme fasting anecdote limits broader long‑term relevance.
