# Life With Arsenic: Who'd Have Thought? (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses NASA's announcement of a groundbreaking discovery: researchers had successfully grown bacteria that appeared to substitute arsenic for phosphorus in their basic biochemistry. The work, published in Science, described how scientists took bacteria from Mono Lake sediments and gradually forced them to grow in increasingly arsenic-rich, phosphate-starved conditions. The resulting bacteria seemed to incorporate arsenate into their biomolecules—including potentially DNA and ATP—something previously thought impossible given arsenic's reputation as a poison that disrupts phosphate-dependent enzyme systems.

The author expressed considerable surprise at this finding, noting that arsenic sits directly below phosphorus in the periodic table and forms similar compounds, but with significantly different chemical behavior. While the bacteria grew more slowly and preferentially switched back to phosphate when available, they appeared to demonstrate that life's fundamental chemistry could be stretched much further than previously believed. The discovery was framed as raising exciting possibilities about alternative biochemistries on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the universe.

## 2. HISTORY

The arsenic life story underwent one of the most dramatic scientific reversals in recent memory. Within months of publication, the original Science paper faced intense criticism from the scientific community. Researchers identified numerous methodological flaws and potential contamination issues that cast doubt on the central claims. 

In 2012, Science published two comprehensive technical critiques (Erb et al. and Redfield et al.) that systematically dismantled the original findings. These papers demonstrated that the bacteria still contained sufficient phosphate to sustain normal biochemistry and that arsenate had not actually been incorporated into DNA or other critical biomolecules as claimed. The "arsenic life" interpretation proved to be incorrect—the bacteria were simply highly arsenic-tolerant organisms surviving through conventional phosphate biochemistry, not utilizing arsenic as a biochemical replacement.

The lead author, Felisa Wolfe-Simon, faced significant criticism for what many viewed as premature conclusions and inadequate experimental controls. Despite the controversy, she maintained positions at various institutions and continued researching extremophile microbiology, though the arsenic life hypothesis was effectively disproven. The episode became a cautionary tale about the importance of rigorous peer review and the dangers of science-by-press-release, particularly when dealing with extraordinary claims about fundamental biological principles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author suggested this discovery would "keep a lot of people busy for quite a while" working out biochemical details, and that arsenic-from-the-ground-up organisms would likely be found in nature.  
**Reality**: Research activity did intensify, but primarily to disprove rather than confirm the findings. No naturally occurring arsenic-utilizing organisms have been discovered.

• **Prediction**: The author speculated about selenium-for-sulfur substitutions and even tellurium/antimony experiments becoming more plausible.  
**Reality**: While selenium biochemistry continues to be studied, no successful forced substitution experiments along these lines have gained acceptance, and the arsenic case actually made researchers more skeptical of such possibilities.

• **Prediction**: The implications for extraterrestrial life were considered significant, suggesting our type of biochemistry might be common and have "wiggle room."  
**Reality**: The failed replication actually reduced enthusiasm for extreme biochemical flexibility in astrobiology discussions, reinforcing that life likely requires specific molecular building blocks rather than interchangeable alternatives.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article addresses a genuinely important scientific question about the fundamental constraints on biochemistry, and the dramatic reversal of its central claim makes it historically significant for understanding how science self-corrects. However, the eventual debunking limits its long-term scientific importance compared to validated discoveries, though it remains valuable as a case study in scientific controversy and methodology.
