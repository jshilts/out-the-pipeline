# The Hollywood Analogy (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article responds to the "Hollywood analogy" for pharmaceutical drug discovery—the comparison that, like movie studios, drug companies produce many candidates knowing most will fail, with uncertain outcomes despite best efforts. The author acknowledges superficial similarities but argues the analogy breaks down across six critical dimensions: (1) movie narrative is a well-understood human construct with reusable tropes, whereas drug mechanisms must adapt to biological reality; (2) health stakes dwarf entertainment choices; (3) medical timing and diagnosis windows are unforgiving; (4) drug development timelines are far longer with late-stage costs dominating; (5) copyright protection (95+ years) versus patent protection (~20 years from filing) creates vastly different economics; and (6) drugs either remain valid for decades or are definitively superseded, unlike movies that retain cultural value. The core argument is that drug discovery operates under fundamentally different constraints than human-designed systems like entertainment.

## 2. HISTORY

The Hollywood analogy and deregulatory arguments reappeared periodically after 2017, but the regulatory landscape generally moved toward more oversight, not less. The FDA's drug approval pathways evolved rather than retreated: accelerated approval mechanisms (e.g., for oncology and rare diseases), real-world evidence integration, and adaptive trial designs broadened gradually under Commissioners Gottlieb (2017–2019), Hahn (2019–2021), and Califf (2022–present). FDA's Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations expanded, but premarket evidence requirements remained largely intact.

Concrete impacts from deregulatory proposals did not materialize; no mainstream "release-and-see" model for therapeutics gained traction. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and PDUFA reauthorizations maintained the existing approval framework while adding flexibility. COVID-19 vaccines and therapies (2020–2021) operated under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) but still required substantial safety and efficacy data, and full approvals (e.g., Comirnaty, Spikevax) underwent standard BLA review.

Drug development timelines and costs remained stubbornly high. Industry R&D spending continued rising (often exceeding $2–3 billion per approved drug when failures are amortized), and Phase II/III trial costs dominated budgets as the article predicted. Patent cliffs persisted—blockbusters like Humira (adalimumab) faced biosimilar competition starting 2023, illustrating the 20-year patent constraint.

The knowledge gap between drug mechanism understanding and biological complexity continued to challenge the field. Predictive failures in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's trials repeatedly failing despite amyloid-targeting approaches), oncology resistance, and heterogeneous patient responses confirmed the article's skepticism about borrowing lessons across projects.

Business models did not shift toward deregulated self-selection. Instead, value-based pricing, outcomes-based contracts, and patient assistance programs became more common, but these operated within existing regulatory pathways.

A partial counterexample emerged with direct-to-consumer lab testing and wellness products (e.g., Theranos-era claims, later discredited), which faced FDA scrutiny and legal consequences, reinforcing the author's point that health decisions cannot be treated like entertainment choices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was largely descriptive rather than predictive, but it contained several implicit forecasts about industry dynamics:

- **Implicit prediction: Regulatory frameworks will remain stringent**  
  ✅ **Accurate:** No significant deregulation occurred in drug approval pathways post-2017. FDA maintained premarket evidence requirements even as it expanded expedited pathways.

- **Implicit prediction: Drug discovery will remain uniquely difficult compared to human-designed systems**  
  ✅ **Accurate:** Neuroscience, oncology, and autoimmune drug development continued showing high failure rates and mechanistic surprises. CAR-T therapies succeeded in blood cancers but struggled with solid tumors; Alzheimer's trials repeatedly missed endpoints.

- **Implicit prediction: Patent lifetimes will continue creating different economics than copyright**  
  ✅ **Accurate:** Major drugs lost exclusivity (e.g., Humira biosimilars launched in 2023, Keytruda faces 2028 patent expiry). Generic/biosimilar competition consistently eroded revenues post-patent expiry.

- **Implicit prediction: Time and capital intensity in late-stage trials will persist**  
  ✅ **Accurate:** Phase III trial costs remained the dominant budget item. Gene therapies reached multi-year development timelines with nine-figure Phase III costs (e.g., Zolgensma, Luxturna).

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addresses a persistent misconception in tech-industry thinking about drug discovery—the "build it and they will come" fallacy. It dissects the analogy systematically, touching on regulatory science, patent law, clinical timelines, and biological complexity, with implications that have remained relevant for years.
