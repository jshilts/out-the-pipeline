# Vaccine Roundup: Merck Wipes Out (and More) (January 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article provides a comprehensive January 2021 snapshot of the global COVID-19 vaccine landscape, focusing primarily on Merck's announcement that it was discontinuing both of its viral vector vaccine candidates (measles-based and VSV-based) due to Phase I data showing immunogenicity below convalescent plasma levels and lower than other vaccines. The piece surveys multiple vaccine platforms: viral vector candidates including Oxford/AstraZeneca (approved in multiple countries but facing manufacturing shortages), CanSino (limited efficacy data), and Sputnik-V (rolling out but awaiting full publication); mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech (already being widely administered with promising real-world data emerging from Israel); and other approaches including inactivated virus vaccines (Bharat Biotech, SinoVac, SinoPharm with unclear efficacy data), recombinant protein vaccines (Novavax awaiting Phase III results, GSK/Sanofi facing setbacks), and various earlier-stage efforts. The article notes Moderna's response to new variants showing reduced efficacy against the South African strain but still maintaining protective antibody levels, while highlighting the continued importance of rigorous clinical validation despite pandemic urgency.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this January 2021 article, several major developments occurred:

**Merck's viral vector vaccines** were indeed discontinued as announced, and the company pivoted to focus on therapeutic development. However, in 2021 Merck would later partner with Johnson & Johnson to help manufacture their vaccine and also develop molnupiravir as an oral antiviral treatment.

**Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine** received FDA emergency use authorization in February 2021, but its rollout was complicated by manufacturing issues at a Baltimore facility and later by rare blood clotting concerns that led to temporary paused use in April 2021. The vaccine was ultimately authorized for use in adults, though uptake varied significantly by country.

**Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine** continued to be deployed globally in 2021 but faced significant challenges, including rare thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome safety concerns that led many European countries to restrict its use, particularly in younger populations. Manufacturing disputes with the EU persisted, and by 2022 many high-income countries had shifted away from this vaccine toward mRNA options.

**mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna** became the dominant COVID-19 vaccines in high-income countries throughout 2021 and 2022, receiving full FDA approval (Pfizer in August 2021, Moderna in January 2022). Real-world effectiveness data consistently supported their use, though variant evolution (particularly Delta and later Omicron) led to reduced efficacy against infection while maintaining protection against severe disease. Booster campaigns were widely implemented.

**Novavax's recombinant protein vaccine** finally received regulatory approvals beginning in late 2021 (Indonesia, Philippines) and FDA EUA in July 2022, but this came too late for broad market penetration as most populations had already been vaccinated or infected. The company struggled with manufacturing scale-up and saw limited commercial uptake.

**Variant adaptation** became a major focus in 2022, leading to bivalent boosters targeting both original strain and Omicron variants approved by FDA in August-September 2022. Moderna's variant work referenced in the article proved prescient, though the sixfold reduction against South African variant was replaced by much larger reductions (10-40 fold) against later Omicron subvariants.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **"Frankly, it had better work - we need it"** (regarding J&J vaccine): The J&J vaccine did receive authorization and was deployed, but manufacturing problems and safety concerns significantly limited its impact compared to initial hopes. While it provided important single-dose convenience, especially for hard-to-reach populations, it never approached the market share or public confidence of mRNA vaccines.

• **(Implicit) Variant adaptation would be necessary**: Moderna's work on variant-specific boosters proved highly relevant. The sixfold reduction against B.1.351 mentioned in the article was actually modest compared to later variant challenges. The "insurance policy" approach of developing variant-specific boosters became standard practice by 2022, with multiple updated vaccines approved and deployed.

• **(Implicit) The vaccine landscape would be "quite different" by the time later candidates completed trials**: This proved accurate - candidates like Inovio's DNA vaccine and various other platforms mentioned never achieved significant market penetration or completed pivotal trials in time. The mRNA vaccines established dominance, and later entrants faced difficult commercial landscapes even when technically successful.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when the first wave of vaccine successes was becoming clear while the limitations of other approaches were emerging. The Merck discontinuation highlighted critical realities about vaccine development timelines and failure modes that remained relevant throughout the pandemic, and the variant concerns expressed here anticipated the next two years of iterative vaccine development.
