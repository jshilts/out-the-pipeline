# Analysis of "Novartis Gets Out of RNAi" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 article reported on Novartis's decision to exit RNA interference (RNAi) research, citing both developmental difficulties and the realization that fewer disease areas were amenable to the technique than initially hoped. The piece positioned this as part of a broader trend of large pharmaceutical companies (including Merck) retreating from RNAi, suggesting the field might be better suited for smaller, more specialized companies like Alnylam rather than pharmaceutical giants requiring blockbuster therapies to sustain their R&D pipelines.

The article's tone was cautiously skeptical, noting that while a future technological breakthrough could revive large-pharma interest, Novartis appeared to have expected such a breakthrough sooner rather than later, and their exit reflected waning patience with the technology's commercial viability.

## 2. HISTORY

The historical trajectory of RNAi therapeutics post-2014 reveals a dramatic reversal of the pessimism expressed in the article, culminating in what can only be described as a remarkable validation of the technology—albeit on a longer timeline than initially anticipated.

**The Breakthrough Arrives (2018-2020):** Just four years after the article's publication, the first RNAi therapeutic, Alnylam's Onpattro (patisiran), received FDA approval in August 2018 for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. This landmark approval opened the floodgates, demonstrating that systemic delivery—once considered the field's Achilles' heel—was achievable.

**Large Pharma's Second Coming:** Rather than abandoning RNAi, major pharmaceutical companies began aggressively re-entering the space:
- **Novartis itself** acquired The Medicines Company in 2020 for $9.7 billion, primarily to gain access to inclisiran, an RNAi therapy for cardiovascular disease (an area the 2014 article suggested was problematic).
- **Pfizer** expanded its RNAi capabilities through multiple partnerships and acquisitions.
- **Roche** made significant investments in the space.
- **AstraZeneca** and **Sanofi** developed substantial RNAi pipelines.

**Clinical and Commercial Success (2020-Present):** By 2024, multiple RNAi therapeutics achieved both regulatory approval and commercial success, treating conditions ranging from rare genetic diseases to more common conditions like cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol. The market grew to billions of dollars annually, with dozens of RNAi candidates in clinical development across multiple disease areas.

The "technological breakthrough" the article suggested might never arrive had, in fact, arrived—it just took longer than Novartis's 2014 timeline anticipated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**
- **Small companies' advantage:** The prediction that specialized companies like Alnylam might succeed where large pharma struggled was prescient, as Alnylam became the undisputed leader in RNAi therapeutics.
- **Difficult development pathway:** The acknowledgment of developmental challenges was accurate—RNAi delivery remained problematic for years, and success required sustained investment and scientific persistence.
- **Different business models:** The suggestion that RNAi might fit better with smaller companies' economics proved temporarily correct.

**What the Article Got Wrong:**
- **Permanent large-pharma exit:** The assumption that Novartis's exit reflected a long-term strategic reality for large companies was completely incorrect. Instead, it represented typical corporate short-termism and impatience.
- **Disease area limitations:** The suggestion that RNAi would be limited to niche applications proved largely unfounded—successes now span rare diseases, cardiovascular conditions, neurological disorders, and beyond.
- **Timeline:** The implicit assumption that RNAi might never achieve breakthrough status underestimated the perseverance of the remaining players.

**Most Significantly Wrong:** The article failed to anticipate that sustained success by smaller companies would eventually prove the technology's commercial viability, prompting large pharma to return at premium valuations. Novartis's 2020 acquisition of The Medicines Company—paying billions for an RNAi asset—directly contradicted their 2014 strategic rationale.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article is highly interesting despite being wrong about the long-term prospects of RNAi technology. Its value lies in capturing a crucial moment in biotechnology business strategy—the tension between breakthrough science and commercial timelines—and documenting how large pharmaceutical companies can make strategically myopic decisions based on short-term considerations.

The piece represents a fascinating case study in:
- The challenge of timing breakthrough technologies
- The difference between tactical retreat and long-term strategic wisdom
- How market dynamics can reverse dramatically within a decade
- The interplay between small biotechnology innovation and large pharmaceutical company commercialization

What elevates its interest beyond mere historical documentation is how perfectly it illustrates the recurring pattern in biotechnology: breakthrough technologies often appear commercially non-viable at key moments, only to succeed spectacularly when pursued with sustained commitment by patient investors and researchers. Novartis's journey from RNAi exit to RNAi re-entry at premium cost encapsulates this dynamic beautifully.

The article serves as a cautionary tale about the difficulty of predicting technological tipping points and the strategic challenges facing large organizations in genuinely innovative fields—lessons as relevant today as they were in 2014.
