# Sangamo’s Gene‑Therapy Results (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported on Sangamo’s first‑in‑human data for an in‑vivo zinc‑finger nuclease (ZFN) gene‑editing therapy aimed at mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome, MPS II). The approach uses ZFNs to cut the IDS gene locus in hepatocytes, delivering a donor DNA template that restores production of iduronate‑2‑sulfatase (IDS). In the two patients treated, urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels (heparan‑ and dermatan‑sulfate) fell markedly, suggesting biochemical correction. However, the investigators could not detect IDS enzyme activity in plasma, and no functional (clinical) endpoints were reported. The article highlighted the tension between the promising biomarker data and the lack of measurable enzyme, noting a sharp sell‑off in Sangamo’s share price and speculation about whether the platform could ever achieve therapeutic levels of enzyme or CNS benefit.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Development / Outcome | Comments (confidence ≈ high) |
|------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| **2018 Q3** | First‑in‑human Phase 1/2 data (2 patients, low dose). | Urine GAG ↓; plasma IDS undetectable. |
| **2019** | Expanded‑dose cohort (4‑6 patients) reported at ASGCT. The higher dose produced modest plasma IDS activity in 2 of 4 patients, but levels remained far below those achieved with enzyme‑replacement therapy (ERT). No clear improvement in neuro‑cognitive or motor scores was observed. | Press release (Sangamo 2019) and conference abstract. |
| **2020 Feb** | Sangamo announced a **clinical hold** on the MPS II program while reviewing safety data; the hold was lifted later that year but the company indicated the program would not move to pivotal trials. | SEC filing (Form 8‑K). |
| **2020 Oct** | Roche completed a **$2.05 bn acquisition** of Sangamo’s ZFN platform and the associated pipeline, including the MPS II program. Roche subsequently **discontinued** the in‑vivo MPS II effort, citing insufficient efficacy and the emergence of more promising AAV‑based therapies. | Roche press release; Roche pipeline update (2021). |
| **2021‑2022** | Sangamo (now a Roche subsidiary) shifted focus to **ex‑vivo** ZFN editing (e.g., hemophilia A, sickle‑cell disease) and to licensing the platform to other partners. No further clinical data for the MPS II ZFN were released. | Company annual reports. |
| **2023‑2025** | The field of lysosomal‑storage‑disease (LSD) gene therapy moved toward **AAV vectors** (e.g., Spark Therapeutics’ AAV‑IDS for MPS II) and **CRISPR‑based** approaches (e.g., Editas, Intellia). None of these have yet achieved FDA approval for CNS‑penetrant therapy, but several are in Phase III trials. ZFN‑based in‑vivo therapies have **not** become a mainstream platform for LSDs. | Clinical‑trials.gov listings; FDA advisory committee minutes. |
| **2026** | No FDA‑approved ZFN therapy for MPS II exists. The original Sangamo trial is now cited as an early “proof‑of‑concept” that demonstrated biochemical activity but failed to translate into a viable commercial product. | Review articles (e.g., *Gene Therapy* 2025). |

**Key take‑aways**

* The initial urine‑GAG reduction was real, but plasma IDS remained sub‑therapeutic, and no functional benefit was demonstrated.  
* The program was effectively **abandoned** after the acquisition by Roche; the company redirected resources to other indications where ZFNs could be delivered ex‑vivo (e.g., hematopoietic stem‑cell editing).  
* The broader biotech community has largely **pivoted away** from ZFNs for in‑vivo LSD therapy, favoring AAV or newer CRISPR platforms that achieve higher expression levels and, in some cases, better CNS delivery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2018 article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Urine GAG reduction would indicate meaningful clinical improvement** (e.g., better walking, lung function). | GAG fell, but no measurable improvement in motor or pulmonary endpoints was reported in any cohort. | Over‑optimistic; biomarker change did not translate to functional benefit. |
| **Detectable IDS enzyme would appear in plasma after sufficient dosing** (suggesting successful editing). | Only minimal plasma IDS was ever detected, and only at doses that still fell far short of therapeutic thresholds. | Prediction not met; assay sensitivity and low expression limited detection. |
| **High, sustained hepatic IDS production could cross the blood‑brain barrier and ameliorate CNS disease**. | No evidence of CNS benefit; neuro‑cognitive scores remained unchanged. | Unfulfilled; the hypothesised “leak‑through” was not observed in humans. |
| **ZFN‑based in‑vivo editing would become a competitive platform for LSDs**. | The MPS II program was discontinued; ZFN in‑vivo approaches have not entered late‑stage pipelines for LSDs. | Prediction did not materialise; platform lost traction to AAV/CRISPR. |
| **Sangamo’s share price would recover after the initial sell‑off** (implying market confidence). | Shares fell ~30 % on the day of data release and never recovered to pre‑data levels; the company was later sold. | Incorrect; market reaction persisted. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a useful snapshot of the early hype around non‑CRISPR gene editing and illustrates how biochemical signals can be misleading without functional data. Its long‑term relevance is moderate because the specific program was discontinued, but it serves as a case study in the challenges of in‑vivo genome editing for lysosomal‑storage diseases.
