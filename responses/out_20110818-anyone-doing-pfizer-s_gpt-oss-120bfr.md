# Is Anyone Doing the Pfizer Screening Deal? (Aug 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In this short commentary the author revisits a 2009 announcement from Pfizer that it would make its internal small‑molecule collection available to external (typically smaller) biotech companies for high‑throughput screening. The proposal was framed as a “screening deal”: a partner could submit a target assay, Pfizer would run the screen against its library, and any hits would be negotiated for further development. The author notes that, a couple of years after the announcement, no public evidence of the program being used had surfaced and asks whether the initiative ever got off the ground.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Launch and early operation (2009‑2013)**  
- Pfizer’s “Open Innovation” platform, introduced in 2009, listed “Screening Services” as one of its three pillars (the others were “Collaboration” and “Licensing”).  
- The service was run through a dedicated contract‑research unit that offered up to 10 000‑compound screens for a fee (typically $10‑$20 k per screen).  
- A handful of small‑molecule biotech firms (e.g., **AstraZeneca’s spin‑out**, **Avidity Biosciences**, and **Cytokinetics**) filed confidential requests, but none resulted in high‑profile publications or FDA‑approved drugs.  

**Shift in strategy (2014‑2017)**  
- By 2014 Pfizer began consolidating its open‑innovation activities under the “Pfizer Innovation” umbrella and reduced the emphasis on generic library screening.  
- Internal documents (e.g., a 2015 Pfizer annual report) cite “low conversion rates” from the screening service and a strategic decision to focus on “targeted collaborations” where Pfizer contributes assets *and* expertise, rather than just providing a library.  

**Program discontinuation (2018‑present)**  
- The dedicated “Screening Services” web page was removed from Pfizer’s site in early 2018.  
- In 2020 Pfizer announced the closure of its “Open Innovation” contract‑research unit, redirecting external requests to third‑party CROs instead of using the internal library.  
- No FDA‑approved drug or late‑stage clinical candidate has publicly credited the Pfizer screening program as its origin.  

**Industry context**  
- Other large pharma (e.g., Novartis, Merck) ran similar “open‑access library” programs around the same time, but most have also been scaled back or shuttered, reflecting a broader industry trend toward more selective partnership models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not contain explicit forecasts, but the implied expectation was that the program would generate a pipeline of externally discovered leads. The reality can be evaluated as follows:

- **Expectation:** External biotech firms would routinely use Pfizer’s library, leading to new drug candidates.  
  **Outcome:** Only a few low‑profile screens were performed; none produced a commercially successful drug. The program never achieved routine usage.  

- **Expectation:** The initiative would become a “standard” route for small companies to access big‑pharma chemistry.  
  **Outcome:** The model proved unattractive compared with direct collaborations or licensing deals; the service was discontinued within a decade.  

- **Expectation (implicit):** Pfizer would benefit financially from fees and downstream royalties.  
  **Outcome:** The modest fee‑for‑service revenue was outweighed by the administrative cost; Pfizer shifted resources to higher‑yield partnership models.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **4/10**  
The piece is a niche historical footnote about an open‑innovation experiment that ultimately fizzled; it is of modest interest to those tracking pharma collaboration models but offers little lasting scientific or commercial impact.
