# Science Gifts: Chemistry Sets (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2012 blog post by Derek Lowe provides recommendations for science-themed gifts, specifically focusing on chemistry sets. The author reflects nostalgically on his own childhood chemistry set from the early 1970s, mentioning his enjoyment of experimenting with various reagents including potentially dangerous ones like potassium permanganate. He references a Smithsonian Magazine article about the history and evolution of chemistry sets, and recommends Thames and Kosmos chemistry sets based on positive reviews, while cautioning readers to use discretion with particularly hazardous chemicals.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2012, the chemistry set market and STEM education landscape have evolved significantly. Thames and Kosmos has continued operating and expanded their product lines, maintaining their reputation for quality educational science kits. The broader trend has been toward safer, more structured chemistry sets for children, with many manufacturers reducing or eliminating truly hazardous chemicals due to safety concerns and regulatory pressures. 

The chemistry set industry has largely shifted from the open-ended, potentially dangerous kits of the mid-20th century toward more guided, educational experiences that comply with modern safety standards. While this has made chemistry sets more accessible to families concerned about safety, it has also led to debates about whether modern sets provide the same level of hands-on experimental freedom that earlier generations experienced.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There are no explicit predictions in this article to evaluate. The piece is primarily retrospective and focused on gift recommendations rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 2/9**

This is a light personal blog post about gift recommendations with minimal broader scientific or industry significance. While it touches on the evolution of chemistry education, it lacks substantive analysis of biotechnology developments, clinical outcomes, or policy changes that would make it highly interesting or important.
