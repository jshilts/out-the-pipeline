# Invisible Crystals Yield Structure (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a significant breakthrough paper from UCLA, HHMI, LBNL, and SLAC researchers studying alpha-synuclein, the protein responsible for aggregation in Parkinson's disease. The team focused on an 11-amino acid segment (NACore) that drives the protein's toxic aggregation behavior—mutations or deletions in this region abolish aggregation and toxicity.

The remarkable finding was that the researchers obtained a high-resolution structure (1.4 Å) of this aggregated protein segment, but through an unusual route: the crystals were invisibly small (50-300 nm), below optical wavelength detection. Standard crystallization appeared to produce "amorphous" material, but electron microscopy revealed these were actually nanocrystal clusters.

The structures were solved using micro-electron-diffraction (MicroED), marking the first time completely unknown protein structures were determined by this technique. The core structure revealed expected beta-sheet architecture typical of amyloid proteins, with some unusual water molecule involvement. The authors speculated that natural beta-sheet twisting creates strain limiting crystal growth, making these nanocrystals ideal for MicroED rather than traditional X-ray crystallography.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 MicroED breakthrough with alpha-synuclein nanocrystals proved highly significant for structural biology and Parkinson's disease research:

**Technical Development**: MicroED rapidly evolved from this milestone. By 2018-2020, the technique became more widely adopted, with commercial instrumentation becoming available. The method proved particularly valuable for studying amyloid and membrane protein structures that resist traditional crystallization. Structural biologists began using MicroED routinely for difficult targets, though it complemented rather than replaced X-ray crystallography or traditional cryo-EM.

**Parkinson's Disease Research Impact**: The detailed NACore structure provided critical insights into alpha-synuclein aggregation mechanisms. Subsequent research used this structural information to design aggregation inhibitors and understand how mutations affect disease progression. However, this has not yet translated into approved Parkinson's drugs targeting alpha-synuclein aggregation—despite numerous clinical trials (including those testing aggregation inhibitors), no disease-modifying therapy has reached approval as of 2024. The structural knowledge fed into understanding pathology but has faced the broader challenge that targeting protein aggregation therapeutically remains clinically difficult.

**Business/Scientific Adoption**: The groups involved (UCLA, HHMI, SLAC) continued advancing MicroED technology. Commercial entities like Thermo Fisher began offering MicroED solutions, making the technique accessible. The scientific community now considers MicroED a standard tool for structural biology, though it remains specialized rather than routine for most laboratories.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and implications that can be evaluated:

• **"How many other invisible crystals are out there, waiting to be solved?"** ✓ **ACCURATE**: This proved prescient. Numerous subsequent studies revealed that many proteins form nanocrystals when traditional crystallization fails. MicroED has since determined structures of various challenging targets including membrane proteins, small molecule compounds, and natural products that wouldn't crystallize conventionally.

• **MicroED as a "major milestone for that up-and-coming technique"** ✓ **ACCURATE**: MicroED indeed became an established structural biology method. It's now routinely used alongside X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM, with dedicated sessions at major conferences and specialized facilities worldwide.

• **Implication that understanding alpha-synuclein structure would aid drug development** ⚠ **PARTIAL**: While the structural insights significantly advanced basic research understanding of Parkinson's mechanisms, they have not yet led to approved therapeutics. The fundamental challenge of inhibiting protein aggregation in vivo has proven far more complex than understanding the structures in vitro.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article anticipated a major methodological breakthrough that genuinely transformed structural biology. MicroED became an important technique solving real practical problems in determining protein structures, while the Parkinson's research angle connected to significant disease relevance, even if clinical translation remains ongoing.
