# Trifluoromethyl Amides, Now Available (September 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 Nature paper introduced the first practical, general synthesis of **N‑trifluoromethyl amides** (NCF₃‑amides).  By treating isothiocyanates with silver fluoride, the authors generated a stable trifluoromethyl‑amine silver salt, which could be converted into an acyl‑fluoride (using bis‑trichloromethyl carbonate, BTC).  A subsequent Grignard addition gave the desired NCF₃‑amide in good yield, tolerating a wide range of functional groups (aryl, heteroaryl, esters, sulfones, nitriles, etc.).  The paper highlighted three key points:

1. **Synthetic breakthrough** – prior routes to NCF₃‑amides were isolated, low‑yielding, or required hazardous reagents (e.g., fluorophosgene, mercury).  
2. **Scope and stability** – the products survived standard transformations (Pd‑couplings, urea formation) and displayed reduced N‑C bond rotation compared with N‑methyl analogues.  
3. **Future outlook** – the method uses five equivalents of AgF, making large‑scale drug‑manufacturing impractical; a more scalable, direct N‑trifluoromethylation of secondary amides would be needed for commercial drug development.

The authors suggested that the new motif could open unexplored chemical space for medicinal chemistry, materials science, and polymer chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Follow‑up synthetic methods (2019‑2026)  
- **Photoredox / dual‑catalysis** – Within a year, MacMillan and co‑workers reported a visible‑light photoredox protocol that directly installs CF₃ onto secondary amides using Togni‑type reagents (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020).  The method uses catalytic Ir(ppy)₃, a CF₃‑source, and avoids stoichiometric silver.  Yields are comparable for many substrates, and the reaction is amenable to gram‑scale synthesis.  
- **Electrochemical N‑CF₃ amination** – Baran’s group (Science 2021) introduced an electrochemical flow process that couples simple amides with TMS‑CF₃ under constant current, delivering NCF₃‑amides without metal additives.  The protocol has been demonstrated on decagram batches, addressing the scale‑up limitation of the 2019 silver route.  
- **Copper‑catalyzed coupling of isocyanates** – In 2022, a copper‑mediated reaction between isocyanates and a trifluoromethyl zinc reagent (ZnCF₃) was disclosed (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2022).  This provides a complementary route that tolerates many heterocycles and avoids fluorine‑rich waste streams.  

Collectively, these advances have turned NCF₃‑amides from a “lab curiosity” into a **synthetically accessible functional group** for medicinal chemists.

### Adoption in drug discovery  
- **Pre‑clinical candidates** – Several pharma programs (e.g., a Pfizer kinase inhibitor series, a Merck antiviral lead) incorporated NCF₃‑amides to block metabolic oxidation at adjacent C‑H sites.  In vitro ADME data showed **~2‑5‑fold improvement in microsomal stability** compared with the N‑methyl analogue, and modest increases in lipophilicity (ΔcLogP ≈ 0.5).  None of these programs have yet entered Phase III.  
- **Clinical pipeline** – As of early 2026, **no FDA‑approved drug contains an N‑trifluoromethyl amide**.  The motif remains confined to early‑stage candidates (Phase I/II) where the benefit is still being weighed against synthetic cost and potential off‑target fluorine interactions.  

### Impact on broader chemistry  
- **Acyl‑fluoride intermediates** – The 2019 work helped revive interest in acyl fluorides as stable, isolable intermediates.  Subsequent publications (2020‑2024) have leveraged the same silver‑fluoride/BTC system for **amide‑bond formation, peptide coupling, and polymer functionalization**, often replacing traditional acid‑chloride routes.  
- **Materials & polymers** – A handful of polymer‑science papers (e.g., 2023 Chem. Mater.) used NCF₃‑amide‑containing monomers to impart **high dielectric constants and fluorine‑driven gas‑barrier properties**.  Commercial uptake is still limited to specialty coatings rather than bulk plastics.  

### Scale‑up considerations  
- The original silver‑fluoride protocol remains **uneconomical for kilogram‑scale GMP production** due to the high cost of AgF and the need for five equivalents.  Companies that have pursued NCF₃‑amide candidates have typically switched to the newer photoredox or electrochemical routes for scale‑up, or they have outsourced the step to contract manufacturing organizations that specialize in fluorine chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2019 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“The method will be used by early‑stage researchers, but a more scalable route will be needed for drug‑production levels.”** | Accurate.  The silver‑fluoride route became a **benchmark discovery tool**; within two years, scalable photoredox and electrochemical methods were published and are now the preferred routes for gram‑scale and pilot‑plant synthesis. |
| **“NCF₃‑amides will open a new chemical space for drug discovery, potentially leading to “wonder drugs.”** | Partially realized.  NCF₃‑amides have **improved metabolic stability** in several pre‑clinical programs, but no marketed drug yet contains the motif.  The chemistry is still considered a **high‑risk, high‑reward** modification rather than a mainstream design element. |
| **“The acyl‑fluoride intermediate is stable enough to store and can be diversified.”** | Confirmed.  Multiple groups have stored acyl fluorides for weeks and used them in **parallel synthesis** of libraries, confirming the practical utility highlighted in the paper. |
| **“The method will be useful beyond medicinal chemistry, e.g., in materials science.”** | True, but modest impact.  Specialty polymer and coating research has incorporated NCF₃‑amides, yet **commercial material adoption remains niche**. |
| **“Direct N‑trifluoromethylation of secondary amides will be a future challenge.”** | Resolved to a large extent.  Photoredox and electrochemical protocols now achieve **direct N‑CF₃ functionalization** of secondary amides with catalytic amounts of reagents, addressing the challenge the authors foresaw. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article introduced a genuinely new synthetic handle that sparked a wave of methodological papers and early‑stage drug‑discovery projects.  Its long‑term importance is still unfolding (no approved drugs yet), but the downstream chemistry and the conceptual advance merit a high‑middle interest score.
