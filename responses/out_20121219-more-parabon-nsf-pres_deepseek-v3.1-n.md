# More on the Parabon NSF Press Release (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post documents a dispute between the author (a drug discovery scientist) and Josh Chamot, a National Science Foundation (NSF) media officer, regarding an NSF press release about Parabon, a company developing DNA-based nanostructures for drug delivery. The author had previously criticized the press release as overhyped and scientifically implausible to drug discovery professionals. 

Chamot defended the press release, stating that Parabon had received both Phase I and Phase II NSF small business funding through competitive peer review, making the research a "valid starting point." He emphasized that the press release was intended as an alert for journalists who should follow up with the researchers for deeper information, not as a comprehensive scientific communication. The author countered that in the modern era, press releases are often directly consumed by the public and specialists without journalistic filtering, necessitating greater accuracy and transparency from the start. The core tension was between the NSF's traditional press-release-to-journalist pipeline and the author's view that direct public access requires higher standards of scientific communication.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2012 controversy, Parabon continued developing its "Computational DNA NanoArray" technology for targeted drug delivery. The company pivoted toward government and defense applications rather than mainstream pharmaceutical drug development.

**Clinical and Commercial Impact**: Parabon did not successfully develop FDA-approved drugs using their DNA nanostructure platform for the pharmaceutical market. The technology did not become widely adopted among drug discovery scientists, and no major drugs using this approach entered clinical trials or achieved patient use in the following decade.

**Business and Funding Trajectory**: Parabon shifted focus to bio-surveillance and forensic applications. The company received contracts from defense and intelligence agencies, including work with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). By 2015-2017, they were primarily promoting their DNA technology for law enforcement applications rather than drug delivery. The company continued operating but never achieved significant commercial success in pharmaceuticals.

**Technology Adoption**: The specific approach described in the 2012 press release—using computational design of DNA nanostructures for precise drug delivery—did not become a mainstream or widely adopted method in biotechnology. While DNA nanotechnology research continued in academic settings, it did not translate into approved therapeutic products in the subsequent decade.

**Policy and Communication**: This incident highlighted ongoing tensions in science communication between traditional institutional press release practices and emerging direct-to-public communication through blogs and social media. However, it did not lead to significant policy changes at NSF or other funding agencies regarding press release standards.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments, but rather documented differing perspectives on appropriate scientific communication practices and the validity of Parabon's claims.

However, the underlying assumption in Chamot's defense was that Parabon's NSF-funded research would prove valuable and that journalists would properly vet the claims through follow-up reporting:

- **Chamot's implied prediction**: Parabon's peer-reviewed, NSF-funded research represented valid and exciting science that would withstand scrutiny → **Outcome**: Parabon did not achieve commercial success in drug delivery, and the technology did not advance to clinical applications as implied in the press materials.

- **The author's implied concern**: The hype would mislead without delivering practical results → **Outcome**: This concern proved justified, as the technology never produced the drug delivery breakthroughs suggested in the press release.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 2**

This article represents a relatively minor dispute about science communication practices rather than substantive scientific advancement. While it illustrates important issues about institutional credibility and press release standards, it did not involve breakthrough science or have lasting impact on biotechnology development.
