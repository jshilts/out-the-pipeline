# Article Title (Month Year)
# Come One, Come All to These Kinases (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a study analyzing kinase inhibitor selectivity patterns across 398 kinase enzymes, identifying a cluster of eight kinases that bind unusually high numbers of inhibitors (mean of 99 compounds versus 17 for typical kinases). These "promiscuous" kinases, including YSK4 and DDR1, were found to preferentially adopt the DFG-out conformation—normally considered less stable than the catalytically active DFG-in conformation—due to a stabilizing salt bridge in their structure. This structural feature enables them to bind a wide range of inhibitors, even though they were not necessarily the targets of extensive drug discovery campaigns.

The key finding challenges traditional assumptions about kinase classification: these promiscuous kinases are scattered across the conventional kinome phylogenetic tree rather than clustering together by sequence homology, suggesting convergent evolution of this structural motif independent of sequence relatedness. The article emphasizes that while this promiscuity makes finding starting points for drug development easier, it doesn't preclude achieving selectivity for individual kinases within this group.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2019 publication, the implications of DFG-out stabilized kinases have continued to influence both basic kinase biology and drug discovery strategy. However, progress has been more complex than simple therapeutic breakthroughs:

**Drug Development Outcomes:**
- **DDR1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor 1)**: Multiple DDR1 inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials, including compounds from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim. While some showed antifibrotic effects in animal models, clinical validation has remained challenging. DDR1 remains an important research target given its role in fibrotic diseases.
- **YSK4**: Research interest continued, but without major clinical breakthroughs as of current knowledge.
- The general finding has informed how pharmaceutical companies approach "difficult" kinases and validated computational structural biology approaches to predicting kinase-inhibitor interactions.

**Scientific Impact:**
- Subsequent structural studies corroborated the finding of convergent evolution in kinase structural motifs
- Improved understanding of regulatory mechanisms governing kinase conformations
- Enhanced computational models incorporating structural features beyond sequence homology

The fundamental insight—that structural properties can override sequence-based predictions—has endured, though translation into approved drugs has followed typical timelines and attrition rates for kinase inhibitor development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Explicit and Implicit Predictions in the Article:**

• **"finding starting points for such chemical matter is going to be relatively easy"**
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate for DDR1 and similar kinases. A reasonable amount of drug discovery has occurred, and multiple inhibitors have been developed. However, "relatively easy" chemical starting points did not translate into easy drug approval, as clinical success depends on many factors beyond initial binding.

• **Implicit: These kinases would receive greater research and drug discovery attention**
  - **Outcome**: Moderate. DDR1 has seen substantial research, but these kinases did not become pharmaceutical "superstars" like EGFR or BRAF, likely because they target more niche indications.

• **Implicit: The structural insights would improve kinase inhibitor discovery**
  - **Outcome**: True. The general understanding of DFG-out conformations has become integrated into structure-based drug design, though specific therapeutic breakthroughs remain limited by broader challenges in drug development.

• **Implicit: The kinome tree might be supplemented by structural clustering**
  - **Outcome**: Puzzling. I don't have confident information on whether kinase classification schemes have extensively incorporated this insight.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article identifies a clear and important biochemical insight about kinase structural variation and inhibitor selectivity, while the implications for drug discovery proved real but niche, looking at DDR1 outcomes. The finding influenced thinking about kinase classification and drug design, but did not produce major therapeutic breakthroughs of broad impact. Slightly above average within the context of kinase drug discovery research.
