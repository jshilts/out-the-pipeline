# Things I Won't Work With: Dimethylcadmium (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a vividly written safety commentary warning against working with dimethylcadmium, an organocadmium compound. The author describes it as an extremely hazardous substance, detailing how it is highly toxic upon inhalation, produces poisonous cadmium oxide smoke, can ignite spontaneously to form friction-sensitive explosive peroxides, and even reacts violently with water in explosive bursts. Key risks highlighted include severe lung, liver, kidney, and nervous system toxicity, carcinogenicity, and high vapor pressure. The article notes dimethylcadmium was historically used in textbooks for synthesizing methyl ketones from acid chlorides but was already largely obsolete, with safer alternative reagents available. It remains used only at small research scales for making exotic photosensitive and semiconducting materials, and even those practitioners desire alternatives given the extreme handling risks and high cost.

## 2. HISTORY

This section cannot be completed with confidence. The available text is a safety commentary about a hazardous chemical rather than an article about biotechnology developments, drug pipelines, regulatory policy, or business trends. No specific drugs, clinical trials, companies, or regulatory actions are mentioned that could be tracked for historical outcomes. Dimethylcadmium is described as a niche research reagent with declining use, so there are no obvious downstream medical or commercial developments to verify.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This section cannot be completed with confidence. The original article does not contain forward-looking predictions about biotechnology, drug approval, technology adoption, or market growth. It focuses entirely on describing the hazards of dimethylcadmium and its limited, undesirable role in research chemistry. Without explicit predictions, there is nothing to evaluate against later empirical outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article is not relevant to biotechnology developments or analysis of the biotechnology industry and falls completely outside the scope of the requested task.

**Note:** The PROMPT_TEMPLATE instructs analysis of "a commentary article that appeared several years ago about the biotechnology industry." However, the provided article is a chemistry safety commentary about a hazardous laboratory reagent (dimethylcadmium) and contains no discussion of biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, medical treatments, or industry trends. It appears to be entirely off-topic for the requested analysis framework.
