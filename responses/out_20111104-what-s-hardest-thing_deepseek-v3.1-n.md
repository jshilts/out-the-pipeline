# What's the Hardest Thing? (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2011 commentary reflects on the challenges of communicating scientific concepts to non-specialists, particularly in drug discovery. The author identifies two broad categories of difficulty: (1) communicating multiple interconnected concepts simultaneously (PK/absorption, metabolism, molecular properties, selectivity, toxicology), exemplified by the challenge of explaining how "the dose makes the poison" using selenium as an example where an essential nutrient can also be toxic; and (2) conveying the vast amount of unknowns in science, especially in toxicology where people expect definitive answers about drug safety. The author emphasizes that biological systems are fundamentally more complex than everyday objects—not just in degree but in kind—making meaningful explanations difficult.

## 2. HISTORY
The communication challenges identified in 2011 have persisted and evolved over the subsequent decade, amplified by major events that brought science communication into the public spotlight:

**The Communication Gap Widened:** The 2011 concerns about explaining scientific uncertainty became prescient during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023), when the public struggled to understand why scientific guidance evolved as new data emerged. The challenge of explaining "what we don't know" became a central issue in public health communication.

**Evidence of Persistent Challenges:** Surveys from 2012-2022 consistently showed widespread scientific illiteracy. For example, a 2014 NSF survey found only 74% of Americans knew the Earth revolves around the sun, and surveys during the pandemic revealed significant misunderstanding of concepts like vaccine efficacy and viral transmission.

**Selenium Context:** Scientific understanding of selenium's dual role advanced—research through the 2010s refined understanding of its narrow therapeutic window and role in selenoprotein synthesis. However, public understanding remained limited, with dietary supplements and misinformation continuing to present risks.

**Technology Communication Evolution:** The article mentions NMR imaging as difficult to explain. By 2020-2023, advances in AI-driven medical imaging (including improvements in MRI/NMR technology) made explanations even more complex as laypeople encountered terms like "machine learning," "neural networks," and "deep learning" in medical contexts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article made no explicit predictions about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

The article demonstrates long-term relevance—its core insight about scientific communication challenges became critically important during major public health crises, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, validating the author's concern about conveying scientific uncertainty to the public.
