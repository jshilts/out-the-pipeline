# Making the Numbers Confess (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The MarketWatch commentary reported that Apricus Biosciences had **re‑analyzed** data from its U.S. Phase‑III trials of **Mycova™** (later marketed as Mycovan™), a topical treatment for onychomycosis (nail fungus). The original trials had failed to meet their primary endpoint of a mycological cure. By applying “extreme post‑hoc data mining,” Apricus claimed that a subset of patients did achieve cure rates that were statistically significant, and the company suggested that the drug was therefore effective and could be brought to market. The article highlighted the controversy: critics argued that such post‑hoc subgroup analyses are statistically unreliable and can be misleading.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome** – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration never approved Mycova/Mycovan. In early 2012 Apricus announced that it would **discontinue development** of the nail‑fungus program, citing the inability to generate a convincing, prospectively defined efficacy signal. The company’s 2012 10‑K listed the Mycova program as a “failed” asset and wrote down the associated R&D expense.

**Business impact** – The nail‑fungus effort represented a sizable portion of Apricus’s early pipeline, but its termination had limited financial fallout because the program had already been heavily written off. Apricus subsequently shifted focus to its **Vitaros®** (topical alprostadil) for erectile dysfunction, which received **FDA approval in 2015** and became the company’s primary commercial product. The company also pursued a topical testosterone gel (Tidal) that was later discontinued.

**Scientific relevance** – The Mycova episode is now frequently cited in discussions of **post‑hoc data mining** and the dangers of “p‑hacking” in clinical trials. No subsequent independent studies have validated the subgroup findings reported by Apricus, and the drug never entered clinical practice. The broader field of onychomycosis treatment continued to be dominated by oral terbinafine, itraconazole, and newer topical agents (e.g., efinaconazole, tavaborole) that achieved FDA approval through prospectively designed trials.

**Industry lessons** – The case reinforced the FDA’s emphasis on **pre‑specified statistical analysis plans** and contributed to tighter scrutiny of companies that attempt to salvage failed trials through retrospective subgroup analyses. It also underscored the importance of **transparent data sharing**; Apricus eventually released the raw trial data to the FDA, which found the post‑hoc claims insufficient for approval.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
*The original article did not list explicit forecasts, but the surrounding press releases implied several expectations:*

- **Prediction:** The post‑hoc reanalysis would convince regulators that Mycova was effective, leading to FDA approval and commercial launch.  
  **Outcome:** **Did not happen.** The FDA required a new, prospectively designed trial; Apricus abandoned the program in 2012.

- **Prediction:** The “extreme post‑hoc” results would generate strong market enthusiasm and boost Apricus’s stock price.  
  **Outcome:** **Partially true in the short term** – the announcement caused a brief share‑price uptick, but the subsequent failure to obtain approval erased the gain and the stock later fell.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The analytical approach could become a model for rescuing other borderline‑positive trials.  
  **Outcome:** **Not adopted** as a standard practice; regulators and investors remain skeptical of post‑hoc subgroup claims without prospective validation.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **4/10**  
The story is a useful cautionary tale about statistical misuse in drug development, but the drug itself never reached patients and the episode had limited lasting impact on the biotech industry.
