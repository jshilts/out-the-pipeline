# The Cost of New Drugs (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article summarizes Bernard Munos' analysis of pharmaceutical industry productivity, focusing on the economics of drug development. The key findings presented are:

- The cost of bringing a new drug to market has been increasing at **13.4% annually** since the 1950s, with cost estimates forming an almost perfectly linear log plot over time
- Large pharmaceutical company R&D spending grew at over 12% annually since 1970, suggesting some efficiency improvements as New Molecular Entity (NME) output remained roughly linear
- **Less than one-third of the industry** achieves costs per NME under $1 billion, with some companies spending substantially more
- The probability of any new drug becoming a blockbuster (≥$1 billion annual sales) remains steady at **about 20%**
- Despite widespread industry complaints about regulatory burdens, evidence suggests that stringent regulatory requirements (like FDA standards) may actually **stimulate innovation and competitiveness** rather than hinder it

## 2. HISTORY

### Cost Trajectory Validated and Accelerated

Following 2009, the **$1 billion per drug cost figure became well-established** in industry discourse, though the underlying methodology (which includes opportunity costs and failed compounds) continued to be debated. By the 2010s, multiple analyses confirmed Munos' findings, with Tufts Center for Drug Development Research publishing influential studies showing costs reaching $2.6-2.8 billion per approved drug when accounting for post-approval R&D and failures.

The **13.4% annual cost inflation persisted through the 2010s**, driven by:
- Increasing clinical trial complexity
- Greater regulatory requirements for safety monitoring
- Larger patient populations needed for statistical power
- Expansion into more difficult disease areas (Alzheimer's, rare diseases, oncology)

### Blockbuster Model Under Stress

The **20% blockbuster probability** proved resilient but masked major shifts. Several developments challenged this model:

- **Patent cliffs**: Major drugs like Lipitor (2011), Plavix (2012), and Nexium (2014) lost patent protection, eliminating tens of billions in annual revenue
- **Generic competition intensified**, with 80-90% price drops common within months of patent expiration
- **Payor pressure increased**, with pharmacy benefit managers and insurers demanding greater value demonstrations
- While some companies successfully launched new blockbusters (Keytruda, Opdivo, Humira biosimilars), the **pipeline reliability** Munos noted remained problematic

### Regulatory Environment Evolution

The **FDA's role as innovation driver** that Munos highlighted continued evolving:

- **Breakthrough Therapy Designation** (2012) accelerated approval pathways for serious conditions
- **21st Century Cures Act** (2016) further streamlined regulatory processes
- However, **safety requirements continued tightening**, particularly after drug withdrawals and Black Box warnings
- **FDA approval times** improved markedly, but post-marketing surveillance requirements expanded significantly
- The **European Medicines Agency** (EMA) faced challenges post-2009, with Brexit creating regulatory fragmentation

### Industry Restructuring

Pharmaceutical companies responded to these cost pressures through:

- **Massive mergers and acquisitions**: Pfizer-Wyeth (2009), Merck-Schering-Plough (2009), Roche-Genentech (2009), Teva-Cephalon (2011)
- **R&D restructuring**: Major companies closed research sites and narrowed therapeutic focus
- **Outsourcing expansion**: Clinical research organizations (CROs) grew dramatically
- **Biotech partnerships increased**, with large pharma relying more on external innovation

### Therapeutic Area Shift

The industry shifted focus toward:
- **Specialty drugs and biologics** (higher cost, smaller patient populations)
- **Oncology** became the dominant therapeutic area by R&D investment
- **Rare diseases** attracted attention due to regulatory incentives and premium pricing
- **Gene and cell therapies** emerged as a new frontier, with costs per patient reaching millions

### COVID-19 Impact

The **2020-2022 pandemic** dramatically demonstrated both the industry's capabilities and cost structure:

- **Operation Warp Speed** produced vaccines with unprecedented speed and cost
- **mRNA technology** validated for the first time commercially
- However, the **footprint of traditional drug development costs** remained evident in non-pandemic areas
- Supply chain vulnerabilities prompted calls for **reshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing**

## 3. PREDICTIONS

### Munos' Implicit Predictions (Evaluated Against Subsequent Developments)

**Prediction: Continued cost escalation at ~13.4% annually**
- **Accuracy: Mixed**. While R&D costs continued rising through the 2010s, the rate appears to have moderated somewhat, particularly as companies adopted more efficient trial designs and biomarker strategies. However, the fundamental trend of increasing costs per approved drug remained intact.

**Prediction: Blockbuster odds remaining ~20%**
- **Accuracy: Broadly correct**. The blockbuster model persisted, but with important caveats. Success became more concentrated in specific therapeutic areas (oncology, immunology) and modalities (biologics, cell therapy). The definition of "blockbuster" also evolved with smaller patient populations and higher prices in specialty areas.

**Prediction: Most companies facing >$1 billion cost per NME**
- **Accuracy: Validated**. By the mid-2010s, the $1+ billion figure was widely accepted and even conservative for complex biologics and specialty drugs. Some orphan drugs and gene therapies now cost far more.

**Prediction: Stringent regulation favoring innovation**
- **Accuracy: Partially validated**. The correlation observed by Munos held, with the US maintaining leadership in pharmaceutical innovation. However, regulatory convergence globally and the rise of China's regulatory system (NMPA) as increasingly sophisticated challenged the simple dichotomy between "stringent" and "permissive" systems. **Access considerations** grew in importance beyond purely regulatory standards.

**Prediction: Industry structure implications unclear but concerning**
- **Accuracy: Prescient**. The industry underwent massive consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, rationalization of R&D portfolios, and greater reliance on external innovation. The sustainability question Munos raised remained unresolved, with ongoing debates about **pipeline productivity** and appropriate pricing models.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article provided a data-driven foundation for understanding pharmaceutical R&D economics that remained relevant for over a decade. Munos' analysis accurately identified persistent trends in cost escalation and productivity challenges that continued shaping industry strategy. The regulatory insights proved particularly insightful, predicting the complex relationship between stringent standards and innovation leadership. While the specific numerical estimates evolved, the fundamental structural issues highlighted—cost trajectory, blockbuster dependency, regulatory paradox—captured enduring characteristics of drug development economics.
