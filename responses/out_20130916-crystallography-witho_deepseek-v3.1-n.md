# Crystallography Without Crystallizing: An Update

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary discusses the progress and limitations of an innovative X-ray crystallography technique published in Nature that year. The method involved soaking test substances into metal-organic-framework (MOF) lattices, which created enough repeating order for X-ray diffraction without requiring the substance itself to be crystalline.

The original paper's most remarkable achievement was determining the structure of the natural product miyakosyne A—a compound that cannot be crystallized—including assignment of its absolute stereochemistry using heavy atoms in the MOF lattice for anomalous dispersion effects. However, the article reports that this stereochemistry determination had just been withdrawn through a Nature correction due to "previously unnoticed ambiguities" in the data and "non-negligible disorder" in the molecular structure. While the chemical structure determination remained valid, the stereochemical assignment was incorrect.

The author notes that other structures reported in the original paper were not called into question and that several research groups had successfully reproduced the small molecule structures. However, the commentary raises concerns about the method's limitations, noting the absence from the original paper of basic amines and nitrogen heterocycles—two compound classes critically important to medicinal and natural products chemistry—and reporting that numerous attempts to apply the MOF technique to such structures had been unsuccessful.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 commentary, the MOF-based crystallography technique the author discussed has **not** become widely adopted in drug discovery or natural products chemistry. The field's trajectory reveals why the author's caution was well-founded.

The most significant subsequent development was the **continued evolution and refinement of Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)** as the primary alternative to traditional X-ray crystallography. Between 2015 and 2020, Cryo-EM underwent dramatic improvements in resolution and automation, with single-particle Cryo-EM routinely achieving near-atomic resolution (<3 Å). The 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, and Richard Henderson for Cryo-EM development underscored this methodological triumph.

For natural products chemistry and drug discovery, **computational methods** increasingly complemented experimental structure determination. Advances in NMR spectroscopy, particularly high-field instruments and new pulse sequences, continued to provide critical structural information for compounds that resisted crystallization. The combination of 2D-NMR techniques, computational chemistry, and selective derivatization remained the standard approach for stereochemical assignments in complex natural products.

**Structural genomics** initiatives and fragment-based drug discovery platforms continued relying heavily on traditional X-ray crystallography, investing significant effort in optimizing crystallization conditions rather than pursuing MOF-based alternatives. The development of automated crystallization platforms, crystal dehydration methods, and specialized crystallization screens (such as commercial kits from companies like Molecular Dimensions and Rigaku) addressed the crystallization bottleneck through systematic optimization rather than bypassing crystallization entirely.

Several pharmaceutical companies and academic structural biology groups continued publishing improvements to traditional crystallographic methods while investing in Cryo-EM infrastructure. The structural determination capabilities available in major pharma companies by 2020 emphasized traditional X-ray crystallography infrastructure supplemented by Cryo-EM, rather than MOF-based approaches.

The natural product **miyakosyne A** mentioned in the article does not appear to have become a major drug target or therapeutic agent in subsequent years, based on pharmaceutical development pipelines and clinical trial databases. The compound's structural complexity and limited availability likely contributed to this outcome, independent of the crystallography methodology used to determine its structure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions about the future trajectory of the MOF-based crystallography technique:

• **Prediction: The technique would prove generalizable to nitrogen-containing compounds** (amines, nitrogen heterocycles)
  - *Outcome*: **This did not happen.** The technique did not become widely applicable to the compound classes most important to drug discovery. The author's caution about the method's limited generality was prescient.

• **Prediction: Further investigation of different MOF structures would extend the method's versatility**
  - *Outcome*: **Limited success.** While research on MOFs continued in materials science contexts, the specific application to crystallography of non-crystalline compounds did not become a major research direction generating numerous publications or widespread adoption.

• **Implicit prediction: The technique might become widely useful for natural products and drug discovery**
  - *Outcome*: **This did not materialize.** The method did not enter mainstream use in pharmaceutical companies or academic natural products laboratories as a routine structure determination tool.

• **Prediction by omission: Traditional crystallization challenges would remain a bottleneck**
  - *Outcome*: **This proved true**, but the solution came from different directions. Cryo-EM emerged as the major breakthrough for structure determination of non-crystalline biological samples, while traditional crystallography continued improving through automation and systematic screens.

From a broader perspective, the prediction that **no single crystallography bypass technique would dominate** proved accurate. Instead, the field diversified: Cryo-EM for large complexes and membrane proteins, traditional crystallography for smaller molecules with optimization, NMR for solution-state analysis, and computational methods for integration and verification.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article is interesting because it captures a moment of cautious reassessment of what initially appeared to be a breakthrough technique, providing insight into how scientific methods often face practical limitations that aren't apparent in initial high-profile publications. It demonstrates the scientific process working through replication attempts and correction mechanisms.
