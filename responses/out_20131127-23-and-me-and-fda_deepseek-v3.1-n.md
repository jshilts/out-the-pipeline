# 23 And Me And the FDA (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the FDA's November 2013 warning letter ordering 23andMe to immediately stop selling its direct-to-consumer DNA testing service. The author presents two competing viewpoints on the controversy: the "practical view" (represented by Matthew Herper) that 23andMe brought this on themselves by failing to communicate with the FDA since May 2013 despite years of regulatory discussions, and the "idealistic view" (from economist Alex Tabarrok) that the FDA was overreaching by wanting to regulate genetic tests as high-risk medical devices requiring clinical validity proofs rather than just analytical validity under existing CLIA regulations. The author acknowledges merits in both perspectives while noting that 23andMe's explicit health benefit claims (marketing the test for "254 diseases and conditions" including as "first step in prevention" for diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer) inevitably triggered FDA jurisdiction. The piece also speculates that 23andMe might have avoided regulatory trouble by marketing differently or that their aggressive stance might indicate disappointing results from their population genomics research.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2013 FDA halt, 23andMe spent years working toward regulatory compliance. In February 2015, the company received FDA authorization for its first direct-to-consumer genetic test for Bloom syndrome carrier status. This marked a significant shift in regulatory approach, establishing a precedent for DTC genetic health risk tests. By April 2017, the FDA granted 23andMe authorization to market genetic health risk tests for 10 conditions including Parkinson's and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The breakthrough came through the FDA's de novo classification pathway, which created a regulatory framework for similar DTC genetic tests.

The company's business model evolved substantially post-2013. While initially focused on health reports, 23andMe dramatically expanded its therapeutic development efforts. In 2018, the company launched 23andMe Therapeutics to develop drugs based on genetic insights from its database. More significantly, 23andMe began generating substantial revenue through pharmaceutical partnerships, including a $300 million collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline announced in July 2018, followed by an expanded $1 billion partnership in 2023. These deals gave pharmaceutical companies access to 23andMe's genetic database for drug target identification and clinical trial recruitment.

The personal genomics market continued growing despite early regulatory hurdles. By 2021, 23andMe had over 12 million customers, with competitors like AncestryDNA also expanding aggressively. The company went public via SPAC merger in June 2021 at a $3.5 billion valuation. However, challenges remained: the company faced criticism for data privacy practices and its business model's dependence on selling data access, while the clinical utility of many genetic risk markers continued to be debated within the medical community.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction that 23andMe could have avoided FDA trouble by using "neutral language" instead of medical benefit claims**: This proved partially correct. The FDA eventually created regulatory pathways for DTC genetic tests, but companies still needed to demonstrate clinical validity through extensive validation studies, suggesting that merely changing language wouldn't have solved the underlying regulatory requirements. The successful later-approached products still required substantial clinical evidence.
  
- **Implication that 23andMe's aggressive stance might indicate disappointing research results**: This appears to have been inaccurate. 23andMe's genetic database became increasingly valuable for pharmaceutical research, leading to major partnerships worth over $1 billion with companies like GSK. The database's size and genetic diversity became significant assets, contradicting the speculation that "nothing good has popped up yet."

- **Tabarrok's concern that clinical validity requirements would be the "death-knell" for such products**: This prediction was overly pessimistic. While clinical validity requirements did increase costs and development time significantly (it took nearly 4 years for 23andMe to get FDA clearance), the regulatory pathway was ultimately established and the industry adapted to meet these standards, leading to an expanding market rather than industry demise.

## 4. INTEREST 
**Score: 7**

This article captures a pivotal regulatory moment that fundamentally shaped the direct-to-consumer genetic testing industry. The 2013 FDA-23andMe confrontation established precedents that influenced how genetic data is regulated, commercialized, and integrated into healthcare, with implications extending far beyond a single company's regulatory compliance.
