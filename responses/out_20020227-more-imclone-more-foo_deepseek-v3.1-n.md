# More Imclone, More Food for Thought (February 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses ImClone Systems' regulatory setback after the FDA declined to approve their cancer drug candidate (which would become Erbitux/Cetuximab) without additional clinical data. The FDA agreed to consider a resubmission if ImClone could provide more data from Merck KGaA's European trials along with clarification of their own numbers. However, this meant at least a year's delay in bringing the drug to market, potentially allowing competing therapies targeting the same epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to catch up. The author defends the FDA's decision, arguing that ImClone and their partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (who paid $2 billion for 40% of the drug's profits) chose to conduct the "shortest, smallest trial they possibly could get away with," and that the regulatory standards were well-established. The article also mentions the author's short position on ImClone stock and reflects on the broader implications for cancer patients who needed the treatment urgently.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2002 FDA rejection, ImClone did eventually succeed in gaining approval for Erbitux (cetuximab). The drug received FDA approval in February 2004 for use in metastatic colorectal cancer, specifically for patients whose tumors expressed EGFR and who had failed prior irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Over subsequent years, Erbitux gained additional FDA approvals as both a first-line and second-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.

Multiple competing EGFR inhibitors did enter the market as predicted. Small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors including gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) gained approvals in the mid-2000s. Additionally, other monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR pathways emerged.

The business implications were significant. The year-long delay created substantial challenges for both ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb. This regulatory setback occurred during the broader ImClone scandal involving insider trading by company executives, which further complicated the drug's path to market.

Erbitux became an important cancer treatment option, but it never achieved the blockbuster status anticipated when Bristol-Myers Squibb made its substantial investment, partly due to the competitive landscape that emerged during the approval delays. The drug established a solid place in oncology treatment protocols, particularly for colorectal and head and neck cancers, but the competitive dynamics predicted in the article largely materialized.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions made:**
- The drug would be delayed at least a year due to need for additional European data
- Competing therapies targeting EGFR would catch up during the delay  
- Small molecule EGFR inhibitors would potentially offer advantages in production cost and convenience
- The competitive landscape would intensify
- Bristol-Myers Squibb might struggle to recoup their $2 billion investment

**Outcomes:**
✓ **Accurate**: The drug was indeed delayed, receiving approval in February 2004 (about two years later)  
✓ **Accurate**: Multiple competing EGFR inhibitors entered the market, including gefitinib (approved 2003) and erlotinib (approved 2004)  
✓ **Accurate**: Small molecule inhibitors proved competitive and often offered oral administration advantages, though monoclonal antibodies like Erbitux maintained a role in certain cancers  
✓ **Accurate**: The competitive landscape became quite crowded, though different mechanisms found niche applications  
✓ **Accurate**: While Erbitux achieved market success, the intense competition and delay likely limited returns on the massive BMS investment

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article demonstrates sharp insight into drug development dynamics and regulatory realities, with accurate predictions about competitive pressures. However, it primarily captures a moment in a single company's regulatory journey, with limited broader scientific implications.
