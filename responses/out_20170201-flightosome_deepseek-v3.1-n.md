# The Flightosome (Feb 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a diagram from biologist Arjun Raj's Twitter feed that satirically depicts how much we truly understand about important biological systems - represented by the "flightosome", a deliberately unhelpful name that reflects many real biological terms that sound impressive but convey little mechanistic understanding. The author acknowledges this as a painfully accurate representation of biology's current state, referencing the famous "Can A Biologist Fix a Radio?" paper and efforts to simulate brain function or reverse-engineer computer chips using molecular biology approaches. The piece explores the tension between two extreme views: engineers who dismiss biological research as "descriptive crap" that lacks systematic engineering principles, versus those who claim massive data collection alone will solve everything without deeper insight. The author concludes that both perspectives are inadequate - biology needs both extensive empirical data AND conceptual insight, though gathering facts is difficult and achieving genuine understanding is even harder.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2017 article, several relevant developments occurred:

**Scientific Methodology Evolution**: The period 2017-2024 saw massive expansion of single-cell genomics, proteomics, and multi-omics approaches that indeed generated "piles of facts" on an unprecedented scale - exactly the data-gathering approach the author described. Technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing became routine, generating petabytes of descriptive biological data.

**AI/ML Integration**: Machine learning and AI became increasingly integrated into biological research, attempting to bridge the gap between "descriptive bean-tallying" and systematic understanding. AlphaFold's protein structure predictions (2020-2021) exemplified this - combining massive structural data with deep learning to achieve predictive power that exceeded decades of traditional structural biology.

**Precision Medicine Implementation**: Large-scale genomic databases (UK Biobank, All of Us) were built following this period, representing the ultimate manifestation of the "lots more data, much faster" approach. However, translating these databases into actionable precision medicine has proved slower and more difficult than initially hoped, largely confirming the author's skepticism about data collection alone being sufficient.

**Cellular Engineering Advances**: CAR-T cell therapy became FDA-approved and clinically successful during this period, representing a case where engineering principles were successfully applied to biology, partially answering the "Can a biologist fix a radio?" challenge. Similarly, CRISPR gene editing moved from experimental tool to clinical reality, though with notable limitations and continuing safety concerns.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself made few explicit predictions, but expressed implicit expectations:

- **Implicit expectation**: That simply collecting more descriptive biological data wouldn't automatically lead to deeper understanding
  - **Reality**: Partially validated. Despite massive data accumulation through omics technologies, fundamental mechanistic understanding has progressed more slowly than data generation, though ML approaches are beginning to bridge this gap

- **Implicit skepticism**: About whether systematic, engineering-style thinking could be readily applied to biology
  - **Reality**: Mixed results. While synthetic biology and cellular engineering have had successes (CAR-T, some metabolic engineering), the complexity and context-dependency of biological systems continues to frustrate purely reductionist approaches

- **Implicit assumption**: That the tension between "descriptive" and "systematic" approaches would persist
  - **Reality**: Validated. This dichotomy continues to characterize biological research, though increasingly sophisticated computational tools are helping to integrate both approaches

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article captured a fundamental tension in biological research that has become even more relevant with the explosion of big data in biology. It identified the central challenge of integrating massive empirical datasets with mechanistic understanding - a problem that remains largely unsolved and has shaped research directions and funding priorities in the intervening years. The core insight about needing both facts AND insight remains prescient.
