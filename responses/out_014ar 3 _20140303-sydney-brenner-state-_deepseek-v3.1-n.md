# Retrospective Critique: Sydney Brenner’s 2014 Jeremiad on the State of Science

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 *Science* piece relays a characteristically blunt interview with Sydney Brenner, who excoriates the modern scientific enterprise on two fronts: how it trains and manages scientists, and how it vets and disseminates research. He lambasts the U.S. graduate and postdoctoral system as a form of “slavery” and “indentured labour,” arguing that fear and performance pressure crush intellectual independence, leaving young researchers unable to formulate and pursue their own ideas. Brenner contends that tight-fisted, risk-averse funders demand preliminary data that “will work,” forcing investigators onto the “straight and narrow” and stifling high-risk, long-term exploration of the kind exemplified by Fred Sanger, who would be deemed “unproductive” and defunded by today’s metrics.

On publishing, Brenner brands peer review a “completely corrupt system” that “hinders science,” viewing it as a regression to the mean and a moral hazard. He argues that scientists have abdicated judgment to journal editors and publishers—profit-driven “giant organisations”—with universities gatekeeping careers by demanding publications in “okay places” (high-impact journals). The picture is one of a sclerotic, commercialized, and bureaucratized research culture that systematically weeds out creativity, risk, and intellectual independence.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade-plus since the interview, the themes Brenner spotlighted have persisted, deepened, and catalyzed organized reform movements, though far-reaching structural change remains elusive.

**Funding, Risk, and Slow Science**
- Sustained pressure on public research budgets has kept conservatism high; agencies still favor low-risk proposals with strong preliminary data.
- In response, “slow science” and high-risk funding initiatives have gained visibility. Programs such as the NIH Director’s Pioneer/Transformative Research Awards, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator model (which emphasizes people over projects), and the ERC’s Synergy and Advanced Grants explicitly seek to fund long-term, exploratory work. Private funders (e.g., the Moore, Simons, and Templeton foundations, and now Schmidt Sciences) have played a similar role. Even so, these remain small fractions of overall funding, with mainstream R01/PI panels still trending conservative and proposal success rates remaining low.
- The “safe spaces” for failed experiments and negative results have slowly grown via dedicated journals and platforms (e.g., *JNeurosci*’s “negative results” section, *PLOS*, *eLife*, and journals like *F1000Research* using post-publication review), but they have not displaced the prestige hierarchy of the high-impact journals.

**Academic Labor and Training**
- Graduate-student and postdoc unions have become more widespread in the U.S., with successful organizing at major universities and national labs; some of these have produced gains in stipends, benefits, and workplace protections, challenging the “indentured” status Brenner decried. Movements to limit “postdoc years” (e.g., to five years) have also gained ground institutionally.
- Yet, hyper-competition and precarious employment remain pervasive. The academic job market has not meaningfully expanded, so many early-career researchers still face a lengthy “holding pattern” with meager pay and uncertain prospects, reinforcing Brenner’s diagnosis of a system built on cheap, contingent labor.
- High-profile critiques and reports (e.g., NASEM’s *The Next Generation of Biomedical and Behavioral Sciences Researchers*, known as the “Ginther report”) spotlight persistent inequities and precarity, validating concerns about the training pipeline.

**Scientific Publishing and Peer Review**
- The open-access (OA) movement has accelerated. Transformative agreements have spread across Europe and globally, and funder policies (Plan S) now mandate OA to publicly funded research. Preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv) have become mainstream, decoupling rapid dissemination from gatekeeping review.
- New publishing models (e.g., *eLife*’s shift to editorial “review as assessment” without accept/reject, and platforms like *PLOS*) have loosened editorial control, allowing peer review to take place post-publication or in a more consultative, non-performative mode. However, the high-impact journal “brand” remains powerful in hiring, tenure, and funding assessments, retaining the moral hazard Brenner identified.
- Organized pushback against the oligopoly of for-profit publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) has yielded progress, yet subscription and APC costs remain high and transformative agreements are unstable in some regions.

**Impact Metrics and Assessment**
- The “Declaration on Research Assessment” (DORA) has won thousands of institutional signatories, urging committees to evaluate research on its own merits rather than the journal’s impact factor. Some universities now explicitly limit the use of impact factors in hiring and promotion.
- Nevertheless, quantitative proxies (citation counts, h-indices, social-media attention) remain influential, and many committees still lean heavily on publication venues—as Brenner warned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Brenner’s critique was less a set of concrete forecasts than a systemic diagnosis and a stark warning. Viewed through that lens:
- **Broadly correct (and persisting trends):**
  - Risk aversion in funding remains entrenched; agencies lean toward proposals with clear preliminary data and well-defined deliverables, curtailing long-term, exploratory work.
  - Publishing remains heavily commercialized, with journals acting as powerful gatekeepers and prestige brands. The “publish in the okay places or perish” culture is largely unchanged.
  - The academic labor structure continues to rely on contingent, underpaid postdocs and graduate students, fostering precarity and conformity.
- **Underestimated pressures for change:**
  - Brenner likely did not foresee how rapidly preprints would normalize, nor the traction DORA and OA mandates (e.g., Plan S) would gain to weaken the grip of impact factors and paywalls.
  - He also understated the rise of patient, institutionally protected funding vehicles (HHMI-style), and the organizing power of early-career researchers (unionization) aimed at improving conditions. While these reforms are partial, they suggest a more dynamic response than his bleak portrait implied.
- **Arguments that have aged poorly:**
  - His blanket dismissal of peer review as “completely corrupt” overstates the case. Despite its flaws, formal peer review remains a valued (and corrigible) mechanism for quality control and error correction; when it is replaced by post-publication commentary or crowd review, noise and gaming often emerge. A more nuanced critique—distinguishing between performative gatekeeping and genuine scholarly assessment—would have been more durable.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

Brenner’s polemic sits in the 70–79th percentile of interest for a retrospective critique. It offers durable insights and is bracingly readable, but its focus is narrower than top-decile articles. A score of 9 is reserved for analyses with sweeping, cross-disciplinary long-term impact (e.g., reflections on the sequencing of the human genome or the rise of CRISPR). Brenner’s piece is primarily about the sociology of academic science, including publishing, training, and funding. While acutely observed, its real-world relevance is tilted toward those working inside the research enterprise rather than the public understanding of science or technological transformation.

The piece remains highly cited and regularly resurfaces in debates over scientific culture precisely because the problems it diagnoses remain largely unsolved. Therefore, it is more than a period curio; it’s a foundational indictment that continues to frame arguments for reform in training, funding, and publishing. For that reason, it ranks well above average but not in the very top tier of long-term importance.
