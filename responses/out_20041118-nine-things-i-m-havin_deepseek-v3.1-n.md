# Nine Things I'm Having Trouble Imagining (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a humorous, skeptical commentary from November 2004 written by a chemist, likely in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry, addressing nine frustrating aspects of chemistry research and development. The author expresses difficulty believing several scenarios: chemistry departments having adequate numbers of chemists; Aldrich (a chemical supplier) being the lowest-priced option; synthesis papers justifying their work's value; tolerable graduate student lounge conditions; JACS publications without nanorods; HPLC salesmen admitting product limitations; solubilizing modifications actually improving drug candidates; protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors achieving clinical success; and Japanese patents being written in languages other than Japanese (which would make them easier to read). The tone suggests these phenomena rarely occur in the real world, reflecting common frustrations about costs, marketing, and the practical challenges of drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published before major trends reshaped chemistry and biotechnology. Subsequently: 

- **Aldrich and chemical pricing**: Around 2004–2006, consolidation accelerated among chemical suppliers. Sigma-Aldrich (which included Aldrich) acquired Supelco in 2004 and later merged with Merck KGaA in 2015. Pricing transparency increased with online platforms, but Aldrich generally competed on quality and catalog breadth rather than being the lowest-priced option for common reagents; local suppliers and specialized vendors often offered lower prices for bulk orders. Aldrich remained a premium supplier for research-scale materials.

- **Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors**: The author's skepticism reflected real challenges. Between 2004 and 2024, PTP-targeted drug programs saw mixed outcomes. Several PTP1B inhibitors reached clinical trials for diabetes and obesity but faced issues with selectivity, cell permeability, and off-target effects; most programs were discontinued or stalled. No PTP inhibitor received FDA approval through the 2010s/2020s, though research continued (e.g., targeting SHP2 in oncology). The broader phosphatase field faced technical hurdles due to conserved active sites and the need for cell-permeable, selective inhibitors.

- **Drug solubilization strategies**: The challenge of improving leads by adding solubilizing groups persisted. Medicinal chemists increasingly used structure-based design, prodrug approaches, and formulation strategies to address poor solubility (a key cause of failure in ~40% of candidates). Success depended heavily on balancing potency, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and off-target effects—adding solubilizing groups sometimes improved workability but rarely overcame fundamental issues like target engagement or toxicity without careful optimization.

- **JACS and nanorods**: The mid-2000s represented the peak of fascination with anisotropic nanomaterials such as nanorods and nanowires, driven by potential applications in electronics, catalysis, and biomedical imaging. By the 2010s, the focus shifted to 2D materials (graphene, TMDCs), nanoparticles, and hierarchical nanostructures with specific functions (e.g., drug delivery, energy storage). JACS continued publishing work on nanocrystals and nanostructures, but the scope broadened beyond just shape-controlled synthesis toward mechanistic insights and applications—the hype about "nanorods for everything" subsided as the field matured.

- **Chemistry talent and graduate training**: In the 2000s, concerns about chemist supply persisted, but post-2008 financial crisis and industry consolidation (mergers, site closures) led to reduced hiring in traditional pharma roles. Demand shifted toward specialized skills like computational chemistry, bioconjugation, and translational research. Graduate student conditions became a prominent topic, with advocacy for shorter Ph.D. timelines, mental-health support, and career diversity—many departments improved facilities and mentorship practices in the 2010s. 

- **HPLC and analytical technology**: HPLC columns diversified with UHPLC (ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography), core-shell particles, and hybrid stationary phases. Column suppliers continued to emphasize performance and reproducibility, though marketing claims about universal problem-solving became more nuanced with greater transparency in method development challenges. Automated systems, LC-MS coupling, and bioanalysis workflows improved, but HPLC column selection remained critical and vendor-dependent.

- **Japanese patents**: Japanese patent applications increasingly included English abstracts and searchable metadata. Full translations remained costly, but machine translation and patent databases (e.g., WIPO, EPO) eased access. Legal and regulatory harmonization (e.g., PCT filings) helped reduce language barriers, though in 2004–2010 navigating non-English patents was still a significant hurdle for U.S. and European researchers.

These developments reflect broader industrial R&D trends: increased computational modeling, nanomaterial maturation beyond shape-control hype, ongoing challenges in kinase/phosphatase inhibitor development, and globalization of patent landscapes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article implicitly predicts (with skepticism) several outcomes; actual subsequent results were:

- **PTP inhibitors achieving clinical effectiveness**:
  - **Prediction**: The author expresses disbelief that any protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor will work well enough for human use.
  - **Reality**: No PTP-targeted drug received FDA approval by the early 2020s. Clinical trials for PTP1B inhibitors in diabetes (e.g., ISIS 113715, a nucleic acid-based candidate; and small molecules) were terminated or failed to demonstrate efficacy. Research pivoted to other phosphatases (e.g., SHP2 inhibitors in oncology entered trials) but with limited success. The author's skepticism proved largely justified for PTP1B; broader phosphatase druggability remained challenging due to selectivity and on-target toxicity.

- **Solubilizing modifications improving drug candidates**:
  - **Prediction**: The author doubts that adding solubilizing groups will yield better molecules.
  - **Reality**: Solubility optimization became a cornerstone of lead optimization, but outcomes were mixed. Examples like adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, phosphate prodrugs, or lipid conjugates worked in some cases (e.g., sofosbuvir for HCV), but often required extensive balancing of potency, PK/PD, and safety—random modifications rarely succeeded. Industry increasingly used structure-guided design and ADME profiling to guide modifications, validating the author's practical concern about simplistic strategies.

- **Continued proliferation of nanorods in JACS**:
  - **Prediction**: Implicitly, the author expects endless nanorod papers with photos.
  - **Reality**: Nanorods remained common (especially for Au, CdSe, ZnO), but after 2010 the field shifted toward functional nanomaterials (e.g., for energy conversion, biomedical applications), 2D materials, and operando characterization. Shape control alone became less publishable unless linked to quantitative performance.

- **HPLC sales claims**:
  - **Prediction**: HPLC salespeople will not admit product limitations.
  - **Reality**: Vendor marketing evolved to emphasize application-specific solutions, but claims of universal suitability remained common. Instrument and column catalogs highlighted unique chemistries, though technical support teams acknowledged limitations during method development calls—partial validation of the author's cynicism.

- **Japanese patent language barriers**:
  - **Prediction**: Japanese patents will remain mostly in Japanese.
  - **Reality**: While many patents still required translation, machine translation and international filings (PCT, EPO) eased access. Japanese companies increasingly filed English-language equivalents for key inventions targeting global markets.

In each case, the author's skepticism highlighted real-world friction points that remained partially unresolved or evolved in ways that validated their concerns (e.g., PTP inhibitors failing, solubility strategies being hard), even as technology improved.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article is a lighthearted commentary offering a snapshot of mid-2000s chemistry, but it lacks broader scientific predictions or deep analysis—mostly highlighting practical annoyances. Its value lies in historical context rather than lasting scientific insight.
