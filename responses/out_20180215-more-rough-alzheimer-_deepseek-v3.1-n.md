# More Rough Alzheimer's News (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY
The February 2018 article discusses a particularly discouraging day for Alzheimer's disease drug development. Merck announced the failure of their BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931) in a Phase III trial for prodromal (early-stage) Alzheimer's patients, despite earlier optimism about the approach. This followed an earlier trial failure in more advanced patients that had been stopped for futility. Concurrently, Biogen revealed it was expanding enrollment for its Phase III trial of the antibody aducanumab due to "variability" in the data, which the author interpreted as a likely sign of weak efficacy requiring larger sample sizes to achieve statistical significance. The author also criticized media coverage of a mouse study claiming to "reverse" Alzheimer's through BACE modulation, highlighting the stark disconnect between dramatic animal model results and repeated clinical failures. The article expresses serious doubts about the amyloid hypothesis itself and raises concerns about moral hazard—the temptation for regulators to approve marginally effective drugs due to desperate patient demand.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent years validated and amplified many of the author's concerns:

**BACE Inhibitors**: Merck's 2018 failure proved prescient for the entire class. Multiple other BACE inhibitors from companies including Lilly, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Janssen, and Amgen ultimately failed in Phase III trials or were discontinued. The fundamental issue appeared to be timing—by the time clinical symptoms emerge, the disease process may be too advanced, and BACE inhibition may even have detrimental effects on normal neural function.

**Aducanumab**: Biogen's drug followed a tortuous path. In March 2019, Biogen discontinued two Phase III trials (EMERGE and ENGAGE) after an interim analysis suggested futility. However, in October 2019, Biogen controversially announced it would seek FDA approval based on a post-hoc reanalysis claiming one trial showed benefit. The FDA approved aducanumab in June 2021 despite significant controversy—the agency's advisory committee had voted against approval, and many experts questioned the clinical meaningfulness of the modest effects seen. Post-approval commercial uptake was slow, with major medical systems declining to use it and CMS severely restricting coverage.

The aducanumab approval exemplified the author's 2018 concern about moral hazard. While technically meeting an FDA endpoint, the drug's real-world benefits remained highly questionable, demonstrating that regulatory pressure could indeed lead to approval of drugs with uncertain clinical value when dealing with devastating diseases.

**Amyloid Hypothesis Evolution**: The repeated failures of amyloid-targeting therapies led to significant debate about the hypothesis itself. While some researchers maintained that earlier intervention might still work, others increasingly questioned whether amyloid was truly causal or merely a biomarker.

**Lecanemab**: In January 2023, the FDA approved lecanemab (Biogen/Eisai), another anti-amyloid antibody, based on more convincing Phase III data showing modest slowing of cognitive decline (27% over 18 months on the clinical dementia rating scale). However, controversy remained about clinical meaningfulness and serious side effects including brain bleeding and swelling. This demonstrated that modest efficacy was achievable, though the benefits remained incremental rather than transformative.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several prescient insights:

• **Beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors would continue to fail**: The article's suggestion that BACE inhibitors were unlikely to succeed proved correct. Multiple additional BACE inhibitor programs failed after 2018, validating the skepticism.

• **The moral hazard issue would materialize**: The author's concern that the FDA would face immense pressure to approve drugs with questionable efficacy proved remarkably accurate with the aducanumab approval in 2021. The approval occurred despite weak evidence and strong advisory committee opposition, driven by patient advocacy and market pressures.

• **Statistical significance vs. clinical meaningfulness**: The article anticipated that achieving statistical significance on cognitive endpoints wouldn't necessarily translate to meaningful patient benefit—a concern that remained relevant through the aducanumab controversy and persisted even with lecanemab's more robust data.

• **The amyloid hypothesis might be wrong or incomplete**: While the article expressed growing doubts about the amyloid hypothesis, subsequent years showed more nuance. Anti-amyloid antibodies like lecanemab and donanemab (approved 2024) produced modest but statistically significant benefits, suggesting amyloid reduction could have some clinical effect, though far less than originally hoped. The hypothesis wasn't entirely wrong, but it was clearly insufficient as the sole therapeutic target.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrated extraordinary prescience about key issues in Alzheimer's drug development—the author correctly anticipated BACE inhibitor failures, highlighted valid concerns about statistical vs. clinical significance that would prove crucial in the aducanumab controversy, and identified the moral hazard problem that did indeed materialize with regulatory decisions. The piece captured a pivotal moment when accumulating failures should have prompted more fundamental reconsideration of therapeutic strategies, making it highly valuable both as historical record and cautionary analysis about the challenges of translating biological hypotheses into effective therapies for complex diseases.
