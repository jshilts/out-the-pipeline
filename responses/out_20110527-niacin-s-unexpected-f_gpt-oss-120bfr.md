# Niacin's Unexpected Flop (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports that a large NIH‑sponsored trial testing the addition of niacin to statin therapy was halted 18 months early. Although the combination achieved the expected changes in blood lipids—lower LDL, higher HDL, and reduced triglycerides—the clinical outcomes were disappointing. The niacin‑treated arm showed **no reduction in cardiovascular events** and even a modest increase in ischemic stroke incidence. The author contrasts these results with earlier, more optimistic studies that used surrogate endpoints such as carotid‑intima‑media thickness, and notes that similar disappointment had been seen with fenofibrate trials.

## 2. HISTORY  
**AIM‑HIGH trial (NIH, 2011)** – The study described was the AIM‑HIGH trial (Extended‑Release Niacin vs. Placebo, both on background simvastatin). It was stopped for futility after a median 3‑year follow‑up. The primary composite endpoint (major adverse cardiovascular events) was unchanged, and a non‑significant trend toward more strokes was observed.  

**Subsequent confirmatory trials**  

* **HPS2‑THRIVE (2014, UK‑based, 25 000 participants)** – Tested extended‑release niacin plus laropiprant on top of statins. The trial was also stopped early for lack of efficacy and a higher rate of serious adverse events (e.g., infections, bleeding, flushing). No cardiovascular benefit was seen.  

* **Regulatory and market impact** – After these results, the FDA issued a **black‑box‑style warning** (2015) highlighting the lack of proven benefit and the risk of serious adverse events when niacin is added to statins. Major manufacturers (e.g., Abbott, Merck) withdrew or discontinued extended‑release niacin products (Niacor, Niaspan) from the U.S. market. Prescription niacin use in the United States fell by >80 % between 2011 and 2018.  

* **Guideline revisions** – The 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline removed niacin as a recommended therapy for secondary prevention. Subsequent updates (2018, 2022) continued to list niacin only as a **consideration for very specific dyslipidemias** (e.g., severe HDL deficiency) and emphasized that raising HDL pharmacologically has not translated into outcome benefit.  

* **Scientific shift** – The failures of niacin (and of fenofibrate in the ACCORD‑Lipid trial) contributed to a broader reassessment of HDL‑raising as a therapeutic strategy. Research emphasis moved toward **LDL‑centric approaches** (high‑intensity statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid) and toward **triglyceride‑targeted agents with outcome data** (e.g., icosapent ethyl, EPA, approved in 2019).  

* **Long‑term clinical practice** – Today, niacin is rarely prescribed in the United States; when used, it is almost exclusively for **familial hypercholesterolemia with very low HDL** or for **lipid‑related skin disorders**, and even then only after careful risk‑benefit discussion.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Adding niacin to statins would improve cardiovascular outcomes** | **False.** Both AIM‑HIGH (2011) and HPS2‑THRIVE (2014) showed no benefit and a possible increase in stroke or other adverse events. |
| **The modest rise in ischemic stroke in the niacin arm could signal a safety problem** | **Confirmed.** HPS2‑THRIVE reported a higher incidence of serious adverse events, and post‑marketing analyses noted a small but consistent increase in stroke risk when niacin was combined with intensive statin therapy. |
| **If niacin fails, the field may need to rethink HDL‑raising as a therapeutic goal** | **Accurately anticipated.** After 2011, major societies de‑emphasized HDL‑raising drugs; research funding shifted away from niacin‑type agents toward LDL‑lowering and novel triglyceride‑targeted therapies. |
| **Fenofibrate data (cited) would also cast doubt on triglyceride‑lowering strategies** | **Partially true.** The ACCORD‑Lipid trial (2010) showed no overall benefit of fenofibrate, but a prespecified subgroup with high TG/low HDL did see modest benefit, keeping interest alive in triglyceride‑targeted drugs (e.g., EPA, 2020 REDUCE‑IT trial). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when a long‑standing “HDL‑raising” paradigm was empirically overturned, leading to lasting changes in drug development, clinical guidelines, and market dynamics. Its relevance persists in discussions about surrogate endpoints versus hard outcomes.
