# And One Was Just Right? (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques a PNAS paper from Stuart Schreiber's group evaluating three compound collections (commercial small molecules, natural products, and academic DOS compounds) screened against 100 proteins using small-molecule microarrays. The PNAS paper concluded that commercial molecules are too flat and achiral while natural products are too complex and chiral, positioning diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) compounds as the "just right" intermediate in stereochemical/shape complexity. The critique argues the analysis is flawed by failing to account for molecular weight differences (with commercial compounds including many small fragments that inherently bind promiscuously), and omitting crucial parameters like logP, polar surface area, and problematic functional groups present across all three collections. The author contends all three collections have significant issues and that the paper's conclusions favor DOS compounds through selective metric choice rather than demonstrating genuine superiority.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this critique, diversity-oriented synthesis continued to evolve as a field but never achieved the broad pharmaceutical adoption that might have been hoped for in 2010. While academic interest in DOS continued through the 2010s, with Schreiber's group and others publishing additional work, the approach did not fundamentally transform drug discovery screening strategies. The pharmaceutical industry largely continued using focused libraries, fragment-based screening, and increasingly DNA-encoded libraries throughout the 2010-2024 period, rather than broadly adopting DOS principles at scale.

The debate about compound library design shifted instead toward issues of drug-likeness, developability parameters (beyond simple complexity metrics), and the rise of molecular glues and PROTACs in the 2010s as distinct approaches to addressing difficult targets. Fragment-based drug discovery, which the article noted was present in the commercial collection, became an established and productive screening paradigm rather than being displaced by DOS approaches.

No major FDA-approved drugs emerged from DOS screening programs in the subsequent 14 years, nor did DOS become a standard industry practice for primary screening. While the concept influenced academic chemical biology and probe development, its practical impact on pharmaceutical productivity remained limited. The methodological concerns raised in the critique - particularly around controlling for molecular weight and physicochemical properties rather than focusing primarily on stereochemical complexity - proved prescient as the field increasingly recognized the multifactorial nature of drug-likeness.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction about interpretability of cellular pathway assays with promiscuous DOS compounds**: "if they hit across so many proteins at the same time, you have to wonder how such assays can be interpreted" → This concern was validated as understanding of polypharmacology and assay interpretation became more sophisticated; promiscuous hits typically require extensive follow-up or structure optimization to become useful probes, and the challenge of interpreting pathway effects from promiscuous compounds remains a recognized issue in chemical biology.

- **Prediction about molecular weight bias compromising conclusions**: "Run a commercial/natural product/DOS comparison controlled for molecular weight, and we can talk" → This critique was well-founded; subsequent work in drug discovery increasingly emphasized matched molecular pairs and controlled comparisons when evaluating library performance, as molecular weight effects on binding are well-established and significant.

- **Implicit prediction about lack of broad industry adoption of DOS**: The author's skepticism about paying for any of the three collections, preferring to "cherry-pick about 15 or 20%" suggests limited practical utility → DOS did not achieve broad pharmaceutical adoption, remaining primarily an academic approach rather than becoming a standard industry practice.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5**

This represents moderate historical interest - it's a well-argued methodological critique of a specific paper that highlighted important but often overlooked issues in compound library evaluation, though the debate had limited broader impact on pharmaceutical practice. The critique was scientifically sound and prescient about methodological problems, but addressed a niche academic debate rather than influencing major industry trends or policy.
