# Waiting for the Metaphorical Phone to Ring (November 2003)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a first-person commentary by a drug discovery scientist describing the psychology of conducting high-risk experiments in biotechnology. The author has set up 32 experiments that have been incubating for ten days and are about to be analyzed. He describes the ambivalence many scientists feel—almost not wanting to know the results because the most interesting, high-reward experiments typically fail. 

The author distinguishes between exploratory experiments (rare in mature fields) and hypothesis-driven experiments that carry pass/fail outcomes. He acknowledges that while there's plenty of day-to-day work to stay busy with, he's compelled to pursue these "roll-the-dice" ideas despite their history of failure. The piece captures the tension between playing it safe with incremental work versus pursuing breakthrough ideas that could fundamentally advance the field, even when past attempts have been "relentlessly negative."

## 2. HISTORY

The biotechnology industry landscape in 2003-2024 shows a complex story regarding the tension the author describes. Several major trends emerged from this period that contextualize his experience:

**R&D Productivity Challenges**: The crisis the author describes—where "none of the really good ones have worked"—mirrored broader industry struggles. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, pharmaceutical companies faced declining R&D productivity despite increased investment. Many big pharma companies restructured their research operations, with some closing entire research sites. The industry moved toward more targeted approaches, external innovation, and portfolio diversification to manage the high failure rates the author experienced firsthand.

**HPLC and Automation**: By 2003-2004, high-throughput screening and automation were already transforming drug discovery, but these technologies became increasingly sophisticated throughout the 2000s. The 32-experiment setup the author describes would become a tiny fraction of what automated platforms could handle by the 2010s, with some screening hundreds of thousands of compounds.

**Specific Therapeutic Breakthroughs**: Cancer immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, emerged as major successes starting around 2010-2014 with drugs like ipilimumab (Yervoy, approved 2011) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, approved 2014). These represented exactly the kind of paradigm-shifting discoveries the author hoped for, though they came through different research pathways than small-molecule drug discovery.

CAR-T cell therapy received its first FDA approval in 2017, and mRNA vaccine technology became globally significant with COVID-19 vaccines in 2020-2021. These were true breakthrough innovations that likely exceeded even optimistic 2003 predictions.

**Continued Challenges**: The fundamental problem the author describes—that most bold ideas fail—remains accurate today. Success rates for drugs progressing from Phase I to approval remain low, typically around 10-15%. However, there's been significant progress in understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2003 article made implicit predictions through its exploration of scientific risk-taking:

**Prediction**: The "big experiments, the ones that'll make you jump up and down if they work, generally don't work."
- **Reality**: This prediction generally proved accurate. Despite major advances in understanding disease biology and drug mechanisms from 2004-2024, most experimental approaches still fail. The industry has adopted various strategies to manage this reality, including earlier kill decisions, portfolio approaches, and external innovation through biotech partnerships. Success rates have improved somewhat through better target validation and patient selection, but most bold ideas continue to fail.

**Prediction**: "None of the really good ones have worked, not one."
- **Reality**: The author may have been experiencing a local minimum in their research program. The broader field did achieve significant breakthroughs between 2004-2024, particularly in immunotherapy, gene therapy, and precision medicine. However, many individual researchers and companies did experience the pattern the author describes, with many having to pivot strategies or shut down programs entirely.

**Prediction**: The tension between pursuing high-risk ideas versus focusing on day-to-day incremental work.
- **Reality**: This tension has remained central to drug discovery. Many companies struggled to balance breakthrough research with predictable pipelines, leading to restructuring and greater emphasis on external innovation through licensing and acquisitions of biotech companies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an authentic, enduring aspect of scientific research that remains highly relevant two decades later. The psychological experience of balancing ambition with pragmatism, and the reality that most breakthrough attempts fail, reflects fundamental truths about innovation in biotechnology and science more broadly. It offers insight into the human side of drug discovery that transcends specific technical developments.

While not focused on particular scientific breakthroughs or policy changes, the article's observations about risk, failure, and persistence remain prescient and valuable for understanding how scientific progress actually happens—through repeated failures punctuated by rare successes.
