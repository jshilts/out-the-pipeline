# Allergan Escapes Valeant (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes the conclusion of a hostile takeover battle in the pharmaceutical industry. Valeant Pharmaceuticals had been pursuing a takeover of Allergan, but Allergan successfully fended off this attempt by agreeing to be acquired by Actavis instead. The Actavis deal was approximately $6 billion higher than what Valeant had indicated it was willing to pay. The author notes that Valeant had a reputation for being "tight-fisted" and cutting R&D spending, which made the company undesirable as an acquirer from Allergan's perspective. The combined Allergan-Actavis entity was expected to have an R&D budget of $1.7 billion annually, representing a net reduction from what would have been the sum of the two companies' individual R&D budgets ($1.62 billion combined), but still significantly higher than what would have occurred under Valeant ownership.

## 2. HISTORY
**The Allergan-Actavis merger was completed in March 2015**, creating one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with the Actavis name, though the company later changed its name back to Allergan in June 2015.

**R&D Budget Reality**: The combined company's R&D spending did indeed undergo consolidation. In subsequent years, Allergan maintained R&D spending in the range of approximately $1.4-1.6 billion annually, broadly consistent with the expected $1.7 billion projection, representing efficiency gains through merger synergies.

**Valeant's Continued Strategy and Later Decline**: Valeant continued its aggressive acquisition strategy, notably acquiring Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015 for $14.5 billion. However, Valeant faced major controversies starting in 2015-2016 related to drug price increases and its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor, leading to significant stock price declines, management changes, and company restructuring. Valeant eventually changed its name to Bausch Health Companies in 2018 as part of a rebranding effort to distance itself from past controversies.

**Allergan's Subsequent Fate**: Allergan (the merged entity) itself became a major pharmaceutical company but faced its own challenges. The company grew through additional acquisitions and eventually was acquired by AbbVie in May 2020 in a transaction valued at approximately $63 billion.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: The author suggested that if the Actavis deal succeeded, it "might cause people to look with suspicion on any future Valeant bids for other companies."
  
  **Outcome**: This proved partially accurate. Valeant did continue making acquisitions (including Salix in 2015), but increasing scrutiny of the company's business model and ethics eventually led to significant reputational damage and reduced acquisition activity as the controversies mounted in 2015-2016.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6/9**

This article captures a significant moment in pharmaceutical industry consolidation and highlights important debates about R&D spending strategies that remained relevant in subsequent years. The broader narrative about different pharmaceutical business models (growth-through-acquisition vs. organic R&D investment) proved prescient as these issues continued to shape the industry through 2020.
