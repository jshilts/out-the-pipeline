# More Price Hikes on Obscure Medication (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes the business model of Martin Shkreli and his companies (Retrophin, and later Turing Pharmaceuticals) involving acquiring small-market drugs from obscure producers and dramatically raising prices. The piece focuses on Shkreli's attempt to purchase praziquantel (Biltricide), an anti-parasitic drug from Bayer used to treat liver fluke infections. When Shkreli's interest became known, Bayer independently raised the drug's wholesale price by 3.5x (from approximately $100 to $350 per treatment course), though this was substantially less than the $100,000 per course that Turing had reportedly planned. The article contextualizes this within Shkreli's earlier activities at Retrophin with the drug Thiola (20x price increase) and his subsequent ouster from that company amid stock-trading irregularities. It notes that unlike Thiola, praziquantel had multiple generic suppliers and Merck Serono's donation program in Africa, making it less vulnerable to extreme price manipulation.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this article's publication, the pharmaceutical pricing controversies escalated dramatically. In September 2015—seven months after this piece—Turing Pharmaceuticals, now under Shkreli's leadership, acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine), a decades-old anti-parasitic drug used to treat toxoplasmosis, and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill (a 5,500% increase). This became a national scandal and brought widespread media attention, congressional hearings, and public outrage. Shkreli became known as "the most hated man in America" and "Pharma Bro."

Shkreli's legal troubles intensified: in December 2015, he was arrested by the FBI on securities fraud charges related to his time at Retrophin. In August 2017, he was convicted on multiple counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, and sentenced to seven years in federal prison in March 2018. He was released briefly in 2022 before being returned to prison for violating release conditions. The Daraprim controversy catalyzed significant public policy discourse around pharmaceutical pricing, leading to congressional investigations and proposed legislation on drug price controls, though comprehensive federal reform remained elusive for years.

Regarding praziquantel specifically, the Merck Serono donation program mentioned in the article expanded significantly. The company has donated over 1.5 billion tablets to treat schistosomiasis in Africa since the program's inception, treating more than 100 million children annually. The WHO added praziquantel to its Model List of Essential Medicines, and it remains a critical tool for neglected tropical disease control. Bayer continued manufacturing Biltricide at elevated prices, but the economic impact was moderated by generic availability and donation programs for parasitic diseases primarily affecting developing countries.

Turing Pharmaceuticals declared bankruptcy in 2018. Retrophin, under new leadership after Shkreli's departure, rebranded as Travere Therapeutics and shifted focus to rare disease drug development, with two FDA-approved drugs by 2024 (Filspari for IgA nephropathy and Chenodal for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions by the author:**
- That "pricing power is a weapon... that if you keep using indiscriminately can be taken away"
- That companies would continue testing regulatory and public tolerance for extreme price increases on small-market drugs

**Actual outcomes:**
• The prediction about pricing power being "taken away" proved partially accurate: while no direct regulatory mechanisms stripped companies of pricing power, the Daraprim case created such public backlash that it became a cautionary tale influencing subsequent industry behavior and political discourse around drug pricing reform
• The article's concerns about continued price hikes were well-founded: the Daraprim incident exceeded even the Thiola scale, though the resulting public outrage and Shkreli's legal troubles demonstrated limits to how far this model could be pushed
• The author's implicit concern about industry reputation was validated: the "Pharma Bro" phenomenon damaged pharmaceutical industry public perception and provided momentum for drug pricing reform advocates

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **9/10**

This article provides prescient insight into pharmaceutical business practices that would explode into major public controversy within months. The piece captures a crucial early chapter in what became one of the most significant American healthcare controversies of the decade, offering foundational context for understanding how extreme drug pricing strategies developed and their real-world consequences for patient access and industry oversight.
