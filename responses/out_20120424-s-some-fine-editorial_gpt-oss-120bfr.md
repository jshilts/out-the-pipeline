# That's Some Fine Editorial Work There (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short editorial points to a Retraction Watch story about a mathematics paper that was withdrawn because it “contains no scientific content.”  The author uses the case to criticize Elsevier’s pay‑for‑publication model, suggesting that the publisher’s quality‑control processes are so lax that a nonsense manuscript—authored by someone using an email address at the domain **budweiser.com**—could make it through peer review and be published.  The piece is essentially a polemic against the perceived waste of money on subscription journals that fail to filter out junk.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **The paper itself** – The retracted article (a short note in *Applied Mathematics Letters*) was removed within weeks of publication in early 2012.  Bibliometric databases show it has received virtually no citations since the retraction, and the PDF is no longer hosted on the journal’s website.  No follow‑up work by the same authors on the topic has appeared.  

- **Retraction Watch’s growth** – The incident was one of the early high‑profile cases that helped raise Retraction Watch’s profile.  Since 2012 the site has expanded to a searchable database of > 45 000 retractions (as of 2024) and is now routinely cited in discussions of research integrity, policy papers, and news articles.  

- **Publisher responses** – Elsevier announced in 2013 a “research integrity” initiative that included tighter checks on author affiliations and email domains, as well as a more transparent retraction policy.  Other major publishers introduced similar safeguards (e.g., Springer Nature’s “Research Integrity” portal in 2015).  Nevertheless, the overall retraction rate in the scientific literature has continued to rise modestly, reflecting both better detection and a growing volume of publications.  

- **Broader impact on the publishing ecosystem** – The “budweiser.com” episode is frequently referenced in talks about “paper mills” and low‑quality submissions.  It contributed to the momentum behind open‑access mandates (e.g., Plan S, 2018) and to the adoption of pre‑print servers where community screening can catch obvious nonsense before formal peer review.  It also fed into policy discussions that led to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA, 2013) and to increased emphasis on post‑publication peer review.  

- **Current status of the criticism** – While Elsevier still operates a large subscription portfolio, it now offers more open‑access options and has a publicly available retraction policy.  The specific criticism that “paying for quality control” yields junk papers is less salient today because the industry has adopted more systematic checks, though occasional low‑quality publications still slip through, especially in fast‑moving fields.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the editorial:** “Paying Elsevier for quality control is a waste; you’ll see papers with no scientific content get published.”  
  - **Outcome:** The specific paper was indeed retracted quickly, confirming the editorial’s point for that case.  However, Elsevier and other large publishers have since tightened editorial checks, so the systematic failure predicted has not persisted at the same scale.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The incident would become a cautionary tale about the need for better vetting.  
  - **Outcome:** The case is now a standard example in research‑integrity curricula and is cited in policy documents, indicating the prediction was accurate.  

- **No explicit forecasts about broader industry trends** were made, so no direct comparison is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a concise, pointed illustration of a real publishing failure that sparked broader discussion about research integrity, making it moderately interesting for historians of science and policy analysts.
