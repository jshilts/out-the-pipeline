# Value in Structure? (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery commentary examined a Thomson‑Reuters pipeline of ≈ 1 000 drug‑discovery projects, split into two groups: enzymes for which high‑resolution crystal structures were publicly available, and G‑protein‑coupled receptors (GPCRs) that, at the time, lacked any such structural data.  

Using the database, the authors found that ≈ 70 % of the GPCR projects were listed as “suspended” or “discontinued,” versus ≈ 44 % of the enzyme projects. To control for target‑specific success rates, they selected ten enzyme targets and ten GPCR targets that had historically produced a similar number of marketed drugs. Even within these matched sets, the structure‑enabled enzyme projects showed fewer “stopped” entries and a higher proportion of candidates in discovery or clinical phases. The authors concluded that the availability of structural information appears to correlate with higher project continuation rates and, by implication, higher valuation for those programmes.

## 2. HISTORY  
### Enzyme targets  

| Target | Post‑2011 developments (to 2026) |
|---|---|
| **DPP‑IV** | Four DPP‑4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, linagliptin) were already on the market before 2011; after 2011, additional agents (e.g., vildagliptin, teneligliptin) entered global markets. Crystal structures of DPP‑4 bound to inhibitors, first published in the early 2000s, have been repeatedly used to improve selectivity and pharmacokinetics, but the commercial success of the class was driven more by clinical efficacy and safety than by new structural insights. |
| **BCR‑ABL** | Imatinib (2001) remained the benchmark, but second‑generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib) and third‑generation ponatinib (2012) were approved. High‑resolution kinase domain structures, especially of resistance mutants, guided the design of later inhibitors and informed combination strategies. |
| **HER2 kinase** | Small‑molecule HER2 inhibitors (lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib) received approvals between 2007 and 2020. Structural data on the HER2 kinase domain and its heterodimer with EGFR helped rationalize selectivity and resistance mechanisms. |
| **Renin** | Aliskiren (2007) remained the only approved renin inhibitor; no new renin‑targeting drugs reached market after 2011, despite continued structural work and several failed Phase III programmes. |
| **Factor Xa** | Rivaroxaban (2011) and apixaban (2012) entered the market, followed by edoxaban (2015) and betrixaban (2017). Early crystal structures of Factor Xa with inhibitors were instrumental in optimizing oral bioavailability and selectivity. |
| **HDAC** | Vorinostat (2006) and romidepsin (2009) were already approved; pan‑HDAC inhibitor panobinostat (2015) and belinostat (2014) followed. Structures of multiple HDAC isoforms, solved after 2010, have been used to design isoform‑selective inhibitors, though clinical translation remains limited. |
| **HIV integrase** | Raltegravir (2007) and elvitegravir (2012) were on the market; dolutegravir (2013) and bictegravir (2018) later received approval. Crystal structures of integrase‑DNA‑inhibitor complexes were crucial for understanding resistance and for the rapid development of next‑generation agents. |
| **JAK2** | Ruxolitinib (2011) for myelofibrosis and later fedratinib (2019) and baricitinib (2018) for rheumatoid arthritis and COVID‑19 were approved. Structural studies of the JAK kinase domain informed the design of more selective inhibitors. |
| **Hepatitis C protease (NS3/4A)** | First‑generation protease inhibitors (telaprevir, boceprevir) were approved in 2011; later agents (simeprevir 2013, grazoprevir 2016) benefited from crystal structures of the protease, but the ultimate cure of HCV came from combination regimens that included NS5A inhibitors, whose structures were also resolved. |
| **Cathepsin K** | Odanacatib, a cathepsin K inhibitor, progressed to Phase III but was discontinued in 2012 due to safety concerns. Structural data had been used to improve potency, but the target failed to deliver a viable market product. |

Overall, most enzyme targets continued to generate approved drugs, and for many (BCR‑ABL, Factor Xa, HIV integrase, JAK2) structural information was explicitly cited in later medicinal‑chemistry publications as a key design tool. The one clear failure (cathepsin K) illustrates that structural data alone cannot overcome adverse safety signals.

### GPCR targets  

| Target | Post‑2011 developments |
|---|---|
| **Endothelin A receptor** | Macitentan (2013) received approval for pulmonary arterial hypertension; the first high‑resolution ET_A structure (2016) arrived after the drug’s launch and has since been used for next‑generation antagonist design. |
| **P2Y12** | Clopidogrel and prasugrel remained standard; ticagrelor (2009) continued to dominate. The P2Y12 receptor structure (2012) enabled the design of allosteric modulators, but no new marketed antagonists have yet emerged. |
| **CXCR4** | Plerixafor (2008) stayed the only approved CXCR4 antagonist. Structural elucidation (2013) spurred numerous preclinical programs, yet none have reached registration as of 2026. |
| **Angiotensin II (AT₁) receptor** | Existing ARBs (losartan, valsartan) continued to dominate; the AT₁ crystal structure (2005) pre‑dated the article, and later structures refined biased‑ligand concepts but did not produce new approved drugs. |
| **Sphingosine‑1‑phosphate 1 (S1P₁)** | Fingolimod (2010) remained the first approved S1P modulator; newer selective agents (siponimod 2019, ozanimod 2020) entered the market. The S1P₁ structure (2012) was directly referenced in the design of these later, more selective compounds. |
| **NK₁** | Aprepitant (2003) and netupitant (2015) continued to be used; the NK₁ receptor structure (2012) facilitated the discovery of next‑generation antagonists, though none have yet achieved regulatory approval. |
| **Muscarinic M₁** | No selective M₁ agonist has been approved; however, the M₁ crystal structure (2012) enabled the design of biased agonists such as xanomeline‑trospium (2022) for Alzheimer’s disease, which is in late‑stage clinical testing. |
| **Vasopressin V₂** | Tolvaptan (2009) remained the sole V₂ antagonist; the V₂ receptor structure (2015) has been used for fragment‑based screening, but no new marketed drugs have appeared. |
| **Melatonin receptors (MT₁/MT₂)** | Ramelteon (2003) stayed the only approved melatonin‑receptor agonist; crystal structures (2017) have been leveraged for the design of investigational sleep agents, none of which have reached approval yet. |
| **Adenosine A₂A** | Istradefylline (2013) gained approval for Parkinson’s disease; numerous A₂A antagonists entered clinical trials, and the receptor’s first high‑resolution structure (2008) was instrumental in guiding SAR. |

In the decade after the article, **GPCR structural biology exploded**: > 300 GPCR structures were deposited in the PDB, many via cryo‑EM. This wealth of data has undeniably accelerated ligand design, especially for previously “undruggable” receptors. Nevertheless, the **overall success rate of GPCR programmes** (percentage reaching market) has remained modest, reflecting the intrinsic challenges of receptor pharmacology, efficacy biomarkers, and safety, rather than the mere presence of a structure.

### Business and valuation impact  

- Companies that invested early in GPCR structural platforms (e.g., Schrödinger, Nimbus Therapeutics, Karuna) attracted sizable venture capital and saw their valuations rise, but many of their pipelines are still in Phase I/II as of 2026.  
- Enzyme‑focused biotech firms (e.g., Vertex, Alnylam) continued to deliver approved products, reinforcing the perception that enzyme targets, especially those with structural data, are lower‑risk investments.  

Overall, the **correlation observed in 2011 still holds in a broad statistical sense** (structure‑enabled projects tend to have higher continuation rates), but the causal narrative is more nuanced: structural data is a valuable tool, yet target biology, clinical endpoints, and market forces dominate ultimate outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article did not list explicit numeric forecasts, but it implied two main predictions:

- **Prediction 1:** *Availability of high‑resolution structures will increase the likelihood of project continuation and eventual market approval.*  
  - **Outcome:** Largely true. Enzyme projects with structures (e.g., Factor Xa, HIV integrase, JAK2) continued to produce approved drugs. GPCR projects that later obtained structures (S1P₁, A₂A, NK₁) saw newer agents reach the market, though many still failed. The statistical advantage persists, but the effect size is modest compared with other risk factors.

- **Prediction 2:** *Valuations of pipelines will reflect structural “advantage,” with structure‑enabled targets being priced higher.*  
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed in the venture‑capital landscape. From 2012‑2020, biotech firms that marketed a “structure‑based drug design platform” (e.g., Nimbus, Karuna, Schrödinger) achieved higher pre‑money valuations than comparable enzyme‑only firms, even when their pipelines were at similar stages. However, market corrections occurred when structural optimism was not matched by clinical success (e.g., cathepsin K failures, several GPCR programs that stalled despite structural data).

No other specific forecasts (e.g., “GPCRs will become as tractable as enzymes within five years”) were made, so no further evaluation is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise, data‑driven snapshot of a pivotal moment in drug‑discovery strategy. Its relevance endures because it sparked debate on the practical value of structural biology, a topic that remains central to both academia and industry. The analysis is still cited when discussing risk assessment for early‑stage pipelines.
