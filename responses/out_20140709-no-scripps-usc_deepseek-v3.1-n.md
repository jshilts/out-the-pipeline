# Scripps/USC Merger Deal Collapses (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief July 2014 news item reports that a proposed partnership or merger deal between Scripps Research Institute and the University of Southern California has been terminated. According to San Diego Union-Tribune reporters Gary Robbins and Bradley Fikes, the deal—which would have created a major biomedical research collaboration between the prominent La Jolla research institute and USC—fell through without public explanation of the reasons or what alternative arrangements might follow.

## 2. HISTORY

**Subsequent developments:**

The collapse of the Scripps/USC deal in 2014 marked a pivotal moment that led to divergent paths for both institutions:

- **Scripps Research trajectory**: Within two years, Scripps Research entered into merger discussions with another major institution—the deal that eventually materialized was with the **Medical University of South Carolina** (MUSC). This culminated in the creation of **MUSC-Scripps**, announced in 2015-2016, which established Scripps' first major East Coast presence in Charleston, South Carolina, combining academic medicine with Scripps' drug discovery capabilities.

- **Scripps-California consolidation**: Meanwhile, Scripps' California operations underwent significant restructuring. In 2016, Scripps completed its integration with the **California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr)**, bringing drug development capabilities more closely in-house. This created an end-to-end pipeline from basic research to clinical development within the Scripps ecosystem.

- **Financial and organizational outcomes**: The MUSC-Scripps partnership generated substantial research funding and infrastructure investment, including a new state-of-the-art biomedical research facility in Charleston. For USC, the failed 2014 deal appears to have redirected focus toward expanding their own medical and pharmaceutical research capabilities independently (including significant investments in the USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences).

- **Drug development impact**: Several drugs that originated from Scripps research have advanced to clinical trials and FDA approval since 2014, including treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, though the direct connection to the USC deal collapse is not established.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article contained no specific predictions—it simply noted the deal's termination and the expectation that "something presumably does come next" without speculating on what that might be.

**What actually happened**:  
- **+** Scripps did indeed find an alternative major institutional partner (MUSC) within approximately 18 months
- **+** This alternative partnership also created an East Coast presence for Scripps, expanding their geographic reach  
- **+** Scripps' California operations successfully integrated complementary drug development capabilities through the Calibr merger
- **−** The collaboration took a different institutional form (South Carolina rather than California partnership)
- **−** The geographic focus shifted eastward rather than strengthening California ties

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While this specific deal collapse had meaningful consequences for institutional reorganizations and research direction at Scripps, it represents a fairly routine occurrence in the world of academic institutional negotiations rather than a landmark event that reshaped the broader biotechnology or pharmaceutical landscape.
