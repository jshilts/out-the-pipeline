# Acronym-Fest: GSK and Its DPUs (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) major R&D reorganization into "Discovery Performance Units" (DPUs), which aimed to emulate biotech companies by breaking research into smaller competitive teams with scientists at the center. Under the new model, teams faced a "succeed or you're out" approach, with Moncef Slaoui (GSK's R&D head) claiming that talent had been "buried in the ocean" under the previous system. The article notes this was another iteration of GSK's ongoing restructuring efforts - the company had previously organized into "Centers of Excellence for Drug Discovery" (CEDDs) that were supposedly empowered and nimble. The author observes that it was too early to judge the DPU model's effectiveness, with GSK planning to complete its first appraisal in February 2012, making funding decisions based on team performance.

## 2. HISTORY

**Later Developments (2012-2020):**

The DPU model persisted through much of the 2010s but delivered mixed results. While GSK maintained a substantial pipeline, the DPU structure did not dramatically improve R&D productivity compared to industry peers. Key outcomes included:

- The model continued under CEO Andrew Witty's tenure (through 2017), with GSK maintaining its position as a major pharmaceutical company but not achieving breakthrough improvements in drug approval rates
- Several high-profile clinical failures occurred during this period, particularly in late-stage trials, which critics argued suggested the DPU model wasn't fundamentally solving underlying productivity challenges
- The company continued portfolio restructuring, divesting certain therapeutic areas while acquiring others (such as the Novartis vaccines acquisition in 2015 and subsequent divestment in 2018)
- By 2018, when Emma Walmsley became CEO, GSK began moving away from the strict DPU model toward more integrated approaches
- In 2020, GSK announced another major R&D reorganization, effectively ending the DPU era and consolidating research into two large therapy areas (Oncology and Immuno-inflammation) plus vaccines
- Throughout the 2010s, GSK's FDA drug approvals remained steady but unexceptional compared to industry leaders like Roche, Novartis, and Merck

**Real-world Impact:**
- No evidence suggests the DPU model led to superior drug discovery outcomes; GSK's approval rates and pipeline quality remained broadly comparable to industry averages
- The model's "succeed or exit" approach did create internal competition but also cultural challenges and potentially discouraged long-term high-risk research
- Public policy did not change in response to this organizational structure
- The restructuring reflects broader pharmaceutical industry struggles with R&D productivity rather than a successful innovation model

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit long-term predictions, but it highlighted several implied expectations and industry observations that can be evaluated:

(I was unable to identify clear, testable predictions in this article - it primarily reported on GSK's organizational changes and noted it was too early to judge outcomes)

## 4. INTEREST 
**Rating: 6/9**

This article represents a moderately interesting case study in pharmaceutical R&D reorganization, illustrating the industry's persistent efforts to solve productivity challenges through structural changes. However, its long-term importance is limited because the DPU model did not prove transformative and was eventually abandoned.
