# Mongersen Fails (October 2017)

## 1. Summary

The article discusses the failure of Celgene's Phase III trial for mongersen (GED-301), an oral antisense drug for Crohn's disease. Celgene had acquired the drug from Irish biotech Nogra Pharma in 2014 for $710 million upfront as a late-stage candidate. The drug targeted Smad7, a protein involved in inflammatory signaling pathways that is difficult to modulate with small molecules. Early Phase II results had looked promising, with Celgene highlighting data showing clinical remission in patients. However, the article notes that a previous trial lacked a control arm, making results difficult to interpret. When the placebo-controlled Phase III trial was conducted, an interim analysis showed that mongersen performed no better than placebo, leading to the trial's discontinuation due to futility. The author criticizes the high price paid for an unproven therapy and warns against regulatory proposals that would allow earlier patient access based on Phase II data alone, using this case as evidence that well-controlled Phase III trials remain essential.

## 2. History

Mongersen's failure marked a significant setback in the development of oral antisense therapeutics for inflammatory bowel disease. Following the 2017 Phase III failure, Celgene terminated the mongersen program entirely. This was particularly impactful because it represented one of the largest upfront payments for a relatively unproven asset at the time, and the drug had been expected to become a major revenue driver for Celgene's inflammatory disease portfolio.

The failure also had broader implications for oral antisense drug development. While antisense technology had shown promise for certain targets (notably in rare diseases where local delivery to specific tissues was feasible), mongersen's failure reinforced the challenges of oral oligonucleotide delivery and adequate tissue penetration, even for gut-targeted applications.

For Crohn's disease treatment, the clinical need remained high, with patients continuing to rely on established therapies including immunomodulators, biologics targeting TNF-α, integrins, and IL-12/23, and emerging JAK inhibitors. Several other drug candidates for Crohn's disease also failed in subsequent years, highlighting the continued difficulty of drug development in this complex inflammatory condition.

## 3. Predictions

**Article's implicit predictions and their outcomes:**

• **Mongersen itself would not succeed**: ✓ **CORRECT** - The drug was abandoned after Phase III failure and never reached market

• **Large upfront payments for unproven assets carry substantial risk**: ✓ **LARGELY CORRECT** - While this specific case validated the concern, the biopharma industry continued to see both large acquisitions that succeeded and those that failed, demonstrating that deal size alone doesn't predict success

• **Antisense approaches for gut-specific targets face significant delivery challenges**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Despite theoretical advantages, oral antisense drugs have not become a major therapeutic class for IBD or most gastrointestinal diseases

• **The need for rigorous Phase III trials with proper controls**: ✓ **VERIFIED** - Regulatory emphasis on controlled trials remained strong, and subsequent regulatory pathways (such as accelerated approval mechanisms) still required post-marketing confirmatory studies

## 4. Interest

Rating: **6/10**

This article demonstrates a common but important pattern in biotech: expensive late-stage failures of seemingly promising mechanisms. The mongersen case serves as a cautionary example about antisense drug development challenges and the risks of large acquisitions based on uncontrolled data, though the specific target and approach have not proven broadly influential beyond this failure.
