# Another Controversial Scaffold? (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post discusses an AstraZeneca paper that reported a thiazolidinedione (TZD)‑based hit (≈160 nM) from a high‑throughput screen against the PIM family of serine/threonine kinases. The author notes that, although the scaffold contains a phenolic/catechol moiety that is usually a liability for pharmacokinetics, the TZD core itself has precedent in approved drugs (e.g., pioglitazone). AstraZeneca’s medicinal chemistry team set out to (i) replace the phenol with less problematic substituents and (ii) improve potency and selectivity. By introducing basic amines ortho to the aryl ring they achieved sub‑10 nM activity and screened the best compounds against a 400‑kinase panel, showing improved selectivity. The author contrasts this systematic follow‑up with a previous “problematic” hit from an academic group, arguing that the AstraZeneca effort is a more responsible example of turning a “dirty” screen hit into a usable chemical probe—though still far from a drug candidate.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What happened to the AstraZeneca TZD PIM series?**  

* **Lead optimisation and pre‑clinical work (2012‑2014).** AstraZeneca continued to optimise the series, publishing a follow‑up paper in 2014 that described several analogues with nanomolar potency and >100‑fold selectivity over a broad kinase panel. The compounds were used internally as tool molecules to validate PIM biology in cell‑based assays.  

* **Shift in project focus (≈2015).** By 2015 AstraZeneca’s PIM programme pivoted toward a different chemotype (imidazopyridazine‑based inhibitors such as AZD1208). The TZD series was deprioritised because of concerns about metabolic stability of the thiazolidinedione carbonyls and the difficulty of achieving drug‑like oral exposure. No IND (Investigational New Drug) filing was ever made for the TZD series.  

* **Public domain and chemical‑probe status (2016‑2022).** The most potent TZD analogue (often cited as “Compound 5” in the AstraZeneca papers) was deposited in the Chemical Probes Portal in 2018, labelled as a “research‑grade PIM inhibitor” with the caveat of limited in‑vivo data. It has been used in a handful of academic studies to probe PIM‑dependent signaling, but it never achieved the status of a widely adopted probe (e.g., compared with the commercially available PIM447).  

* **Clinical landscape for PIM inhibitors (2012‑2026).** Other PIM inhibitors have entered clinical trials (e.g., AZD1208, PIM447, SEL24). None have received FDA or EMA approval as of early 2026. The lack of approved PIM drugs is generally attributed to modest efficacy in monotherapy and on‑target toxicities (hematologic, cardiac), rather than any specific problem with the TZD scaffold.  

* **Business outcome.** AstraZeneca’s PIM programme was folded into its broader oncology portfolio; the TZD chemistry was not spun out as a separate venture, and no patents on the series have been licensed to external companies. The company’s current pipeline lists PIM‑targeting candidates only under newer scaffolds.  

**Take‑away:** The TZD‑based PIM inhibitors remained useful as early‑stage chemical tools but did not progress to clinical candidates, and the original AstraZeneca effort was eventually abandoned in favour of more drug‑like chemotypes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / explicit prediction in the blog post | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| *“The phenol is a liability; removing it should improve potency and drug‑likeness.”* | Substituted aryls without phenols gave sub‑10 nM potency and better selectivity. | Correct (potency improved; however, overall drug‑likeness remained limited). |
| *“Selectivity profiling is essential; a series with poor selectivity would be discarded.”* | The team performed a 400‑kinase panel; the best analogues showed >100‑fold selectivity and were retained for tool‑compound use. | Accurate; the series survived early profiling but later was dropped for other reasons. |
| *“A thiazolidinedione scaffold, while not ideal, is acceptable for a tool compound if it can be made selective.”* | The TZD analogues were distributed as research probes (e.g., Chemical Probes Portal) but never became a standard, widely‑used probe. | Partially true – they were used sparingly, indicating limited adoption. |
| *“If a drug company had pursued this series, the combination of a reactive thio‑/carbonyl group and modest selectivity would likely have killed the project.”* | AstraZeneca indeed deprioritised the series in favour of other chemotypes, citing metabolic liability and PK concerns. | Correct; the series was abandoned before clinical development. |
| *No explicit forecast of clinical success.* | No TZD‑based PIM inhibitor reached IND or market. | Consistent with the author’s cautious tone. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a solid illustration of how medicinal chemists can rescue a “dirty” screening hit, offering a concrete case study in early‑stage drug discovery. Its relevance is moderate because the chemistry did not translate into a therapeutic, but the discussion of selectivity profiling and scaffold optimisation remains instructive for both academia and industry.
