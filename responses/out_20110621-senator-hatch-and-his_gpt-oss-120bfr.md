# Senator Hatch And His Wonderful Industry (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The op‑ed lampoons Senator Orr Orrin Hatch for championing a “wonder‑drug” supplement industry that, according to the author, thrives because it sidesteps the rigorous pre‑clinical and clinical testing required of FDA‑approved medicines. The piece points to the Hatch‑Waxman law (the 1984 drug‑approval reform) and the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which Hatch co‑authored, as the legislative backbone that let supplement makers market products with sweeping health claims while avoiding FDA oversight. The author also insinuates that Hatch’s family and business associates have personally profited from this regulatory environment.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Legislative background** – The 1984 Hatch‑Waxman Act re‑balanced the market for brand‑name and generic drugs; it did **not** deregulate dietary supplements. The real “boost” for supplements came from DSHEA (1994), which classified vitamins, minerals, herbs and other “dietary ingredients” as foods rather than drugs, allowing manufacturers to market them without pre‑market safety or efficacy data, provided they include the disclaimer “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA.” Hatch was a chief sponsor of DSHEA and continued to defend it throughout his Senate career.

**Market growth** – After 2011 the U.S. supplement market kept expanding. Industry reports estimate U.S. sales rose from roughly **$25 billion in 2010** to **$55 billion by 2022**, roughly doubling in a little over a decade. The growth has been driven by consumer interest in “wellness,” protein powders, probiotics, and botanical extracts.

**Regulatory actions** – While DSHEA left the FDA with limited pre‑market authority, the agency has stepped up post‑2011 enforcement:  

* 2015‑2020: The FDA issued dozens of warning letters to companies making unsubstantiated disease‑treatment claims (e.g., “cures cancer” or “treats Alzheimer’s”).  
* 2017: The FDA’s “New Dietary Ingredient” (NDI) guidance was tightened, requiring manufacturers to submit safety data for ingredients not marketed before 1994.  
* 2020: The FDA’s “Supplement Safety” initiative increased post‑market surveillance and led to several product recalls (e.g., contaminated kratom, heavy‑metal tainted herbal teas).  

These actions have not dismantled the industry but have introduced more scrutiny than existed in 2011.

**Political fallout** – Hatch retired from the Senate in 2019. No credible investigations have linked him or his immediate family to direct financial gain from supplement companies. The claims in the 2011 article remain unsubstantiated in the public record.

**Scientific outcomes** – Because supplements are not required to demonstrate efficacy, most have not been validated in large, randomized trials. A few ingredients (e.g., omega‑3 fatty acids, vitamin D, probiotics) have modest evidence for specific health effects, but the majority of products marketed with bold health promises have not shown clinically meaningful benefits.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not lay out explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Continued explosive growth of the supplement market** – *Outcome*: Accurate. U.S. sales roughly doubled from 2010 to 2022, and the global market exceeded $140 billion in 2023.
- **Minimal regulatory oversight, allowing “any damn thing” to be marketed** – *Outcome*: Partially correct. The industry remains largely unregulated compared with pharmaceuticals, but the FDA has increased enforcement, issued warning letters, and tightened NDI rules, curbing the most egregious false‑claim advertising.

No specific drug or technology predictions were made, so no direct comparison is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece is a pointed political commentary that touches on real legislative history (DSHEA) and the sizable supplement market, making it moderately interesting for readers of biotech policy, though it offers little new factual analysis.
