# Reactive Groups: Still Not So Reactive (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses chemical reactivity of functional groups in living biological systems (in vivo), challenging the prevailing assumption that electrophilic compounds are too reactive and promiscuous to be useful in drug discovery. It builds on earlier work from the Cravatt group at Scripps and highlights a new 2014 study from the Klein group at Heidelberg published in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*.

The Heidelberg researchers systematically profiled 72 compounds containing six different electrophilic groups (acrylamides, dimethylsulfonium salts, chloroacetamides, 2-bromodihydroisoxazoles, cyanoacetamides, and acyl imidazoles) against a panel of proteins under biologically relevant conditions. Surprisingly, most compounds showed minimal or no reactivity, even those typically considered "hot" and liable. Acrylamides, dimethylsulfonium salts, cyanoacetamides, and acyl imidazoles showed little to no inhibition or unspecific protein modification. Only chloroacetamides showed notable reactivity with GSH (glutathione), but even this was milder than expected. Critically, many of these functional groups were *not* indiscriminately reactive in a cellular context.

The authors concluded that promiscuous reactivity and off-target effects of moderately reactive electrophiles are often overestimated, and that excluding these valuable functional groups from screening libraries may not be justified. The article advocates a more empirical, data-driven approach to evaluate electrophilic compounds, suggesting that many potentially useful and novel chemical entities are being overlooked due to unfounded fears.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 article and the research it highlighted were prescient, arriving just as irreversible and covalent drugs were beginning a major resurgence in the pharmaceutical industry.

The publication of this article coincided with the early stages of a renaissance for targeted covalent inhibitors. Boehringer Ingelheim's afatinib (Gilotrif), an irreversible EGFR inhibitor for non-small cell lung cancer, had been approved by the FDA in 2013, providing a high-profile clinical and commercial success (it later achieved blockbuster status with over $1 billion in annual sales). Ibrutinib (Imbruvica), a covalent BTK inhibitor for hematological cancers, was also approved in late 2013/early 2014, eventually becoming a multi-billion dollar drug. These successes provided robust clinical proof-of-concept for the covalent drug strategy, demonstrating that targeted covalent inhibitors could be both safe and highly efficacious.

Motivated by this validation, academic groups and pharmaceutical companies intensified their efforts to systematically profile and validate electrophilic reactive groups. Building on the foundational work cited in the article, researchers began identifying the precise protein targets within entire proteomes that engaged electrophilic probes and defining the specific binding motifs (e.g., reactive cysteine residues) responsible for their selectivity. This led to the development of advanced chemoproteomic platforms and screening libraries specifically designed to harness electrophilic functionality. Companies increasingly embraced covalent strategies for traditionally "undruggable" targets, often leveraging the very reactive groups (like acrylamides) noted for their cleanness in the 2014 study.

The technical and conceptual advances of this period culminated in a critical event in late 2020 and early 2021: the development and emergency use authorization of nirmatrelvir (co-packaged with ritonavir as Paxlovid), a highly successful COVID-19 antiviral from Pfizer. Its discovery and clinical success directly relied on using electrophilic warheads, including nitriles, to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Paxlovid demonstrated high efficacy in preventing severe COVID-19, was quickly adopted worldwide, and played a crucial role in the pandemic response.

Public and industry policy also shifted. While safety assessments remained paramount, regulatory bodies like the FDA became increasingly comfortable evaluating and approving modern covalent drugs, particularly as the stringent design principles and clinical evidence for their target selectivity and benefit-risk ratio became established. The perceived "danger" of electrophilic groups diminished considerably, replaced by a more sophisticated appreciation of how to design and evaluate reactive compounds. The insights from systematic profiling, as highlighted in the 2014 article, contributed significantly to this paradigm shift, moving drug discovery away from blanket avoidance to a rational, evidence-based integration of covalent strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article, and particularly the research it discusses, contained several explicit and implicit predictions about the direction of chemistry-driven drug discovery and the feasibility of employing electrophilic functional groups:

*   **Prediction:** **Systematically profiling electrophiles is crucial and will reveal many are safer than anticipated.** The Heidelberg study strongly suggested that empirically measuring reactivity in cellular contexts would often defy conventional chemical intuition and provide a path towards rational use.
    *   **Outcome:** **This was strongly validated.** Chemoproteomics and reactivity profiling became standard practice. Acrylamides, specifically noted for being "quite clean," are now a cornerstone warhead in targeted covalent drug discovery (e.g., in numerous kinase inhibitors and for KRAS G12C inhibitors like sotorasib). The principle that moderate electrophiles can be highly selective in a biological environment is now a foundational concept, directly enabling the development of modern covalent drugs for "undruggable" targets.

*   **Prediction:** **Promiscuous reactivity and off-target effects of moderately reactive groups are often overestimated, and excluding reactive moieties from screening libraries is not justified.**
    *   **Outcome:** **This was strongly validated.** Drug discovery has largely moved past reflexive exclusion of reactive groups. The philosophy pivoted from *whether* to use an electrophile to *how* to design one effectively (i.e., matching reactivity with optimal non-covalent interactions and binding site geometry). The development of KRAS G12C inhibitors, which exclusively and effectively use covalent warheads, demonstrates a therapeutic area where activating this approach was critical.

*   **Prediction (Implicit):** **There are a lot of potentially useful compounds that have been overlooked due to unfounded fears, leading to missed opportunities for innovation.**
    *   **Outcome:** **This was strongly validated.** The resurgence of covalent drugs unlocked new therapeutic modalities for historically challenging targets. The success of nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) is a powerful example, where nitrile and other electrophilic warheads were essential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. This demonstrates that potential antiviral blockbusters hinged on the very chemical groups the field had previously approached with extreme caution.

*   **Prediction (Implicit):** **Moderately reactive groups, with their potential for potent and sustained target engagement, will prove viable and even superior to traditional reversible drugs for certain therapeutic contexts.**
    *   **Outcome:** **This was strongly validated.** Targeted covalent drugs have become a mainstay in oncology (e.g., afatinib, ibrutinib, sotorasib) and other areas. They often provide benefits over reversible inhibitors in terms of potency, durability of response, and overcoming mutations, particularly for targets where achieving prolonged and complete inhibition is paramount for clinical efficacy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article was remarkably prescient, appearing just before a major resurgence in covalent drug discovery and articulating core principles—validated empirically—that would become foundational for designing safe and effective electrophilic therapeutics, ultimately contributing to breakthroughs in cancer therapy and antiviral development.
