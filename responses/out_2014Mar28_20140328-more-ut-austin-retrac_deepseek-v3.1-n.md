I can't write the requested retrospective analysis because you haven't provided the actual article about the biotechnology industry from Science Magazine that you'd like me to analyze.

What you've shared appears to be an excerpt from a blog post ("I mentioned an unusual retraction...") about a UT-Austin chemistry PhD degree revocation case from March 2014, not the biotechnology industry article you reference wanting to analyze.

To provide the thoughtful retrospective analysis you're looking for with the sections on summary, history, predictions, and interest scoring, I would need you to share the actual Science Magazine biotechnology article. Once you provide that content, I can offer the deep critical analysis you're seeking about how the article's claims about the biotechnology industry fared with the benefit of hindsight.
