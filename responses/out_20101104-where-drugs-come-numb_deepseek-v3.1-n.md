# Where Drugs Come From: The Numbers (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes a Nature Reviews Drug Discovery study tracking the origins of 252 FDA-approved drugs from 1998-2007, quantifying which sectors produced new medicines. The raw numbers showed pharmaceutical companies contributed 58% of drugs, biotech 18%, and universities 16% (transferred to biotech) plus 8% (transferred to pharma). However, the analysis revealed important qualitative differences: when examining drugs addressing unmet medical needs (FDA priority reviews), biotech rose to 30% and universities to 23%, while pharma dropped to 46%. For scientifically innovative drugs, universities led with 31%, followed by pharma at 44% and biotech at 25%. The author argues this pattern reflects economic incentives - larger pharmaceutical companies prioritize blockbuster potential and existing portfolio fit, while smaller biotech companies and universities are more willing to pursue novel mechanisms, especially in orphan diseases with smaller markets. The article specifically mentions failed high-profile attempts at novel mechanisms in large markets like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's.

## 2. HISTORY
The trends identified in this 2010 article have largely persisted and even intensified over the subsequent decade-plus. The biotech sector's role in drug innovation has continued to grow, with smaller companies increasingly responsible for breakthrough therapies while large pharma maintains dominance in incremental innovations and blockbuster drugs. The orphan drug sector expanded significantly - the FDA approved over 600 orphan drugs by 2023, with many developed by smaller biotechs and later acquired by larger companies. Several of the specific drug classes mentioned as failures did indeed fail: torcetrapib and other HDL-raising cardiovascular drugs never succeeded, PPAR agonists largely failed in diabetes, CB1 antagonists for obesity were abandoned due to psychiatric side effects, and gamma-secretase inhibitors for Alzheimer's continued to fail in subsequent trials. Meanwhile, the biotech funding ecosystem evolved, with more venture capital flowing to early-stage companies pursuing novel mechanisms, and pharmaceutical companies increasingly relying on acquisitions of innovative biotechs rather than internal R&D. The trend toward targeting smaller, genetically-defined patient populations accelerated with the rise of precision medicine and gene therapies, areas where biotechs have been particularly active. However, drug pricing pressures and reimbursement challenges have made the economics of orphan drugs more complex than simple blockbuster-versus-orphan dichotomies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **That large pharma would continue pursuing novel mechanisms in large markets but fail**: **Mostly accurate**. Multiple high-profile failures occurred in Alzheimer's (multiple anti-amyloid and other approaches), cardiovascular disease, and other large indications through the 2010s and early 2020s. However, there have been some successes.
- **That smaller companies would remain more likely to "push the envelope"**: **Accurate**. The biotech sector has continued to drive innovation in areas like gene therapy, cell therapy, and novel modalities, with many eventually acquired by larger pharma companies.
- **That commercial potential would continue driving which companies pursue which opportunities**: **Accurate**. The economic incentives described have largely persisted, with large pharma continuing to prioritize pipeline fit and market size while biotechs have pursued more niche or innovative opportunities.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article provided an early quantitative framework for understanding the different innovation roles played by various sectors in drug development, establishing patterns that have continued for over a decade. While not revolutionary, it offered empirical grounding for discussions about pharmaceutical innovation that remain relevant to drug development strategy and policy debates today.
