# Gene Editing Therapies Thunder Along (March 2015)

## 1. Summary

The article provides an overview of the therapeutic gene editing landscape circa 2015, highlighting the excitement around CRISPR/Cas9 technology while noting that zinc finger nucleases and TALENs were also being pursued. The author notes that huge amounts of money were flowing into the field due to CRISPR's apparent superiority over previous approaches.

The key challenge identified is not the editing itself, but ensuring that modified cells successfully engraft and proliferate. Blood disorders are highlighted as a natural fit because bone marrow can be extracted, modified, and reinfused (similar to CAR-T approaches). For other cell types, challenges include incomplete understanding of stem cell behavior and difficulty clearing defective cell populations.

The article describes several gene editing strategies: disrupting defective genes, replacing them with working versions, or adding working copies alongside existing ones. The author anticipates extensive human clinical trials, questions how predictive animal models will be, and predicts a turbulent path ahead with dramatic successes and failures requiring substantial financial resources and courage.

## 2. History

Subsequent developments have largely validated the article's assessment of gene editing's trajectory, though with notable specific outcomes:

**CRISPR/Cas9 dominance**: CRISPR/Cas9 became the dominant gene editing platform, largely displacing zinc finger nucleases and TALENs for most therapeutic applications due to its efficiency and ease of use.

**FDA approvals and clinical progress**: 
- **Luxturna** (voretigene neparvovec, 2017): First gene therapy approved by FDA for inherited retinal disease (though this uses AAV gene addition rather than editing)
- **Zolgensma** (onasemnogene abeparvovec, 2019): Gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy
- **CASGEVY** (exagamglogene autotemcel, 2023): First CRISPR-based gene editing therapy approved by FDA and EMA for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia

**Blood disorder successes**: The prediction about blood disorders being a natural fit proved prescient. Several gene editing therapies for hemoglobinopathies reached late-stage clinical trials, with CASGEVY representing the breakthrough approval showing ex vivo gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells could successfully treat sickle cell disease.

**CAR-T expansion**: CAR-T therapies became established cancer treatments with multiple FDA approvals (Kymriah, Yescarta, others), validating the bone marrow modification approach referenced in the article.

**Delivery challenges**: In vivo gene editing has proven more challenging than ex vivo approaches, with ongoing research into delivery vectors and targeting specific tissues.

**Business landscape**: Companies like CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics, and Editas Medicine became major players, with valuations reflecting the field's promise. Significant pharmaceutical partnerships emerged.

## 3. Predictions

• **"Blood disorders are a natural fit"** ✓ **CORRECT**: This prediction proved accurate. The first approved CRISPR therapy (CASGEVY) treats sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, and numerous other blood disorder programs have advanced through clinical trials.

• **"Gene editing may turn out to be the easy part"** ✓ **PARTIALLY CORRECT**: While gene editing technology advanced dramatically, delivery and engraftment remain significant challenges, particularly for in vivo applications. The "easy part" comment underestimated remaining technical hurdles but correctly identified that cell biology and delivery would be limiting factors.

• **"We don't always have a good handle on stem-cell precursors"** ✓ **CORRECT**: Stem cell biology remains complex, and achieving efficient editing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells required years of optimization, as evidenced by the timeline to CASGEVY's approval.

• **"A lot of experimentation is going to be done in the clinic"** ✓ **CORRECT**: Extensive human clinical trials occurred, with thousands of patients treated in gene editing trials worldwide. Some animal model limitations were indeed encountered.

• **"Dramatic successes, dramatic failures"** ✓ **PARENTHESIS CORRECT**: The field experienced both—major successes like CASGEVY, but also clinical trial setbacks, safety concerns, and programs that failed to show efficacy.

## 4. Interest

**Rating: 9/10**

The article demonstrates remarkable prescience about gene editing's trajectory, correctly identifying both the technology's promise and the key biological challenges that would shape its clinical translation, making it highly interesting for understanding how a revolutionary technology moved from laboratory tool to approved medicine.
