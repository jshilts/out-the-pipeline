# GSK with AstraZeneca? (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short piece, published on 4 May 2012, treats a Reuters headline—“GSK rejects idea of buying AstraZeneca”—as the main news item. It then veers into absurdist satire, claiming that Delta Air Lines has turned down a plan to build its long‑range jets from bamboo and stale Fig Newton bars, and that Burger King has dismissed a proposal to sell Birkenstock sandals inside hamburger buns. The tone is deliberately tongue‑in‑cheek, using the real pharmaceutical M&A rumor as a springboard for a series of obviously fictitious “business news” items.

## 2. HISTORY  
**GSK and AstraZeneca after 2012**  
- **No merger materialized.** Both companies remained independent, pursued separate strategic paths, and never entered serious merger talks.  
- **GSK’s restructuring:**  
  - 2015 – GSK acquired Novartis’ oncology portfolio (including the T‑cell therapy platform) for $2.7 bn, shifting focus toward specialty medicines.  
  - 2020 – GSK announced a major spin‑off of its consumer‑health division; the new company, **Haleon**, launched in January 2022.  
  - 2022‑2023 – GSK completed the acquisition of **Cytokinetics’** cardiac‑muscle contractility assets and entered a partnership with **Mitsubishi Tanabe** for gene‑therapy development.  
- **AstraZeneca’s trajectory:**  
  - Continued to double‑down on oncology and respiratory disease, launching several blockbuster drugs (e.g., **Tagrisso** for EGFR‑mutant lung cancer, approved 2015).  
  - Played a leading role in the COVID‑19 response, co‑developing the **Vaxzevria** (AstraZeneca‑Oxford) vaccine, which received emergency use authorizations worldwide in 2020‑2021.  
  - 2020 – AstraZeneca acquired **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** for $39 bn, expanding its rare‑disease portfolio.  
- **Industry‑wide M&A context:** The 2010s saw a wave of large‑scale deals (e.g., **Bristol‑Myers Squibb‑Celgene 2019**, **Pfizer‑Wyeth 2009**, **Merck‑Schering Plough 2009**), but a GSK‑AstraZeneca combination never entered the market.  

**The satirical side‑notes** (Delta’s bamboo jets, Burger King’s sandal‑in‑bun concept) remained pure comedy; no such initiatives were ever pursued by the companies mentioned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not articulate explicit forecasts, but its implicit suggestion was that a GSK‑AstraZeneca merger would **not** happen. The factual outcome aligns with that implication:

- **Prediction (implicit):** GSK will not acquire AstraZeneca.  
  - **Outcome:** Correct. No acquisition occurred; both firms stayed separate and later pursued distinct strategic moves.  

No other concrete predictions were made, so there is nothing further to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10**  
The piece is a brief, humorous commentary rather than substantive analysis; its only lasting relevance is as a snapshot of the speculative M&A chatter surrounding two major pharma players in 2012.
