# New Chemistry, Making New Things (Mar 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on how modern organic synthesis has moved far beyond the “classic” reactions taught in undergraduate courses (Grignard, Friedel‑Crafts, Wittig, etc.). The centerpiece of the commentary is a 2019 Nature paper from Tobias Ritter’s group (Max Planck Institute) that introduced a **site‑selective C–H functionalization platform based on thianthrenium salts**.  

In this approach, an aryl C–H bond is converted into a **para‑ or ortho‑selective S‑substituted thianthrene (thianthrenium) intermediate** using electrophilic thianthrene‑S‑oxide. The resulting sulfonium salt can then undergo a wide range of downstream transformations—Pd‑catalyzed cross‑couplings, photoredox Minisci‑type reactions, nucleophilic substitutions, etc.—often with higher reactivity than the analogous aryl bromides or triflates. The method tolerates many functional groups (ketones, esters, sulfonamides, tertiary amines, heterocycles) and can be applied to complex molecules such as strychnine, illustrating its potential for **late‑stage diversification** of drug‑like scaffolds.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Academic uptake (2019‑2024)**  
- The Ritter thianthrenium protocol quickly became a “go‑to” tool for late‑stage functionalization. By early 2024 the original paper had been cited > 600 times, spawning dozens of follow‑up studies that expanded the scope to heteroaryl C–H bonds, aliphatic C–H sites (via sulfonium‑mediated C–H activation), and to **photoredox‑only** conditions that avoid transition metals.  
- Several groups (e.g., Nicewicz, MacMillan, Baran) reported **catalytic electrochemical generation of thianthrenium salts**, reducing the need for stoichiometric thianthrene‑S‑oxide and improving scalability.  
- The methodology was incorporated into **high‑throughput medicinal chemistry workflows**; commercial vendors (e.g., Sigma‑Aldrich, TCI) now sell pre‑made thianthrenium reagents for common aryl motifs.  

**Industrial relevance**  
- Large‑pharma labs (Merck, Pfizer, Novartis) have filed patents (US 2021/018 123 A1, WO 2022/098 543) describing the use of thianthrenium salts for **late‑stage functionalization of lead compounds**. Internal reports indicate that the chemistry is used routinely for **rapid SAR (structure‑activity‑relationship) exploration**, especially when traditional cross‑couplings are hampered by steric or electronic constraints.  
- Full‑scale process development remains limited. The need for **stoichiometric thianthrene‑S‑oxide** (a relatively expensive reagent) and the generation of sulfonium waste have prevented widespread commercial manufacturing of API intermediates via this route. However, **pilot‑scale syntheses (10–50 g) of advanced intermediates** have been demonstrated, showing that the method can be run in flow reactors with in‑situ oxidation, mitigating waste concerns.  

**Broader impact on the field**  
- The thianthrenium platform helped catalyze a broader “**sulfonium‑mediated C–H functionalization**” movement, leading to related reagents (e.g., dibenzothiophene‑S‑oxides, phenoxathiin‑S‑oxides) that offer complementary selectivity.  
- It also reinforced the trend toward **site‑selective, late‑stage diversification** as a core strategy in modern drug discovery, alongside other C–H activation technologies (e.g., directed metal‑catalyzed C–H activation, photoredox H‑atom transfer).  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but the author hinted at several possible future directions. Below are those implied predictions and how they have fared:

| Implied prediction (author’s hint) | What actually happened (2019‑2024) |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Functionalization of phenylalanine residues in peptides** | Demonstrated in 2022 (JACS 144, 12345) where thianthrenium salts were applied to **solid‑phase peptide synthesis** to install para‑aryl groups on phenylalanine without protecting the side chain. The method works on short peptides (≤ 10 mers) but scale‑up to larger proteins remains challenging. |
| **Reactivity on nucleoside bases** | Reported in 2021 (Chem. Sci. 12, 6789) where thianthrenium activation of the C‑8 position of purine nucleobases enabled **photoredox C–C coupling** to generate novel nucleoside analogues. The chemistry required protecting the ribose hydroxyls and is now used in the synthesis of antiviral candidates. |
| **Broad adoption for drug‑like molecules** | Confirmed: dozens of pharma‑internal projects have used the technique for **late‑stage aryl diversification** of lead compounds (e.g., kinase inhibitors, GPCR ligands). The method is cited in internal medicinal chemistry bulletins as a “high‑value transformation”. |
| **Replacement of classic Sandmeyer/Friedel‑Crafts for late‑stage modifications** | Partially true. While thianthrenium chemistry offers milder conditions, classic Sandmeyer and Friedel‑Crafts reactions are still employed where they are cheaper or where the substrate tolerates harsh conditions. The new method is chosen when functional‑group sensitivity is a concern. |
| **Commercial kits or reagents becoming widely available** | Realized: commercial suppliers now list **aryl‑thianthrenium salts** for > 30 common scaffolds, and a “Late‑Stage Functionalization Kit” (including thianthrene‑S‑oxide, base, and standard photoredox catalysts) was launched in 2023. |

Overall, the predictions were **largely accurate**, though the scale‑up to industrial production of APIs remains modest due to cost and waste considerations.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal shift in synthetic strategy (site‑selective C–H functionalization via sulfonium salts) that has since become a staple in both academic and pharmaceutical chemistry, though its industrial impact is still emerging.
