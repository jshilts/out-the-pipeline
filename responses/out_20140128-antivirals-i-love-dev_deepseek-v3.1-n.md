# Antivirals: I love the deviousness of it all (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This appears to be a brief blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog at Science magazine, published in January 2014. The post references and links to an external article discussing HIV antiviral research and what appears to be drug repurposing work. The title suggests an appreciation for clever or unconventional approaches to antiviral drug development. The author mentions being unable to directly comment on the research at the time but indicates interest in the "devious" or innovative strategy employed.

The full context of what specific HIV research or repurposed compound was discussed requires accessing the linked external source, which would provide details about the particular antiviral mechanism or compound being examined.

## 2. HISTORY
HIV antiviral therapy has evolved significantly since 2014. The standard of care for HIV treatment has continued to be antiretroviral therapy (ART), typically involving combination regimens. Several new antiretroviral drugs have been approved by the FDA since 2014, including integrase inhibitors like bictegravir and novel formulations of existing drugs designed to improve adherence and reduce side effects.

Drug repurposing has remained a significant strategy in antiviral research, with particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic when existing drugs were rapidly evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 activity. The approach of finding new uses for approved compounds continues to be valuable due to reduced development timelines and known safety profiles.

The HIV treatment landscape has evolved toward long-acting injectable formulations and improved tolerability profiles, with continued emphasis on combination therapies to prevent resistance development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself does not appear to contain explicit predictions about the future of antiviral development, based on the provided excerpt. The post seems focused on commenting on contemporary research rather than making forward-looking statements.

If the linked article contained predictions about HIV treatment or antiviral strategies, these would need to be examined separately. The 2014 timeframe was relatively mature for HIV antiretroviral therapy, so predictions from that period might have focused on improved delivery methods, combination strategies, or novel targets rather than fundamental breakthroughs in antiviral mechanisms.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This appears to be a routine blog post linking to external HIV research content. While antiviral drug development is important, this particular piece seems more like a brief commentary or link-sharing rather than substantive analysis, limiting its long-term significance relative to more comprehensive reviews or primary research articles on antiviral strategies.

*Note: A complete analysis would benefit from access to the linked external article to fully understand the specific antiviral research being referenced and any predictions or claims made about that particular approach or compound.*
