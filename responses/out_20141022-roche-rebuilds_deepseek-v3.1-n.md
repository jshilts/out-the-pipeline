# Roche Rebuilds (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This October 2014 article reports on Roche's major infrastructure investment at its Basel headquarters, committing $1.8 billion to construct a new research center. The development plan included four new office and laboratory buildings designed to house 1,900 R&D staff, with the pharmaceuticals group (pRED) led by John Reed slated to occupy the new facilities. The timeline indicated that construction of an in vivo animal research center would be completed by 2018, and Roche planned to demolish older buildings to make way for a new office tower as part of a broader $3.2 billion building initiative.

The article also noted the author's recent visit to Basel, where they observed Roche's current office tower and commented that it lacked architectural distinction, mentioning local reports that more elaborate architectural plans had been scaled back due to cost considerations.

## 2. HISTORY

Roche proceeded with these ambitious infrastructure plans over the subsequent decade. The company successfully completed the construction projects in Basel, creating a major R&D hub that consolidated research operations. This infrastructure investment supported Roche's continued leadership in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, particularly in oncology, immunology, and rare diseases.

During this period, Roche achieved significant milestones with multiple FDA approvals and market successes. Key developments included:
- Continued success with cancer drugs like Perjeta and Kadcyla
- Breakthrough therapy designations and approvals for new medicines
- Significant expansion in personalized medicine capabilities

However, the pharmaceutical industry also faced challenges during this timeframe, including increased competition from biosimilars, patent expirations on major drugs, and rising R&D costs. John Reed, mentioned in the original article as head of pRED, continued to lead pharmaceutical research at Roche for several years following the article's publication, overseeing the integration of these new facilities.

The broader $3.2 billion building initiative represented longer-term strategic planning for Roche's Basel presence, reinforcing Switzerland's importance as the company's research and development epicenter alongside operations in other global locations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions identified:**
• Completion timeline for in vivo animal research center by 2018
• Successful completion of broader construction plans
• Housing 1,900 R&D staff in new facilities

**Outcomes:**
• Construction plans proceeded, though large-scale infrastructure projects of this magnitude typically encounter timeline adjustments and phased implementations that may deviate from initial projections
• The investment aligned with Roche's sustained R&D commitment in subsequent years
• The scale of the investment correlated with Roche's continued position as a leading global pharmaceutical company

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article covers a significant corporate real estate decision with implications for research capacity, but lacks broader scientific or industry-wide impact. The topic is moderately interesting to biotech industry observers focused on major company infrastructure and R&D expansion, but has limited implications for fundamental scientific advances or patient outcomes compared to drug development milestones or breakthrough therapies.
