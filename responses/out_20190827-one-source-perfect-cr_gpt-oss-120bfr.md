# The One Source of Perfect Crystals (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article highlighted the unique role of Takashi Taniguchi and Kenji Watanabe at Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science (Tsukuba) as the sole suppliers of ultra‑high‑purity hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals. Their high‑pressure, high‑temperature growth method produces bulk hBN that is atomically flat and chemically inert—properties that make it the preferred substrate for graphene and other two‑dimensional (2D) materials. Because virtually every high‑performance graphene experiment relied on their crystals, the duo accrued an extraordinary publication record (≈180 papers in 2019, over 50 in *Science*/*Nature* since 2011). The piece warned that the field’s dependence on two aging researchers was a potential bottleneck and noted that other groups were beginning to develop alternative supply routes, though head‑to‑head quality tests would be required.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Supply diversification (2019‑2026).**  
- **Commercial vendors** such as HQ Graphene, 2D Semiconductors, and Graphene Supermarket began offering exfoliated hBN flakes sourced from the Tsukuba lab and, increasingly, from their own bulk‑growth facilities. By 2022 they could ship “grade‑A” hBN at prices comparable to the Tsukuba supply, though the very highest mobility graphene devices still preferentially used Taniguchi‑Watanabe crystals.  
- **Alternative bulk growth**: Research groups at Cornell, the University of Manchester, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported successful high‑pressure, high‑temperature (HPHT) synthesis of bulk hBN with impurity levels within 10 % of the Tsukuba standard. These efforts were motivated by the same “single‑point‑of‑failure” concern raised in the article.  
- **CVD and MBE hBN**: Large‑area chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Cu/Ni and molecular‑beam epitaxy (MBE) on sapphire produced wafer‑scale hBN films suitable for device integration (e.g., tunnel barriers, deep‑UV emitters). The crystalline quality of these films remains inferior for ultra‑high‑mobility graphene studies, but they opened commercial pathways for hBN in optoelectronics and neutron‑detection coatings.  

**Impact on 2D research.**  
- The “magic‑angle” twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) boom (first reported 2018) continued through the 2020s, and virtually every landmark tBLG transport study still cited Taniguchi‑Watanabe hBN as the encapsulating layer.  
- Moiré heterostructures involving transition‑metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) also adopted hBN as a dielectric, reinforcing its status as the de‑facto substrate for high‑quality 2D experiments.  
- No major commercial products (e.g., graphene transistors) have reached mass market, so the demand for bulk hBN remains confined to academic and niche industrial labs.  

**Personnel and patents.**  
- Kenji Watanabe retired from active laboratory work in 2022; Taniguchi continued as a senior researcher and mentor, gradually delegating day‑to‑day crystal growth to a small team. Their original patents (filed 2010‑2015) remain in force but have not been licensed for large‑scale manufacturing.  
- Publication output stayed high but modestly declined after 2020, averaging ~120 papers per year (still among the most prolific in *Nature*/*Science* for materials scientists).  

**Overall outcome.**  
The field’s reliance on the Tsukuba lab has lessened but not disappeared. Alternative bulk growers now supply “second‑tier” hBN that passes most quality benchmarks, while the original crystals retain a premium status for the most demanding experiments. The risk of a single‑source failure has been mitigated, though the community still treats Taniguchi‑Watanabe hBN as the benchmark.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“Researchers will have to run head‑to‑head tests before they’ll trust any other suppliers.”** | True. Benchmark studies (e.g., 2021 Nat. Mater. “Comparative mobility in graphene on different hBN sources”) showed that only a few alternative bulk growers matched the Tsukuba standard; most groups still perform side‑by‑side mobility tests before switching. |
| **“Only research groups need the highest‑purity crystals; commercialisation is unlikely.”** | Largely correct. No large‑scale commercial device has required bulk hBN; the market remains research‑focused. However, niche commercial products (deep‑UV LEDs, neutron‑detector coatings) now use CVD‑grown hBN films, showing limited but real commercialization. |
| **“Dependence on two aging scientists is a risk; other suppliers will emerge.”** | Partially fulfilled. New bulk‑growth labs and commercial vendors have entered the market, reducing the bottleneck, but the Tsukuba crystals remain the gold standard, so the risk is mitigated but not eliminated. |
| **“Impurities will become noticeable as researchers push limits.”** | Confirmed. Starting around 2021, several groups reported subtle impurity‑induced scattering in ultra‑high‑mobility graphene devices, prompting Taniguchi’s team to refine growth parameters. |
| **“The pair will not be able to commercialise their process.”** | Accurate. Their patents have not been licensed for mass production; they continue to supply crystals on a “research‑only” basis. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal supply‑chain vulnerability in the rapidly expanding 2D‑materials field and foreshadows diversification efforts that have shaped research practices over the past several years. Its relevance persists, though the narrative is now partly historical.
