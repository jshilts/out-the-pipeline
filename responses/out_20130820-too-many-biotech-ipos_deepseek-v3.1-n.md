# Too Many Biotech IPOs? (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes the surge in biotech and small pharma IPOs during 2013, noting that 29 companies had gone public that year through August, including eight since just the end of June. This marked a dramatic increase from only eleven IPOs in 2012 and even fewer during the 2007-2008 financial crisis period. 

The author expresses concern that this "boom period" represents market momentum that may be pushing companies of varying quality into the public markets. He suggests that after the initial wave of stronger companies that had been waiting for better conditions, the IPO market may be reaching "the bottom of the sack" where lower-quality companies with potential issues are now coming to market. The commentary anticipates that the IPO window may soon close, potentially catching good companies in a market downturn.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2013-2015 period did indeed represent a significant biotech IPO boom, with the momentum continuing beyond the article's publication. According to industry data, 2014 saw approximately 66 biotech IPOs, more than double the 29 mentioned in the August 2013 article, making it one of the most active years on record. The boom continued into early 2015 before market conditions shifted.

However, the biotech sector experienced a significant correction starting in mid-2015 that lasted through early 2016, with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declining roughly 30% from its peak. This downturn did indeed "whipsaw" many companies, both those that had recently gone public and those planning IPOs, leading to a much tighter IPO window and numerous postponed offerings. The market volatility reflected broader concerns about drug pricing, regulatory uncertainty, and macroeconomic conditions.

The companies that went public during the 2013-2015 boom period experienced widely varying outcomes. Some, particularly those with promising clinical assets, went on to successful drug approvals and significant market value growth. Others struggled with clinical failures, regulatory setbacks, or cash burn issues. The period also saw increased scrutiny of drug pricing models and business practices, which became a major policy focus in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"We're getting near the bottom of the sack" - quality concerns**: The author suggested lower-quality companies would follow the initial wave. **Outcome**: The IPO boom actually continued for nearly two more years with 2014 being even stronger than 2013, suggesting sustained investor appetite rather than immediate quality deterioration at the time.

• **"Soon we'll probably be in the part of the cycle where good companies... get whipsawed by a closing IPO window"**: **Outcome**: This prediction proved largely accurate, though the timing was longer than "soon" implied. The IPO window remained open through most of 2014 and into 2015 before the mid-2015 biotech correction significantly tightened market access for nearly a year.

• **Market volatility and timing risks**: The article's concern about market instability catching companies at inopportune times reflected reasonable caution. **Outcome**: The 2015-2016 biotech downturn did create challenging conditions for many companies, with some experiencing significant valuation declines and limited access to follow-on financing.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
The article captures an important moment in biotech market cycles and demonstrates reasonable insight into IPO market dynamics, though it underestimates the duration of the boom. It provides useful context about industry financing trends but lacks specific company or therapeutic area analysis that would enhance its long-term relevance.
