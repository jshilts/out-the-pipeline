# Plain Alcohols as Hetero-Alkylating Agents (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Nature paper from the Macmillan group that demonstrated a novel photoredox catalysis method for using simple alcohols as alkylating agents on nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The reaction uses an iridium photocatalyst, a thiol cocatalyst, and blue LED irradiation to achieve bond formations that were previously inaccessible. Key advantages highlighted include operational simplicity—requiring only nitrogen purging instead of extensive degassing—and broad applicability to medicinal chemistry-relevant substrates like pyridines and isoquinolines. The author draws parallels to the transformative impact of palladium coupling reactions in the 1980s-1990s, suggesting this methodology could similarly reshape organic synthesis.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2015 publication, photoredox catalysis did experience substantial growth and adoption in pharmaceutical and academic settings. The Macmillan group's alcohol alkylation work represented one of several important advances in visible-light-mediated transformations. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly incorporated photoredox methods into medicinal chemistry workflows for building molecular libraries and late-stage functionalization. However, these reactions often required specialized equipment, careful optimization, and sometimes exhibited scaling challenges in industrial applications. Over the subsequent decade, photoredox catalysis evolved from an emerging field to a standard synthetic tool, with numerous reviews and books covering the methodology. The specific alcohol alkylation reaction described in this work became part of an expanding toolkit, but did not singularly revolutionize medicinal chemistry workflow in the way palladium couplings had decades earlier.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"This method of installing inert alkyl groups will probably find wide application in the medicinal chemistry community"**: This prediction proved partially correct. Photoredox catalysis generally did find adoption in medicinal chemistry, and alcohol alkylation specifically provided a useful method for certain transformations. However, it did not become a universally applied "wide application" technique on par with more fundamental reactions like Suzuki couplings or amide bond formations. The method found its niche but remained one of many tools rather than a dominant methodology.

• **Implicit prediction that such reactions would transform organic synthesis similarly to palladium couplings**: Photoredox catalysis did become an important and widely used methodology, but it did not achieve the same level of fundamental impact as palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, which became absolutely foundational to modern synthesis across all areas. Photoredox reactions are now standard tools but are more specialized and less universally applied than palladium couplings.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While this article highlighted an important synthetic methodology that did gain adoption, the prediction of transformation on par with palladium couplings proved overly optimistic, limiting its broader historical significance.
