# Chemistry-Themed Books for Non-Chemist Readers (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a curated bibliography of chemistry-themed books aimed at general readers, written by a chemist blogger who previously covered specialist medicinal chemistry texts. The author organizes recommendations into several categories: visually rich element-focused books (Theodore Gray's *The Elements*, *Molecules*, and related merchandise), popular narrative chemistry books (Sam Kean's *The Disappearing Spoon*, *Napoleon's Buttons*), historical accounts (Thomas Hager's works on Haber-Bosch and sulfanilamide), chemistry-themed memoirs (Oliver Sacks' *Uncle Tungsten*, Primo Levi's *The Periodic Table*), cooking science books (*The Food Lab*, Harold McGee's *On Food and Cooking*), and DIY chemistry experiment guides (Thompson's *Illustrated Guide to Home Chemistry Experiments*, Bassam Shakhashiri's demonstration series). The piece serves as a gift guide, providing brief commentary on each title's strengths and characteristics, with an emphasis on accessibility for non-specialists.

## 2. HISTORY

The article was published as a blog post and gift guide in December 2016, recommending books that either were already well-established or newly available. In the subsequent years, many of the titles endorsed here have remained popular and widely referenced in science communication circles. Theodore Gray's books and merchandise continued to be commercial successes and educational staples. Several of the authors mentioned have published additional works or updated editions, but the core recommendations in this guide have largely endured as reliable introductory resources for lay readers interested in chemistry. The piece itself represents a snapshot of early-to-mid 2010s science popularization literature rather than a commentary on biotechnology industry developments or policy; its practical impact is primarily educational and cultural, helping general readers choose accessible chemistry books.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article includes minimal explicit prediction. Its structure as a book list implies an expectation that the titles would remain relevant and useful to readers, and this has largely held true. The author's implicit confidence in established books like *The Elements* and *Uncle Tungsten* appears validated by their continued popularity and commercial availability. However, since the piece focuses on recommending existing books rather than forecasting future trends, there are no concrete predictions to evaluate against subsequent outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This article is a well-intentioned book list for general readers, but it is off-topic relative to the biotechnology industry and lacks long-term importance for analyzing industry developments.
