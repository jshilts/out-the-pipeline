# How Many New Drug Targets Aren’t Even Real? (Sep 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on a 2011 internal Bayer study that surveyed 23 laboratory heads responsible for 67 early‑stage target‑validation projects (mostly oncology). The scientists compared the published literature that had motivated each project with the data they generated in‑house. Only ~20‑25 % of the projects showed full agreement with the published results; in roughly two‑thirds of the cases the published data were inconsistent enough to delay or abort the program. The author attributes the gap mainly to small sample sizes, statistical noise, and the “publish‑or‑perish” pressure that favors positive findings. The piece stresses that the problem is one of irreproducibility—not fraud—and that drug‑discovery teams must treat every new target claim with skepticism before committing resources.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Industry‑wide acknowledgement of a reproducibility crisis (2012‑2020).**  
- **Amgen (2018)** published a systematic attempt to replicate 53 high‑impact cancer‑biology studies; only 6 (≈11 %) reproduced key findings.  
- **The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology** (2014‑2020) similarly reported low replication rates, reinforcing Bayer’s 2011 observations.  

**Shift in target‑validation practices.**  
- **CRISPR‑based genetic screens** (mid‑2010s onward) became a standard, allowing rapid, genome‑wide loss‑of‑function validation that is less prone to the small‑sample biases cited in the Bayer survey.  
- **Open‑science consortia** (e.g., the **Open Targets Platform**, launched 2014) aggregate genetics, expression, and functional data to provide independent, publicly vetted evidence for target relevance.  
- **Pre‑clinical reproducibility initiatives** funded by the NIH (e.g., the **Reproducibility and Robustness Initiative**, 2014) and by pharma (e.g., **Bayer‑Novartis “Target Validation Alliance”** 2015‑2018) introduced standard operating procedures, blinded replication, and data‑sharing mandates.  

**Impact on drug pipelines and investment.**  
- **Failure rates remained high.** From 2011 to 2023, ≈90 % of drug candidates entering Phase I failed to reach market, a figure consistent with the article’s implication that many early targets never survive.  
- **Success stories where rigorous validation paid off** include PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab) and PARP inhibitors (olaparib). Both benefited from strong genetic/clinical evidence before large‑scale investment.  
- **High‑profile disappointments** such as BACE‑inhibitors for Alzheimer’s disease (multiple Phase III failures 2015‑2021) illustrate that even well‑publicized targets can collapse when later data (often from more robust models) contradict early reports.  

**Policy and cultural changes.**  
- **Journals introduced stricter reporting standards** (e.g., Nature’s “Transparent Reporting of Methods” checklist, 2013) and many now require raw data deposition.  
- **Funding agencies began to require replication plans** for high‑risk, high‑reward proposals (NIH’s “Reproducibility and Rigor” policies, 2015).  
- **Biotech venture capital** became more cautious about “unvalidated” targets, often demanding orthogonal genetic or pharmacologic evidence before committing capital.  

Overall, the concerns raised by Bayer in 2011 have been substantiated by multiple independent studies, and they have driven concrete changes in how pharmaceutical companies and academic labs approach target validation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations. Below are the implied predictions and how they fared:

| Implied prediction (2011) | Outcome (2024‑2026) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Only a minority (~20‑25 %) of published target claims will hold up under in‑house testing.** | Confirmed. Independent replication studies (Amgen 2018, Reproducibility Project) report reproducibility rates between 10‑30 % for high‑impact preclinical work. |
| **Irreproducibility will be a major source of wasted R&D spend.** | Still true. Industry analyses estimate that 30‑40 % of preclinical spend is lost on targets that later fail due to weak or non‑reproducible data. |
| **Pharma will need to develop more rigorous, internal validation pipelines.** | Realized. CRISPR screens, orthogonal pharmacology, and cross‑company validation consortia are now routine in most large drug‑discovery groups. |
| **The “publish‑or‑perish” pressure will continue to bias the literature toward positive results.** | Partially mitigated. Journals now encourage negative results and pre‑registration, but the bias persists, especially in early‑stage biology. |
| **Venture capital will become more skeptical of academic‑originated targets.** | Observed. VC term sheets increasingly require multiple lines of genetic/clinical evidence; many funds now specialize in “target de‑risking” before a full‑scale program. |

No explicit bold predictions (e.g., “by 2020 half of all oncology pipelines will be cut”) were made, so the evaluation focuses on the article’s underlying expectations.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece is a concise, data‑backed snapshot of a problem that later proved to be a systemic issue across biomedicine; its relevance has only grown, though the article itself is brief and lacks detailed methodology.
