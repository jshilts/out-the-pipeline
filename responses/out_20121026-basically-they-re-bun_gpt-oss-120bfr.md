# Basically, They're A Bunch of Lemmings (October 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece quotes Raghuram Selveraju of Aegis Capital criticizing big‑pharma business‑development teams for “lemming‑like” behaviour: when a target or therapeutic area becomes hot, every major company rushes to acquire or license a molecule in that space. Selveraju argues this herd mentality stems from declining R&D productivity and leads to costly deal failures (the article links to a 2012 list of high‑profile deal collapses).  

To break the cycle he recommends a shift toward **incremental innovation**—using the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway, pursuing biosimilars, repurposing existing drugs, and focusing on niche or specialty indications rather than large primary‑care markets. The tone is skeptical that such a conservative strategy would keep pharma at the cutting edge of discovery.

## 2. HISTORY  

### R&D productivity trends (2012‑2026)  
- **Continued productivity slowdown**: Multiple independent analyses (e.g., the Tufts Center, 2020) show that the number of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved per billion dollars of R&D spending has not improved markedly since the early 2010s.  
- **External innovation models**: In response, the “big‑pharma‑as‑venture‑capitalist” model expanded. Companies such as Roche, Novartis, and Johnson & Johnson increased external collaborations, licensing, and acquisition of biotech start‑ups, especially in gene‑therapy, mRNA, and cell‑based modalities.  

### Adoption of 505(b)(2) and incremental products  
- **Growth of 505(b)(2) filings**: The FDA’s annual reports show a steady rise in 505(b)(2) submissions, from roughly 30 in 2012 to over 80 by 2024. Many of these were new formulations, fixed‑dose combinations, or new indications for existing molecules (e.g., a 2021 505(b)(2) approval for a once‑daily formulation of an older antihypertensive).  
- **Commercial impact**: Incremental products have become a reliable revenue stream for some firms (e.g., Teva’s “generic‑plus” portfolio), but they have not replaced the pursuit of breakthrough therapies in the overall R&D budget.  

### Biosimilars  
- **Market expansion**: The biosimilar market exploded after the 2015 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). By 2025, over 30 biosimilars were approved in the U.S., capturing roughly 15 % of the biologics market share. Companies such as Sandoz, Amgen, and Pfizer built dedicated biosimilar units.  
- **Strategic shift**: Large innovators (e.g., AbbVie, Roche) responded by developing “next‑generation” biologics and by acquiring biosimilar developers, rather than abandoning primary‑care biologics altogether.  

### Focus on niche/specialty indications  
- **Real‑world shift**: Many big pharma have indeed re‑balanced pipelines toward oncology, rare diseases, and specialty immunology. For example, Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s 2020‑2025 pipeline was >60 % oncology/immune‑modulation.  
- **Primary‑care presence**: Nevertheless, legacy primary‑care products (e.g., statins, antihypertensives) remain sizable revenue generators, especially for companies that spun off consumer‑health divisions (e.g., Pfizer’s 2020 split). The wholesale abandonment Selveraju implied never materialized.  

### Alzheimer’s and other “high‑risk” areas  
- **Continued failures**: The majority of late‑stage Alzheimer’s trials still failed through 2022, confirming the high‑risk nature Selveraju highlighted.  
- **Recent approvals**: Aducanumab (2021) and lecanemab (2023) received accelerated approvals, but uptake has been limited by pricing, reimbursement, and safety concerns, so the “big‑pharma‑herd” in Alzheimer’s remains modest.  

### Overall business‑development behaviour  
- **Deal activity**: M&A volume stayed high. From 2012‑2024, big pharma spent >$200 billion on acquisitions, with a noticeable tilt toward biotech assets (e.g., Gilead’s 2020 acquisition of Immunomedics). The “lemming” pattern of chasing hot targets persisted, especially in oncology and immunology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article or implied) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Big pharma will retreat from primary‑care markets and focus on niche/specialty indications.** | Partial shift: specialty/oncology grew, but primary‑care products (statins, antihypertensives) remain core revenue for many firms; no wholesale exit. |
| **Incremental innovation via 505(b)(2) will become the dominant growth strategy.** | 505(b)(2) use increased, but it accounts for a modest fraction of total R&D spend; breakthrough modalities (CAR‑T, mRNA, gene editing) have attracted larger investment. |
| **Biosimilars will be a major growth engine, replacing many original biologics.** | Biosimilars captured ~15 % of the U.S. biologics market by 2025, providing steady revenue, but original biologics still dominate high‑margin segments; biosimilars complement rather than replace. |
| **Companies will avoid “hot” targets to reduce risk.** | The herd behavior continued; when a target (e.g., KRAS G12C) became hot, multiple firms launched parallel programs. |
| **Alzheimer’s will be abandoned as too risky.** | Not abandoned; a few high‑profile approvals occurred, but the area remains high‑risk with limited commercial success. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in pharma strategy—highlighting the tension between herd‑driven deal‑making and a push for incremental, lower‑risk innovation—a theme that has shaped industry behavior over the subsequent decade. It is still relevant, though many of its more extreme predictions did not fully materialize.
