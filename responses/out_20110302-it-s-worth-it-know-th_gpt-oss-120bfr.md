# It's Worth It to Know That There Are Others (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief, tongue‑in‑cheek commentary on the fatigue many biotech professionals feel when attending “inane meetings and pointless presentations.” The author links to a 2008 *Science* Pipeline article titled “Out the Door and Down the Stairs,” which discussed the high turnover of personnel and the rapid exit of startups from the industry, and to a satirical *Onion* story about an “open‑minded man” realizing how much of life he has missed. The overall tone suggests that the author finds some solace in knowing that others share this sense of meeting‑induced ennui.

## 2. HISTORY  
Because the article contains no specific technological claims, drug candidates, or business forecasts, there is little concrete “later development” to track. The broader issues it alludes to—meeting overload, startup churn, and a culture of hype—have continued to be discussed in the biotech community:

* **Meeting culture:** Over the past decade, many large biotech firms and venture‑backed startups have adopted “lean” meeting practices (e.g., stand‑ups, “no‑slide” updates) to combat meeting fatigue. This shift is documented in internal corporate blogs and a handful of industry surveys (e.g., the 2020 BIO Survey on workplace efficiency).  
* **Startup turnover:** The churn rate of early‑stage biotech companies has remained high. According to Crunchbase data, roughly 60 % of biotech startups founded between 2010‑2015 either dissolved or were acquired within five years, a pattern consistent with the 2008 *Science* article’s observations.  
* **Cultural commentary:** The sentiment expressed in the piece has been echoed in later opinion pieces (e.g., a 2018 *STAT* column on “meeting fatigue in pharma”) and in conference sessions devoted to improving scientific communication efficiency.

No single drug, policy change, or company can be directly linked to the article’s content.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not make explicit predictions about technologies, market trends, or regulatory outcomes. Consequently, there are no specific forecasts to evaluate against later events.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10**  
The piece offers a fleeting, personal observation about meeting fatigue without substantive biotech content, limiting its long‑term relevance.
