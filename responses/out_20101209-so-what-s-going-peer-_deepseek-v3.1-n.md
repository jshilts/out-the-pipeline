# So What's Going On With Peer Review, Anyway? (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary reflects on a series of questionable papers published in prestigious journals around 2010, most notably the NASA arsenic bacteria paper in *Science*. The author questions why peer review failed to catch obviously flawed work, citing multiple examples including a retracted "reactome" paper in *Science* and a hexacyclinol synthesis in *Angewandte Chemie* that drew immediate criticism from specialists. The central concern is whether high-impact journals' pursuit of splashy, attention-grabbing publications leads editors to lower standards or bypass rigorous review. While the author supports publishing "out-there" work, they emphasize that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence—a standard that seemed to be breaking down. The piece raises broader questions about peer review quality, editorial decision-making, and whether the prestige system itself creates perverse incentives that undermine scientific rigor.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this article, the issues identified by the author became part of a much larger and more visible crisis in scientific publishing. The arsenic bacteria paper referenced in the article was formally repudiated—independent researchers could not replicate the findings, and the claims were ultimately rejected by the scientific community despite the initial media attention. The incident became a case study in how prestigious journals can amplify questionable science.

More significantly, the 2010s witnessed a "replication crisis" across multiple fields, particularly psychology and biomedical research, where systematic efforts to replicate published studies revealed alarmingly low reproducibility rates. This led to the establishment of organizations like the Center for Open Science (founded 2013) and widespread reforms including preregistration of studies, data sharing requirements, and new publication standards.

High-profile retraction scandals continued: Anil Potti's cancer research fraud (2010-2012), the STAP stem cell scandal at RIKEN (2014), and hundreds of papers retracted due to image manipulation and other integrity issues. These events validated the author's concerns about peer review failures at elite journals.

Practical changes emerged: many journals adopted more stringent data availability policies, some implemented statistical review, and post-publication peer review platforms like PubPeer gained prominence. However, the fundamental tension between high-impact publications and rigorous review remained unresolved—*Nature* and *Science* continue to publish papers that later face criticism or retraction, suggesting the systemic issues identified in 2010 persist over a decade later.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article primarily diagnosed existing problems rather than making explicit predictions about the future. Its concerns about systemic peer review failures were validated by subsequent developments, but it did not forecast specific events like the formal replication crisis movement or the scale of retractions that would follow.

## 4. INTEREST
Score: **6**

This article captured early recognition of systemic problems in scientific publishing that would explode into major policy debates. While it identified genuine issues at the right moment, similar concerns about peer review had been raised before—making it prescient but not uniquely visionary.
