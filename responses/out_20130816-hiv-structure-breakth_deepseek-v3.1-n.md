# An HIV Structure Breakthrough? (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a controversial 2013 PNAS publication by Joseph Sodroski's group at Harvard reporting a 6-angstrom-resolution structure of HIV surface proteins gp120 and gp41 obtained through cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure represented a significant technical achievement for studying membrane-bound protein-protein interactions, which are notoriously difficult targets for traditional structural biology methods like X-ray crystallography.

However, the work immediately became highly contentious within the structural biology community. Prominent researchers, including cryo-EM pioneer Richard Henderson, publicly criticized the paper as "complete rubbish" with "no redeeming features." The main criticisms centered on two issues: (1) technical skepticism that Sodroski's group could achieve 6-Å resolution with their microscope type, and (2) concerns that they had solved the structure of a "phantom molecule" rather than the actual trimer. Critics argued the researchers may have inadvertently aligned to noise rather than actual protein particles, citing the risk of spurious alignment artifacts in cryo-EM image processing. Sodroski's group declined to respond to specific criticisms in the Science news article but indicated willingness to defend their work in peer-reviewed literature.

## 2. WHAT HAPPENED SUBSEQUENTLY

The 2013 controversy presaged broader challenges in the field, but cryo-EM continued its dramatic advancement. What followed were several key developments:

**Resolution Revolution in Cryo-EM**: The period after 2013 saw cryo-EM undergo what became known as the "resolution revolution," driven by direct electron detector technology and improved computational methods. By 2015-2017, cryo-EM routinely achieved near-atomic resolution (better than 3-4 Å) for many targets, including membrane proteins that were previously intractable.

**HIV Envelope Trimer Structures**: Valid atomic-resolution structures of the HIV envelope trimer were eventually achieved through multiple complementary approaches. Notably, X-ray crystallography of engineered soluble trimers provided high-resolution structures that became foundational for HIV vaccine design, while improved cryo-EM structures followed as the technology matured.

**Field Adoption and Validation**: The broader structural biology community moved toward requiring more rigorous validation controls in cryo-EM studies, including gold-standard resolution estimation methods, extensive particle sorting procedures, and cross-validation with independent techniques. These practices became standard as the field professionalized.

**Impact on HIV Research**: While the specific 2013 structure didn't prove transformative, the broader pursuit of HIV envelope structures led to major advances. Atomic-resolution structures informed rational immunogen design for HIV vaccines and provided mechanistic insights into antibody neutralization and immune evasion strategies.

**Resolution of the Dispute**: The scientific community ultimately resolved such controversies through accumulation of independently determined structures using improved methods, rather than through direct replication or refutation of the specific contested structure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Several implicit predictions were embedded in the original controversy:

**Prediction**: The 6-Å cryo-EM structure would prove either groundbreaking or fundamentally flawed.
**Outcome**: Neither extreme materialized. The structure didn't become a foundational reference, but cryo-EM itself became transformative with better technology.

**Prediction**: The controversy would resolve through peer-reviewed exchange.
**Outcome**: The field moved forward largely by developing better methods rather than litigating the specific case.

**Prediction**: Membrane protein structures would remain exceptionally challenging.
**Outcome**: While still challenging, cryo-EM has made membrane proteins markedly more accessible for structure determination.

**Prediction**: Technical limitations of current cryo-EM would constrain progress.
**Outcome**: Instead, cryo-EM transformed into one of structural biology's most powerful tools, achieving resolutions competitive with crystallography for many targets.

**Prediction**: The Sodroski structure case would determine cryo-EM's credibility for HIV envelope work.
**Outcome**: The field achieved credible HIV envelope structures through multiple complementary approaches as methods matured.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides a valuable time-capsule view of a field in transition, capturing the methodological debates and growing pains as cryo-EM evolved from an emerging technique into a mainstream structural biology powerhouse.
