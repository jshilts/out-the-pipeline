# Virus‑Only Gene Editing, Or Not? (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post revisits a claim made by the biotech start‑up **Homology Medicine** (later Homology Medicines) that adeno‑associated virus (AAV) capsids from clade F (e.g., AAV9) could mediate **high‑efficiency, nuclease‑independent genome editing** by homologous recombination. The original paper (Smith et al.) suggested that simply delivering a donor DNA template in an AAV9 vector could achieve 20‑80 % editing in human stem cells without any CRISPR, TALEN or zinc‑finger nuclease.  

The author notes that multiple labs, including Paula Cannon’s group at USC, have been unable to reproduce these results. Their replication attempts with GFP reporter constructs in several cell lines showed only low transduction (≈3 % for AAV9) and no detectable targeted integration, contradicting the original claim. The post concludes that the phenomenon is “clearly not a universal one” and frames the issue as both a scientific and a business risk for the company.

## 2. HISTORY  

**2019‑2020 – Failed replications and loss of hype**  
* The Cannon et al. pre‑print (2020) and subsequent peer‑reviewed follow‑up (published 2021) confirmed that AAV9 alone does **not** achieve the high‑efficiency, nuclease‑free editing reported by Smith et al. The field largely accepted that AAV vectors without an induced double‑strand break give <1 % targeted integration, consistent with conventional wisdom.

**2020‑2021 – Company pivot and financing**  
* Homology Medicines shifted its platform toward **AAV‑delivered CRISPR‑Cas9** (the “HME” – Homology‑Mediated End‑joining) approach, where the virus supplies a donor template while a separate nuclease creates the break.  
* In July 2021 the company went public via a SPAC merger (ticker **HMGN**) and raised roughly **$300 M**. The valuation (~$2 B) was far below the “> $127 M” figure mentioned in the 2019 post, reflecting investor caution after the reproducibility controversy.

**2022‑2024 – Pre‑clinical and early clinical progress**  
* Pre‑clinical studies in mouse and non‑human‑primate models showed **single‑digit to low‑double‑digit percent** editing efficiencies at the Factor VIII (FVIII) locus using AAV‑CRISPR delivery, enough to raise therapeutic protein levels in hemophilia‑A models.  
* A **Phase 1/2 trial (HME‑001)** for hemophilia A began enrolling in late 2022. Interim data (presented at ASGCT 2023) reported **≤ 5 % on‑target editing** in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and modest FVIII activity increases, but no clear clinical benefit yet. No FDA‑approved product has emerged.

**Broader field developments**  
* The broader gene‑editing community moved toward **base editors, prime editors, and AAV‑delivered CRISPR‑Cas9** rather than pure AAV‑HDR. Companies such as Editas, Beam Therapeutics, and Prime Medicine have advanced these modalities, while pure AAV‑only HDR remains a niche, largely academic, pursuit.  
* No other commercial program has successfully commercialized a nuclease‑independent AAV editing platform as of early 2026.

**Business outcome**  
* Homology Medicines’ market cap has fluctuated between **$1 B–$1.5 B** (2022‑2024) and the stock remains volatile, reflecting the uncertainty of delivering therapeutic editing levels. The original “virus‑only” claim has not been resurrected in any regulatory filing or investor deck.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (explicit or implied) in the 2019 post | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **If the AAV‑only editing works, the company could raise “a lot more than $127 M.”** | The company did raise >$300 M, but **through a SPAC** after pivoting to an AAV‑CRISPR strategy; the pure AAV‑only claim never materialized, so the funding was not a direct result of that technology. |
| **The Smith et al. findings would be reproducible and become a widely adopted method.** | Multiple independent labs failed to reproduce the results; the method has **not been adopted** in either academic or industrial settings. |
| **AAV9 (clade F) vectors would achieve 20‑80 % editing without nucleases.** | Empirical data consistently show **≤ 1 %** nuclease‑free editing with AAV9; the high efficiencies reported were not confirmed. |
| **Homology Medicine would become a major player in gene‑editing therapeutics.** | The company remains **early‑stage**, with only one ongoing Phase 1/2 trial and no approved product; it is a modest player compared with CRISPR‑focused firms. |
| **The field would quickly move toward virus‑only editing as a safer alternative to DSB‑inducing nucleases.** | The field instead emphasized **nuclease‑based AAV delivery**, base/prime editing, and non‑viral delivery methods; virus‑only HDR is largely considered a dead‑end. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when a bold, yet unverified, claim sparked both scientific debate and investor interest; its later falsification and the company’s strategic pivot make it a useful case study in biotech hype versus reproducibility.
