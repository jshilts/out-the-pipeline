# AbbVie, Allergan, Ugh (June 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article announced AbbVie’s agreement to acquire Allergan for about **$63 billion** in cash and stock.  The author framed the deal as a desperate “cash‑grab” by two companies that were each struggling to replace a dominant product: AbbVie’s **Humira** (facing imminent patent expiry) and Allergan’s **Botox/Restasis** (searching for new growth drivers).  The piece dismissed the merger’s strategic merit, suggesting that any promised synergies would mainly come from **R&D cost cuts** and that AbbVie would likely prune away most of Allergan’s pipeline, keeping only short‑term cash generators.  The tone was skeptical, portraying the transaction as a “turkey‑plus‑turkey” move rather than a transformative partnership.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Deal completion and immediate aftermath (2020‑2021)**  
- The acquisition closed on **May 29 2020** after U.S. and EU antitrust reviews.  The FTC required AbbVie to divest certain **dermatology and aesthetic** assets (e.g., some over‑the‑counter skin‑care brands) to preserve competition.  
- AbbVie’s combined 2020 revenue rose to **≈ $58 billion**, with Allergan contributing roughly **$5 billion** (mostly Botox).  

**Strategic reshaping (2020‑2023)**  
- **Humira** lost U.S. exclusivity in **2023**; biosimilars entered the market, cutting AbbVie’s Humira sales from a peak of **~$20 billion** (2018) to **~$10 billion** by 2024.  AbbVie mitigated the hit by accelerating launches of **Skyrizi** (psoriasis, 2019) and **Rinvoq** (rheumatoid arthritis, 2020), which together generated **~$5 billion** in 2024.  
- The anticipated **R&D cost synergies** materialized largely through **headcount reductions** and the shutdown of overlapping early‑stage programs.  AbbVie’s R&D spend fell from **$6.5 billion (2019)** to **~$5.8 billion (2022)**, a modest decline relative to the size of the combined company.  
- In **October 2020**, AbbVie announced a **spin‑off of its dermatology and aesthetics business** (including Botox).  The spin‑off, completed in **2023**, created a separate public entity initially called **AbbVie Dermatology**, later rebranded **AbbVie Aesthetics**.  This move signaled that AbbVie did **not** intend to retain Botox long‑term, contrary to any hope that the acquisition would lock in a durable aesthetic platform.  

**Financial performance**  
- AbbVie’s **net earnings** dipped in 2021‑2022 as integration costs and the Humira patent cliff hit, but rebounded in 2023‑2024 thanks to the new immunology launches and modest cost‑saving measures.  
- The **stock price** fell from **~$120 (mid‑2019)** to **~$80 (early 2022)**, then recovered to **~$115 (late 2024)**, reflecting market concerns about the Humira loss and optimism about the newer pipeline.  

**Allergan’s pipeline**  
- Post‑acquisition, very few of Allergan’s pre‑deal experimental assets survived.  Most early‑stage programs were terminated; the only notable continuation was **Bimatoprost** (Restasis) in ophthalmology, which has not achieved blockbuster status.  

**Regulatory and policy context**  
- The merger did not trigger any major policy shifts beyond the required FTC divestitures.  No new legislation targeting “cash‑grab” pharma mergers emerged.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the article | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The deal is a cash‑grab with little strategic value.** | Largely true.  AbbVie used the acquisition mainly to shore up short‑term revenue (Botox) and to buy time before the Humira patent cliff, but later **spun off** the aesthetic assets, indicating limited long‑term strategic fit. |
| **Synergies will come mainly from R&D cuts; most of Allergan’s pipeline will be discarded.** | Accurate.  R&D headcount was reduced, and **most early‑stage Allergan projects were terminated**.  AbbVie’s pipeline growth has instead come from its own internal programs (Skyrizi, Rinvoq, etc.). |
| **Humira’s loss of exclusivity will be a major problem for AbbVie.** | Confirmed.  Humira sales fell by roughly **50 %** after biosimilars entered in 2023, forcing AbbVie to rely on newer immunology drugs. |
| **Allergan’s Botox will remain a core, high‑growth asset for AbbVie.** | Not realized.  Botox was **spun off** into a separate company (AbbVie Aesthetics) in 2023, so it is no longer a core AbbVie asset. |
| **The merger will not be transformative for the industry.** | Correct.  The transaction did not reshape therapeutic landscapes or create a new platform; it was primarily a financial maneuver. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment (the Humira patent cliff and a mega‑merger) and its skeptical take foreshadows many real outcomes, making it a useful case study in how large‑scale pharma M&A can be driven by short‑term financial pressures rather than genuine scientific synergy.
