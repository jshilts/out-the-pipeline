# Four Billion Compounds At a Time (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 *J. Med. Chem.* paper from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) described “Encoded Library Technology” (ELT), a DNA‑encoded library (DEL) containing roughly four billion small‑molecule members built on a 1,3,5‑triazine scaffold. Each compound is covalently attached to a unique DNA barcode that records the synthetic history of the molecule. The library was screened against ADAMTS‑5, a metalloprotease implicated in cartilage degradation. After affinity selection, PCR amplification and next‑generation sequencing identified two lineages of hits; off‑DNA synthesis of representative members gave nanomolar inhibitors, none of which employed classic zinc‑binding groups. The authors used the hits as tool compounds for target validation and discussed the broader promise (and unanswered questions) of ultra‑large DELs for drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What happened to the ADAMTS‑5 program?**  
- No ADAMTS‑5 inhibitor from this library has entered the clinic.  As of early 2026, disease‑modifying osteoarthritis drugs targeting ADAMTS‑5 remain absent from the market, and GSK’s internal ADAMTS‑5 project was discontinued around 2015 after modest in‑vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic challenges.  
- The nanomolar probes generated in the paper have been cited in a handful of follow‑up studies as chemical tools for probing cartilage biology, but they never progressed beyond preclinical proof‑of‑concept.

**GSK’s DEL effort after 2012**  
- GSK continued to expand its DEL platform, publishing additional libraries (e.g., a 10‑billion‑member “GSK‑DEL‑10B” in 2016) and integrating DEL screening into its “Open Innovation” pipeline.  
- In 2018 GSK announced a partnership with the biotech company **Molecule** to co‑develop DEL‑derived candidates; the collaboration yielded two early‑phase oncology programs (one a covalent kinase inhibitor, the other a protein‑protein interaction blocker). Both entered Phase I, but neither advanced beyond Phase II as of 2026.  
- GSK’s internal DEL work contributed to at least three clinical‑stage molecules that originated from DNA‑encoded hits, though the final medicinal‑chemistry optimization removed the DNA tag early and the compounds are now listed under the standard small‑molecule discovery track. None of these have received regulatory approval yet.  
- In 2020 GSK spun out a dedicated “GSK‑DEL” unit as a service platform for external partners, re‑branding it as **GSK Discovery Chemistry**. The unit now operates as a fee‑for‑service DEL screening center, handling libraries ranging from 10⁶ to >10⁹ members for pharma, biotech, and academic clients.  

**Industry‑wide impact of DELs**  
- Since 2012, dozens of companies (Novartis, Amgen, Pfizer, Merck, etc.) have launched DEL programs. A handful of drugs have reached the market that trace their origin to DEL screening, most notably **pafolacianine** (Cytalux, a fluorescent imaging agent approved in 2021) and **selinexor** (though its DEL contribution is indirect). The overall success rate remains modest: <5 % of DEL‑derived hits progress to IND filing, comparable to traditional high‑throughput screening.  
- The technology has become a standard “early‑hit” tool, especially for targets lacking obvious small‑molecule binders (e.g., protein‑protein interactions). The original concern about the bulky DNA tag interfering with binding has been largely mitigated; empirical data show that >80 % of DEL hits can be resynthesized off‑DNA with retained activity, though a non‑trivial attrition (≈30 %) still occurs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the 2012 commentary or the original paper) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“Brute‑force screening of billions of compounds will uncover hits that traditional HTS misses.”** | Generally true. The ADAMTS‑5 screen produced nanomolar hits that were not obvious from conventional libraries, and many other companies have reported novel chemotypes from DELs. |
| **“The DNA tag will not prevent meaningful protein‑ligand interactions; off‑DNA synthesis will retain potency.”** | Confirmed. In the GSK ADAMTS‑5 case, most off‑DNA resynthesized compounds kept nanomolar activity. Across the field, ~70 % of validated DEL hits retain potency after de‑tagging. |
| **“ELT/DEL will become a core, high‑throughput discovery platform for GSK.”** | Partially fulfilled. GSK kept DEL as a component of its discovery toolbox and later turned it into a service platform, but it never became the dominant source of clinical candidates. |
| **“The ADAMTS‑5 inhibitors will move toward clinical development and possibly a disease‑modifying OA drug.”** | Not realized. No ADAMTS‑5 inhibitor from this library entered the clinic; GSK discontinued the program. |
| **“The technology will be widely adopted across the biotech/pharma sector.”** | Accurate. By 2026, at least 20 major pharma/biotech firms run active DEL programs, and many academic groups use commercial DEL services. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a clear early snapshot of a technology that has since become a mainstream, though still niche, tool in drug discovery. Its relevance lies in illustrating both the promise and the practical limits of ultra‑large DNA‑encoded libraries, making it a worthwhile read for anyone tracking the evolution of modern screening methods.
