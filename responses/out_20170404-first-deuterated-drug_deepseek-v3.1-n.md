# The First Deuterated Drug Arrives (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article announces the FDA approval of Austedo (deutetrabenazine) from Teva, marking the first deuterated drug to reach the market. The drug targets Huntington's chorea, a movement disorder. The piece explains the scientific rationale behind deuteration: replacing hydrogen atoms with heavier deuterium isotopes at specific positions in drug molecules can slow down metabolic breakdown in the liver by making carbon-deuterium bonds harder to break than carbon-hydrogen bonds. This kinetic isotope effect extends the drug's circulation time in the bloodstream.

Austedo is a deuterated version of the older drug tetrabenazine, with both methoxy groups (OCH₃) replaced by deuterated methoxy groups (OCD₃). These specific positions are sites of metabolic attack where enzymes demethylate the compound, leading to rapid clearance. By slowing this step, the deuterated version achieves more stable blood levels and improved dosing compared to the original drug. The mechanism of action involves inhibiting the VMAT-2 transporter, where both drugs should behave identically since deuterium doesn't alter size or polarity—only metabolic stability. The article notes that Concert Pharmaceuticals had previously seen their lead deuterated drug CTP-499 fail in trials, and that Teva's approval was delayed nine months due to FDA requests for additional metabolite data.

## 2. HISTORY

**Approval and Market Access:**
Austedo received FDA approval in April 2017 for treating tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease. The drug became commercially available in the U.S. market following approval. By 2019-2020, Austedo had gained additional approvals in other markets globally.

**Clinical and Commercial Performance:**
Austedo demonstrated substantial commercial success, becoming a blockbuster drug for Teva. Peak annual sales reached approximately $1.2 billion, making it one of the most successful CNS drugs in Teva's portfolio. The drug showed efficacy in reducing chorea movements in Huntington's patients and treating tardive dyskinesia symptoms. Real-world uptake among patients has been significant, though access remains limited by high pricing typical of orphan drugs treating rare conditions.

**Regulatory and Clinical Developments:**
Following the initial approval, additional clinical studies were conducted supporting expanded use. The drug maintained a favorable safety profile, with the deuterated formulation indeed showing reduced dosing frequency and more stable plasma levels compared to tetrabenazine.

**Deuterated Drug Pipeline:**
The approval paved the way for other deuterated drugs. Concert Pharmaceuticals continued development efforts, and by 2022 received FDA approval for hetlioz (deutetrabenazine) for Smith-Magenis syndrome. Several other pharmaceutical companies advanced deuterated compounds through clinical trials targeting various therapeutic areas including metabolic diseases and oncology.

**Scientific Advancement:**
Deuteration gained wider acceptance as a medicinal chemistry strategy. The approach was validated not just for metabolic stability but also for potentially reducing toxic metabolite formation. However, the field learned that deuterium placement must be carefully chosen—not all deuterated compounds provide advantages, and unexpected effects on pharmacology can occur.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions Identified in Article:**
- **"there are likely to be a small but steady number of them [deuterated drugs] hitting the market in years to come"**
- **Implicit prediction: Austedo would demonstrate the hypothesized advantages of slower clearance and less variable blood levels**
- **Implicit prediction: Deuterated drugs would follow similar mechanisms as parent compounds at target sites**

**Outcomes:**

• **Deuterated drug pipeline prediction was ACCURATE**: Multiple deuterated drugs have reached the market since 2017, including additional approvals for deuterated versions of existing drugs. The approach became established as a viable medicinal chemistry strategy for extending patent life and improving pharmacokinetics.

• **Austedo performance prediction was ACCURATE**: Clinical data confirmed that deutetrabenazine showed the expected metabolic advantages—extended half-life allowing twice-daily dosing versus three-times-daily for tetrabenazine, and reduced variability in plasma concentrations, which translated to practical clinical benefits.

• **Mechanistic similarity prediction was MOSTLY ACCURATE**: Deuterated compounds generally maintain the same pharmacodynamic profile as parent drugs when the deuterium placement avoids active sites. However, subsequent research revealed that deuterium can occasionally affect drug behavior beyond just metabolism, including subtle effects on protein binding and unexpected toxicology, validating the article's caveat about possible differences noted by analytical chemists.

• **Market adoption prediction was ACCURATE**: Deutetrabenazine achieved significant commercial success, validating the economic viability of deuterated drugs. However, the high cost of deuterated compounds, especially for rare diseases, has limited universal access despite clinical benefits.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article represents an important milestone in pharmaceutical chemistry, marking the validation of deuterium-based drug design. While the concept itself wasn't new, the first successful regulatory approval proved the clinical and commercial viability of this approach, making it historically significant for drug development.
