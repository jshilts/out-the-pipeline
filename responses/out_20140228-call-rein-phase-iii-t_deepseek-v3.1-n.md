# A Call to Rein in Phase III Trials (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This Science blog post discusses a New England Journal of Medicine perspective by venture capitalists Robert Kocher and Bryan Roberts from Venrock, analyzing how drug research funding decisions are made. The authors identified four key evaluation criteria that venture investors use: development costs, selling costs, drug differentiation from current treatments, and disease incidence/prevalence. Cancer and orphan disease drugs tend to receive funding because they score favorably on multiple dimensions—lower development costs and strong differentiation—while drugs for common conditions like type 2 diabetes or hypertension face more investor reluctance due to higher costs and competition from generics.

The article's main proposal advocates for FDA reform toward conditional drug approvals. The authors argued that traditional Phase III trials are economically inefficient—they're overpowered for demonstrating efficacy yet still underpowered to detect rare adverse events that may only emerge post-approval. The suggested alternative was smaller trials for initial approval based on efficacy and fundamental safety, followed by mandatory postmarketing surveillance using electronic health records and large datasets. The piece estimated this could reduce drug development costs by up to 90% and time by 50%, while making the FDA more responsive to genuine safety signals without lengthy trial processes.

## 2. HISTORY

The proposals outlined in the 2014 article anticipated several FDA policy evolutions that have since materialized, though implementation has been more measured than the authors' ambitious targets.

**FDA Real-World Evidence and Accelerated Approval Evolution**: By 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act expanded the FDA's authority to consider real-world evidence (RWE) in regulatory decisions. This aligned with the article's call for leveraging electronic health records and large datasets. The FDA subsequently established its Real-World Evidence Program in 2018, creating frameworks for using observational data in regulatory submissions. However, acceptance has been cautious rather than revolutionary—RWE primarily supplements rather than replaces traditional clinical trial data for approval decisions.

**Conditional and Accelerated Approval Pathways**: The FDA's existing accelerated approval pathway, established in 1992 for serious conditions with unmet needs, underwent refinements but maintained core requirements. The agency did implement more flexible Phase II/III trial designs and adaptive trial approaches, allowing for modifications based on interim analyses. Post-marketing requirements (PMRs) and post-marketing commitments (PMCs) became more common, requiring companies to conduct additional studies after approval—consistent with the article's surveillance concept though with more traditional trial designs rather than pure registry approaches.

**Drug Development Cost and Time**: Industry data from 2014-2023 showed mixed results on the authors' predicted reductions. While some oncology drugs achieved approval through smaller, targeted trials with substantial cost savings, average R&D costs continued rising industry-wide, reaching $2.3-2.8 billion per approved drug by some estimates. Development timelines have shortened for breakthrough therapies (often 6-7 years rather than 10-12 years historically), particularly in oncology, but not approaching the 50% reduction suggested.

**Political and Implementation Reality**: The authors' political concerns proved prescient. Public skepticism about drug safety oversight persisted, illustrated by controversies like the Aduhelm approval in 2021, where critics argued accelerated approval was misused. The FDA has faced ongoing pressure to balance speed against safety, with congressional oversight and patient advocacy groups monitoring the agency's flexibility in approval standards. The structural reforms proposed—mandatory comprehensive surveillance replacing large trials—did not materialize at scale.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Cost Reduction (90%) and Time Reduction (50%)**: The prediction that conditional approvals could cut development costs by 90% and time by 50% proved overly optimistic. While accelerated pathways have reduced timelines for specific drug categories (notably oncology), overall industry R&D costs continued rising through 2023. Some breakthrough therapies realized substantial savings, but system-wide cost reduction stopped well short of 90%. Partial confirmation for targeted therapies; systemic failure for broad implementation.

• **Electronic Health Record Integration**: The article predicted widespread adoption of mandatory postmarketing surveillance using EHR data would make "thousand-patient trials obsolete." While electronic databases became important for safety monitoring (FDA's Sentinel System expanded significantly), traditional Phase III trials with substantial patient numbers remained standard for most approvals. EHR integration advanced but not enough to replace traditional trial designs. Partial confirmation—enhanced surveillance emerged but didn't replace large trials.

• **Regulatory Framework Changes**: The authors anticipated the FDA moving toward conditional approval models as described. While accelerated approval pathways existed before 2014 and subsequently expanded, the agency did not adopt the wholesale framework transformation suggested. Incremental changes occurred, but traditional Phase III requirements persisted for most drugs. Partial confirmation.

• **Risk-Shifting Perception**: The article predicted political resistance to shifting risk to "paying customers." This proved accurate—public and legislative scrutiny of FDA approval standards continued, with debates over whether accelerated approvals adequately protect patients. The Aduhelm controversy and ongoing discussions about FDA's role reflected this exact tension. Confirmed.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article merits high interest for correctly identifying economic forces driving drug development investment and anticipating major regulatory trends, including the integration of real-world evidence and expanded conditional approvals. The analysis proved prescient regarding both the direction of FDA policy evolution and the political constraints that would shape implementation. However, the article's quantitative predictions were overly optimistic, making it an instructive case study in balancing visionary proposals with practical realities.
