# J. Appl. Drivel or Gibberish Lett.? Choices, Choices (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a journalistic sting operation conducted by Tom Spears, a reporter at the Ottawa Citizen, who created a deliberately nonsensical scientific paper to test the legitimacy of predatory open-access publishers. The fabricated manuscript was constructed through blatant plagiarism, copying phrases and sections from unrelated fields (geology and hematology), including irrelevant graphs from a Mars research paper, and citing footnotes from wine chemistry research.

The fake paper, containing invented concepts like "seismic platelets," was submitted to 18 low-quality journals. Sixteen of these accepted the obviously flawed manuscript, with some providing peer review approval within 24 hours. One rejection came with suggestions for minor revisions to achieve acceptance, and one publisher even invited Spears to join their editorial advisory board.

The article contrasts this with a separate case involving Drug Discovery Today (an Elsevier journal) publishing questionable content, though without the pay-to-publish model characteristic of predatory journals.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2014 Ottawa Citizen sting operation was part of a broader trend of exposés targeting predatory publishers that accelerated throughout the 2010s:

**Academic Community Response**: This incident contributed to growing awareness about predatory publishing, leading to more systematic efforts to combat the problem. Libraries, universities, and funding agencies began developing blacklists and whitelists of legitimate journals.

**Beall's List and Its Impact**: Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at University of Colorado, had been maintaining a list of "potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers" since 2010. The list grew substantially until 2017 when it was taken down after Beall left his position, amid controversy and legal threats from publishers.

**Increased Regulation and Standards**: Major funding agencies like the NIH and institutions began implementing policies requiring publication in reputable journals. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and other organizations developed clearer guidelines for identifying legitimate publishing practices.

**Continued Problems**: Despite increased awareness, predatory publishing remains a significant issue. Studies in subsequent years showed thousands of predatory journals still operating, extracting millions of dollars annually from researchers, particularly targeting early-career researchers and those from developing countries.

**Legal and Ethical Developments**: Some countries began investigating and prosecuting predatory publishers under fraud statutes. However, enforcement remained challenging due to the international nature of the operations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about the future of predatory publishing or academic publishing more broadly.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article captured an important moment in the ongoing exposé of predatory academic publishing, contributing to broader awareness of fraudulent practices in scholarly communication, though the phenomenon itself was already well-documented by researchers in the field.
