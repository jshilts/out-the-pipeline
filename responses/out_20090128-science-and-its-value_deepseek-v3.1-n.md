# Science and Its Values (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article comments on Dennis Overbye's New York Times essay "Elevating Science, Elevating Democracy," which argued that science, despite its reputation for value-neutral objectivity, is fundamentally guided by core values: honesty, doubt, respect for evidence, openness, accountability, and tolerance for opposing viewpoints. The author endorses Overbye's main thesis while expressing skepticism about the political rhetoric surrounding the recent Obama inauguration. The piece emphasizes that science represents a relatively recent development in human history, noting that most societies throughout time lacked the resources or conceptual framework for systematic scientific inquiry—even ancient Greeks, despite their philosophical sophistication, often dismissed controlled experimentation. The article celebrates the core scientific method of rigorous experimentation, evidence-based reasoning, and intellectual honesty as the foundation of scientific progress.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this 2009 article, the relationship between science, democracy, and public trust has undergone significant evolution with both encouraging and concerning developments:

**Positive developments in scientific values**: Open science initiatives expanded dramatically, with pre-print servers (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv) becoming standard practice across many fields, increasing transparency and accessibility. Data sharing requirements by major funding agencies (NIH, NSF) reinforced accountability norms. Reproducibility efforts gained momentum, with organizations like the Center for Open Science (founded 2013) and reproducibility initiatives in psychology and cancer biology highlighting science's self-correcting mechanisms.

**Erosion of trust**: The post-2009 period saw growing anti-science sentiment and politicization of scientific issues, particularly climate change, vaccine safety, and more recently COVID-19. Public confidence in scientists declined notably in certain demographics, with significant partisan gaps emerging in trust toward scientific institutions—ironically demonstrating how scientific values of evidence-based reasoning clashed with political tribalism.

**Institutional responses**: Major scientific organizations increasingly engaged in public outreach and policy advocacy. The March for Science (2017) represented an unprecedented mobilization of scientists defending evidence-based policy. The National Academies and other institutions issued reports on scientific integrity and the role of science in democratic society.

The biotech and pharmaceutical industries saw continued innovation but also faced increased scrutiny over clinical trial transparency, leading to strengthened reporting requirements and greater emphasis on real-world evidence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article emphasized enduring scientific values rather than making specific predictions about biotechnology developments. However, by celebrating evidence-based inquiry and rigorous experimentation as foundational to scientific progress, the piece **implicitly endorsed a vision of science continuously advancing through adherence to core principles**—a perspective largely validated by subsequent developments:

• **Validation**: The pharmaceutical industry continued relying on controlled clinical trials and evidence-based medicine, leading to breakthroughs like immunotherapy drugs, gene therapies (first FDA approvals 2017), and mRNA vaccines (developed through rigorous clinical evaluation)
  
• **Validation**: The reproducibility crisis in psychology and cancer biology (2011-2015) demonstrated science's self-correcting nature through doubt and re-examination—exactly the values Overbye highlighted

• **Mixed outcome**: While scientific integrity and evidence-based approaches remained central to research, the broader democratic embrace of scientific values proved more fragile than perhaps anticipated, with significant political polarization around scientific consensus emerging post-2009

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the philosophical reflection on science's core values offers important perspective, the commentary adds limited new insights beyond endorsing another writer's essay. The piece lacks concrete analysis of biotechnology developments or specific implications for the industry, instead remaining at an abstract level about scientific methodology and culture.
