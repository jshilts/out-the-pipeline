# Jack Scannell Talks Loads of Sense on Drug Pricing (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Jack Scannell's analysis of drug pricing rationales published in Forbes. Scannell systematically examines four common justifications for high drug prices: (1) recouping R&D costs, which he dismisses as economically flawed since sunk costs shouldn't determine pricing; (2) value-based pricing, which he critiques because drug value is difficult to determine at launch and the UK was backing away from this model; (3) patent-based monopoly pricing, which he notes works as intended when generics eventually lower prices; and (4) the lottery-like nature of drug development, where only ~10% of clinical candidates succeed and the top 10% of approved drugs generate half of industry profits. The article emphasizes that drug development involves substantial uncertainty, many critics misunderstand the economics, and political promises of easy fixes overlook the systemic complexity.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's 2015 publication, drug pricing became increasingly politicized. The most significant US policy development was the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which for the first time allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices for select medications, directly challenging Scannell's observation about temporary monopoly pricing. The years 2015-2016 saw heightened scrutiny of companies like Turing Pharmaceuticals, Valeant, and Mylan for dramatic price increases on older drugs, leading to congressional hearings. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, launched in 2013-2014 at $84,000+ per treatment course, remained central to pricing debates through 2015-2016 and beyond, demonstrating the value-based pricing challenges Scannell described.

The biopharmaceutical industry faced continued consolidation, with major mergers (Pfizer-Allergan attempted in 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb-Celgene in 2019, AbbVie-Allergan 2019) that Scannell's lottery analogy helps explain—large companies acquiring innovation rather than developing it internally. R&D productivity remained problematic, with continued high clinical failure rates validating Scannell's observations. By 2020-2022, COVID-19 vaccines and treatments (Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna) became new focal points for pricing debates, particularly regarding government funding's role in development and fair pricing. The industry's defense of pricing increasingly emphasized Scannell's lottery argument—that high prices on successful drugs fund the many failures—while critics argued for greater transparency and alternative R&D models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"A likely outcome is that things grind slowly along their current trajectories"** → **Mixed accuracy**. Scannell correctly anticipated gradual change rather than dramatic reform pre-2022, but the IRA's Medicare price negotiation provisions (2022) represented more substantial policy intervention than his prediction suggested.

• **Implicit prediction that political promises of easy fixes would continue but prove ineffective** → **Accurate**. The 2016-2024 period saw numerous political proposals (Trump administration's drug pricing blueprint, various congressional bills), but comprehensive reform remained elusive until the IRA's limited provisions in 2022.

• **Implicit expectation that industry fundamentals (high failure rates, lottery dynamics) would persist** → **Accurate**. Clinical trial success rates and the concentration of profits among top drugs continued through the late 2010s and early 2020s, validating Scannell's structural analysis.

## 4. INTEREST
Score: **8**

The article provides enduring analytical clarity on drug pricing's economic realities that remained highly relevant through subsequent political debates and policy developments, making it both prescient and consistently informative for understanding the fundamental tensions that persisted through 2025.
