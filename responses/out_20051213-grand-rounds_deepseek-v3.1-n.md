# Grand Rounds (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is not a traditional biotechnology industry commentary article but rather a "Grand Rounds" blog carnival hosting post from December 2005. The author, writing from a pharmaceutical industry research perspective, curated and linked to various medical and healthcare blog posts from that week. The content spans multiple topics including: clinical case discussions, patient care challenges, healthcare policy debates, new medical technologies (particularly an inhaled insulin trial), medical ethics questions, public health issues like obesity, and some biotechnology-related items including the newly sequenced dog genome and genetic research on Alzheimer's disease. The tone is informal and industry-insider focused, with the blogger identifying as working in drug discovery research.

## 2. HISTORY
After this December 2005 post, several notable developments occurred related to topics mentioned:

**Inhaled Insulin**: The most significant biotechnology story here is the inhaled insulin mentioned in the diabetes trial. Pfizer's Exubera (inhaled insulin) received FDA approval in January 2006 but was withdrawn from the market in October 2007 due to poor sales and concerns about lung effects. This marked a major failure for alternative insulin delivery methods.

**Alzheimer's Disease Research**: Despite decades of research and hundreds of failed clinical trials since 2005, effective disease-modifying treatments have remained elusive. The "seven years" of failed Alzheimer's drug development mentioned by the author foreshadowed continued struggles - most notably the many high-profile Phase 3 failures through the 2010s.

**Dog Genome Impact**: The dog genome sequencing mentioned did contribute to comparative genomics research and toxicology model improvements, but did not fundamentally transform drug discovery models as might have been hoped.

**Healthcare System Changes**: The policy discussions prefigured the Affordable Care Act (2010) debates. Medicare reimbursement changes did occur, and the transition from fee-for-service toward value-based care accelerated in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contains relatively few explicit predictions, functioning more as commentary on current events. However, some implicit expectations can be evaluated:

• **Implicit about inhaled insulin success**: The casual mention of inhaled insulin trials suggested optimism about alternative delivery methods. **OUTCOME**: Inhaled insulin failed commercially within two years of approval, representing a major setback for non-injectable insulin delivery.

• **Implicit about Alzheimer's drug development**: The author's reference to "seven years" of work suggests expectation of progress in the field. **OUTCOME**: Nearly 20 years later, Alzheimer's remains extremely difficult to treat, with most clinical trials failing despite significant investment.

• **Implicit about genetic research impact**: The dog genome and genetic linkage studies suggested expectation of translational progress. **OUTCOME**: While genomic research has advanced tremendously, the immediate translation to approved therapies has been slower than many anticipated in 2005.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This scores in the lower-middle range because while it captures a snapshot of medical blogging culture in 2005 and has some biotechnology relevance through the inhaled insulin and genetics mentions, it's primarily a link compilation rather than substantive biotechnology industry analysis. The format as a blog carnival limits deep technical or industry insights.
