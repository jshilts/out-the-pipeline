# The GSK Layoffs Continue, By Proxy (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary describes a chain of pharmaceutical industry layoffs in North Carolina's Research Triangle. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) initially transferred up to 450 employees to Parexel, a contract research organization, with many workers performing the same roles in the same buildings but at reduced compensation—a pattern the author notes previously occurred when Eli Lilly transferred employees to Covance. The article then reports that up to 200 of those transferred Parexel employees were subsequently laid off anyway, with Parexel's CEO framing broader cost-cutting under the "Margin Acceleration Program." The piece criticizes the corporate euphemisms used to describe mass layoffs and suggests the transfer merely delayed the inevitable outcome for affected workers.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 GSK-Parexel transition reflected broader pharmaceutical industry trends toward outsourcing clinical research functions to contract research organizations (CROs). During this period, major pharmaceutical companies increasingly shifted from internal R&D infrastructure to external partnerships with CROs like Parexel, IQVIA (then Quintiles), and Covance as a cost-containment strategy.

**Parexel's trajectory:** Following the 2015 layoffs, Parexel continued operating its substantial North Carolina presence. The company maintained its position as one of the top global CROs, though it faced continued margin pressures typical of the CRO industry. In 2017, Parexel was acquired by private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management for approximately $5 billion, after which the company underwent restructuring initiatives. By 2023, Parexel International was rebranded as Parexel.

**Industry outcomes:** The shift toward CRO partnerships that this article documented in microcosm accelerated through the late 2010s and early 2020s. Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly relied on CROs for clinical trial management, data management, and regulatory affairs work, with the global CRO market growing significantly. This outsourcing model became particularly crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic, when sponsors needed flexible capacity for clinical trial execution.

**Employment patterns:** The pattern of transferring employees to CROs at reduced compensation continued as an industry practice, though specific instances similar to the 2015 GSK-Parexel situation occurred periodically across different companies and CROs. The Research Triangle area maintained its position as a major hub for both pharmaceutical companies and CROs, with employment in the sector generally growing despite individual company fluctuations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained limited explicit predictions but implied several outcomes:

- **Implicit prediction: Transfer to CROs merely delays layoffs** 
  - The author's observation that the transfer "bought them a few months on the way to the same destination" proved accurate for the specific 200 employees mentioned. However, the broader trend of pharmaceutical-to-CRO transfers continued, with many subsequent transfers resulting in longer-term employment rather than imminent layoffs. The pattern was mixed—some transfers led to layoffs, others to sustained CRO careers.

- **Implicit prediction: Corporate euphemisms for layoffs will continue**
  - This proved correct. Terms like "workforce optimization," "rightsizing," "structural realignment," and "efficiency initiatives" remained standard corporate language for layoffs across the pharmaceutical and broader technology sectors throughout the following decade.

- **Implicit prediction: Working conditions under cost-cutting CROs would be challenging**
  - The author's advice to "plan accordingly" acknowledged the reality of CRO business models prioritizing margin improvement. The CRO industry generally maintained lean cost structures, though working conditions varied significantly by company and role.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article captures an important micro-trend in pharmaceutical industry restructuring, its narrow focus on a single instance of layoffs and corporate language limits broader significance. The practice of pharmaceutical-to-CRO transfers it described became widespread and economically important, but the article itself provided only anecdotal evidence without deep analysis of the underlying strategic shift.
