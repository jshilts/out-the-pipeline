# Totally New Standards For Drug Approval? (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a proposal by Andrew Lo and Vahid Montazerhodjat for a new Bayesian-based framework for drug approval that would explicitly vary evidentiary standards based on disease severity and unmet medical need. The proposal calls for relaxing the false-positive tolerance for life-threatening conditions with few treatment options (e.g., raising the false-positive rate from the standard ~2.5% to perhaps 27% for pancreatic cancer), while tightening standards for well-served therapeutic areas like diabetes (down to about 1.3%). The authors viewed this as a rational response to existing state "right-to-try" laws, providing a more structured approach that could accelerate therapies for desperate patients while acknowledging that some approved drugs would later prove ineffective. The proposal was framed as balancing Type I and Type II errors in a more utilitarian way than the existing binary approval system.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 article, these developments occurred:

**FDA Policy Evolution (2016-2022):** The FDA has adopted more flexible approval pathways that reflect certain principles in Lo's proposal, though not through formal Bayesian thresholds. The agency's accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug programs have substantially grown, enabling faster access for serious conditions with limited options. Oncology has benefited especially—immunotherapy approvals expanded dramatically, and real-world evidence is increasingly used for post-marketing confirmations.

**Clinical Impact:** Oncology and rare disease drug approvals surged, with many drugs approved on single-arm trials or surrogate endpoints. However, confirmatory trials have sometimes failed to verify clinical benefit, leading to voluntary withdrawals or FDA-mandated confirmatory studies.

**Public Policy:** The federal Right to Try Act passed in 2018, expanding access to investigational drugs. However, implementation has been constrained by logistical hurdles and limited manufacturer participation, not fully resolving the tensions the article identified.

**Bayesian Methods Adoption:** Bayesian statistics have gained broader acceptance in clinical trials, but not as the formal, disease-specific regulatory framework Lo and Montazerhodjat proposed. Adaptive trial designs and basket/umbrella trials are now more common in oncology.

**Business Impact:** Biotechnology investment continued growing, and companies in oncology and rare diseases benefited from streamlined pathways, though the proposed graded threshold system was not formally implemented.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made these predictions for the proposal. Here is how they compared to later events:

- **Varying approval standards by disease severity would succeed:** → **Moderate success.** Flexible standards gained traction ("breakthrough therapy" designations, surrogate endpoints in oncology), and pancreatic cancer drugs did advance (e.g., PARP inhibitors, immunotherapies). But the formal Bayesian thresholding system was not adopted at scale or explicitly signed into regulation.
- **Right-to-try laws would expand access to investigational drugs while raising concerns about charlatans:** → **Partially accurate.** Right-to-try laws proliferated at the state and federal levels, but real-world uptake remained limited. The charlatan problem surfaced through off-label and direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics, while mainstream industry participation in expanded access programs remained cautious.
- **Drugs approved with looser standards would later prove ineffective more often:** → **Accurate.** Several accelerated approvals, especially in oncology, have failed to demonstrate benefit in confirmatory trials or shown only marginal improvements, leading to withdrawals or continued use with narrower indications.
- **Sound-bite communication challenges would hinder public acceptance of nuanced tradeoffs:** → **Accurate.** Public and political discourse around drug approval balance (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines and antivirals) has remained polarized, with limited appreciation for the Type I/Type II error tradeoffs highlighted in the proposal. FDA decisions are frequently criticized in both directions—as either dangerously premature or overly cautious—suggesting the communication hurdles identified were real.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article engaged with a nuanced, important problem—trading Type I and Type II errors in drug approval—and captured early thinking that set the stage for later regulatory evolutions in accelerated pathways and real-world evidence. It remains relevant for explaining the difficulties of balancing speed, evidentiary certainty, and patient access.
