# Hope, Springing Eternal And All That (November 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Merck's $1.1 billion acquisition of Sirna Therapeutics, positioning it within the context of RNA interference (RNAi) hype. The author draws parallels to the earlier rise and fall of antisense DNA therapies, noting that despite initial enthusiasm, antisense faced extraordinary development challenges over many years. Merck had previously collaborated with ISIS Pharmaceuticals on antisense therapies for diabetes and other indications beginning in 2002, but the partnership dissolved, and the clinical candidates either failed or stalled in development. The author cites multiple clinical failures of ISIS antisense compounds that showed early promise but ultimately "bit the dust." The central argument is that small nucleic-acid-based therapeutics—whether antisense DNA or RNAi—face fundamental delivery, stability, and efficacy hurdles that prior enthusiasm didn't fully appreciate. With Merck's pipeline pressures mounting since the late 1990s, the author views the Sirna acquisition as an act of desperation rather than a well-founded strategic move.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article, both RNAi and antisense encountered the kinds of challenges the author anticipated, though with important outcomes that validated some pathways while exposing others.

RNAi faced significant delivery and efficacy hurdles. Merck struggled to advance Sirna's RNAi programs, and in 2014 Merck sold Sirna and most RNAi assets to Alnylam, effectively reversing the acquisition at a substantial loss. Alnylam and other firms nonetheless continued pushing RNAi forward. The breakthrough came with improved delivery technologies and chemical modifications that enhanced stability and targeted tissues. In 2018, Alnylam achieved the first FDA-approved RNAi therapeutic, patisiran (Onpattro), for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. Subsequent approvals have followed, including givosiran and lumasiran, establishing RNAi as a validated therapeutic modality with approved drugs. Adoption remains concentrated in rare diseases where delivery can be precisely targeted.

Antisense saw parallel progress after protracted development. In 2013, Isis (which later changed its name to Ionis) secured the first antisense approval with mipomersen for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, nearly two decades after work began in earnest. Exondys 51 followed in 2016 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Antisense therapies are now used clinically, particularly in rare genetic disorders, but broader uptake has been constrained by delivery challenges and the specific disease niches these drugs address. Isis's pipeline did ultimately produce multiple drugs, though not necessarily the diabetes and broad indications originally pursued with Merck.

Neither modality achieved the broad blockbuster status once envisioned. Instead, success has concentrated in rare diseases where tissue targeting is more straightforward and regulatory paths are faster. Manufacturers learned that delivery remains the central challenge the author highlighted in 2006: getting nucleic acids into the right cells at sufficient concentrations without toxicity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author's core predictions and their outcomes:

- **RNAi will face the same development challenges as antisense DNA**  
  This proved largely accurate. RNAi encountered substantial delivery problems, immune activation issues, and the need for sophisticated chemical modifications—challenges familiar from antisense research. Merck's inability to translate Sirna's science into approved drugs corroborated the prediction.

- **Merck's desperation to fill their pipeline drove the acquisition, not wisdom**  
  Merck sold Sirna's RNAi assets in 2014 at a loss; the acquisition did not yield near-term approved drugs and largely failed to address pipeline gaps. The prediction about desperation over strategic fit appears borne out by the outcome.

- **The ISIS diabetes antisense collaboration would not progress meaningfully**  
  While specific details about that exact candidate are limited, none of the programs from Isis's 2002 pipeline advanced expeditiously. The broader field took many more years to produce any approved therapies.

- **Small nucleic-acid compounds are inherently difficult therapeutics**  
  This remains true. Delivery constraints, stability, manufacturing complexity, and cost have limited nucleic acid therapeutics to specialized applications rather than broad first-line use.

- **Antisense would remain stuck without major breakthroughs**  
  Breakthroughs did eventually come through chemical modifications and targeted delivery strategies, but progress was indeed slow. Antisense required roughly two decades from early hype to meaningful clinical success.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article warrants high interest due to the author's remarkably prescient critique of therapeutic modality hype and the subsequent validation of those concerns over the following decade. The parallels drawn between antisense and RNAi were empirically accurate: both faced fundamental delivery challenges that took years to solve. Merck's expensive failure with Sirna and the eventual success of RNAi and antisense in narrow clinical niches underscore the importance of realistic timelines in biotechnology.
