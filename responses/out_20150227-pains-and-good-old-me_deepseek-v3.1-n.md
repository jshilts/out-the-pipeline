# PAINs And Good Old Med Chem (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 blog post discusses the growing awareness of PAINs (Pan Assay INterference compounds) in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. The article references two key editorials by Jonathan Baell and Dan Erlanson that criticized how academic and industrial screening programs were producing false positives that wasted time and resources. 

The main arguments are that PAINs compounds exhibit poor structure-activity relationships (SAR), resist medicinal chemistry optimization, often show only micromolar activity, and lack convincing biological data. The article emphasizes that many screening campaigns are too small to yield meaningful hits, particularly for difficult targets like protein-protein interactions. It calls for larger screening libraries (150,000-250,000 compounds rather than 10,000-30,000) and rigorous counter-screening to eliminate artifacts. The author strongly advocates for traditional medicinal chemistry as an irreplaceable part of drug discovery, arguing that computational filters alone are insufficient and that sustained chemical synthesis and optimization remain essential.

## 2. HISTORY

The PAINs concept has had substantial real-world impact since 2015:

**Scientific Adoption and Policy Changes:**
- Major journals including *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* and *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* implemented stricter requirements for authors to demonstrate that hits undergo proper counter-screening and control experiments.
- Many academic screening centers and pharmaceutical companies adopted formal PAINs filters and quality control protocols.
- Jonathan Baell's PAINs substructure filters became widely integrated into cheminformatics pipelines.

**Clinical and Commercial Impact:**
- Several high-profile drug discovery programs were halted or redirected after retrospective PAINs analysis revealed their hits were artifacts. This particularly affected academic-led projects targeting challenging mechanisms.
- The field saw increased emphasis on orthogonal assay formats and mechanistic studies early in screening campaigns.
- Pharmaceutical companies invested more heavily in quality physical and biophysical characterization methods alongside traditional HTS, reducing wasted resources on false positives.

**Educational and Training Changes:**
- Medicinal chemistry curricula began incorporating systematic training on assay interference mechanisms.
- Grant review panels increasingly expected applicants to address PAINs concerns in proposal methodology sections.

**Continued Relevance:**
The core message about medicinal chemistry remaining essential proved prescient. Despite advances in AI drug design and structure-based methods, empirical synthesis and optimization continue to dominate successful drug discovery. The biotech industry's productivity challenges in subsequent years reinforced the article's arguments about the irreplaceable nature of careful experimental work.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1:** *No technological shortcuts would replace medicinal chemistry synthesis and optimization*
- **Outcome:** **Accurate.** Despite advances in computational methods, machine learning, and AI-driven drug design (particularly post-2018), successful drug discovery programs still heavily rely on iterative synthesis cycles. Companies like Schrödinger, Atomwise, and DeepMind's AlphaFold have enhanced certain aspects but haven't eliminated the need for traditional medicinal chemistry.

**Prediction 2:** *Large screening libraries (>100K compounds) would become standard for challenging targets*
- **Outcome:** **Mixed.** While large screens became more common, the trend also moved toward more sophisticated, mechanism-informed smaller libraries rather than pure brute-force approaches. DNA-encoded libraries (DEL) grew in popularity as an alternative paradigm, and fragment-based drug discovery gained traction for difficult targets.

**Prediction 3:** *Computational PAINs filters alone would prove insufficient*
- **Outcome:** **Accurate.** The community indeed recognized that filters catch only known problematic structures while novel interference mechanisms continuously emerge. Multi-assay validation, orthogonal readouts, and mechanistic deconvolution became standard practice alongside computational filtering.

**Prediction 4:** *Management would continue underestimating the time and effort needed for hit-to-lead optimization*
- **Outcome:** **Accurate.** The biotech industry's continued struggles with R&D productivity through the late 2010s and early 2020s validated this concern. Pressure for faster timelines often led to premature advancement of problematic candidates.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article correctly identified a critical quality control issue that was gaining recognition and accurately predicted the continued importance of careful experimental work. Its influence on best practices in screening and hit validation was substantial, though some specific recommendations about library size became less central as alternative screening paradigms emerged.
