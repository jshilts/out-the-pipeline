# Running Novartis (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the leadership transition at Novartis Pharmaceuticals, where Jay Bradner is taking over research operations from Mark Fishman. The author reflects that Novartis has maintained relatively stable R&D operations over the past decade compared to other large pharmaceutical companies, avoiding major job-slashing upheavals and mega-mergers that have characterized the industry. Fishman had entered the company around 2004-2005 with a vision of transformative science, though the reality by 2015 fell somewhat short of revolutionary changes due to what the author characterizes as "biochemical reality" - the inherent complications and delays in drug research.

The article speculates on two possible paths for Bradner's leadership: either a traditional "shake things up" approach with sweeping changes (common when new leadership arrives) or a "stay the course" strategy, which the author suggests is more likely given Novartis's relatively successful track record. The author acknowledges the challenges Bradner will face in transitioning from academia to industry, including managing different constituencies and expectations, and notes the delicate balance required in pharmaceutical R&D between moving too quickly versus too slowly, diversifying too much versus over-concentrating resources.

## 2. HISTORY

The article was published at a pivotal time for Novartis. In the subsequent years, Novartis experienced significant developments that validated the author's "stay the course" prediction:

**R&D Transformation Journey**: Rather than radical restructuring, Novartis maintained its course and focused on core therapeutic areas. Over 2016-2018, Novartis regrouped into five focused business units: Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Alcon (eye care), Sandoz (generics), and later expanded into gene therapy with its 2018 acquisition of AveXis.

**Jay Bradner's Impact**: Jay Bradner, who joined from Harvard/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, did implement changes but through evolution rather than revolution. His approach emphasized platform development for targeted therapies, including cell and gene therapies. Novartis pursued strategic acquisitions, including the 2018 purchase of AveXis (for its spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy, later commercialized as Zolgensma).

**Drug Pipeline and FDA Approvals**: In the years immediately following 2015, Novartis's pipeline delivered several important medications:
- Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), a CAR-T cell therapy, received FDA approval in August 2017 for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia
- Kisqali (ribociclib), approved in March 2017 for HR+/HER2- breast cancer
- Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan), already approved in 2015, experienced broader uptake and expanded indications for heart failure care

The company continued navigating the balance between innovation and practical drug development, maintaining steady employment in R&D while the broader pharmaceutical industry continued consolidation and restructuring.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1**: "The new guy just doesn't get it" doubts about Bradner's transition from academia
- **Outcome**: Jay Bradner successfully navigated the transition and implemented evolutionary changes rather than radical restructuring, reflecting continuity with Novartis's approach.

**Prediction 2**: Two possible paths - radical shakeup versus staying the course
- **Outcome**: The prediction that Bradner would follow a "stay the course" approach proved largely accurate. Novartis maintained stability in its research operations while evolving its platform focus.

**Prediction 3**: The suggestion that delivering "drugs that are useful enough that people will actually be willing to pay money for them" would determine success
- **Outcome**: Novartis continued delivering marketable drugs in subsequent years, including breakthrough therapies like Kymriah and expanded indications for existing products, validating the commercial focus.

**Prediction 4**: Implicit suggestions about R&D headcount trends (decreasing industry-wide)
- **Outcome**: By 2018, Novartis did indeed restructure, including R&D staff reductions and the spinning off of Alcon, consistent with broader industry patterns of consolidation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article provides moderate historical interest as an accurate contemporary snapshot of a major pharmaceutical company's leadership transition at a pivotal moment in drug development history. While not groundbreaking scientifically, it captured an important moment accurately - the beginning of a leadership transition that would guide Novartis through the emergence of transformative therapies like CAR-T and gene therapies. The author's predictions and observations about the pharmaceutical industry's challenges remain relevant for understanding the tensions between innovation and commercial viability in drug development.

The main limitation on historical importance is the article's focus on organizational dynamics rather than specific scientific breakthroughs, which reduces its relevance to biotechnology's most impactful developments in the post-2015 period.
