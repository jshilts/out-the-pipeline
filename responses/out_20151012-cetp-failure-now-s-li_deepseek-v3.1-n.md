# CETP Failure: Now It's Lilly's Turn (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 commentary reviews the clinical failure of Eli Lilly's evacetrapib, a CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibitor intended to raise HDL cholesterol and combat cardiovascular disease alongside statins' LDL-lowering effects. The article contextualizes this within a decade of industry failures targeting CETP, starting with Pfizer's torcetrapib in 2006, which showed toxicity and increased mortality, followed by Roche abandoning their program in 2012. Lilly's evacetrapib failed in Phase III not due to safety issues but complete lack of efficacy, with the data monitoring committee finding no chance of meeting primary endpoints. The author questions whether Merck's anacetrapib—still in development at the time—can succeed where others failed, noting the substantial financial and scientific investment in CETP inhibition, with most companies regretting their involvement.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent years validated the article's skepticism about CETP inhibition. Merck continued its REVEAL trial with anacetrapib through 2017, but results showed only modest cardiovascular benefit despite massive sample size (30,000+ patients), with a 1% absolute risk reduction after 4 years that failed to justify clinical or commercial viability. Merck abandoned the drug in 2017 without seeking regulatory approval, effectively ending the CETP inhibitor class as a viable cardiovascular therapeutic approach.

Scientific understanding evolved to recognize that CETP's role in HDL metabolism is more complex than initially believed, with research showing that CETP inhibition, while raising HDL-C levels, doesn't predictably translate to improved cardiovascular outcomes. The broader cardiovascular drug development landscape shifted focus toward PCSK9 inhibitors, which successfully lowered LDL and demonstrated clear efficacy, gaining FDA approval and market adoption. The CETP inhibitor experience became a case study in drug development about the hazards of mechanism-based assumptions and biomarker surrogates (HDL-C levels) that don't correlate with clinical benefit.

The pharmaceutical industry largely abandoned HDL-raising as a strategy, with no CETP inhibitors reaching regulatory approval or clinical use. Lilly's stock decline following the 2015 announcement proved temporary, as the company successfully diversified its pipeline in other therapeutic areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction about Merck's anacetrapib**: The article questioned whether Merck's drug would succeed where others failed, suggesting it would likely "go down the same chute." This proved substantially accurate—while anacetrapib showed marginal benefit, it failed to demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy and was never approved.

• **General skepticism about CETP inhibition viability**: The article's tone suggested the entire mechanism might be fundamentally unproductive. History confirmed this, with no CETP inhibitors achieving clinical success despite decades of effort and billions in investment.

• **Implication about HDL-raising paradigm**: While not explicit predictions, the article's critique of the underlying scientific premise foreshadowed the broader scientific reassessment that simply raising HDL cholesterol levels doesn't reliably improve cardiovascular outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
**Decile Score: 7**

This article exemplifies the importance of scientific skepticism in drug development and correctly anticipated the ultimate failure of an entire therapeutic approach, making it historically significant as the CETP inhibitor class reached its endpoint.
