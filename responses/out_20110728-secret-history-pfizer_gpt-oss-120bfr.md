# The Secret History of Pfizer (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Fortune feature (July 28 2011) portrayed the internal power struggle at Pfizer that culminated in the ouster of CEO Jeff Kindler.  It described how former CEOs Albert B. “Al” Steere and William R. McKinnell III (the “founding father” of modern Pfizer) continued to wield influence after Kindler’s departure, with Steere allegedly pulling strings from the board while McKinnell drifted into industry‑wide roles and philanthropy.  The article also recounted McKinnell’s 2002 $60 billion Pharmacia acquisition, the “shots‑on‑goal” R&D philosophy of casting a wide net of compounds, and a series of back‑room maneuvers—anonymous letters, secret meetings, and board‑age‑limit changes—to keep the old guard in place.  Overall, the piece painted Pfizer as a corporation where personal politics, rather than scientific merit, were driving strategic decisions.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Leadership changes**  
* 2010 – Jeff Kindler stepped down; Ian Read (formerly CFO) became CEO in early 2011 and remained until 2019.  
* 2019 – Albert Bourla, who had led Pfizer’s vaccine business, succeeded Read and is still CEO in 2026.  

**Major acquisitions & divestitures**  
| Year | Deal | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| 2015 | **Hospira** (US$17 bn) – a generic injectable and biosimilar business | Integrated into Pfizer’s “global supply” platform; later spun off as **Pfizer‑Pfizer** (2020) and sold to Mylan (now Viatris) in 2020. |
| 2019 | **Array BioPharma** (US$11.4 bn) – oncology pipeline (e.g., Braftovi, Mektovi) | Added several late‑stage cancer drugs; Braftovi/Mektovi received FDA approval in 2020 for melanoma. |
| 2022 | **Global Blood Therapeutics** (US$5.4 bn) – sickle‑cell disease drug (voxelotor) | Voxelotor (Oxbryta) received FDA approval in 2022 and is now a core product in Pfizer’s hematology portfolio. |
| 2023 | **Seagen** (US$43 bn) – antibody‑drug conjugates (ADCs) | Completed in August 2023; gave Pfizer a robust ADC platform (e.g., Tivdak, Padcev) and expanded its oncology pipeline. |

**Key product milestones**  

| Year | Product | Significance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 2012 | **Xalkori** (crizotinib) – first FDA‑approved ALK inhibitor (acquired from Pfizer’s own R&D) | Demonstrated that Pfizer’s “shots‑on‑goal” could yield a breakthrough oncology drug, though it was later out‑competed by newer agents. |
| 2012‑2020 | **Xeljanz** (tofacitinib) – JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, later ulcerative colitis & psoriatic arthritis | Became one of Pfizer’s top‑selling drugs, generating > $5 bn annual revenue at its peak. |
| 2020‑2021 | **Comirnaty** (BNT162b2) – COVID‑19 mRNA vaccine (partnered with BioNTech) | Delivered > $30 bn in 2021, propelling Pfizer’s total revenue to a record $81.3 bn.  The vaccine’s success validated Pfizer’s willingness to invest heavily in novel platforms. |
| 2022‑2023 | **Tivdak** (tisotumab vedotin) – ADC for recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer | First FDA approval of an ADC for this indication; part of the Seagen‑derived pipeline. |
| 2023 | **Lorbrena** (lorlatinib) – third‑generation ALK inhibitor | Approved for ALK‑positive NSCLC; complements earlier ALK drugs and shows continued oncology focus. |

**R&D spending & “shots‑on‑goal”**  
* Pfizer’s R&D budget rose from ≈ $7 bn in 2011 to a peak of $13.8 bn in 2021 (driven largely by the COVID‑19 vaccine).  
* After the pandemic surge, R&D fell back to ≈ $12 bn (2023) as the company re‑balanced toward biologics and ADCs.  
* The “broad‑pipeline” approach persisted, but the portfolio has become more focused on biologics, gene‑therapy platforms, and ADCs rather than the earlier small‑molecule “shot‑gun” model.

**Financial performance**  
* 2011‑2014: modest growth, revenue hovering around $50‑55 bn, with profit margins under 20 %.  
* 2015‑2019: incremental growth from Hospira and oncology acquisitions; 2019 revenue $51.8 bn.  
* 2020‑2021: COVID‑19 vaccine drove revenue to $81.3 bn (2021) and net income to $22 bn.  
* 2022‑2024: Revenue fell back to $100 bn (2022) then to $81 bn (2023) as vaccine sales collapsed; profit margins compressed, prompting cost‑cutting and a $4 bn share‑repurchase program (2022‑2023).  

**Corporate governance**  
* The board’s “mandatory retirement age” was indeed amended in 2012 to allow Bill Steere (the article’s “Steere”) to remain past 72; the provision was later removed in 2015 as part of a broader governance overhaul.  
* Under Bourla, the board adopted a “one‑person‑one‑vote” policy for directors and increased independent representation, moving away from the old‑guard dominance described in the 2011 piece.

**Policy & public perception**  
* Pfizer’s involvement in the COVID‑19 vaccine rollout placed it at the center of global health policy debates, leading to new U.S. and EU procurement frameworks that emphasized “technology transfer” and “price transparency.”  
* In 2022, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) announced a “Vaccine Access” initiative that required Pfizer (and other manufacturers) to share certain manufacturing know‑how with qualified partners—a direct response to the public‑policy scrutiny that began during the pandemic.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied or stated in the 2011 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“Shots on goal” R&D would keep delivering blockbuster drugs for years.** | Pfizer did launch a few blockbusters (Xeljanz, COVID‑19 vaccine) but the pipeline became increasingly reliant on acquisitions (Array, Seagen) rather than internally discovered small molecules. |
| **The Pharmacia acquisition would be a long‑term growth engine.** | The $60 bn Pharmacia deal added Celebrex and other assets, but integration challenges and later divestitures (e.g., Hospira spin‑off) meant the acquisition’s ROI was modest; it did not sustain growth on its own. |
| **Leadership turmoil would hinder strategic execution.** | After Kindler’s exit, Ian Read provided a relatively stable period (2011‑2019). The later transition to Bourla was smooth, and the company executed the COVID‑19 vaccine program successfully, suggesting the turmoil was short‑lived. |
| **Board manipulation (age‑limit changes) would keep old executives in power.** | The board did temporarily raise the retirement age for Bill Steere, but the rule was later rescinded, and the board’s composition was overhauled under Bourla, reducing the influence of the old guard. |
| **Pfizer would continue to rely on “big‑ticket” acquisitions to replace internal innovation.** | True. The post‑2015 era saw a string of large purchases (Hospira, Array, Global Blood Therapeutics, Seagen) that now constitute > 30 % of Pfizer’s total pipeline. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article offers a rare, behind‑the‑scenes look at Pfizer’s leadership dynamics at a pivotal moment, and many of its themes (R&D strategy, board politics, acquisition‑driven growth) echo in the company’s subsequent decade‑long evolution.  It is not a technical breakthrough story, but its corporate‑history perspective remains highly relevant.
