# More on Outsourcing
28 Feb 2006

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the emerging trend of medical outsourcing, specifically using "nighthawk" firms in radiology where nighttime U.S. medical imaging could be interpreted by radiologists in Bangalore during their daytime hours. The author references a New England Journal of Medicine perspective that examined both the benefits and potential problems of such services.

The article acknowledges that medical outsourcing faced resistance from physicians and specialty societies who might use "legislation, licensure, certification, and reimbursement" to protect their livelihoods, often framed as quality or patient safety concerns. However, the author advocates for embracing outsourcing that serves patients' interests while focusing on improving local care quality and efficiency. The piece concludes with a free-trade perspective, arguing that American research firms should welcome global competition as it ultimately benefits everyone through innovation.

## 2. HISTORY

Medical outsourcing, particularly in radiology, did expand significantly after 2006, though not as rapidly as some predicted. Teleradiology became increasingly common, with many U.S. hospitals contracting with both domestic and international radiology groups for overnight coverage. However, several factors tempered the growth:

**Regulatory and Licensing Barriers**: State medical licensing requirements created significant hurdles for international radiologists to interpret U.S. patient images. Many states require full licensure for physicians reading studies on their residents, regardless of where the physician is located. This limited pure offshore outsourcing compared to domestic teleradiology networks.

**Liability and Malpractice Concerns**: Hospitals and practices faced questions about malpractice coverage and legal jurisdiction when using offshore services, leading many to prefer domestic outsourcing arrangements.

**Quality Control and Integration**: While technology made image transmission seamless, workflow integration, patient communication, and quality assurance remained challenges that favored more integrated domestic solutions.

**Growth in Domestic Teleradiology**: Instead of massive offshore outsourcing, the industry saw substantial growth in domestic teleradiology firms that could provide 24/7 coverage across different U.S. time zones. Companies like vRad (Virtual Radiologic) and others expanded significantly, often using U.S.-based radiologists working remotely.

**Hybrid Models**: Many institutions adopted hybrid approaches, maintaining local radiologists for complex cases and routine daytime work while using teleradiology services (both domestic and occasionally international) for preliminary reads and nighttime coverage.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Full-blown medical outsourcing is decades away"** vs. **"pace of change might actually be shockingly rapid"**: 
  - **Outcome**: The pace was slower than anticipated for pure offshore outsourcing. While teleradiology adoption grew substantially, regulatory and liability barriers prevented the kind of rapid, widespread offshore migration seen in other industries like call centers. The change was evolutionary rather than revolutionary.

• **"Physicians and specialty societies will undoubtedly use the tools of legislation, licensure, certification, and reimbursement to thwart perceived threats"**:
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate. State licensing requirements became a major barrier, and professional organizations like the American College of Radiology established guidelines and standards that, while intended to ensure quality, also created hurdles for international outsourcing.

• **"People and institutions that are harmed by outsourcing will not take it sitting down"**:
  - **Outcome**: Correct prediction. There was significant resistance from radiologist groups concerned about job security and quality standards, leading to various protective measures and advocacy efforts.

• **Implicit prediction that offshore medical outsourcing would follow the pattern of "high-tech call centers" migrating to Bangalore:
  - **Outcome**: This did not materialize to the same extent. While some medical transcription, billing, and supporting services did move offshore, core clinical services like radiology interpretation faced much higher barriers than call center work due to regulatory, liability, and quality control requirements.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **3/10**
This article touches on important trends in healthcare delivery and globalization, but its focus on a specific moment in the outsourcing debate has limited lasting relevance compared to broader discussions about healthcare technology, telemedicine evolution, or global health equity.
