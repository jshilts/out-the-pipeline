# Lilly's Two-Drugs-a-Year Prediction (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

In December 2012, a Science Magazine blog post by Derek Lowe examined Eli Lilly's ambitious 2010 prediction that the company would begin producing two new drugs per year starting in 2013. The article was published as 2013 approached and found the prediction looking unlikely to succeed. The context was that Lilly's CEO John Lechleiter had made this forecast in 2010 while trying to reassure investors about the company's ability to weather major patent expirations on blockbuster drugs.

By late 2012, the article noted that Lilly had experienced what the author called a "brutal string of late-stage clinical failures," including multiple Phase III trial disappointments and the withdrawal of the sepsis drug Xigris in 2011. The company had also invested heavily in Alzheimer's disease research with disappointing results. The author expressed skepticism that any pharmaceutical company could sustain a pace of two new drug approvals per year, characterizing such predictions as unrealistic "happy talk" that the stock market nevertheless seemed to demand from drug company executives.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Trial Outcomes (2013-2023):**
Following the article's publication, Eli Lilly's R&D productivity did not meet the two-drugs-per-year target. Between 2013 and 2022, Eli Lilly received FDA approval for approximately eight novel drugs (excluding line extensions and reformulations), averaging less than one per year. These included diabetes drugs like Trulicity (2014) and Jardiance (2014), psoriasis drug Taltz (2016), cancer drugs Cyramza (2014) and Verzenio (2017), migraine prevention drug Emgality (2018), immunosuppressant Olumiant (2018), and cancer drug Retevmo (2020).

**The Alzheimer's Gamble:**
The article's concern about Lilly's "big bet on Alzheimer's" proved prescient. The company's Alzheimer's program for solanezumab failed multiple Phase III trials and was ultimately abandoned. However, in 2023, Lilly received FDA approval for donanemab (branded as Kisunla), which showed modest efficacy in slowing cognitive decline. This came more than a decade after the company's earlier Alzheimer's failures.

**Stock Performance vs. R&D Reality:**
Despite not meeting the two-drug target, Lilly's stock performed exceptionally well, particularly from 2020-2024, largely driven by diabetes drugs Mounjaro (tirzepatide) and Zepbound, and the Alzheimer's drug donanemab. The company's market capitalization grew from approximately $50 billion in 2012 to over $740 billion by 2024, making it the world's largest pharmaceutical company by market cap.

**Industry Context:**
The author's broader point about industry-wide productivity challenges proved accurate. No major pharmaceutical company consistently achieved two novel drug approvals per year between 2013-2023. The average among major pharma companies remained below one novel drug approval annually, with development timelines often exceeding 10-12 years and costs per approved drug estimated at $2-3 billion.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Lilly's Two-Drugs-Per-Year Forecast:** The company predicted it would begin launching two new drugs per year starting in 2013. **Result:** Failed to achieve this target, averaging less than one novel drug approval annually between 2013-2022. The prediction proved overly optimistic.

• **Implicit Prediction About Stock Market Demands:** The article suggested that "happy talk" predictions were what "everyone would rather hear" and that the stock market wouldn't tolerate honest assessments of R&D uncertainty. **Result:** Partially accurate - while realistic R&D projections remain rare, investors ultimately rewarded Lilly's stock based on eventual drug successes, not just optimistic forecasts.

• **Industry Productivity Challenge:** The article's broader implication that sustained two-drug-per-year productivity was historically unprecedented and unlikely to be achieved. **Result:** Confirmed - no major pharmaceutical company maintained this pace between 2013-2023.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/10**

This article captures a revealing moment in pharmaceutical industry history - an ambitious prediction that proved unrealistic yet occurred within a company that ultimately achieved remarkable success. The disconnect between short-term R&D productivity failures and long-term market success makes this historically interesting, illustrating how drug development timelines and investor expectations often misalign.
