# They Don't Make These Things to Have Dichloromethane Poured on 'Em (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary recounts a laboratory mishap in which a researcher accidentally spilled dichloromethane (DCM) onto an Apple wireless keyboard that was being used near HPLC and LC‑MS equipment. The author notes that, despite the prevalence of electronic lab notebooks and computer hardware in modern analytical labs, they have never seen a keyboard actually melt from a solvent spill. The piece is largely anecdotal, describing the “crunchy” feel of the damaged keys and joking that the hardware survived, albeit in a compromised state. No broader scientific claim or technical analysis is offered; the article is essentially a humorous observation about the fragility of consumer electronics in a wet‑lab environment.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2012 there have been no notable scientific or commercial developments directly tied to this incident. The episode is occasionally cited in informal blog posts as a cautionary tale about keeping solvents away from electronics, but it has not spurred any major policy changes or product redesigns.  

* **Laboratory safety practices** – Over the past decade, many institutions have reinforced standard operating procedures that explicitly forbid placing electronic devices near open solvent containers. Spill‑containment kits and “no‑electronics” zones are now common in chemistry labs, but these practices pre‑date the article and were not introduced because of it.  

* **Solvent usage trends** – Dichloromethane remains a widely used extraction solvent, but regulatory pressure (e.g., EPA and EU restrictions on VOC emissions) has encouraged a gradual shift toward greener alternatives such as ethyl acetate or 2‑methyltetrahydrofuran. This shift is unrelated to the keyboard incident.  

* **Hardware durability** – Consumer‑grade keyboards have not been redesigned specifically for resistance to organic solvents. Laboratory‑grade input devices (e.g., sealed, silicone‑coated keyboards) continue to be marketed for harsh environments, but their adoption remains niche because most labs still rely on standard office keyboards protected by careful handling.  

* **Public discourse** – The article lives on mainly as a humorous footnote in chemistry‑blog circles; it has not been referenced in scientific literature, safety guidelines, or regulatory documents.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The piece does not contain explicit forecasts. Implicitly, the author suggests that such solvent‑induced damage is rare. The subsequent record supports that view: widespread reports of keyboards melting from DCM spills are still absent, indicating the incident was an outlier rather than a trend.

* **Implicit prediction:** “We don’t see many keyboards melted in labs.”  
  *Outcome:* Accurate. Over the ensuing decade, only occasional anecdotal reports have surfaced, and no systematic problem has been documented.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **2/10**  
The article is a brief, humorous anecdote with limited relevance to biotechnology or broader scientific progress; its only value lies in a light‑hearted reminder about lab safety.
