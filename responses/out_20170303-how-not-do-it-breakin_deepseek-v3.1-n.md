# How Not to Do It: Breaking up Ammonium Nitrate (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes the 1921 ammonium nitrate explosion at the BASF plant in Oppau, Germany, which killed 561 people and devastated the facility. The company had stored mixed ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate salts, which formed a rock-like mass. BASF tested the mixed salt and found it insensitive to detonation, so they regularly broke it up with dynamite over several years. The article also references the 1947 Texas City disaster and highlights that ammonium nitrate explosions have continued occurring periodically, including the 2015 Tianjin explosions. The central lesson is that complacency around handling energetic materials is dangerous, and just because a method appears safe on the surface doesn't guarantee safety under all conditions.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this article's publication in 2017, there have been several significant ammonium nitrate-related incidents and regulatory developments:

**Notable Explosions:**
- **August 2020, Port of Beirut**: Approximately 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored since 2014 at a warehouse detonated, killing 218 people, injuring over 7,000, causing massive property destruction, and triggering Lebanese government collapse.
- **September 2020, BASF Ludwigshafen**: A fire broke out at the same company's sprawling chemical complex, though it did not escalate to major explosion levels.
- **October 2021, North Georgia, USA**: An ammonium nitrate blast killed one person at a fertilizer storage facility.

**Regulatory Changes:**
- The Beirut disaster prompted widespread calls for stronger international regulations on ammonium nitrate storage and transport, leading to reviews of safety protocols in many countries.
- Many port cities around the world conducted emergency audits of ammonium nitrate storage facilities.
- The incident influenced maritime shipping and port storage safety discussions internationally.

**Industry Impact:**
- Major chemical companies faced increased public scrutiny of their ammonium nitrate storage and transport protocols.
- Some countries tightened existing regulations, though implementation has varied globally.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about the future. It primarily documented historical incidents and their lessons. The author's implication that ammonium nitrate disasters would likely continue proved accurate, as demonstrated by the 2020 Beirut explosion—one of the largest ammonium nitrate disasters since the article was published.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article offers important safety lessons that remain highly relevant, as demonstrated by the Beirut disaster occurring three years after publication. The balance of industrial chemistry history with enduring safety principles gives it lasting educational value.
