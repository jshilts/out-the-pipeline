# Dacomitinib Doesn't Come Through (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on Pfizer's announcement that dacomitinib, an irreversible kinase inhibitor targeting the HER kinase family in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), failed two Phase III trials by missing primary endpoints. The author notes this was particularly disappointing because dacomitinib was positioned as a centerpiece of Pfizer's oncology portfolio, and the compound had shown promising Phase II results. The mechanism involved targeting Cys773 at the edge of the ATP binding pocket across HER kinases, but this broad activity proved insufficient for the lung cancer indications tested. The piece emphasizes that even major pharmaceutical companies experience major late-stage trial failures.

## 2. HISTORY

**Approval Turnaround (2018):** Despite the 2014 Phase III failures reported in the article, dacomitinib (brand name Vizimpro) was ultimately **FDA-approved in September 2018** for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations. The approval was based on the ARCHER 1050 trial, which did demonstrate significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to gefitinib.

**Commercial Performance:** Following its 2018 approval, dacomitinib achieved **modest but not blockbuster commercial success**. By 2022, it generated approximately $100-150 million in annual sales, far below original expectations for a major oncology product from Pfizer. Market uptake was limited by competition from other EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib (Tagrisso) and afatinib (Gilotrif).

**Clinical Practice Adoption:** Dacomitinib established a **niche position** in EGFR-mutant NSCLC treatment. It is included in major clinical guidelines (NCCN, ESMO) but typically positioned as an alternative rather than first-choice therapy due to toxicity profile concerns (especially skin rash and diarrhea) and the strong data supporting osimertinib.

**Patent and Generic Competition:** Pfizer's dacomitinib patent expires in **2027**, after which generic competition will likely further erode market share.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Article's implicit prediction that dacomitinib would not be a major drug: PARTIALLY INACCURATE** - While dacomitinib never achieved blockbuster status, it did eventually gain FDA approval and has generated meaningful revenue, serving a specific patient population.
- **Article's assessment that Pfizer had a major failure on its hands: LARGELY ACCURATE** - Compared to initial expectations, the drug's commercial trajectory was indeed disappointing, achieving only modest market penetration rather than portfolio centerpiece status.
- **The article correctly anticipated** that finding patient subsets would be crucial - the eventual approval was specifically for EGFR-mutant patients, confirming that the initial broad patient population trials were problematic.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article is moderately interesting as a real-time snapshot of a major trial failure that was later followed by partial redemption through approval in a targeted patient population. It demonstrates how initial Phase III failures don't always represent the final story, and how important biomarker-based patient selection is in oncology. However, the long-term commercial outcome validated the article's skepticism about the drug's ultimate impact compared to initial expectations.

## 5. ANALYSIS
The dacomitinib story illustrates several important themes in drug development. First, the shift from broad patient populations to **biomarker-selected populations** was crucial - the eventual success came only when testing specifically in EGFR-mutant patients. Second, the case demonstrates that **Phase III failures need not be final**; drugs can sometimes be resurrected through better patient selection. However, the commercial outcome supports the article's skeptical tone - even with eventual approval, dacomitinib became a relatively minor player in the competitive EGFR inhibitor market, far from the portfolio centerpiece Pfizer initially envisioned. The story exemplifies how first-to-market advantages and superior tolerability profiles (like osimertinib's better side effect profile) often outweigh later entries even when efficacy is comparable.
