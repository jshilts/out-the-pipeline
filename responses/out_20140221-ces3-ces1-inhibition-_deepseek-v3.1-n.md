# Ces3 (Ces1) Inhibition As a Drug Target (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Nature Chemical Biology paper from the Cravatt group using activity-based proteomics to investigate carboxylesterase 3 (Ces3) as a potential drug target for metabolic disease. Through screening approximately 150 structurally diverse carbamates, researchers identified WWL113 and the more selective WWL229 as inhibitors that showed beneficial metabolic effects in mouse studies. The inhibitors improved glucose tolerance, lipid profiles, and notably cleared adipose deposits from the liver. The work built upon earlier genetic modification studies in rodents that had already suggested Ces3 as a therapeutic target, demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition could produce similar beneficial effects.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 article, Ces3 (carboxylesterase 3, also known as Ces1 in some nomenclature systems) continued to be investigated as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases, but the pathway faced significant challenges in translation to clinical applications. 

The research base expanded with continued academic studies validating the target's role in lipid metabolism, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome phenotypes. However, **no Ces3/Ces1 inhibitors have progressed to FDA approval** for metabolic diseases to date. The challenges reflect broader difficulties in targeting esterase enzymes, including achieving sufficient selectivity, managing potential off-target effects, and optimizing pharmacokinetic properties.

Clinical development in the NAFLD/NASH space shifted toward other mechanisms instead, with most late-stage drug development focusing on targets like FXR agonists (obeticholic acid), thyroid hormone receptor beta agonists, and PPAR modulators. While Ces3 remained of academic interest for understanding lipid metabolism, **it did not emerge as a clinically validated target** in the decade following the 2014 publication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, but it implied expectations about the therapeutic potential of Ces3 inhibition. • **Therapeutic potential**: The author noted the "beneficial effects" and that "a number of drug companies are interested" in clearing hepatic adipose deposits. While academic research continued, this did not translate into successful clinical development or approved therapies. • **Drug development pathway**: The article suggested pharmaceutical interest in the mechanism, but no Ces3 inhibitors successfully navigated the clinical development pipeline for metabolic diseases.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This represents a moderate-interest case study of promising early-stage academic research that failed to translate into clinical or commercial success, illustrating the common gap between preclinical findings and therapeutic applications.
