# What To Do About Chemistry Papers That Don't Work? (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary addresses a growing problem in chemistry research: published synthetic procedures that other labs cannot reproduce, yet do not rise to the level of clear fraud. The author highlights a reader's experience where a methodology paper on amine amination contained systematic errors—the reported reactions produced entirely different products (alkoxyamines instead of hydrazines) due to misanalyzed NMR data. The author shares a similar personal experience with an unresponsive Chemical Communications paper. 

The piece explores the ethical dilemma facing researchers who discover non-functional methods: contacting original authors often yields no response, formal rebuttals don't fit "interesting" research criteria, and public "name and shame" approaches create excessive burden. The article explicitly distinguishes these cases from Blog Syn efforts (community verification of working reactions) and grapples with how to correct the scientific record for what amounts to honest but incorrect science in lower-impact journals. The core question remains unresolved by the article's end: what institutional mechanism exists to flag and correct published but non-reproducible chemistry?

## 2. HISTORY

**Recognition of the Problem (2013-2016)**: Following this article, the reproducibility crisis in chemistry gained institutional recognition. In 2016, Nature published a survey of 1,576 researchers showing that over 70% had tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, with chemistry among the most affected fields.

**Journal Policy Changes**: Major chemistry journals began implementing reproducibility requirements. The Royal Society of Chemistry introduced detailed guidelines for experimental reporting around 2014-2015. By 2017, many journals required deposition of comprehensive experimental data, detailed NMR characterization, and in some cases, independent reproduction attempts before publication. Tetrahedron Letters (the journal mentioned in the article) strengthened its referee criteria for methodological papers.

**Formal Correction Mechanisms**: The period saw expansion of post-publication peer review platforms. PubPeer, launched in 2012, gained significant traction in chemistry by 2014-2015 as a venue for commenting on published papers, including reporting reproducibility issues. Some journals began accepting "Comment" articles specifically addressing reproducibility problems, though uptake remained limited compared to the scale of the problem.

**Chemical Industry Impact**: The pharmaceutical industry responded by placing greater emphasis on reproducibility in academic collaborations. Companies like Pfizer and GSK reported in the mid-2010s that they could only reproduce about 25-30% of published academic results, leading to more stringent validation requirements before pursuing external research leads.

**No Major Retractions**: Most cases like those described in the article did not lead to formal retractions, as they involved honest errors rather than misconduct. The scientific record remained largely uncorrected for papers in lower-tier journals, while higher-impact journals developed better mechanisms for addressing reproducibility concerns through editorial correspondence or formal comments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about how chemistry reproducibility issues would evolve:

• **"Anyone who does [run a 'Name and Shame' site] will find themselves with a lot more work and many more headaches than they'd imagined"**
  - **Accuracy**: Correct. PubPeer and similar platforms faced legal challenges, most notably in the 2015 case where a researcher sued PubPeer commenters, though platforms ultimately prevailed. The burden of moderation, legal costs, and managing harassment concerns proved substantial.

• **Implicit prediction that lack of correction mechanisms would persist**
  - **Accuracy**: Partially correct. While formal mechanisms improved somewhat for high-impact journals, the majority of reproducibility issues in lower-impact publications (like Tetrahedron Letters) remain unaddressed through official channels. Post-publication peer review filled some gaps but didn't achieve comprehensive coverage.

• **Implicit prediction that contacting original authors would remain ineffective**
  - **Accuracy**: This remained true for many cases. The 2016 Nature survey confirmed that author non-responsiveness was one of the most commonly cited barriers to resolving reproducibility issues, with many researchers reporting that original authors failed to provide adequate clarification or supporting data.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a critical moment in chemistry's confrontation with reproducibility challenges, identifying institutional gaps in scientific self-correction that remained partially unresolved for years. The specific dilemma—honest errors in methodology that don't warrant retraction but undermine research progress—represents a significant and ongoing challenge across experimental sciences.
