# Genius, Sheer Genius (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post comments on the proliferation of fraudulent practices in scientific publishing. It notes the existence of bogus scientific journals, services that sell fabricated research results to enable paper creation, and the problematic overuse of journal impact factors. The article then highlights a new scheme: selling fake impact factors themselves—charging publication fees from researchers chasing perceived prestige. The piece closes with a Farsi proverb: "A thief robs a thief, and God smiles," suggesting a kind of grim inevitability to predatory actors exploiting other predatory actors.

## 2. HISTORY

The practices described in this 2014 article continued to escalate and evolve. Beall's List—which originally documented predatory publishers—expanded for several years but was taken down in 2017 amid controversy; the problem did not abate. The term "paper mill" became widely used, and systematic investigations increasingly uncovered orchestrated fraud on a massive scale. By the mid-to-late 2010s and into the 2020s, major retractions occurred (e.g., hundreds of papers linked to organized paper mills), impacting numerous journals and institutions. Some publishers (e.g., SAGE, Springer) took down entire special issues; others (e.g., Wiley) announced large-scale retractions. In oncology, radiology, and applied/clinical biomedicine, systematic manipulation and citation rings were repeatedly identified. The response expanded from blacklists to proactive screening, AI-led integrity checks by publishers, and policy efforts (e.g., funding-agency mandates on open data and preregistration). Journal impact factors continued to be heavily criticized; in late 2022, DORA was officially adopted by the White House OSTP policy guidance. The commercialization of fake metrics persisted (e.g., for a fee, journals could quickly appear in certain indexes), alongside cottage industries offering "evidence-based" predatory detection services to institutions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not include explicit dated predictions about the future; it primarily offered a sardonic commentary on the state of misconduct. Its tone implied that the pathologies of metrics gaming and pay-to-publish schemes would intensify— a trajectory broadly consistent with subsequent developments—but it did not lay out testable forecasting claims.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The piece insightfully captures the recursive dishonesty in the publishing ecosystem. Although brief and polemical, it highlights a mechanism of fraud that grew in scale and sophistication over the next decade, making it a useful contemporary window into the era's zeitgeist rather than a report on major R&D or clinical outcomes.
