# Advice For Those Trying High-Throughput Screening (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a commentary from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog responding to an academic group seeking advice on entering high-throughput screening (HTS). The author emphasizes the importance of clarifying screening objectives upfront—whether seeking tool compounds, cell-permeable probes, in vivo candidates, or (ambitiously) actual drug candidates—as each goal demands different strategic approaches.

The article highlights critical quality control considerations that were becoming recognized in 2012: avoiding "frequent-hitter" structures (PAINS—pan-assay interference compounds) and screening artifacts like aggregators that can produce false positives. Lowe references emerging literature on these problematic compound classes and stresses the assay-specific nature of such interference, noting that compounds benign in one system can cause trouble in others. The piece solicits community input on best practices for academic groups entering HTS.

## 2. HISTORY

The issues raised in this 2012 article became increasingly significant in subsequent years, with several concrete developments:

**PAINS Awareness and Curation (2013-2020+):** The problematic compound classes mentioned (PAINS) became widely recognized, leading to computational filters that are now standard in academic and pharmaceutical screening. Database curators (ChEMBL, PubChem) began flagging or removing PAINS structures, and journals increasingly required disclosure of PAINS filtering in screening publications. The aggregator issues highlighted by Shoichet's work led to improved counter-screening protocols using detergent-based confirmation assays.

**Shift in Academic Screening:** Many academic screening centers evolved toward more targeted approaches rather than pure high-throughput campaigns, focusing on fragment-based drug discovery, DNA-encoded libraries, or phenotypic screening with better validation. The cost-ineffectiveness of large-scale academic HTS became more apparent, with some centers consolidating or pivoting to collaborative pharmaceutical partnerships.

**Tool Compound Development:** The distinction Lowe drew between tool compounds and drug candidates became increasingly important in chemical probe development, leading to initiatives like the NIH's Illuminating the Druggable Genome program and structural genomics consortia that focused specifically on high-quality chemical probes rather than drug candidates, with better defined criteria for cellular activity, selectivity, and mechanistic validation.

**FDA Drug Approvals Context:** The period saw continued modest output from HTS-based drug discovery, with successes including kinase inhibitors and targeted oncology drugs, but also notable failures where HTS hits couldn't be optimized into drugs. This reinforced Lowe's caution about distinguishing drug candidates from mere screening hits.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself doesn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather provides cautionary guidance based on 2012 understanding. The piece anticipated that academic groups entering HTS without proper quality controls would produce unreliable results. The implicit expectations were that quality over quantity, better curation, and assay validation would become increasingly important—trends that largely materialized in the subsequent decade through standardized PAINS filtering, improved aggregator detection protocols, and shift toward phenotypic screening with orthogonal validation.

## 4. INTEREST

**6/9** - This article represents an important snapshot of an inflection point in drug discovery methodology, capturing emerging awareness of quality control issues that became standard practice within a few years, though it deals with relatively technical screening specifics rather than broader transformative developments.
