# Nitric Acid And Your Lab Coat (May 18, 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief personal anecdote about laboratory safety involving nitric acid/sulfuric acid nitration procedures. The author recounts seeing a photo of a damaged lab coat from an acid spill, then shares their own similar experience from 1984 when sulfuric acid splashback ruined one of their shirts. The piece emphasizes the importance of wearing proper personal protective equipment (specifically lab coats) when working with corrosive acids, noting that while getting acid on protective clothing is problematic, it's far preferable to having it contact bare skin.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2015, laboratory safety practices and standards have continued to evolve, though the fundamental importance of PPE like lab coats remains unchanged. The period has seen:

- **Enhanced safety protocols**: Increased emphasis on risk assessment and safety training in academic and industrial labs
- **Improved PPE technology**: Development of more advanced lab coat materials with better chemical resistance
- **Regulatory developments**: Continued strengthening of OSHA laboratory safety standards and institutional safety requirements
- **Industry practices**: Widespread adoption of the fundamental safety principle highlighted in the article - that PPE serves as a critical barrier between hazardous materials and the body

The core message of the article - that lab coats prevent serious injury from chemical splashes - remains a foundational principle taught in laboratory safety training programs worldwide.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific forward-looking predictions about biotechnology or scientific developments. It was a retrospective safety anecdote rather than a forward-looking analytical piece.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the safety message has enduring value, the article lacks broader insights relevant to biotechnology industry developments, scientific breakthroughs, or substantial analysis meriting detailed retrospective evaluation.
