# Models and Reality (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article uses wind tunnels in aerodynamics as an analogy to explain why computer simulations alone aren't sufficient for drug discovery. The author highlights that computational models involve approximations and can't capture all real-world complexities—particularly turbulent flow in aerodynamics and molecular interactions in drug design. The piece emphasizes that just as aerospace engineers must validate computational fluid dynamics with physical wind tunnel tests, drug discovery remains an empirical science requiring real-world experimental validation through medicinal chemistry departments. The article argues that experienced modelers understand their work involves approximations of reality, not perfect representations.

## 2. HISTORY

The fundamental tension between computational modeling and empirical validation described in this 2013 article has remained remarkably consistent over the past decade. While computational methods have advanced significantly, the core principles articulated here have proven durable:

**Computational Advances:** Structure-based drug design, molecular dynamics simulations, and AI-driven approaches (particularly AlphaFold's protein structure predictions from 2021 onward) have become increasingly sophisticated. Companies like Schrödinger, Atomwise, and later entrants have built businesses around computational drug discovery platforms.

**Continued Empirical Reality:** However, drug discovery pipelines still face high failure rates. The vast majority of drug candidates that look promising in silico fail in clinical trials due to unforeseen biological complexity, toxicity, or lack of efficacy. This reflects the author's core point about models being approximations.

**Medicinal Chemistry Persistence:** Pharmaceutical companies continue to maintain large medicinal chemistry departments, confirming the author's observation about the empirical nature of the business. While computational tools guide discovery, synthesis and biological testing remain essential.

**Regulatory Impact:** The FDA and EMA have increasingly accepted modeling and simulation data as supplementary evidence, but still require robust empirical clinical data for drug approval. This institutional reality reinforces the need for experimental validation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather described an ongoing tension between computational modeling and empirical requirements. The underlying principle—that models are approximations requiring empirical validation—has held true across multiple domains beyond drug discovery:

• **Autonomous Vehicles:** Despite sophisticated simulation environments, real-world testing remains essential due to "edge cases" and unpredictable human behavior
• **Climate Models:** While increasingly accurate, still require validation against observational data
• **Protein Folding:** AlphaFold's success (2021) represents a major computational breakthrough, yet experimental structure determination via crystallography and cryo-EM remains the gold standard for drug discovery applications

The broader implication that computational modeling supplements rather than replaces empirical work has proven accurate across scientific domains.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses a fundamental and enduring tension between computational modeling and empirical validation that remains highly relevant across multiple scientific fields. While the specific examples are dated, the underlying principle continues to inform debates about AI's role in science. The core insight—that good modelers understand the limitations of their approximations—has proven prescient as computational methods have advanced but not eliminated the need for experimental validation.
