# Value For the Money (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses BioCentury's "Back to School" issue from September 2013, which warned the biopharmaceutical industry about escalating payer demands for healthcare value. The article highlighted growing pressure on drug developers to demonstrate clear differentiation from existing treatments, pointing to the example of 54 compounds simultaneously targeting VEGF/VEGFR pathways as evidence of overcrowded "me-too" development that payers would likely reject without proven superiority.

The piece argues that companies must abandon resistance to third-party value assessments and instead participate actively in comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evaluations. BioCentury's four recommendations focus on early collaboration with payers, regulatory agencies, and patient groups to define value; working with quality-mandated payers; engaging with health technology assessment bodies; and fundamentally changing traditional industry attitudes as pricing power diminishes.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2013 saw dramatic acceleration in value-based healthcare demands that validated BioCentury's warnings. Several key developments reshaped the landscape:

**Payer Behavior Evolution**: Between 2014-2024, major payers increasingly implemented strict value assessment frameworks. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, and OptumRx expanded prior authorization requirements and formulary exclusions based on comparative effectiveness data. Medicare and commercial insurers adopted quality-adjusted life year (QALY) metrics and other cost-effectiveness thresholds.

**FDA Regulatory Changes**: The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation program, launched in 2012, gained substantial momentum. By 2024, over 300 designations had been granted, with the program proving particularly impactful in oncology and rare diseases. However, accelerated approvals faced increased post-marketing requirement scrutiny, with several high-profile confirmatory trial failures.

**VEGF/VEGFR Inhibitor Market**: The crowded VEGF pathway space saw significant consolidation. While bevacizumab (Avastin), aflibercept (Eylea/Zaltrap), and ramucirumab (Cyramza) achieved commercial success, numerous candidates failed to demonstrate meaningful differentiation, resulting in development discontinuations.

**Health Technology Assessment Growth**: ICER (Institute for Clinical and Economic Review), founded in 2006, gained substantial influence post-2013. Major payers incorporated ICER assessments into coverage decisions, while NICE in the UK continued expanding its technology appraisal programs.

**Value-Based Pricing Pressures**: High-profile drug pricing controversies emerged, including the Turing Pharmaceuticals/Shkreli scandal (2015), hepatitis C drug pricing battles, and congressional investigations into pharmaceutical pricing practices. These led to increased transparency requirements and Medicare Part D redesign legislation over the subsequent decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Companies must create value-differentiation cases during discovery Phase, not later in clinical development.
  - **Reality**: This prediction proved largely correct but underestimated implementation costs. While some companies successfully integrated value assessment early (particularly in rare diseases and oncology), many smaller companies continued deferring differentiation studies to partners due to resource constraints.

• **Prediction**: The 54 VEGF/VEGFR-targeted compounds were unlikely to achieve sufficient differentiation.
  - **Reality**: **Accurate**. Most VEGF pathway inhibitors pursued after 2013 either failed in development or achieved only modest commercial success unless demonstrating clear advantages in specific populations or administration routes.

• **Prediction**: Comparative and cost-effectiveness assessments could not be stopped; industry should participate rather than resist.
  - **Reality**: **Correct directionally**. Industry engagement with ICER, NICE, and other HTA bodies increased significantly, with many companies submitting data to assessments. However, tensions persisted, particularly around methodology disagreements and transparency.

• **Prediction**: Real-world outcomes data collection after approval would become essential for payer acceptance.
  - **Reality**: **Validated**. Post-approval evidence generation became standard practice, with FDA increasingly requiring post-marketing studies and RWE becoming critical for formulary positioning.

• **Prediction**: The Breakthrough designation would encourage earlier differentiation demonstration.
  - **Reality**: **Mixed outcome**. While Breakthrough status facilitated accelerated development, it did not consistently drive earlier differentiation studies, reflecting ongoing resource and prioritization challenges.

• **Prediction**: Incremental innovation frequency might decline if smaller steps became economically unviable.
  - **Reality**: **Partially born out**. Incremental innovation in crowded therapeutic areas decreased, particularly in primary care categories like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, where payers implemented aggressive step therapy and generic-first policies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses important structural shifts in healthcare payment and pharmaceutical development, raising themes that proved relevant over the subsequent decade. The piece provides useful historical perspective on evolving payer dynamics and predictive insights about value assessment, though its impact was limited by being part of broader industry awareness of these issues during that period.
