# Comments Welcome - Really (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from January 2006 describes technical difficulties with the commenting system on a Movable Type-based blog platform. The author notes that despite having the system configured to allow open commenting, legitimate comments are being incorrectly flagged for moderation while spam comments (poker invitations and enhancement product offers) are slipping through the filters. The author seeks suggestions from readers on how to fix Movable Type's spam filtering issues. The post also mentions an upcoming server migration by Corante that might cause temporary outages.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published during the mid-2000s blogging era when Movable Type and WordPress were competing blogging platforms. During this period, blog spam became a significant problem as automated systems began targeting comment sections for commercial purposes. Movable Type (created by Six Apart in 2001) was initially a leading platform but began losing market share to WordPress around this time, partly due to licensing changes and technical issues like those described.

The spam problem continued to worsen throughout 2006-2008, leading to the development and refinement of various anti-spam solutions including Akismet (launched in 2005 by Automattic), CAPTCHA systems, and manual moderation tools. Bloggers increasingly migrated toward WordPress, which offered better spam management through plugins and built-in moderation. By the late 2000s/early 2010s, WordPress had become the dominant CMS platform, while Movable Type's user base declined significantly.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

While this article does not contain explicit predictions about the future, it identifies a growing technical problem (comment spam and moderation failures) that was characteristic of the blogging ecosystem at that time.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a routine technical troubleshooting post from a personal blog about Movable Type commenting issues, with minimal broader significance. While it captures a snapshot of mid-2000s blogging challenges, it lacks the scientific or biotechnology content that would be relevant to the analysis framework you outlined.
