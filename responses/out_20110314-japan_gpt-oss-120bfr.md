# Japan (March 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a personal‑tone commentary written shortly after the March 11, 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and the ensuing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. The author notes that Iwaki, a city near the plant, was heavily affected and that many locals—including a former colleague, Masanori Yamaura—were “unknown” (presumably missing or unreachable). He explains that, unlike Chernobyl, the reactors were being flooded with seawater and boric acid to act as neutron poisons, which should prevent a full‑scale melt‑through. Nonetheless, he warns that the reactors will become long‑term cleanup sites, that a large amount of generating capacity will be offline for years, and that the disaster will damage public confidence in nuclear power. An update points readers to a blog (morgsatlarge.wordpress.com) that offers a “clear‑headed” technical explanation of the situation.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Immediate aftermath (2011‑2013)**  
- All 54 of Japan’s commercial nuclear reactors were shut down for safety inspections.  
- TEPCO began the arduous de‑commissioning of Units 1‑4 at Fukushima Daiichi; Unit 1 achieved cold shutdown in December 2013, Unit 2 in March 2014, Unit 3 in December 2015, and Unit 4 (already damaged) was declared cold in 2014. Full de‑commissioning is projected to take 30‑40 years, with the final removal of fuel expected around 2050‑2060.  
- The government established the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in September 2012, introducing stricter seismic, tsunami, and emergency‑response standards.  

**Policy and energy mix (2014‑2022)**  
- By the end of 2015, only 9 reactors had been granted restart licences; as of 2024, 9 have resumed operation, providing roughly 6 % of Japan’s electricity (down from ~30 % pre‑Fukushima).  
- The “Energy White Paper” (2015, 2018, 2021) repeatedly emphasized a transition toward renewables, energy efficiency, and a “nuclear‑plus‑renewable” mix, but concrete nuclear expansion has been limited by public opposition and legal challenges.  
- The 2022 “Strategic Energy Plan” set a target of 22 % nuclear by 2030, but progress remains slow; only a handful of reactors are slated for restart, and new construction (e.g., the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor at Kashiwazaki‑Kariwa) has been delayed indefinitely.  

**Economic and societal impact**  
- The disaster caused an estimated ¥30 trillion (≈ US$270 billion) in direct and indirect costs, including evacuation, decontamination, and compensation.  
- Agricultural and fisheries products from the Tōhoku region faced export bans for several years; most bans were lifted by 2018, but market perception took longer to recover.  
- Public opinion polls show a persistent decline in support for nuclear power: a 2023 survey found only 30 % of Japanese respondents favored restarting reactors, compared with > 60 % in 2010.  

**International ripple effects**  
- Germany accelerated its nuclear phase‑out, shutting down its remaining reactors by 2023.  
- Several countries (e.g., China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates) continued building new plants, but the global “nuclear renaissance” narrative was largely tempered.  
- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) revised its safety guidelines (e.g., INES‑2020) to incorporate lessons from Fukushima, especially regarding beyond‑design‑basis events.  

**Current status (2024‑2026)**  
- Fukushima Daiichi’s contaminated water storage tanks are nearing capacity; the Japanese government approved a controlled release of treated water (tritiated but otherwise filtered) into the Pacific, beginning in 2023, after extensive international review.  
- The NRA continues to require “stress‑test” upgrades for any reactor seeking restart; as of early 2026, 7 reactors have been cleared, with 4 actually operating.  
- Renewable electricity now supplies ~38 % of Japan’s demand (2025 data), while nuclear’s share remains at ~6 %.  

Overall, the author’s concerns about long‑term clean‑up, loss of generating capacity, and erosion of nuclear confidence have been borne out, though the scale of the cleanup has proven even larger than anticipated, and the anticipated “massive offline capacity” has persisted for more than a decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “The reactors will become massive cleanup sites for many years to come.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. De‑commissioning is projected to last 30‑40 years; water storage, fuel removal, and site remediation are still ongoing in 2026.  

- **Prediction:** “It’s going to take a mighty amount of generating capacity offline for good, which is another long‑term problem.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Japan’s nuclear capacity fell from ~30 % to ~6 % of electricity generation, and the shortfall has been partially filled by fossil fuels and renewables, but the gap remains a policy challenge.  

- **Prediction:** “One of the other long‑lasting bad effects of this crisis is the damage it will do to the idea of using nuclear power.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Public support for nuclear has stayed low; many reactors remain shut, and the government’s nuclear‑restart timetable has been repeatedly delayed.  

- **Implicit prediction (by tone):** “The primary containment vessels are still intact, so you know that you have a pretty full schedule.”  
  **Outcome:** Partially accurate. While primary containment survived, the schedule for de‑commissioning and eventual dismantlement has proven far longer and more complex than early estimates.  

No specific biotech‑related predictions were made in the article, so none can be evaluated.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article captures a contemporaneous, human‑focused snapshot of the Fukushima crisis and correctly anticipates many long‑term consequences, making it a useful historical reference, though its scope is narrow and its style informal.
