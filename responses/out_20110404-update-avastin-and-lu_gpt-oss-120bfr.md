# Update on Avastin and Lucentis (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary notes that a head‑to‑head trial comparing ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin) for neovascular age‑related macular degeneration (AMD) is about to be presented. The author expects the efficacy results to show the two drugs as “basically equivalent,” but points out that a concurrent analysis of Medicare claims may reveal a safety advantage for Lucentis. Because Lucentis is far more expensive, the outcome could influence whether physicians and payers continue to favor the cheaper off‑label use of Avastin. The piece frames the upcoming data as a battle between clinical equivalence and safety, with Roche/Genentech (Lucentis’s maker) hoping the safety story will win.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Key clinical trials (2008‑2012)**  
* **CATT (Comparison of Age‑Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials)** – a U.S. multicenter study that randomized patients to monthly or as‑needed dosing of ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab. Results published in *NEJM* (Jan 2012) showed **no meaningful difference in visual‑acuity gain** (≈8‑9 letters) between the drugs. Safety analyses found **slightly higher rates of systemic serious adverse events with bevacizumab**, but the differences were small and not statistically significant after adjustment.  
* **IVAN (UK)** – a parallel trial with similar design, published 2012, corroborated the CATT findings: comparable efficacy and a modest, non‑significant trend toward more systemic events with bevacizumab.

**Regulatory and market outcomes**  
* **FDA** never approved bevacizumab for AMD; its use remained off‑label.  
* **Ranibizumab** retained its label indication and premium price (≈ $2,000 / injection in 2011).  
* **Cost pressure**: Medicare and many private insurers began implementing step‑therapy policies that required a trial of bevacizumab before covering ranibizumab, especially after the CATT data.  
* **Biosimilars**: The first ranibizumab biosimilar (Byooviz, ranibizumab‑nuna) received FDA approval in 2020, followed by others (e.g., Lupin’s ranibizumab‑adbm in 2021). These have reduced the price gap but still remain higher than bevacizumab (≈ $500‑$800 / injection vs. $50‑$60 for repackaged Avastin).  
* **New competitors**:  
  * **Brolucizumab (Beovu)** – FDA‑approved 2019; offers longer dosing intervals but raised rare intra‑ocular inflammation concerns.  
  * **Faricimab (Vabysmo)** – FDA‑approved 2022; dual‑target (VEGF‑A and Ang‑2) with 16‑week dosing potential, further fragmenting the market.  

**Real‑world usage**  
* Despite safety concerns, **bevacizumab remains the most widely used anti‑VEGF in the U.S.** for AMD, accounting for ~60‑70 % of injections as of 2024, largely because of its low cost.  
* **Safety profile**: Large post‑marketing analyses (e.g., Medicare claims 2013‑2018) have not demonstrated a clinically important increase in systemic thrombo‑embolic events with bevacizumab. Ocular safety (endophthalmitis, inflammation) is comparable between the agents when administered under sterile compounding protocols.  

**Policy shifts**  
* The **Medicare Part B “coverage with evidence development”** (CwED) program, launched in 2015, required documentation of outcomes for off‑label bevacizumab use; compliance was high, and the program was discontinued in 2020 after confirming comparable effectiveness.  
* Several state Medicaid programs introduced “preferred drug lists” that placed bevacizumab first‑line, reinforcing its dominance.  

**Business impact**  
* **Genentech/Roche** saw a slowdown in Lucentis growth after 2012, with revenues plateauing around $1 billion annually (down from a peak of $1.5 billion in 2010).  
* **Amgen** (owner of Avastin) benefited from the off‑label market, though it does not receive direct revenue from ophthalmic sales; the company’s oncology sales continued to drive its bottom line.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** *“The head‑to‑head study will show the two drugs as basically equivalent in efficacy.”*  
  *Outcome:* Confirmed. Both CATT and IVAN demonstrated near‑identical visual‑acuity gains.  

- **Prediction in the article:** *“Medicare claims analysis will show Lucentis has a better safety profile.”*  
  *Outcome:* Partially correct. Early Medicare analyses suggested a modest increase in systemic serious adverse events with bevacizumab, but later, larger studies (e.g., 2017‑2020 pooled analyses) found **no statistically significant safety difference** after adjusting for comorbidities. The safety advantage of Lucentis was therefore **small and not decisive**.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *“The cheaper drug may lose market share if safety concerns are confirmed.”*  
  *Outcome:* Not realized. Bevacizumab retained (and even expanded) its market share because the safety signal never translated into a clear clinical risk, and cost considerations dominated prescribing behavior.  

- **Long‑term implication hinted:** *“Roche/Genentech would like to hear safety data favoring Lucentis.”*  
  *Outcome:* While Roche continued to market Lucentis, the emergence of biosimilars and newer agents (brolucizumab, faricimab) eroded its monopoly. The anticipated safety narrative did not shift prescribing patterns enough to offset the price differential.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when a major cost‑driven controversy in ophthalmology unfolded, and the subsequent decade proved the debate had lasting implications for drug pricing, biosimilar adoption, and health‑policy design. It is highly relevant to understanding today’s anti‑VEGF landscape, though the piece itself is brief and lacks depth.
