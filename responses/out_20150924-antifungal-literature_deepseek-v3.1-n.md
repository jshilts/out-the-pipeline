# The Antifungal Literature Has Problems (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a 2015 *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* paper by Syngenta researchers that criticized the quality of antifungal drug discovery literature. The article notes that while publications on antifungal research had doubled since 2000, very few compounds were actually reaching development. The Syngenta team estimated that up to 80% of reported antifungal compounds were false positives—substances that appeared active in assays but would fail in real-world development.

The problem stemmed from compounds with undesirable structural features: rhodanines, Michael acceptors (thiol-reactive electrophiles), quinones, and redox cyclers. These compounds often showed activity through non-specific mechanisms rather than genuine antifungal properties, but academic labs and startups continued publishing them. The commentary notes that established companies like Syngenta quickly discard such compounds because they fail higher-tier validation tests, but academic incentives (funding, tenure, investor persuasion) may reward publication quantity over genuine drug development progress.

## 2. HISTORY

**Pipeline Challenges and Few New Drugs:** In the decade following this article, antifungal drug development continued to face significant hurdles. Despite increased research activity, only a handful of new antifungal drugs received FDA approval between 2015-2024. The most notable approvals included:
- Cresemba (isavuconazole) - approved in 2015
- Rezzayo (rezafungin) - approved in 2023 for invasive candidiasis

**Mechanism Diversity Remains Limited:** Most approved antifungals still work through a narrow range of mechanisms: azoles (inhibiting ergosterol synthesis), echinocandins (inhibiting cell wall synthesis), polyenes (binding ergosterol), and flucytosine (interfering with DNA/RNA synthesis). The prediction that discovering novel mechanisms would remain challenging proved accurate.

**Rising Resistance Concerns:** Antifungal resistance became an increasingly recognized public health threat. The WHO published its first fungal priority pathogens list in 2022, highlighting *Candida auris* as a critical threat. Multi-drug resistant fungal infections became more common in healthcare settings.

**Publication Quality and Validation:** The concerns raised about false positives appear to have influenced subsequent research practices. Journals increasingly required more rigorous validation of antifungal compounds, including selectivity profiling and mechanism-of-action confirmation.

**Industry Consolidation and Reprioritization:** Several major pharmaceutical companies reduced or exited antifungal research, focusing instead on more lucrative therapeutic areas. The high development costs, limited market size, and technical challenges made antifungal drug discovery less attractive.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Challenge and slow progress will continue** - ✓ **ACCURATE**. The pace of new antifungal drug approvals remained slow. Between 2015-2024, very few new antifungal drugs entered the market, confirming the difficulty predicted.

• **Compounds with undesirable features will continue to appear in literature** - ✓ **ACCURATE**. The proliferation of pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) and non-specific hits remained an issue, though awareness increased.

• **Academic incentives will continue to drive publication of questionable compounds** - ✓ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**. While academic labs continued publishing, increased awareness of the false positive problem led some journals to adopt stricter standards for compound validation and mechanism confirmation.

• **Syngenta and similar companies will avoid these problematic structures** - ✓ **ACCURATE**. Established pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies generally maintained their focus on druggable chemical matter, avoiding the problematic structures identified.

• **Very few compounds will reach development** - ✓ **ACCURATE**. The pipeline drought continued, with most academic discoveries failing to translate into clinical candidates.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article identified a real and persistent problem in antifungal drug discovery that continued to impact the field for years afterward. While the specific issue of false positives became more widely recognized, the underlying challenge of discovering genuinely novel antifungal drugs remained largely unchanged, making this a grounded critique that accurately diagnosed systemic issues.
