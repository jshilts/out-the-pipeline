# Med‑Chem Labs: What’s Changed? (Aug 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post is a short, informal “lab‑culture” note from a medicinal chemist who, while traveling, asks peers to reflect on how day‑to‑day work in a med‑chem laboratory has evolved. The author contrasts two eras:  

* **Past practices** – manual flash chromatography, routine TLC, and the frequent handling of four‑liter solvent bottles (hexane, EtOAc, DCM) for column packing, extractions, etc.  
* **Current (as of 2018) observations** – widespread use of automated chromatography systems with disposable pre‑packed columns, walk‑up LC/MS replacing analytical TLC, and the installation of building‑wide solvent‑distribution plumbing that delivers common solvents “on tap.”  

The piece is essentially a call for anecdotes: “What else have you noticed change?”

## 2. HISTORY  

### Automation and High‑Throughput Experimentation  
Since 2018 the trend toward **automated purification** has accelerated. By 2022 most large pharma med‑chem groups reported >70 % of prep‑scale purifications performed on robotic flash or flash‑LC platforms (e.g., Biotage, Agilent Prep‑LC). The cost of disposable pre‑packed columns has dropped, and their environmental impact is now mitigated by recycling programs in many sites.  

Parallel to purification, **high‑throughput experimentation (HTE)** has become routine. Mini‑scale (microliter) reaction plates coupled to automated liquid handlers and rapid LC/MS read‑outs are now standard for SAR (structure‑activity‑relationship) campaigns. This has shortened the design‑make‑test cycle from weeks to days for many series.  

### Solvent Distribution and Green Chemistry  
Solvent‑distribution manifolds, once a novelty in a few academic cores, are now common in most corporate med‑chem labs (2021‑2024 rollout). They reduce glass‑ware handling, improve safety, and enable **real‑time solvent‑usage monitoring** that feeds into sustainability dashboards.  

Concurrently, **green‑solvent initiatives** have pushed many groups to replace dichloromethane and large volumes of hexane with greener alternatives (e.g., 2‑MeTHF, cyclopentyl methyl ether, ethyl acetate). Regulatory pressure (EU REACH updates, US EPA “Safer Solvents” guidance) and internal ESG targets have made solvent‑recycling and waste‑minimization metrics part of the lab KPI set.  

### Digital Lab Infrastructure  
The period 2019‑2024 saw the widespread adoption of **electronic lab notebooks (ELNs)** and **LIMS** that automatically capture chromatography runs, LC/MS data, and solvent‑distribution logs. Remote monitoring of automated instruments (via cloud dashboards) became especially valuable during the COVID‑19 disruptions of 2020‑2021, cementing a shift toward “lights‑out” operation for routine purifications.  

### Flow Chemistry and Continuous Manufacturing  
While the 2018 post focuses on batch‑style prep, the subsequent years have seen **flow chemistry** move from niche to mainstream for certain chemotypes (e.g., photoredox, high‑temperature C–C couplings). By 2025, several pharma companies reported that >15 % of their lead‑optimization syntheses were performed in continuous flow, often integrated directly with inline purification modules.  

### Business Impact  
Companies that invested early in automation (e.g., Evotec, Synthace) have reported faster project turnover and lower labor costs, contributing to modest (5‑10 %) reductions in med‑chem R&D spend per molecule generated. Conversely, smaller biotech labs sometimes retain manual chromatography due to capital constraints, leading to a **bimodal landscape** where large enterprises are highly automated while many startups operate with hybrid manual/automated setups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit / Explicit prediction (from the 2018 post) | What actually happened (2026) |
|---|---|
| **Automation will replace most manual flash chromatography.** | Largely true. >70 % of prep purifications in big pharma are now robot‑handled; manual flash persists mainly for low‑volume, high‑value compounds. |
| **Walk‑up LC/MS will supplant analytical TLC.** | Accurate. TLC is now rarely used for routine analysis; LC/MS is the default for reaction monitoring and purity checks. |
| **Solvent‑distribution plumbing will become common.** | Correct. Most new med‑chem facilities built after 2019 include centralized solvent manifolds; legacy labs are being retrofitted. |
| **Disposable pre‑packed columns will be “staggering.”** | Realized, though cost and waste concerns have prompted recycling programs and a modest resurgence of reusable silica cartridges for very high‑volume work. |
| **No explicit prediction about AI or digital tools.** | Not addressed in the post, but the subsequent decade saw rapid integration of AI‑driven retrosynthesis (e.g., IBM RXN, Synthia) and data‑driven reaction prediction, which now influence route selection alongside automation. |

Overall, the author’s informal expectations about continued automation and infrastructure upgrades have been borne out, though the **scale and speed** of digital integration (AI, cloud‑based monitoring) exceeded what was hinted at in 2018.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The article is a concise, relatable snapshot of a transitional moment in med‑chem practice. It’s useful for historians of laboratory culture and for benchmarking how quickly automation diffused, but it lacks technical depth or novel insight, limiting its broader scientific impact.
