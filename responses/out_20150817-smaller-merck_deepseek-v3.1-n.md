# A Smaller Merck (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Merck's ongoing restructuring following its merger with Schering-Plough, noting that the company had cut over 36,000 jobs since 2010. The author uses this large-scale workforce reduction to challenge the prevailing narrative about a supposed shortage of science, technology, and engineering professionals in the industry. By highlighting that a significant number of these laid-off employees came from scientific and technical backgrounds, the article questions whether the "shortage" rhetoric accurately reflects the actual job market conditions for STEM professionals in the pharmaceutical sector.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in 2015, Merck continued its restructuring efforts while pursuing strategic shifts in its business focus. The company subsequently divested several business segments, including its consumer care division to Bayer in 2014 (completed in 2015), and its women's health products to CooperSurgical in 2015. Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) immunotherapy, which had received its first FDA approval in 2014, went on to become one of the most successful oncology drugs in history, with numerous additional indications approved between 2015-2024. The pharmaceutical industry overall experienced significant consolidation during this period, with major mergers and acquisitions continuing to reshape the landscape. Merck itself made several strategic acquisitions, including Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 2015 and, more recently, the proposed acquisition of Seagen in 2023 (though this was later abandoned due to antitrust concerns). The trend of large-scale job cuts in the pharmaceutical industry continued beyond 2015, with companies like Pfizer, Novartis, and others also implementing significant workforce reductions during various restructuring phases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about specific future events or outcomes. Instead, it presented a critical perspective on the STEM shortage narrative, using Merck's job cuts as evidence to challenge this claim. The implicit argument was that if there truly were a shortage of qualified STEM professionals, such large-scale layoffs of technical staff would be unlikely or counterintuitive. While the article didn't make specific testable predictions, the underlying concern about the stability of STEM careers in pharmaceuticals has proven relevant, as the industry continued to experience cyclical waves of restructuring, mergers, and job reductions alongside ongoing investment in certain high-growth therapeutic areas.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article provides useful perspective on the inconsistency between industry narratives about STEM shortages and the reality of pharmaceutical company restructuring, though it focuses more on general commentary than specific forward-looking analysis.
