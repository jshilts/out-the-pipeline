# A Prospective Alzheimer's Trial Reports (February 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the negative results from the DIAN-TU (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit) clinical trial announced in February 2020. The trial tested two anti-amyloid antibodies—Eli Lilly's solanezumab and Roche/Genentech's gantenerumab—in 194 patients with genetic mutations causing early-onset Alzheimer's disease, using a prevention approach by treating patients very early in disease progression. Neither drug showed any effect on cognitive decline, continuing their unbroken records of clinical failure.

The author expresses deep skepticism about the entire amyloid hypothesis approach to Alzheimer's treatment, noting that after decades of research, no anti-amyloid antibody therapy has ever shown clear benefit across different mechanisms, dosing regimens, patient populations, and trial designs. The article also criticizes Biogen and Eisai's efforts with their antibody (later known as aducanumab), questioning the validity of re-analyzing failed trial data to claim efficacy. The author views the DIAN-TU results as further evidence undermining the amyloid-targeting approach.

## 2. HISTORY

**DIAN-TU Trial and Anti-Amyloid Antibodies:**
- Both solanezumab and gantenerumab continued their pattern of clinical failures after the 2020 results
- Solanezumab: Eli Lilly formally terminated development after additional failed Phase 3 trials
- Gantenerumab: Roche continued development but ultimately failed in Phase 3 GRADUATE trials (2022), showing no cognitive benefit

**Aducanumab (Biogen/Eisai):**
- Received controversial FDA accelerated approval in June 2021 despite unconvincing efficacy data
- Approved based on amyloid plaque reduction as a surrogate endpoint, not clear clinical benefit
- Limited patient uptake post-approval due to clinical uncertainty, high cost, and insurance coverage challenges
- Medicare severely restricted coverage, essentially limiting real-world use

**Lecanemab (Biogen/Eisai):**
- Received FDA approval in January 2023 with stronger evidence of modest clinical benefit
- Demonstrated ~27% slowing of cognitive decline in Phase 3 trial over 18 months
- Represents first clear but modest success for amyloid hypothesis after decades of failures
- Real-world uptake still faces challenges with administration, monitoring, and cost

**Donanemab (Eli Lilly):**
- Showed positive Phase 3 results in 2023 with ~35% slowing of cognitive decline
- Demonstrates that multiple anti-amyloid antibodies can show some efficacy when dosed appropriately
- FDA review ongoing as of early 2024

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author strongly suggested that Biogen/Eisai's aducanumab would fail and should not be approved by FDA
  - **Reality**: FDA approved aducanumab in 2021 despite weak efficacy evidence, proving the author's concerns about regulatory decision-making accurate. However, the drug had minimal real-world impact due to poor clinical acceptance and coverage restrictions.

• **Prediction**: Expressed extreme skepticism that any anti-amyloid antibody approach would work, stating "Nothing has ever worked. Never once"
  - **Reality**: Both lecanemab (2023) and donanemab (2023 results) have since demonstrated modest but statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline, representing the first real clinical successes for the amyloid hypothesis after decades of failures. However, the effects remain modest and far from curative.

• **Prediction**: Implied that the DIAN-TU results would cast further doubt on the entire amyloid hypothesis approach
  - **Reality**: The field has become more nuanced. The DIAN-TU prevention approach failed, but treatment approaches with higher-dose antibodies (lecanemab, donanemab) in symptomatic patients have shown some efficacy, suggesting timing and dosing are critical factors.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates strong scientific skepticism at a critical inflection point when the field was about to experience its first (albeit controversial and modest) successes. It captures the frustration of decades of amyloid hypothesis failures while accurately predicting the regulatory dynamics that would play out with aducanumab. The timing was prescient—written just before the field would see its first real clinical efficacy signals, making it an important historical marker of scientific opinion at the end of the "complete failure" era.
