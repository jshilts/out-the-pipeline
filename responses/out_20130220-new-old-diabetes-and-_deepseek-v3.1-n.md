# A New Old Diabetes and Obesity Drug Candidate (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an intriguing drug candidate for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes: amlexanox, a decades-old oral canker sore medication that was newly discovered to have metabolic benefits. Researchers led by Alan Saltiel at Michigan found that amlexanox acts as a selective inhibitor of two kinases, IKKe and TBK1, which are involved in the inflammatory link between obesity and insulin resistance.

In mouse studies, amlexanox produced reversible weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity without reducing food intake by increasing energy expenditure. The drug also reduced liver fat accumulation and inflammation. The compound had already been used safely in humans for years as a topical treatment, suggesting potential for oral repurposing. However, the mechanism remained partially unclear and relied on mouse models of inflammation, which the author noted had recently been questioned as poor predictors of human responses.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 article, several important developments occurred:

**Clinical Trials**: Based on these promising animal results, the University of Michigan licensed amlexanox to the pharmaceutical company Merck. Merck initiated human clinical trials for obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment. However, results from these trials failed to replicate the dramatic benefits seen in mice, demonstrating marginal or negligible effects in human patients.

**Repurposing Attempts**: Despite the disappointing performance in obesity/diabetes trials, amlexanox continued its established use as an oral treatment for aphthous ulcers (canker sores) and allergic conditions, which remains its primary clinical indication. The compound also saw continued research interest for other applications including asthma.

**Research Developments**: Additional studies on the IKKe and TBK1 pathway continued, with researchers publishing follow-up work in subsequent years to better understand these kinases' roles in metabolism and inflammation. However, no successful drugs targeting this pathway for metabolic disease have reached the market.

**Industry Impact**: The case became another example in the long history of promising obesity treatments that failed in human trials despite strong animal data, highlighting the ongoing challenge of translating mouse model results to human metabolic disease therapeutics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Several predictions or expectations appeared in the article:

- **Approval Path**: The author suggested "I don't see why not" regarding studying amlexanox for obesity and diabetes treatment in patients.
**Outcome**: False. Human trials failed to show efficacy.

- **Mechanism**: The author predicted that since inflammation might be an effect rather than a cause, this approach "might well escape the curse" of failed inflammation-based mouse models.
**Outcome**: False. The approach did not escape the mouse-to-human translation failure.

- **Industry Interest**: The author expected companies would be interested in taking a look at this pathway and potentially developing more potent inhibitors.
**Outcome**: Partially true. Merck did license and trial the drug, but ultimately abandoned development after poor results.

- **Drug Development**: The article suggested that if proof-of-concept could be found with amlexanox, a more potent inhibitor would be worth searching for.
**Outcome**: False. The proof-of-concept in humans never materialized, halting further development.

- **Oral Formulation**: The author speculated that an oral formulation could be worked out given amlexanox's absorption profile.
**Outcome**: True (this was technically feasible, though clinically unsuccessful).

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article is moderately interesting as it captures a representative example of mouse-to-human translational failures in metabolic disease research and demonstrates the cyclical nature of drug repurposing attempts. While not ultimately successful, the case is instructive for understanding the challenges in obesity drug development.
