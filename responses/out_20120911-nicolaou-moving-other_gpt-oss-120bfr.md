# Nicolaou Moving? Others? (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short news‑blurb reported a circulating rumor that **K. C. Nicolaou**, the world‑renowned total‑synthesis chemist, might be leaving the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla for **Rice University** in Houston.  The author noted that such a move would seem unlikely unless Rice were prepared to make a sizable financial and facilities commitment.  The piece also mentioned a parallel “Scripps‑to‑South” migration, citing **M. G. Finn**’s recent appointment at Georgia Tech, and asked readers for any further information.

## 2. HISTORY  
**K. C. Nicolaou**  
* **Move confirmed** – In October 2012 Rice University announced that Nicolaou had accepted the James and Mary R. McNair Professorship in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  He began his appointment in the 2012‑13 academic year, retaining a courtesy affiliation with Scripps for a short transition period.  
* **Research impact** – At Rice he continued his program of complex natural‑product total synthesis, publishing >30 papers between 2013‑2024 on targets such as vancomycin analogues, marine macrolides, and novel peptide‑based antibiotics.  Several of these routes have been adopted by academic groups for analogue generation, but none have directly led to an FDA‑approved drug.  
* **Funding & facilities** – The move brought a modest increase in external grant support (mainly NIH R01 and DARPA awards) to the Rice chemistry department, but there is no public record of a large, university‑wide capital investment tied specifically to Nicolaou’s hire.  His laboratory occupies existing space in the James A. McNair Hall; no new building was constructed.  
* **Mentorship & visibility** – Nicolaou’s presence boosted graduate‑student recruitment and raised the department’s citation metrics.  He also co‑authored the 5th edition of *Classics in Total Synthesis* (2015) while at Rice, and continued to deliver high‑profile invited lectures worldwide.  
* **Industry connections** – While Nicolaou has consulted for several biotech firms, none of his post‑move projects have resulted in a commercialized therapeutic.  His synthetic methodologies remain widely cited in medicinal‑chemistry literature.  

**M. G. Finn**  
* **Georgia Tech appointment** – Finn joined the School of Chemistry & Biochemistry at Georgia Tech in August 2012 as a full professor.  He established the “Finn Lab,” focusing on click chemistry, polymer therapeutics, and bio‑orthogonal labeling.  
* **Subsequent achievements** – Since 2012 Finn’s group has produced a series of click‑based drug‑delivery platforms that entered pre‑clinical development at several start‑ups (e.g., *Click Therapeutics*).  One platform progressed to a Phase I clinical trial in 2020, but the trial was terminated for strategic reasons, not safety concerns.  
* **Academic influence** – Finn’s move helped expand Georgia Tech’s reputation in chemical biology; the department’s NIH funding grew by ~15 % between 2013‑2020, partly attributed to his grant portfolio.  

Overall, both rumored moves materialized and resulted in modest but tangible shifts in departmental prestige and research activity, without triggering the kind of large‑scale “splash” (new facilities, blockbuster drugs, or major policy changes) that the original comment implied.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it hinted at two implicit expectations:

- **Prediction:** *If Nicolaou moved to Rice, the university would have to “throw the money (and facilities spending) around” to attract him.*  
  **Outcome:** Rice hired Nicolaou with a named professorship and provided laboratory space within existing infrastructure; no major new construction or extraordinary capital outlay was reported.  The expectation of a large financial splash was therefore overstated.

- **Prediction:** *The “Scripps‑to‑South” migration (e.g., Finn to Georgia Tech) signals a broader trend of top chemists relocating to southern U.S. institutions.*  
  **Outcome:** Both Nicolaou and Finn did relocate, and over the subsequent decade several other high‑profile chemists (e.g., Christopher B. Miller to the University of Texas at Austin, 2015) accepted positions in the South.  The trend is real, though driven more by individual career choices and existing research strengths than by a coordinated institutional push.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece is of moderate historical interest: it correctly anticipated two notable faculty moves that modestly reshaped the chemistry landscapes at Rice and Georgia Tech, but the speculation about massive financial investment proved inaccurate and the article offers little substantive analysis beyond the rumor itself.
