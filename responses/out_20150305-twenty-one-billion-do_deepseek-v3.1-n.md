# Article Title (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the pharmaceutical industry's exceptionally high valuation of the cancer drug ibrutinib. It reports that AbbVie won a bidding war to acquire Pharmacyclics for $21 billion, paying $261.25 per share for a company that traded at $1 or less per share back in 2009. The author expresses amazement at these figures, speculating that the acquirer must plan aggressive expansion of ibrutinib into multiple clinical indications and combinations to justify the price. The article notes the bidding war dynamics, with J&J initially expected to win, and references David Shayvitz's account of ibrutinib's development history as a remarkable story.
