# Sir James Black Vents, Therapeutically (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2009 article highlights an interview with Sir James Black, the Nobel laureate who discovered propranolol and cimetidine, as he critiques the pharmaceutical industry at age 83. Black strongly criticizes former GlaxoSmithKline CEO Jean-Pierre Garnier's Harvard Business Review article about drug development, agreeing with the industry's problems but rejecting Garnier's proposed solutions. He expresses disdain for "blockbuster" drug mentality and skepticism toward Pfizer's recent $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth, predicting the merger would exhaust both companies' energies for two years. Black also disputes the narrative that modern drug discovery has become inherently more complex than the "low-hanging fruit" era of the past, and questions the value of marketing forecasts and the trend of R&D scientists moving into bureaucratic roles. The author finds Black's perspective refreshing amid ongoing pharmaceutical industry consolidation.

## 2. HISTORY

**Merger Outcomes**: Pfizer's $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth did indeed proceed, and Black's prediction proved largely accurate—the integration was challenging and lengthy. The combined company underwent significant restructuring and faced patent cliffs on major drugs like Lipitor. However, the merger did bring important assets including Wyeth's vaccine capabilities and eventually contributed to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine development infrastructure.

**Industry Consolidation**: The wave of large-scale pharmaceutical mergers continued after 2009, with major deals including Merck's $41 billion acquisition of Schering-Plough (just months later in 2009), Sanofi's expanded consolidation, and numerous other mega-mergers. These deals arguably exacerbated the R&D productivity challenges Black identified, as many resulted in pipeline rationalization, site closures, and reduced research spending relative to combined revenues.

**R&D Productivity Decline**: Industry R&D productivity continued its decline through the 2010s, with fewer new drugs approved per billion dollars spent. However, the industry did see a partial resurgence in the 2020s due to COVID-19 vaccines, gene therapies, and increased investment in biologics. The "blockbuster" model Black criticized persisted throughout the 2010s but began shifting toward more targeted therapies and orphan drugs.

**Black's Legacy**: Sir James Black passed away in 2010 at age 85, but his contributions—receptor-targeted drug design and the discovery of foundational cardiovascular and gastrointestinal drugs—remain central to modern pharmacology. Many later drug classes built upon his discoveries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Pfizer-Wyeth Merger Exhaustion**: Black predicted the $68 billion merger would "completely exhaust each others' energies for two years." **Outcome**: Largely accurate. Integration proved challenging with significant restructuring, job cuts, and pipeline rationalization that did strain both organizations, though some valuable assets like Wyeth's vaccine division ultimately benefited Pfizer.

• **Industry Consolidation Futility**: Implicit prediction that large mergers wouldn't solve underlying productivity problems. **Outcome**: Very accurate. Mega-mergers continued through the 2010s without fundamentally improving R&D productivity, though they did achieve cost synergies and portfolio rationalization at the expense of research innovation.

• **Continued Relevance of "Low-Hanging Fruit"**: Rejected the notion that past discoveries were simple compared to modern complexity. **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While drug discovery has grown more complex with targeted therapies and biologics, some of the most impactful recent advances (statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors) still followed receptor-based approaches similar to Black's foundational work.

• **Marketing Forecasts Uselessness**: Implicit skepticism about forecasting driving R&D decisions. **Outcome**: Mixed. Pharmaceutical companies still heavily rely on market forecasts, which often prove inaccurate, but they also increasingly use real-world evidence and health economics outcomes research.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

While the article contains brief commentary rather than deep analysis, it captures valuable historical perspective from a pivotal figure during a critical moment in pharmaceutical industry evolution, with several accurate predictions about merger consequences.
