I notice that you've provided the PROMPT_TEMPLATE and a link to an article, but the article you've shared is not actually about the biotechnology industry. The linked article from February 2015 is a personal blog post about heavy snowfall in Boston and the resulting disruptions, with pictures of the author's backyard covered in snow.

This appears to be a humorous, weather-related post rather than biotechnology commentary. Could you please provide the correct biotechnology article you'd like me to analyze using the template structure? I want to ensure I'm applying the analysis framework to the appropriate scientific/biotech content you intended.
