# NMR Continues to Bear Down on Structures (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This April 2017 commentary discusses advances in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for determining molecular structures, particularly for complex natural products and synthetic compounds. The article highlights a joint effort from Merck, Harvard, UConn, and Amsterdam researchers proposing a new protocol that uses less-commonly-applied NMR parameters: residual dipolar coupling (RDC) and residual chemical shift anisotropy (RCSA). These measurements are taken under specialized conditions where molecules align in a gel matrix, providing detailed 3D structural information. The technique is demonstrated on aquatolide, a natural product whose structure had been recently revised after considerable effort. The article contrasts this NMR approach with X-ray crystallography, noting that while X-ray is powerful when good crystals can be grown, crystal growth becomes increasingly difficult for complex molecules with limited sample sizes. The new protocol combines experimental RDC/RCSA data with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to narrow down possible structures.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2017 publication, NMR-based structure determination methods continued to evolve and gain broader adoption:

**Methodological Advances**: The RDC/RCSA approach described in the article has seen continued development and application in natural product structure elucidation. Several research groups have adopted and refined these techniques, particularly for complex molecules where traditional NMR experiments provide ambiguous results.

**Integration with Computational Methods**: DFT calculations have become faster and more accessible, making the computational component of this protocol more feasible for routine use. Modern computing resources have reduced calculation times from "several hours per molecule" to more manageable timeframes.

**Natural Products Community Adoption**: The natural products chemistry community has increasingly embraced these advanced NMR techniques. This is particularly valuable given the persistent problem of incorrect structure assignments in the literature, which the article highlighted.

**Industry Application**: Pharmaceutical companies have continued to invest in advanced NMR capabilities for structure confirmation, especially important during drug development when crystalline material may not be available.

**Complementary Technique Evolution**: While this NMR method has found its place, X-ray crystallography has also continued advancing with brighter X-ray sources and improved data processing techniques, maintaining its position as the gold standard when crystals can be obtained.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's predictions have shown mixed outcomes:

**• Prediction: "The method described in this work has considerable potential to be widely applied, which could help to quell the flow of incorrect structures appearing in the literature."**
**Outcome**: This has occurred to a significant degree. The technique has gained traction, particularly in natural products chemistry where structure misassignment has been a persistent problem. However, widespread adoption has been limited by the technical expertise required.

**• Prediction: "Natural products chemists and medicinal chemists will especially welcome the chance to try it out!"**
**Outcome**: Natural products chemists have indeed adopted these methods more than medicinal chemists. The complexity and time requirements have made it less routine for high-throughput medicinal chemistry applications.

**• Implicit prediction that this would become a routine structure-confirming technique**
**Outcome**: The technique has found its niche but has not become universally routine. It remains a specialized tool requiring significant expertise in both NMR and computational chemistry.

**• Prediction that false-positive rates would be substantially lower**
**Outcome**: This has proven true when properly applied, making these methods valuable for resolving ambiguous structures.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **6/10**
This article addresses an important technical advance in structural determination—a fundamental problem in chemistry—but focuses on a methodological improvement rather than breakthrough applications.
