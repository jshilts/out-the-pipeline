# Three Not-So-Reproducible Papers (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2016 article discusses Amgen's initiative to publish specific case studies of irreproducible academic research through a new Faculty of 1000 channel. The piece highlights three examples: (1) GPR21 knockout mice, which were originally reported to show improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance but upon cleaner genetic knockout methods showed no such effects; (2) USP14, a ubiquitin-specific protease proposed as a neurodegenerative disease target that Amgen could not confirm played a role in protein degradation as claimed; and (3) bexarotene (an LXR/RXR agonist) for Alzheimer's disease, which had already faced multiple reproducibility challenges from other labs. The author welcomes the transparency initiative but notes these particular examples had already been "dented pretty badly" by prior criticism, expressing hope that future reports would reveal problems that weren't already known to the scientific community.

## 2. HISTORY

The reproducibility crisis in biomedical research that this article highlights became much more documented and systematically addressed in subsequent years. 

The reproducibility issues with **bexarotene** continued: multiple independent labs consistently failed to reproduce the original 2012 beta-amyloid reduction findings in Alzheimer's mouse models. No FDA approval was ever granted for bexarotene in Alzheimer's disease, and clinical trials did not demonstrate efficacy. As of 2024, bexarotene remains FDA-approved only for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, not for any neurodegenerative indication.

For **USP14**, the field moved away from it as a primary target for neurodegenerative disease. The theoretical mechanism (speeding up harmful protein degradation) did not translate into robust, reproducible effects, and USP14 inhibition has not emerged as a viable therapeutic strategy.

The **GPR21** knockout mouse story became part of broader awareness about confounding factors in genetic knockouts, leading to increased standards in genetic manipulation techniques and more rigorous validation requirements.

The larger impact was institutional and systemic: between 2016-2024, major initiatives emerged addressing reproducibility including the NIH's enhanced rigor guidelines, journal requirements for detailed methods reporting, and pharmaceutical companies' increased due diligence on target validation. The "publish or perish" culture that drove some irreproducible findings faced growing criticism, though fundamental incentives remain largely unchanged. Amgen's willingness to publish failed replications, while not dramatically changing drug development timelines, contributed to scientific culture recognizing negative results have value.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Author's wish for "things that we didn't know were problematic" to appear on the F1000 reproducibility channel**: This prediction had **partial success**. The F1000 reproducibility channel did publish additional examples, but it never became a primary venue for exposing major unknown reproducibility problems. Instead, the larger reproducibility movement diversified across institutional initiatives, journal policies, and grassroots efforts rather than centralizing around F1000's specific platform.

• **Implicit prediction that drug industry would benefit more from transparency**: This has been **correct but modest**. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly collaborate on pre-competitive reproducibility studies and contribute to public databases, but commercial competitive pressures still limit full transparency about failed target validations. The benefit has been more cultural (normalizing negative results) than directly accelerating drug approvals.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While this article touches on the important reproducibility crisis, its immediate examples were already known to be problematic, and its specific F1000 channel prediction had only moderate impact. The broader reproducibility movement proved more significant than this particular initiative.

## 5. REFLECTION

The article serves as a useful historical marker for when pharmaceutical companies began publicly acknowledging irreproducible academic research, transitioning from vague complaints to specific case studies. The author's skepticism about already-known examples proved prescient—the biggest reproducibility problems affecting drug development were indeed subtle, systemic issues rather than high-profile single papers.

Interestingly, the reproducibility problem's persistence reflects deeper structural issues in academic science: funding mechanisms, publication bias, and career incentives remain largely unchanged since 2016, even as awareness has grown. The article's moderate skepticism ("will those start to appear?") was appropriate for what became a gradual, ongoing cultural shift rather than an immediate revolution in scientific practice.
