# A Table of Smells, Stinks, And Aromas (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article highlights a colorful chart from Monash University titled "Table of Organic Compounds and Their Smells," which categorizes various organic chemicals by their characteristic odors. The blogger comments on the chart's assessments, generally finding them accurate while noting some descriptions like "Unique and Unpleasant," "Old People," "Seaweed," and "Dead Animals" as particularly memorable. The content appears to be a lighthearted commentary on chemistry education materials rather than a serious scientific analysis, focusing on the sensory experience of chemical compounds rather than their industrial or medical applications. The tone is informal and observational.

## 2. HISTORY
The chart referenced in this 2013 blog post from Monash University represents a type of educational resource commonly used in chemistry teaching to illustrate the practical sensory aspects of organic compounds. Such smell charts serve pedagogical purposes in helping students associate chemical structures with real-world sensory experiences.

Following the article's publication, there have been no documented clinical trials, drug approvals, FDA regulatory changes, or pharmaceutical developments resulting from this specific smell chart. The chart itself appears to be an educational tool rather than a research breakthrough. No evidence suggests that any of the smell classifications led to new therapeutic discoveries, diagnostic methods, or medical treatments. The organic compounds listed (such as those smelling of "seaweed" or "dead animals") are well-known chemicals already characterized in the scientific literature since long before 2013. The "Dead Animals" smell category, presumably referring to compounds like cadaverine and putrescine, involves chemicals that have been studied for decades in contexts ranging from food science to disease detection, but no major biotechnology developments are tied specifically to the 2013 publication of this educational chart.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contains no explicit predictions about future scientific developments, technological breakthroughs, or industry trends. It is purely an observational commentary on an existing educational resource. The blogger's remarks are limited to personal assessments of the smell descriptions ("I think it's broadly correct," "I do like the boxes marked...") rather than forecasts of future research directions, commercial applications, or policy changes.

## 4. INTEREST
**2/10**

This ranks in the bottom 20-30% percentile of interest as it's a brief commentary on an educational chemistry chart with no significant scientific, medical, or policy implications, serving primarily as light science communication content.
