# The Good Sides and Bad Sides of Polar Compounds (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the challenges and opportunities of incorporating more polar compounds into pharmaceutical screening collections. The author notes that most drug company screening libraries tend to be predominantly hydrophobic ("greasy"), which reflects both historical medicinal chemistry optimization programs and practical laboratory workflow considerations—polar, water-soluble compounds are harder to purify and concentrate. The article argues that while adding polar chemical matter could enable addressing a wider variety of binding sites, particularly valuable for drug classes like antibiotics, these compounds face thermodynamic disadvantages: they are happier in aqueous solution, must shed solvating water molecules to bind, and require more geometrically demanding polar interactions compared to the "blobbier" hydrophobic binding. The author hypothesizes that polar compound libraries would likely show lower hit rates than hydrophobic ones and would need to be 2-4 times larger to achieve comparable screening impact. Importantly, hits from more polar regions of chemical space should be prioritized because they are less likely to be false positives.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2017, the understanding of polar compounds in drug discovery evolved significantly, though many of the article's core insights remained prescient:

- **Fragments and 3D chemical matter**: The trend toward more polar, three-dimensional fragment libraries and "beyond Rule of Five" (bRo5) chemical space accelerated. Between 2017-2024, pharmaceutical companies increasingly expanded collections toward natural product-like compounds with higher polarity, driven by the recognition that traditional Lipinski-compliant screening decks were insufficient for challenging targets, particularly protein-protein interactions and difficult binding sites.

- **Practical implementation challenges**: The practical difficulties Lowe mentioned—handling, purifying, and concentrating polar compounds—remained significant obstacles. However, companies invested in specialized infrastructure and workflows. Fragment-based drug discovery platforms incorporating polar fragments became more common, often using biophysical methods (SPR, NMR, X-ray crystallography) rather than traditional biochemical assays.

- **Clinical outcomes**: Notably, several more polar drugs successfully reached the market post-2017, particularly in the oncology and anti-infective space. Small-molecule protein-protein interaction inhibitors, which often reside in bRo5 space, increasingly entered clinical development. Success stories included drugs for previously "undruggable" targets like KRAS (sotorasib, approved 2021) and other difficult oncogenic proteins.

- **Dark chemical matter insights**: The polar "dark matter" phenomenon Lowe described—compounds that rarely hit, but whose hits are valuable—was further validated and explored by screening organizations. The biophysics of polar compound binding became better understood, though the fundamental thermodynamic challenges remained.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Writing a commentary rather than making explicit predictions, but implicit in the reasoning are several hypotheses and suggestions about the choice of language:

- **More polar compound libraries will need to be larger**: Lowe suggested that polar libraries would need to be two to four times larger to compensate for their lower hit rates. This insight proved accurate and was reflected in the increasingly large, highly curated fragment libraries that pharmaceutical companies and vendors maintained by the early 2020s, with top academic and industry fragment collections often reaching 10,000–30,000 compounds.

- **Polar compound hits should be prioritized**: Lowe argued that hits from unusually polar compounds should be prioritized because they are more likely to be real binders rather than false positives. This advice aligned with industry practice in high-quality fragment-to-lead work.

- **Unnatural natural product analogs would need large collections**: Lowe saw efforts to mimic natural product-like complexity and polarity as worthwhile but suggested that success would require very large, well-curated collections. Indeed, this proved true as platforms dedicated to complex natural product-like (macrocyclic, polycyclic, highly polar) chemical matter proliferated.

- **The core trade-offs remain thermodynamic**: The author stressed that the solvation penalty for polar compounds represents a real and fundamental biophysical challenge. Subsequent work reaffirmed this: adding polar functionality to achieve selectivity or property optimization incurs an unavoidable desolvation penalty that must be compensated by strong, well-oriented interactions.

- **The practical handling difficulties are real**: Various groups addressed this by developing techniques such as freeze-drying, solid-phase synthesis, automated handling and specialized plate formats to facilitate high-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry of polar compounds.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article ranks in the 70th percentile because it provides the kind of practical drug-discovery insight that is both accurate and enduring—the kinds of lessons that are fundamental to designing high-quality screening libraries and making good investment decisions. It remains highly cited and frequently referenced in discussions of chemical library design and fragment-based drug discovery.
