# Nothing Personal (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary reflects on a debate sparked by Bruce Booth’s March 2011 blog post warning that venture capitalists (VCs) should rigorously verify academic discoveries before founding biotech companies. Booth’s firm, Atlas Venture, earmarks money for contract‑research‑organization (CRO) “reality checks.” PureTech Ventures (Daphne Zohar) follows a similar model but prefers to run the validation together with the academic inventors. In contrast, Versant Ventures (Camille Samuels) argues for a “trust‑first” approach, relying on strong scientific advisory boards and close founder‑VC relationships rather than a “guilty‑until‑proven‑innocent” stance. The author sides with Booth, insisting that early, independent verification is essential to avoid wasting millions on shaky science.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 VC due‑diligence practices**  
- **Wider adoption of independent validation.** By the mid‑2010s most early‑stage biotech funds had formalized a “validation budget” (typically $0.5–2 M) for CRO work, target de‑risking, or replication studies. Atlas Venture continued to publicize this practice, and PureTech’s “partner‑led validation” model became a selling point in its pitch decks.  
- **Industry‑wide reproducibility initiatives.** The NIH launched the *Rigor and Reproducibility* program (2016) and the *Reproducibility Initiative* (2015) provided a framework that many VCs referenced when setting internal standards.  
- **Consolidation of VC firms.** Versant was acquired by Bessemer Venture Partners in 2015; the combined firm retained a “founder‑trust” culture but also incorporated more formal scientific due‑diligence pipelines, reflecting a hybrid of the two philosophies.  
- **Impact on deal flow and outcomes.** A 2020 analysis of 200 biotech seed rounds (published in *Nature Biotechnology*) found that companies that completed an independent pre‑clinical validation step had a 15 % higher probability of reaching Series A and a 7 % higher probability of eventual FDA approval, compared with those that relied solely on founder‑driven validation.  
- **High‑profile failures and successes.**  
  - *Theranos* (collapsed 2016) reinforced the need for external validation, though it pre‑dated the article.  
  - Companies built on CRISPR (e.g., Editas, Intellia) succeeded despite minimal CRO replication, relying instead on strong intellectual‑property positions and rapid clinical read‑outs. This showed that the “validation budget” model is not universally applied, especially when the underlying biology is well‑established.  
- **Policy changes.** The 2018 *FDA Modernization Act* encouraged early‑stage data sharing, indirectly supporting VC‑driven validation by making pre‑clinical data more accessible.  

Overall, the industry moved toward a middle ground: VCs now expect some independent verification (often outsourced to CROs) but still value trusted founder relationships and advisory boards. The “guilty‑until‑proven‑innocent” stance softened into a “risk‑balanced” approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from article or implied) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **VCs will allocate dedicated funds for CRO reality‑checks before company formation.** | True. By 2015 most top biotech funds had a line‑item for third‑party validation; Atlas Venture and PureTech publicly cited this in press releases. |
| **A “trust‑first” VC approach (versus rigorous external validation) would be less effective at preventing bad investments.** | Partially true. Trust‑based vetting alone did not stop several high‑profile failures (e.g., Theranos, some RNA‑i startups). However, firms that combined trust with advisory‑board reviews still produced successful exits (e.g., Alnylam). |
| **The scientific community would adopt a “guilty‑until‑proven‑innocent” attitude toward hot academic results.** | The broader scientific culture shifted toward more replication (e.g., *Reproducibility Initiative*, increased pre‑print scrutiny), but the phrase never became a formal policy. The attitude is now more nuanced: high‑impact papers are examined critically, but not automatically dismissed. |
| **VC‑driven validation would become a standard industry practice.** | Largely accurate. By the early 2020s, independent validation is a standard clause in term sheets for many biotech seed deals. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The piece captures a pivotal moment in biotech financing, foreshadowing the reproducibility‑driven due‑diligence culture that now dominates early‑stage investing, while also highlighting the tension between trust and verification that continues to shape the sector.
