# A Postdoc's Lament (March 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 Nature News column by Jennifer Rohn argued that the post‑doctoral position has become a “cheap, disposable” labor pool that fuels academic research without offering a realistic career trajectory. Rohn proposed two structural changes: (1) dramatically cut the number of graduate students entering the pipeline, and (2) create permanent, non‑faculty research positions (often called “staff scientists”) that would give experienced researchers a stable career inside universities. Derek Lowe’s commentary on the piece is skeptical, noting that such reforms would run counter to the financial incentives of labs that rely on low‑cost trainees to generate grant‑driven data. He also points out that the academic ecosystem already contains “perpetual postdocs” who linger indefinitely, and that the broader job market outside academia has been shrinking, making the problem harder to solve.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Growth of the post‑doc workforce  
- **Numbers** – The U.S. post‑doctoral population continued to rise after 2011. The NIH Office of Extramural Research reported ~ 70 000 postdocs in 2015 and ~ 84 000 in 2022, a ~20 % increase despite modest growth in the overall PhD pool.  
- **Demographics** – The proportion of postdocs on short‑term (≤ 2 yr) contracts fell slightly, while the share on longer (≥ 3 yr) appointments grew, reflecting the “perpetual postdoc” phenomenon noted by Lowe.

### Institutional responses  
- **Staff‑scientist tracks** – Starting around 2014, a growing number of research universities (e.g., Harvard, Stanford, UCSF) launched formal “research scientist” or “staff scientist” positions with tenure‑track‑like benefits. By 2022, the NIH reported that > 30 % of its intramural labs employed staff scientists, and many external institutions followed suit. However, these roles remain a minority (estimates of < 10 % of total research staff) and are often funded by a mix of grant and institutional dollars.  
- **Funding agency policies** – The NIH introduced the **Postdoctoral Salary Scale** (2020) and the **Career Development Plan** requirement (2022), obligating institutions to provide documented career‑development activities for each postdoc. The **Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST)** program, funded by the NIH from 2014‑2020, encouraged universities to create career‑exploration workshops and industry‑placement pipelines.  
- **National‑level reports** – The 2020 **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine** report “The Postdoctoral Experience” highlighted the mismatch between training and available faculty jobs, recommending expanded staff‑scientist pathways and better data collection. The 2023 **AAAS** “Science & Technology Workforce” survey echoed these concerns and called for “stable research‑staff positions” as a key reform.

### Graduate‑program size  
- Contrary to Rohn’s suggestion to “reduce the numbers of people being trained as graduate students,” PhD enrollment in the life sciences continued to climb modestly through the 2010s and plateaued only recently. The **National Science Foundation** reported ~ 55 000 life‑science PhDs awarded annually in 2021, only a few percent lower than the 2018 peak. No major policy has succeeded in shrinking graduate‑school intake at scale.

### Career outcomes  
- **Academic faculty** – The fraction of postdocs securing tenure‑track faculty positions in the U.S. remained low (≈ 15 % in 2020, down from ≈ 20 % in the early 2000s).  
- **Industry and alternative sectors** – Employment in biotech, pharma, data science, and science policy grew steadily. The **2022 Postdoctoral Workforce Survey** showed that ~ 35 % of respondents had accepted non‑academic positions within two years of leaving the postdoc role, up from ~ 25 % in 2015.  
- **Policy impact** – While career‑development programs have improved awareness of non‑academic pathways, they have not eliminated the “tournament” perception of academia. The “permanent postdoc” model remains limited to a handful of well‑funded labs or institutes.

### Overall assessment of Rohn’s proposal  
- **Partial adoption** – The creation of staff‑scientist positions aligns with Rohn’s vision of “permanent non‑lab‑head research roles,” but adoption is uneven and often contingent on external grant support.  
- **No systemic reduction in graduate numbers** – Graduate enrollment has not been curtailed; the pipeline remains broadly unchanged.  
- **Cultural inertia** – The academic incentive structure (grant‑driven publications, overhead recovery) continues to favor a flow of short‑term trainees, as Lowe predicted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article or Rohn’s proposal) | What actually happened (2021‑2026) |
|---|---|
| **Reduce the number of graduate students** | Not realized. U.S. life‑science PhD enrollment stayed roughly flat or slightly higher; no coordinated policy reduced intake. |
| **Create permanent, non‑faculty research positions (staff scientists) to professionalize the postdoc role** | Partially realized. Many institutions now offer staff‑scientist or research‑scientist tracks, but they constitute a small fraction of the research workforce and are often funded by a mix of institutional and grant money. |
| **Academic departments will willingly adopt the new model because it benefits them** | Mixed. Some elite research institutions embraced staff‑scientist roles to retain expertise, but most departments continue to rely on traditional postdoc contracts due to lower cost and flexibility. |
| **The “tournament” model will be replaced by a more stable career ladder** | Not achieved. The tournament model persists; competition for faculty slots remains intense, and most postdocs still view the position as a stepping stone rather than a career endpoint. |
| **Perpetual postdocs will become a recognized, stable career class** | Limited progress. While the term “staff scientist” is now common, many long‑term postdocs remain on renewable contracts without the benefits of true tenure‑track security. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece remains highly relevant because the postdoctoral career dilemma continues to shape research culture, funding policy, and workforce planning, even though most of its bold reforms have only been partially implemented.
