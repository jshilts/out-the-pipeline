# Chemistry Nobel Watch 2015 (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a 2015 blog post handicapping potential winners for the upcoming Nobel Prize in Chemistry, written a few days before the announcement. The author categorizes candidates into three groups: recent discoveries (CRISPR gene editing and cancer immunotherapy), slightly older but growing fields (bio-orthogonal chemistry), and long-standing candidates who hadn't yet won (lithium-ion batteries, various lifetime achievement figures). For CRISPR, the author noted controversy over who should be credited and whether the field was still evolving too rapidly. Cancer immunotherapy was seen as likely worthy but more suited for Medicine than Chemistry. The piece highlighted lithium-ion batteries as highly impactful but questioned whether the chemistry committee awards "device prizes." Other perennial candidates mentioned include John Goodenough, Harry Gray, Bruce Ames, Richard Zare, and several chemical biologists. The author concludes that outside major breakthroughs, prediction remains difficult and noted the committee's preference for bounded, recent discoveries.

## 2. HISTORY

**CRISPR/Cas9**: The 2015 Chemistry Prize did not go to CRISPR. Instead, the prize was ultimately awarded for CRISPR in **2020** (Chemistry) to **Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna** — the same two scientists Thomson Reuters had predicted in 2015. Feng Zhang, whom the author noted was controversially omitted from that prediction list, was not among the laureates, though he has been centrally involved in patent disputes and commercial development. Since 2015, CRISPR has evolved from a rapidly advancing research tool into clinical reality: the first CRISPR-based therapy, **Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel)**, received **FDA approval in December 2023** for treating sickle cell disease, with additional approvals in the UK and other markets. Multiple CRISPR therapies are now in clinical trials for various diseases, and the technology is widely adopted across basic research.

**Cancer Immunotherapy**: The 2015 Chemistry Prize did not honor this field, but the **2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine** was awarded to **James Allison and Tasuku Honjo** for their discovery of cancer therapy through inhibition of negative immune regulation (checkpoint inhibitors). This led to approved drugs that are now standard of care: **pembrolizumab (Keytruda)**, **nivolumab (Opdivo)**, and others have achieved blockbuster status with widespread patient uptake across multiple cancer types.

**Lithium-Ion Batteries**: The 2015 Chemistry Prize did not go to battery research. However, the **2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry** was awarded to **John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino** for the development of lithium-ion batteries, recognizing the same work the 2015 author highlighted. Lithium-ion technology has become absolutely ubiquitous in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage, with massive market growth and continuous improvements in energy density and cost.

**Bio-Orthogonal Chemistry**: Carolyn Bertozzi did not win in 2015, but she was awarded the **2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry** (shared with Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless) for the development of click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. This represented Sharpless's second Chemistry Nobel, which the 2015 author suggested as a possibility. These methods are now widely used in drug development, biomedical research, and materials science.

The 2015 Chemistry Prize ultimately went to **Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich, and Aziz Sancar** for mechanistic studies of DNA repair, a choice not prominently featured in the author's speculation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **CRISPR could win but might face delays due to controversy and rapid evolution**: CORRECT on delay; the prize came five years later in 2020. The controversy over awardees persisted, with Feng Zhang notably not included.

• **Cancer immunotherapy more suited for Medicine Prize than Chemistry**: CORRECT; it won the 2018 Medicine Prize, not Chemistry.

• **Bio-orthogonal chemistry should win eventually, possibly including Sharpless for a second Nobel**: CORRECT; this happened in 2022 with Sharpless as co-laureate.

• **Lithium-ion batteries might win despite being a "device prize"**: CORRECT; they won in 2019, four years after this article.

• **CRISPR award might wait until things settle out more**: PARTIALLY CORRECT; the prize was delayed, but the field continued rapid evolution, with clinical applications and alternative CRISPR systems still emerging post-2020.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8**

This article demonstrated remarkably prescient judgment across multiple fields, correctly predicting eventual Nobel recognition for all major candidates discussed while accurately assessing the timing and prize categories. Its analysis of the committee's behavior and the likely trajectory of emerging fields has proven highly insightful with the benefit of hindsight.
