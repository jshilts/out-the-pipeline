# Solvents and More Solvents (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a practitioner's reflection on the solvents commonly used in synthetic organic chemistry. The author categorizes solvents by their properties and uses: everyday polar and nonpolar workhorses (dichloromethane, THF, DMF, DMSO), structural "cousins" with slightly different boiling points or polarities, specialty solvents for high-temperature reactions (decalin, sulfolane), hazardous solvents now largely avoided (HMPA due to toxicity), and oddball reagents used out of desperation (ethanethiol, trimethyl phosphite). There are no specific forecasts, policy recommendations, or company analyses—just a chemist's informal catalog of tools-of-the-trade and practical preferences.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to 2015 there was no direct regulatory or industry upheaval concerning these solvents, but continuing trends include:
- **Green chemistry/solvent substitution**: Growing use of bio-based solvents (e.g., ethyl lactate, 2-MeTHF from renewables), solvent-reduction strategies (neat reactions), and persistent scrutiny of Class 1/2 residual solvents in pharmaceuticals.
- **Safety and regulation**: Many listed solvents remain on hazardous-use minimization lists (e.g., benzene, carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane). DCM is increasingly restricted in consumer and certain lab applications.
- **Process chemistry and manufacturing**: The push toward more benign, scalable solvents (e.g., favoring isopropanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate over chlorinated solvents) continued, driven by both regulation and cost.
- **Research tools**: High-throughput and computational solvent screening (e.g., using COSMO-RS or machine learning) became more common, though most academic labs still carried out manual screens like the one the author described.

There were no major therapeutic or biotech milestones traceable to this article; it did not name companies, specific drugs, or policy proposals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forecasts about future solvents, technologies, or markets. It was a descriptive commentary on practices at the time.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a useful lab-bench note and a somewhat nostalgic catalog of solvents, but it does not address biotechnology industry topics, clinical outcomes, policy changes, or business developments. The rating reflects its narrow scope relative to biotech-focused commentary and its lack of actionable or forward-looking analysis.
