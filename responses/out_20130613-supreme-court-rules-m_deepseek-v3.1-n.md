# The Supreme Court Rules on Myriad (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the US Supreme Court's unanimous 2013 decision in the Myriad Genetics case regarding the patentability of human genes. The key ruling was that naturally occurring DNA segments cannot be patented simply because they have been isolated from surrounding genetic material. However, the Court found that cDNA (complementary DNA), which is created in the laboratory by removing introns and represents a non-naturally occurring molecule, remains patent-eligible. The decision specifically addressed Myriad's patents on the isolated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with elevated breast and ovarian cancer risk. The author notes the ruling took a narrower approach than the earlier appeals court decision, which had found isolated DNA stretches patent-eligible on the grounds that they don't exist in nature in their unwound, cleaved form. The article emphasizes that the decision allows patents on new applications of genetic knowledge and methods of manipulating genes, just not on the raw, isolated gene sequences themselves.

## 2. HISTORY
The Supreme Court's decision had immediate and significant impacts. Following the ruling, Myriad's exclusive control over BRCA testing ended, and competitors including Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, and Ambry Genetics quickly began offering their own BRCA gene tests at substantially lower prices—as much as 75-80% less than Myriad's previous $3,000-$4,000 tests. Myriad responded by filing patent infringement lawsuits against these competitors, arguing they still held valid method patents and other intellectual property. However, these legal efforts were largely unsuccessful in maintaining their market monopoly.

The decision catalyzed broader genetic testing availability. More laboratories began offering hereditary cancer panels testing multiple genes simultaneously rather than just BRCA1/2, providing patients with more comprehensive information about cancer risk. The ruling also opened pathways for research, as scientists no longer needed to negotiate licensing agreements for studying inherited disease genes. Importantly, the legal precedent was cited in subsequent cases involving natural products, helping to further clarify the boundaries of patent eligibility in biotechnology.

Myriad's business model was significantly disrupted, forcing the company to adapt by diversifying its genetic testing offerings beyond BRCA, investing in companion diagnostics for cancer therapies, and expanding internationally. Despite losing its exclusive hold on BRCA testing, Myriad continued as a major player in genetic testing, though with substantial competition in the hereditary cancer space.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about the ruling's impact:

• **"I don't actually expect this ruling to have much effect"** - This prediction proved significantly inaccurate. The decision had substantial practical effects, leading to rapid market competition, dramatically lower prices, and expanded patient access to BRCA testing.

• **Prediction that cDNA would continue to be patent-eligible** - This proved accurate. cDNA and synthetic genetic constructs remained patent-eligible, supporting continued biotech innovation while preventing the patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences.

• **Implicit prediction that methods and applications would remain patent-eligible** - This proved accurate. Companies could still patent methods of genetic manipulation and novel therapeutic applications, preserving incentives for research and development.

• **Prediction that headlines would be misleading by suggesting "No patents for DNA!"** - This proved accurate. The nuanced distinction between natural DNA sequences and modified/manufactured genetic material was often oversimplified in media coverage.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article addresses a landmark legal decision that fundamentally shaped the biotechnology patent landscape and directly impacted patient access to genetic testing, making it highly significant for both scientific innovation and healthcare delivery.
