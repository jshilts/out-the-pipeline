# Employment Among New Chemistry PhDs (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary responds to a Slate article by Jordan Weissmann analyzing employment data for new STEM PhDs. The piece challenges the widespread corporate narrative of a "terrible STEM shortage," presenting federal survey data (NIH/NSF) showing stagnant or declining employment rates for new doctorates across major disciplines over the previous 20 years.

The article highlights several concerning trends: persistently high postdoc populations across all fields, failure of employment rates to return to late-1990s levels, and a notable pattern in chemistry where unemployed new doctorate holders have outnumbered those with non-postdoc positions for several consecutive years. While computer science and engineering showed slight recent improvements (2011-2012), these remained below 2000-era highs, questioning whether this represented a temporary blip or sustained recovery.

## 2. HISTORY
In the decade following this 2014 article, several developments relevant to chemistry PhD employment patterns emerged:

**Academic Market Evolution**: The post-2014 period saw continued growth in postdoctoral positions, with many chemistry PhDs facing extended postdoc periods or multiple successive postdocs before securing tenure-track positions. The academic job market remained highly competitive.

**Industrial Sector Shifts**: The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries underwent significant restructuring during this period. Major companies continued rounds of mergers, acquisitions, and layoffs (Pfizer-Wyeth, Bristol-Myers Squibb-Celgene, etc.), impacting chemistry hiring. However, the growth of smaller biotech companies and the emergence of new therapeutic modalities (gene therapy, cell therapy, mRNA technologies) created new employment opportunities, albeit often requiring different skill sets than traditional synthetic chemistry.

**Alternative Career Paths**: Increased recognition and acceptance of non-traditional career paths for chemistry PhDs became more established - including science policy, patent law, consulting, science writing, and various roles in startups. Many universities expanded career services and professional development programs addressing these alternatives.

**Geographic Patterns**: Regional biotechnology hubs (Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Research Triangle) continued to concentrate employment opportunities, while other regions saw more limited growth.

**Pandemic Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated some trends (remote work possibilities, supply chain localization needs) while temporarily disrupting others (laboratory-based research).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions made (or implied):**
• **Continued stagnation or worsening employment**: The article strongly implied that employment challenges for new chemistry PhDs would persist
• **Postdoc populations remaining high**: This was expected to continue as a feature of the academic pipeline
• **Disconnect between corporate "shortage" claims and employment reality**: This gap was predicted to remain
• **Uncertainty about computer science recovery**: The "picked up a bit" trend for CS PhDs was noted as possibly being just a temporary blip

**How predictions compared to reality:**
• The employment challenges largely continued as predicted, though the specific manifestation evolved with biotech sector growth and changing skill requirements
• Postdoc positions did remain prevalent, and concerns about postdoc training duration and career outcomes led to increased policy attention and some institutional reforms
• The gap between shortage claims and actual opportunities persisted, becoming more nuanced as certain specialized subfields faced genuine shortages while others remained oversupplied
• CS employment did see substantial improvement post-2014, particularly as data science and AI applications expanded significantly

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article captured an important structural issue in scientific training and employment that remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade. While focused specifically on chemistry PhDs, it highlighted broader questions about STEM workforce dynamics and the disconnect between policy narratives and labor market realities that continued to be significant.
