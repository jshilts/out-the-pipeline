# Politics in the Lab (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses a Slate article discussing the political affiliations of scientists in the United States, based on a 2009 Pew Foundation survey of over 2,000 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The survey revealed stark political differences: scientists identified as Democrat/Republican/Independent at rates of 55%/6%/32%, compared to the general public's 35%/23%/34%, and as liberal/moderate/conservative at 52%/35%/9%, versus the public's 20%/38%/37%. The Slate piece argued this Democratic/liberal skew was problematic because it contributed to Republicans viewing mainstream science as ideologically corrupted, particularly regarding climate change, while Democrats positioned themselves as defenders of science during the Bush administration. The author acknowledges the political divide but questions whether it significantly affects actual laboratory work on topics like dark matter, RNA, or chemical synthesis that don't easily fit into left/right frameworks, expressing concern about making everything subordinate to political considerations.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article, the political polarization around science intensified significantly:

**Political Environment Evolution:** The divide described in 2010 deepened markedly. The Trump administration (2017-2021) saw unprecedented conflicts between scientific institutions and political leadership, highlighted by the 2017 March for Science—the first mass mobilization of scientists in response to political pressures. Climate change remained a central flashpoint, with the 2015 Paris Agreement withdrawal announcement in 2017 exemplifying the Science-vs-politics narrative. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) became a defining moment of science-politics conflict, with public health measures, vaccine development timeline claims, and epidemiological guidance becoming intensely politicized.

**Research Documentation of Divide:** Numerous studies confirmed and quantified the polarization trend described in the original Pew survey. Research by Gordon Gauchat (2012, 2018) documented a long-term decline in trust in science among self-identified conservatives since the 1970s. The General Social Survey continued showing growing gaps between Democrats and Republicans in confidence in scientific institutions. A 2015 Pew Research follow-up found 54% of Democrats versus 37% of Republicans believed science had a mostly positive effect on society.

**Practical Impacts:** The polarization directly affected policy and funding. The 2020 elections saw science policy become more explicitly partisan in campaign platforms. COVID-19 response strategies varied dramatically along party lines across different jurisdictions, with mask mandates, lockdown policies, and vaccine requirements becoming political litmus tests. Funding debates over NIH, NSF, and environmental agencies became increasingly contentious.

**Continuing Pattern:** By 2024, rather than diminishing as the 2010 article might have hoped, the tendency to view science through political lenses had become more entrenched in both public discourse and some institutional responses, though many scientists continued to work on research questions not directly tied to political debates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction that political polarization around science might be containable or primarily reflect superficial political posturing**

**Accuracy:** **Inaccurate.** The following decade saw science become more politically central rather than less, with climate policy, pandemic response, and key regulatory decisions becoming major partisan battlegrounds. The divide became more institutionalized rather than diminishing.

• **Implicit suggestion that scientific work in non-politically-contentious areas would remain insulated from political polarization**

**Accuracy:** **Mostly accurate, with notable exceptions.** While fields like materials science, organic chemistry, and basic physics generally remained outside direct political controversies, the broader scientific enterprise became more affected by political dynamics through funding mechanisms, institutional policies, and public discourse about scientific authority.

• **Concern about the temptation to "measure everything by politics"**

**Accuracy:** **Accurate.** This trend continued and intensified, with science becoming increasingly politicized across multiple domains in subsequent years, though the real-world impact varied significantly by scientific discipline.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article proved prescient in identifying an important trend that would become even more significant in subsequent years. The political polarization around science that seemed noteworthy but perhaps manageable in 2010 became a defining feature of the scientific landscape over the next decade and a half, making this commentary more insightful in hindsight than it may have appeared at publication.
