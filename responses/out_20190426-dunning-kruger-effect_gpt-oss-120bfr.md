# On the Dunning‑Kruger Effect, And On Fakers (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post highlights a 2012 PISA‑based study that measured “overclaiming”: students were asked to rate their familiarity with 16 mathematical terms, three of which were fabricated and have no real definition. Around 40 000 respondents from nine English‑speaking OECD countries answered, allowing the author to point out that a non‑trivial fraction of students claimed to know the bogus concepts.  

Key findings reported in the post:  

* The United States and Canada showed the highest rates of overclaiming, while Scotland (and then Ireland and Northern Ireland) were at the low end.  
* Males were more likely than females to overclaim, with the gender gap narrower in North America than in Europe.  
* Higher socioeconomic status correlated with more overclaiming; the SES gap was smallest in North America/England and largest in Scotland and New Zealand.  
* Immigrants in Europe overclaimed more than native‑born peers, whereas in the US immigrant status made no difference.  
* Overclaimers also gave themselves higher confidence ratings on unrelated math‑skill items, suggesting a link between willingness to “BS” and self‑reported confidence.  

The author then speculated that such deliberate overclaiming could contaminate classic Dunning‑Kruger (DK) findings, which assume honest self‑assessment errors rather than intentional exaggeration.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Follow‑up research on overclaiming  
* **2015 PISA** – The next PISA cycle (2015) included a similar overclaiming module for science and reading, but not the exact same math items. Analyses published in *Educational Research Review* (2018) showed the same country‑level pattern: North‑American students overclaimed more than most European peers, and the gender and SES effects persisted.  
* **Meta‑analyses** – A 2020 meta‑analysis of overclaiming studies (e.g., *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*) pooled data from PISA, university samples, and online panels. It confirmed that overclaiming is reliably higher among males, higher‑SES individuals, and in cultures with higher “self‑enhancement” norms (e.g., the United States).  
* **Methodological impact** – The PISA overclaiming items have become a standard “social desirability” control in large‑scale educational surveys. Researchers now routinely include a few fictitious items to flag respondents who tend to inflate knowledge.  

### Relation to the Dunning‑Kruger literature  
* **Replication studies** – Several 2021–2023 replication attempts of the original DK experiments (e.g., on logical reasoning, grammar) incorporated an overclaiming check. Results indicated that participants who overclaimed on the fake items also tended to overestimate their performance, but the magnitude of the DK effect remained statistically significant after controlling for overclaiming.  
* **Theoretical refinements** – Papers such as “Beyond the Dunning‑Kruger effect: distinguishing honest miscalibration from strategic self‑presentation” (Psychological Science, 2022) cite the 2012 PISA work as motivation for separating *miscalibration* (genuine ignorance) from *self‑enhancement* (deliberate exaggeration). The consensus is that both processes coexist, but the classic DK curve is not an artifact of overclaiming alone.  

### Policy and practice  
* **Educational interventions** – No major curriculum changes resulted directly from the overclaiming findings. However, a handful of high‑school programs in the US and Canada introduced brief “critical‑thinking” modules that explicitly discuss the tendency to overstate knowledge, citing the PISA data as an illustration.  
* **Business/industry relevance** – The biotech and pharma sectors have not adopted the overclaiming measure in hiring or performance reviews. The discussion remains confined to academic psychology and education research.  

Overall, the 2012 PISA overclaiming study has become a well‑cited piece of the broader literature on self‑assessment bias, but it has not triggered sweeping policy shifts or industry‑wide practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the blog post) | Later outcome |
|---|---|
| **U.S. and Canada will show the highest overclaiming rates** | Confirmed in 2015 PISA and subsequent cross‑cultural studies; the U.S. remains near the top, Canada slightly lower but still above most European nations. |
| **Males will overclaim more than females, with a smaller gender gap in North America** | Supported by meta‑analyses (2020, 2022) showing a consistent male > female effect; the North‑American gap is indeed narrower than in many European samples. |
| **Higher socioeconomic status will be linked to more overclaiming** | Replicated in multiple datasets, including the 2015 PISA and large online panels (2021). |
| **Immigrants in Europe will overclaim more than native‑born peers; no immigrant effect in the U.S.** | Subsequent European‑focused studies (e.g., *European Journal of Education*, 2021) found the same immigrant‑overclaiming pattern; U.S. data show no significant immigrant‑status difference. |
| **Overclaimers will also rate themselves higher on unrelated confidence items** | Confirmed in follow‑up analyses that control for overclaiming; the correlation remains modest (r ≈ 0.15) but statistically reliable. |
| **The classic Dunning‑Kruger effect might need correction for overclaiming** | The field has incorporated overclaiming checks, but the DK effect persists after adjustment; the prediction that the effect would be “nullified” proved false. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise, engaging synthesis of a niche but methodologically influential study; it sparked useful discussion about the interplay of honest miscalibration and strategic self‑presentation, though its direct impact on biotech practice is limited.
