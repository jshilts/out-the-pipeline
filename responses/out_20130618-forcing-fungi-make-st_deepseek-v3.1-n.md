# Forcing Fungi to Make Stranger Compounds (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Japanese study where researchers used an HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor to manipulate gene expression in the fungus *Chaetomium indicum*. The rationale was recent evidence suggesting fungi possess many more biosynthetic genes than are typically expressed under normal conditions. By treating the fungus with the epigenetic modifier, the team successfully induced production of significantly larger amounts of polyketide natural products, including several novel compounds never before described.

This epigenetic manipulation represented one of several approaches being explored to unlock natural product diversity from microorganisms. The author noted that compared to other methods like genetic engineering or environmental stress induction, epigenetic manipulation with small molecules offered the advantage of being easier to implement, with a large toolkit of potential gene-expression modifiers including various HDAC inhibitors, histone acetyltransferase inhibitors, methyltransferase inhibitors and others that could "produce weirdo compounds a-plenty."

## 2. HISTORY

Epigenetic manipulation of fungal secondary metabolism became an established approach in natural product discovery over the subsequent decade. The strategy demonstrated in this 2013 study - using HDAC inhibitors and other epigenetic modifiers to activate silent biosynthetic gene clusters in fungi - was adopted and refined by multiple research groups.

By the late 2010s, this approach had yielded numerous new natural products with potential pharmaceutical relevance. Research expanded beyond HDAC inhibitors to include DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, histone methyltransferase inhibitors, and other epigenetic modulators. The technique proved particularly valuable for accessing the "cryptic" or "silent" secondary metabolite pathways that genomic sequencing had revealed to be far more abundant than previously recognized.

However, translating these discoveries into clinically approved drugs proved challenging. While the method successfully unearthed chemical diversity, only a small fraction of newly discovered fungal natural products progressed to drug development. The complexity of these molecules, difficulties in large-scale production, and the lengthy drug development timeline meant that most remained at the research compound stage rather than becoming approved therapeutics. Companies pursuing natural product drug discovery increasingly combined epigenetic activation with other approaches rather than relying solely on this method.

The broader field of natural product drug discovery saw mixed fortunes. Some blockbuster drugs derived from natural products continued to dominate markets, but the pace of new natural product-based drug approvals remained steady rather than accelerating dramatically. Many pharmaceutical companies had scaled back natural product programs in earlier decades, though some maintained interest through partnerships with academic groups and specialized biotechnology companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: HDAC inhibitors and other epigenetic modifiers would provide access to a large diversity of novel fungal natural products due to the "number of potential gene-expression-changing compounds" being "sufficient to produce weirdo compounds a-plenty."

**Actual outcome**: This prediction proved largely accurate. The subsequent decade saw extensive use of HDAC inhibitors (such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid/SAHA, trichostatin A, and others) along with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, histone acetyltransferase inhibitors, and other epigenetic modulators to activate silent biosynthetic gene clusters in diverse fungal species. Numerous research publications demonstrated successful "cryptic" metabolite discovery using these methods.

• **Prediction**: Epigenetic manipulation would be "easier than most" methods for rejiggering natural product biosynthesis, with advantages over genetic engineering or environmental manipulation.

**Actual outcome**: This proved partially true. Epigenetic activation did indeed become a popular method due to its technical simplicity - often requiring only addition of small molecules to fermentation cultures. However, it wasn't necessarily "easier" than all alternatives, and many researchers adopted integrated approaches combining epigenetic activation with genetic manipulation or cultivation-based methods. The prediction underestimated the value of combining multiple techniques.

• **Implicit prediction**: That increasing access to fungal natural product diversity would lead to valuable new pharmaceutical compounds.

**Actual outcome**: While the method did lead to discovery of numerous structurally novel compounds, translation to approved drugs remained slow and limited. The complexity of fungal natural products, challenges in total synthesis, difficulties in optimizing pharmacokinetic properties, and the long development timelines meant that relatively few discoveries progressed beyond the research stage. The value proposition thus remained more in academic discovery and early-stage drug candidates rather than immediate clinical impact.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified an emerging and important trend in natural product discovery that gained significant traction over the subsequent decade. While the core prediction about accessing fungal chemical diversity proved accurate, the article's timeframe for practical impact was optimistic.
