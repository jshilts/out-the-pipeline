# Here Be Chiral Dragons, With Fluorinated Fangs (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the pervasive problem of "folk wisdom" and anecdotal rules of thumb in medicinal chemistry drug discovery projects. The author describes how, after a project has been running for some time, team members develop strongly held beliefs about what structural modifications work or don't work—such as "trifluoromethyl in the 4-position's a killer" or "you need the R stereochemistry at the benzylic site." These maxims are often based on limited data (sometimes just one or two examples from earlier project stages) or have no empirical foundation whatsoever, yet become accepted as gospel truth.

The core argument is that many of these "things that everyone knows" are either outdated, based on insufficient evidence, or completely wrong. The author advocates for actively testing these assumptions by making "contrarian compounds" that challenge accepted wisdom, noting that while this approach may have a lower hit rate than following current leads, failing to periodically re-examine these beliefs means missing potentially valuable discoveries. The piece calls for organizational cultures that tolerate or encourage exploratory synthesis to test long-held assumptions.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2007 article, the pharmaceutical industry has indeed moved toward more systematic approaches to address the exact problems the author identified. High-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry had already begun democratizing access to diverse chemical space by the mid-2000s, but the late 2000s and 2010s saw significant advances in chemoinformatics and data-driven medicinal chemistry that specifically target the "folk wisdom" problem.

The rise of large pharmaceutical companies' internal databases and machine learning applications to SAR analysis has enabled systematic testing of historical assumptions. By 2010-2015, many major pharma companies had implemented quantitative approaches to track success rates of different substituents and structural motifs across multiple projects, replacing anecdotal observations with statistical evidence. Academic research in chemical biology has also contributed to understanding structure-property relationships more rigorously.

However, the practical reality remains that drug discovery is incredibly complex, and medicinal chemists still rely heavily on experience-based heuristics due to the enormous chemical space and the limitations of current predictive tools. The balance the author advocated—systematically testing assumptions while continuing to exploit known productive areas—has become a standard part of modern drug discovery workflows, though the cultural challenges of challenging established wisdom persist in many organizations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions about future outcomes or timelines. It was primarily descriptive and prescriptive about ongoing practices and problems in medicinal chemistry, rather than forecasting specific developments. Its value lies in identifying persistent challenges in drug discovery culture and methodology, which have remained relevant concerns in the intervening years rather than being resolved or made obsolete by technological advances.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article remains moderately interesting because it identifies a persistent, real-world problem in drug discovery that still resonates today, even as analytical methods have improved. However, it doesn't present novel research, specific case studies with outcomes, or actionable strategies that would elevate it to higher impact. The insight about questioning "everyone knows" assumptions is valuable but not unique to drug discovery.
