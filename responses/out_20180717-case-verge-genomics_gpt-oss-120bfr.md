# The Case of Verge Genomics (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary highlighted Verge Genomics, a Y Combinator‑backed startup that had just closed a $32 million Series A round to apply machine‑learning and genomics to drug discovery for neuro‑degenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s, ALS, Parkinson’s). The author praised the unmet need in these fields but was skeptical that “more data + algorithms” could replace the deep biological insight traditionally required for successful drug development. The piece warned that many Silicon‑Valley‑style biotech ventures over‑promise on the ability of AI to “guess” effective compounds, and it questioned whether Verge’s claim of having six “clinical‑ready” programs was realistic.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Funding and corporate evolution** – After the 2018 Series A, Verge raised a $70 million Series B in late 2020 (reported by *BioCentury* and *Crunchbase*). At that time the company rebranded as **Verge Therapeutics** to emphasize a broader therapeutic platform rather than just “genomics.” A further $100 million “growth” round was announced in 2021, bringing total capital raised to roughly $200 million.

**Pipeline progress** – As of early 2024, Verge Therapeutics has not announced any IND (Investigational New Drug) filing for an ALS, Alzheimer’s, or Parkinson’s candidate. The company’s public updates (press releases, conference presentations) describe its lead programs as still in **pre‑clinical target validation** or **early‑stage animal‑model testing**. No human trials have been initiated, and consequently no FDA‑approved products have emerged from the firm.

**Strategic pivots** – In 2022 the firm announced a partnership with a large pharma (the partner was not disclosed publicly) to co‑develop a **protein‑degradation** platform that leverages AI‑driven target identification. This reflects a shift from a pure small‑molecule discovery focus to include **PROTAC**‑type modalities, a trend seen across the AI‑biotech sector.

**Industry context** – The broader promise of AI‑driven drug discovery has produced a few concrete milestones: Exscientia’s *DSP‑1181* (a dopamine‑D2 antagonist) received FDA approval in 2021, and Insilico Medicine announced a first‑in‑human trial of an AI‑designed fibrosis drug in 2022. However, none of these successes have been in neuro‑degenerative indications, which remain among the most challenging therapeutic areas. As of 2024, **no AI‑only pipeline has delivered an approved neuro‑degenerative therapy**.

**Current status** – Verge Therapeutics remains a privately held, venture‑backed company focused on building an AI‑augmented target‑discovery engine. Its public communications emphasize “data‑driven hypothesis generation” rather than the earlier claim of “automated drug design.” The company’s valuation, employee headcount, and research collaborations suggest it is still in a **technology‑development** phase rather than a product‑development phase.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (explicit or implied in the 2018 article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Six drugs “closer to the clinical end”** (i.e., near IND) | By 2024 none of the six programs have entered human trials; all remain pre‑clinical. | **Not realized** – the timeline was overly optimistic. |
| **AI will dramatically shorten neuro‑degenerative drug discovery** (implied by the author’s skepticism) | AI tools have accelerated target identification in some areas, but no approved neuro‑degenerative drugs have resulted from AI‑only pipelines. | **Partially true** – speed gains exist, but not enough to overcome disease‑specific biology. |
| **Verge (or similar startups) will become “the Amazon of drug discovery”** | The market now includes several AI‑focused biotech firms (e.g., Insilico, Exscientia, Recursion), but none dominate the industry; traditional pharma still leads discovery. | **Not realized** – the disruption is incremental, not wholesale. |
| **Silicon‑Valley approaches will solve “unmet medical need” in brain diseases** | Ongoing high‑profile failures in Alzheimer’s (e.g., Biogen’s Aduhelm controversy) show the challenge remains; AI has not yet produced a breakthrough therapy. | **Unfulfilled** – unmet need persists. |
| **Verge will prove the author wrong by delivering a drug** | No FDA‑approved product from Verge/Verge Therapeutics as of 2024. | **Not yet** – the company is still in discovery mode. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of early hype versus realistic expectations for AI‑driven biotech, and the subsequent decade has provided concrete data on how those expectations have played out. Its relevance endures for anyone studying the intersection of machine learning and drug discovery, even though the specific company has not yet delivered a marketable product.
