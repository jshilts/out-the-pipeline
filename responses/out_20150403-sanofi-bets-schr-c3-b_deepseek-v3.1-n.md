# Sanofi Bets on Schrödinger (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article reported that Sanofi had signed an expanded collaboration with Schrödinger, a computational chemistry company, valued at up to $120 million. The partnership aimed to deploy Schrödinger's computational drug discovery technologies "at a level that is unprecedented in the pharmaceutical industry." The article specifically highlighted Schrödinger's advances in protein and ligand structure determination, potency prediction, and mentioned their free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations and molecular dynamics simulations as key technologies being tested in this large-scale industry validation.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 deal, Schrödinger has continued to grow as a major player in computational drug discovery. The company went public via IPO in February 2020, raising approximately $232 million. Their business model involves both software licensing and collaborative drug discovery partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.

**Drug Development Outcomes**: Schrödinger has built its own drug discovery pipeline, moving beyond just software services. They have multiple programs in preclinical and clinical development, though concrete FDA approvals from their proprietary pipeline prior to 2024 are limited. The validation of their FEP methodology has been demonstrated through adoption by major pharmaceutical companies, but the "transformative impact" predicted in the 2015 press release has been more gradual than revolutionary.

**Business Performance**: As a public company, Schrödinger has faced the typical challenges of scaling computational drug discovery. Their market valuation has fluctuated with biotech market conditions, and they've had to navigate between being a software company and a drug development company - two very different business models with different investor expectations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Transformative impact on drug discovery"** - While FEP calculations have become more widely adopted and have proven useful for binding affinity predictions, they have not fundamentally transformed the entire drug discovery landscape as dramatically as the 2015 language suggested. The technology works well for specific applications but hasn't displaced traditional medicinal chemistry approaches.

• **"Unprecedented level" of deployment with Sanofi** - Such collaborations did become more common across the industry, with companies like Exscientia, Recursion, and others establishing similar partnerships. The Sanofi-Schrödinger deal was notable but not uniquely transformative in hindsight.

• **Real-world testing as definitive validation** - This has been partially borne out. Schrödinger's technology has seen real pharmaceutical industry adoption, but the validation has been more measured than the 2015 hype suggested. Computational methods remain complementary tools rather than replacements for experimental approaches.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article represents a moderately interesting snapshot of the computational drug discovery landscape in 2015, capturing the early enthusiasm for structure-based computational approaches, but the developments since have been more evolutionary than revolutionary.
