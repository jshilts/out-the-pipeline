# Don't Optimify Your Plasma Protein Binding

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2014 *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* review from Genentech researchers examining the role of plasma protein binding (PPB) in drug development. The central argument challenges conventional wisdom that high protein binding—where drug compounds bind to blood proteins like human serum albumin (HSA)—should be avoided in drug design.

The authors analyzed FDA-approved drugs from 2003-2013 and found that 45% of newly approved drugs had PPB >95%, with 24% showing PPB >99%. This demonstrated that even extremely high protein binding doesn't preclude a compound from becoming a valuable drug. The paper argues against using arbitrary PPB cutoffs in drug discovery, suggesting that PPB is neither intrinsically good nor bad and shouldn't be optimized during drug design—a view that ran counter to many medicinal chemists' instincts at the time.

## 2. HISTORY

**Drug approval and R&D practice changes**: In the decade following this article, the pharmaceutical industry largely moved away from strict PPB optimization as a primary goal in drug discovery. The FDA's increasingly pragmatic approach to drug approval, especially with breakthrough therapies, has placed more emphasis on overall clinical efficacy and safety rather than hitting specific PPB targets.

**Novel drug modalities**: The rise of biologics, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and other large-molecule therapies post-2014 has made the PPB debate somewhat less central, as these compounds have different distribution and binding characteristics compared to traditional small molecules.

**Continued academic and industry discourse**: The debate continued in publications, with ongoing discussions about when PPB truly matters—particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows or those requiring rapid onset. However, the general consensus shifted toward viewing PPB as one factor among many, rather than as a primary optimization parameter.

**Regulatory evolution**: Regulatory agencies have adopted more nuanced views, recognizing that high PPB alone doesn't disqualify a drug candidate, especially if clinical data demonstrate safety and efficacy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Compounds with PPB >99% can still be valuable drugs"** → **Mostly accurate**. Many successful drugs approved since 2014 continue to show high protein binding. However, context matters—target tissue penetration, therapeutic index, and pharmacodynamic effects often determine whether high PPB is problematic.

- **"Posing arbitrary cutoff values for PPB could miss valuable medicines"** → **Well-supported**. Drug discovery has increasingly embraced more holistic evaluation criteria, recognizing that early-stage optimization on single parameters like PPB can indeed eliminate promising candidates.

- **Implicit prediction that the field would move away from PPB obsession** → **Partially realized**. While strict PPB cutoffs became less common, the parameter remains important in pharmacokinetic modeling and drug-drug interaction assessments, just with more context-aware interpretation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a persistent misconception in medicinal chemistry and provided data-driven evidence that changed how many researchers approached drug optimization. While focused on a specific technical parameter, it had practical impact on drug discovery practices and represents the kind of myth-busting that improves R&D efficiency.
