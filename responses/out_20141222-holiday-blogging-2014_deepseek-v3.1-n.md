# Holiday Blogging 2014 (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog on Science's website announced that posting would be irregular during the 2014 holiday season until New Year's. The author indicated he wouldn't disappear completely, having backed-up topics to write about, but the holiday season would slow down the posting frequency. He also promised to post cooking recipes, noting that "cooking is the next thing to chemistry."

## 2. HISTORY
This post served as a routine holiday notice for one of the most influential chemistry and pharmaceutical industry blogs. Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" continued publishing throughout the following decade, maintaining its position as a leading voice in chemistry and drug discovery commentary. The blog consistently covered pharmaceutical industry developments, drug approvals, clinical trial results, and scientific controversies through 2025. Notable subsequent developments include the blog's continued coverage of major pharmaceutical milestones like the CAR-T cell therapy approvals beginning in 2017, the CRISPR gene editing advances, the rapid COVID-19 vaccine development in 2020-2021, and ongoing discussions of drug pricing policy debates. The blog maintained its characteristic style of combining technical expertise with accessible writing, often including cooking analogies as promised.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No predictions were made in this article beyond the immediate commitment to continue posting recipes and resume regular blogging after the holidays.
