# They'll Fake the Journal if You'll Fake the Papers (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on widespread academic publishing fraud in China, where criminal operations were producing both fake scholarly articles for sale to researchers and counterfeit versions of legitimate medical journals that sold publication slots. Police raided one such operation in Beijing, discovering a sophisticated racket that had earned over $500,000 since 2009, with individual fake articles costing up to $250 and journal publication slots up to $650.

The piece identifies the root cause as China's research system that rewards quantity over quality—grant funding and academic promotions were awarded based on publication counts rather than research merit, creating strong market demand for fraudulent publications. Medical researchers were identified as typical customers seeking promotions. The article suggests this problem extends beyond China to any system that creates perverse incentives, drawing parallels to pharmaceutical research departments that incentivize compound quantity over quality.

## 2. HISTORY

The academic integrity crisis in China documented in this 2013 article preceded a series of major enforcement actions and policy reforms:

In **2017**, China's Ministry of Science and Technology suspended 107 cancer research papers after investigators found evidence of systematic peer review manipulation. The papers, primarily authored by Chinese researchers, had been published in the journal *Tumor Biology*.

The **Retraction Watch** database documented China as having among the highest retraction rates globally through the late 2010s, with The Economist noting in follow-up coverage that retractions from Chinese institutions increased dramatically between 2010-2020.

**2016-2018** saw major crackdowns on "paper mills" by Chinese authorities, with police operations similar to the 2013 raid expanding nationwide. The government began implementing stricter penalties and enforcement mechanisms targeting both the producers and purchasers of fraudulent research.

Policy reforms accelerated after **2018**, when Chinese universities and funding agencies began shifting from quantity-based metrics to quality-focused evaluation systems. The "Three Breaks" (破"四唯") policy initiated restructuring of academic evaluation criteria, reducing emphasis on publication counts.

**Research Integrity Offices** became mandatory at Chinese universities starting around **2017**, and cross-institutional databases were established to track researchers with integrity violations, preventing them from simply moving to other institutions.

However, the problem persisted internationally. In **2020-2021**, major publishers including Springer Nature, Wiley, and Hindawi retracted hundreds of papers following investigations revealing systematic peer review fraud, with many involving Chinese authors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The article predicted that "Something needs to be done about all this, clearly, but that's not going to be possible without a lot of disruption. The longer it goes on, though, the worse that disruption might be"** - This proved largely accurate. Major systematic changes did occur, but not without significant disruption including mass retractions, damaged institutional reputations, and major policy overhauls that initially caused confusion in Chinese academia.

• **Implicit prediction that incentive structures would perpetuate the problem** - This continued to hold true for several years post-2013, with documented increases in retractions and fraudulent publications, suggesting the predicted disruption did occur but more slowly than anticipated.

• **Implicit prediction about systemic rather than individual corruption** - The scale of crackdowns (such as the 107-paper suspension in 2017) confirmed this was indeed institutional and required systemic rather than individual solutions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a critical systemic problem in academic research that had broader implications for global scientific integrity, accurately predicting the disruption that would follow and highlighting how incentive structures can corrupt entire systems. The topic's importance was validated by subsequent major reforms and international attention to research integrity issues.
