# Ghostwriting On the Larger Scale (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 article discusses a New York Times report exposing an entire ghostwritten medical textbook sponsored by SmithKline (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) over a decade prior. The book was a guide for family physicians on psychiatric pharmacotherapy, with the credited authors being the chairman of the psychiatry department at University of Miami and a former chairman at Stanford. According to the report, a medical writing firm working with SmithKline actually wrote the book, and the pharmaceutical company maintained final approval over the page proofs. The author argues that while the accuracy of the book's content is important, the primary issue is the unethical nature of signing one's name to work written by others with their own financial interests at stake.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2010 revelation, several significant developments occurred regarding medical ghostwriting and pharmaceutical industry transparency:

**Regulatory and Legal Actions:**
- In 2012, GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty to federal charges and paid a $3 billion settlement to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data, which included issues related to publishing studies without proper disclosure of company involvement
- Numerous lawsuits were filed regarding undisclosed pharmaceutical industry influence over medical literature  
- Several major journals, including JAMA and PLoS Medicine, strengthened their disclosure policies requiring explicit documentation of author contributions and industry relationships

**Academic and Professional Consequences:**
- The two listed authors faced institutional investigations, though both retained their positions
- Many universities implemented stricter ghostwriting policies
- The American Medical Writers Association and similar organizations updated ethical guidelines
- Several other ghostwritten publications and books were subsequently exposed

**Industry Changes:**
- Major pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline, implemented voluntary transparency policies regarding publication practices
- Development of registries for clinical trial publications with clear author contribution statements
- The Sunshine Act (2010) led to creation of the Open Payments database, though this focused on financial relationships rather than publication integrity

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no explicit predictions about the future. It focuses on condemning the ethical breach of ghostwriting rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article addresses a significant ethical issue in medical publishing that exposed systemic problems and ultimately led to major policy changes in pharmaceutical transparency, though its long-term impact on completely eliminating ghostwriting remains unclear.
