# Open Office Plans - A Question or Two (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post from Science Magazine's "Pipeline" column addresses the growing trend of open office plans in research buildings. The author references a reader's inquiry about two specific issues: (1) whether open office designs were actually becoming widespread in newly constructed research facilities, or if this was just a few high-profile examples getting disproportionate attention; and (2) whether there were documented cases of research departments implementing open office plans and then reverting back to more traditional layouts after negative experiences.

The article draws a clear distinction between open laboratory spaces (which are common and generally work well) versus open office/desk areas where researchers have no walls, cubicles, or even assigned workspaces. The author seeks evidence about the real prevalence and reversibility of these extreme open office implementations in scientific research environments specifically.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2012 article, research has substantially clarified the impact of open office plans, though adoption patterns vary:

**Evidence on Productivity and Collaboration (2012-2024):**
- A landmark 2018 study by Bernstein and Turban published in *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* tracked two Fortune 500 companies before/after transitioning to open offices. Contrary to expectations, face-to-face interaction *decreased* by roughly 70%, while email and messaging increased significantly, suggesting open offices may actually reduce collaboration rather than enhance it.

- Extensive research by organizational psychologist Matthew Davis and others demonstrated that while open offices are cheaper to build (cost savings of 20-30% per square foot), they correlate with reduced privacy, increased distractions, and lower job satisfaction among knowledge workers.

**Industry Adoption and Backlash:**
Major tech companies that had championed open offices began reversing course. Google, which had been heavily associated with open workspaces, began implementing more private spaces and "team neighborhoods" starting around 2015-2016. Similarly, Microsoft, Apple, and other tech firms introduced more varied workspace designs combining open areas with private spaces.

However, open office plans did become more common in research buildings constructed 2010-2020, driven by real estate cost pressures and claims about fostering collaboration. Academic research buildings like the Broad Institute's expansion, various university science buildings, and pharmaceutical company facilities increasingly adopted open-plan designs.

**Reversion Examples:**
While systematic data on reversions remained limited, anecdotal evidence suggests some organizations did move back toward private offices or cubicles. Herman Miller and other office furniture companies reported increased sales of acoustic pods, phone booths, and privacy-focused furniture solutions starting around 2015, indicating demand for retreat spaces within open-plan environments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article poses questions rather than making explicit predictions, but the underlying concerns align with what research later revealed:

**Implicit Question:** "Is this the wave-of-the-future, or just a few high-profile examples getting attention?"

- **What happened:** Open offices did become more common in the following decade, but research showed they often reduced face-to-face collaboration rather than enhancing it. The "wave" was real but the benefits were questionable.

**Implicit Question:** "Does anyone know of examples where research departments tried open-office plans and moved back?"

- **What happened:** While comprehensive reversal data remained scarce, industry trends toward hybrid designs and "activity-based working" suggested recognition that pure open plans were problematic. Companies invested heavily in mitigation solutions (phone booths, quiet zones, private spaces) rather than full reversions, suggesting that once buildings were built with open plans, complete reversion was often impractical and expensive.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article addresses a practical workplace design issue relevant to scientific productivity, and the questions it raises foreshadow concerns that later research would substantiate. The topic intersects workplace design, organizational psychology, and research management, making it moderately interesting with lasting relevance even though it's not a breakthrough scientific topic.
