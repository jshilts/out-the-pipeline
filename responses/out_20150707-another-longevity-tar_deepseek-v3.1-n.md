# Another Longevity Target (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary discusses a *Cell* paper providing evidence that the Ras-ERK-ETS signaling pathway is involved in lifespan regulation in *Drosophila* (fruit flies). The work used trametinib, an MEK inhibitor already approved for metastatic melanoma, to demonstrate that inhibiting this pathway could extend lifespan in flies. Figure 6 of the paper proposed a unifying framework connecting multiple known longevity pathways: insulin signaling, PI3K/AKT, Ras/ERK, and Aop-Foxo.

The authors suggested that these mechanisms might be conserved in mammals, citing evidence that cAMP/PKA disruption extends lifespan in mice, and that fibroblasts from long-lived mammals show altered Erk phosphorylation dynamics. The commentary highlights the intriguing possibility of repurposing trametinib for longevity in healthy humans, while noting that no one without cancer has likely taken the drug for extended periods since its Phase I trials.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2015 article, several developments occurred in the Ras-ERK pathway and longevity research space:

**Trametinib's Clinical Trajectory**: Trametinib (Mekinist) remained FDA-approved for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma and later gained additional indications for non-small cell lung cancer and other malignancies. However, no substantial clinical trials emerged investigating trametinib specifically for longevity or aging in healthy humans. The commentary's speculation that "it's going to be interesting to see if someone takes them up on it" has not materialized in the form of dedicated anti-aging trials.

**Aging Research Progress**: The broader longevity field did advance significantly between 2015-2025 with numerous clinical trials investigating rapamycin/rapalogs, metformin (in the famous TAME trial design), senolytics, and other interventions. However, Ras-ERK pathway inhibitors like trametinib did not become a major focus for longevity drug development.

**Academic Research**: The Ras-ERK pathway continued to be studied in aging contexts in model organisms, but it did not emerge as a primary target comparable to mTOR, AMPK, or senolytic approaches in terms of research investment or clinical translation for aging.

**Drug Repurposing Landscape**: While trametinib itself did not move into longevity trials, the concept of repurposing oncology drugs for aging gained traction more broadly. Rapamycin analogs led this trend following their cancer approvals.

**Safety Barriers**: A major practical barrier mentioned in the original article remained relevant: trametinib and other MEK inhibitors carry significant toxicity profiles including cardiac, ocular, and dermatologic side effects that make chronic use in healthy individuals problematic.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained explicit and implicit predictions:

• **"It's going to be interesting to see if someone takes them up on it"** (regarding investigating trametinib for longevity) - **OUTCOME**: This did not happen to any significant degree. No major pharmaceutical company or research institute initiated longevity trials with trametinib or similar MEK inhibitors in healthy populations.

• **Implicit prediction that Ras-ERK pathway would become a major longevity target** - **OUTCOME**: While the pathway maintained research interest, it didn't achieve the prominence of mTOR, AMPK, or senolytic pathways in the subsequent decade of aging research and drug development.

• **Implicit suggestion that trametinib's effects might translate to humans without cancer** - **OUTCOME**: No direct evidence emerged, as no trials tested this hypothesis. The known toxicity profile of MEK inhibitors made such studies unlikely from the start.

• **Implicit prediction that the conserved mechanisms would prove relevant to mammals** - **OUTCOME**: Partially born out in continued research but without breakthrough translational success. The pathway's importance in cell proliferation and cancer made systemic inhibition for longevity purposes challenging.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article touches on an interesting intersection of oncology drug repurposing and longevity research, but the specific pathway discussed did not become a major focus of subsequent anti-aging efforts. Higher interest would require either successful clinical translation or a significant research breakthrough that didn't materialize.
