# "In the Pipeline" Will Be Moving (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article announces that the blog "In the Pipeline" would be moving from its longtime home at Corante.com after over a decade due to ongoing server problems. The author notes that while several relocation offers had been received over the years, recent server issues had made the move necessary, and that several good hosting situations had recently been offered. The post expresses gratitude to Hylton Joliffe, the founder of Corante.com, for providing the platform and editorial freedom for over ten years. The author planned to continue blogging without interruption and promised details about the new location would follow soon.

## 2. HISTORY

The "In the Pipeline" blog is written by Derek Lowe, a medicinal chemist and pharmaceutical industry commentator. In July 2014, approximately one month after this announcement, the blog moved to the new *Science* magazine website hosted by AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science), where it continues to operate today. The relocation proved successful - the blog maintained its regular publication schedule and has remained consistently active for the subsequent decade. "In the Pipeline" subsequently became one of the most widely-read chemistry and drug discovery blogs, establishing itself as a prominent voice in pharmaceutical industry commentary and scientific criticism. The blog has covered major developments in drug discovery, clinical trial successes and failures, FDA approvals, and controversies in the pharmaceutical industry, with special attention to the practical challenges of medicinal chemistry and drug development pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: The blog would "keep going without interruption" after the move.

- **Outcome**: ✓ **Achieved**. The blog successfully transitioned to *Science* magazine's website in July 2014 and has maintained consistent publication without significant interruption for the subsequent decade.

**Prediction**: The author would "have more details soon about the new location."

- **Outcome**: ✓ **Achieved**. The move was announced one month later when the blog relaunched on the *Science* magazine platform in July 2014.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While personally meaningful to the blog's author and followers, this article has minimal long-term importance as it primarily announces a technical relocation rather than discussing developments in biotechnology or pharmaceutical science.
