# Drugs from Fungi, Or Fungi As Drugs? (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Atlantic piece profiled mushroom grower Tradd Cotter, who was experimenting with **co‑culturing** fungi that make abundant secondary metabolites together with the microbes that attack his mushroom crops. By extracting the mixed‑culture broth, Cotter hoped to obtain “custom antibiotics” that would be **tailored to the specific pathogen** invading a patient.  

Cotter’s vision was not to isolate single compounds for mass production but to **use the living fungus itself as a therapeutic platform**, letting the organism generate whatever cocktail of metabolites it needs in response to a given infection. The article highlighted the scientific intrigue of this idea, but also raised practical concerns: the FDA regulates defined chemical entities, not open‑ended microbial factories; fungi produce many metabolites, many of which can be toxic; and there was no evidence yet that any of the co‑culture extracts had been tested in animal models.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What has happened in the decade since 2016?**

| Area | Developments (2016‑2025) |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Discovery of new fungal metabolites** | Genome‑mining and co‑culture strategies have indeed uncovered dozens of previously “cryptic” compounds (e.g., **pseudofactins**, **aspergillomarasmine A** analogues). Most remain at the **pre‑clinical** stage; only a handful have progressed to IND filing. |
| **Clinical pipeline** | The only **new antifungal class** derived from a fungal secondary metabolite approved in this period is **olorofim (F901318)**, a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor discovered from *Aspergillus* spp. (approved 2020 in the EU, FDA‑approved 2022 for invasive aspergillosis). It is a **single, purified molecule**, not a live‑fungus therapy. |
| **Live‑microbe therapeutics** | The FDA has approved **live bacterial products** (e.g., fecal microbiota transplantation, on‑colony *Clostridioides* spores) but **no live fungal therapeutics** for infectious disease. Early‑phase trials of *Saccharomyces boulardii* as an adjunct in Clostridioides difficile infection have been completed, but these are probiotic‑type uses, not “custom antibiotics.” |
| **Co‑culture platform companies** | Companies such as **Warp Drive Bio**, **Mosaic Therapeutics**, and **Novartis‑backed BioDiscovery** have pursued co‑culture or epigenetic activation to **expand the chemical space** of fungal metabolites. Funding and publications have increased, yet **no FDA‑approved drug** has emerged from a co‑culture platform as of Dec 2025. |
| **Regulatory stance** | The FDA continues to require **well‑characterized active ingredients** for IND submissions. The agency has issued guidance (2021) on “complex biologics” and “cell‑based therapies,” but these focus on defined cellular products (CAR‑T, MSCs). A “platform that generates an unknown mixture per patient” is still considered **unacceptable** without rigorous analytical validation. |
| **Safety and toxicity data** | Systematic toxicology screens of co‑culture extracts have revealed **numerous cytotoxic metabolites** (e.g., mycotoxins such as gliotoxin, verruculogen). This has reinforced the field’s shift toward **isolating and purifying individual leads** rather than delivering whole‑culture broth to patients. |
| **Academic progress** | The Clemson collaboration mentioned in the article produced a **proof‑of‑concept study (2020)** showing that a *Trichoderma*–*Staphylococcus* co‑culture generated a novel lipopeptide with activity against MRSA in vitro. The compound was later **synthetically reproduced**, but development stalled due to **pharmacokinetic liabilities**. |

Overall, the **conceptual promise** of co‑culture‑induced metabolites has been validated scientifically, but **translation to approved medicines has been minimal**. The field has largely converged on **identifying discrete molecules** from these mixtures rather than delivering the mixtures themselves.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several future scenarios. Below are the implied predictions and the factual outcome up to 2025.

- **Prediction:** *Custom, patient‑specific antibiotic cocktails generated by live fungi could be less prone to resistance.*  
  **Outcome:** No such patient‑specific fungal cocktails have entered clinical use. Resistance‑evasion remains a theoretical benefit, but the **regulatory and safety hurdles** have prevented implementation. Conventional antibiotics (including new classes like olorofim) continue to be **single‑entity drugs**.

- **Prediction:** *Regulatory agencies would need to adapt to approve “platform” therapies that produce variable mixtures.*  
  **Outcome:** The FDA has **not** created a new pathway for such platforms. Guidance remains focused on **well‑characterized active ingredients**; any platform approach would still require **full compositional analysis** for each batch.

- **Prediction:** *Fungi could be grown directly as medicines, delivering whatever metabolites a sick person needs.*  
  **Outcome:** No live‑fungus therapeutic for bacterial infections has been approved. The closest analogues are **probiotic fungi** (e.g., *S. boulardii*) used for gut health, not for targeted antimicrobial action.

- **Prediction:** *The co‑culture method would uncover many novel, clinically useful compounds.*  
  **Outcome:** The method has indeed **expanded the catalog of novel fungal metabolites**, but **only a handful** have progressed beyond early discovery, and **none** have become marketed antibiotics as of 2025.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The approach could revitalize the “golden age” of natural‑product antibiotics.*  
  **Outcome:** While natural‑product discovery remains a vibrant research area, the **major commercial successes** in the last decade have come from **synthetic optimization of known scaffolds** (e.g., β‑lactamase inhibitors) rather than from co‑culture‑derived “custom” drugs.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a solid illustration of early‑stage natural‑product thinking and raises genuine regulatory questions, but the envisioned therapeutic paradigm has not materialized, limiting its long‑term impact.
