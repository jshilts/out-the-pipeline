# The Target Validation Database (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes the launch of the Target Validation Database (targetvalidation.org), a collaboration between GSK, Wellcome Trust/Sanger Institute, and EMBL under the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation initiative. The platform aimed to serve as a centralized resource linking genetic sequences, tissues, and human diseases, allowing researchers to input molecular targets and retrieve correlated diseases sorted by categories including genetic mutations, RNA expression data, known drugs, pathways, literature scores, and animal model studies. Researchers could also search in reverse, inputting diseases to identify associated molecular targets. The article notes that while the database would help researchers assess existing evidence, distinguishing between truly validated targets and preliminary associations would remain a scientific judgment call beyond any database's capabilities.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2015 launch, the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation and its database evolved significantly. By 2018, the initiative expanded through partnerships with Biogen, Takeda, and Celgene, with the Open Targets platform becoming the flagship name. The database rebranded as Open Targets Platform and Open Targets Genetics, releasing regular quarterly updates. By 2020-2023, Open Targets had grown to include additional pharmaceutical partners such as Sanofi and Pfizer. The platform now integrates data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), functional genomics (CRISPR screens, proteomics), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and drug target information, serving as a major public resource for target prioritization. Numerous pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers have used Open Targets to identify and validate drug targets, with the platform cited in hundreds of research papers and informing drug discovery programs. While the database doesn't directly translate to drug approvals, its systematic approach to target validation has likely contributed to more informed decision-making in pharmaceutical R&D pipelines, potentially avoiding costly late-stage failures by providing better evidence earlier in the process.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **The database would aggregate extensive data on genetic-disease connections**: ✓ Accurate. Open Targets scaled significantly with quarterly updates and comprehensive integration of genomics, functional data, and literature evidence.

• **Researchers would need to make their own judgments about true validation**: ✓ Accurate. While the platform provides evidence aggregation, target validation remains a complex scientific exercise involving experimental validation rather than database queries alone.

• **Searches returning little/no results could indicate wilderness wandering or novel discoveries**: ✓ Accurate. This reflects the ongoing scientific reality that databases are tools, not oracles, and the burden of identifying meaningful biology remains on researchers.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article highlights a significant early step in systematic target validation informatics, and the Open Targets platform became a major public-private partnership resource widely used in drug discovery, making it historically notable and practically important for the field.
