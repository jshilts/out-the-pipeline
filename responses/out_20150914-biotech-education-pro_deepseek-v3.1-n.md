# A Biotech Education, In Progress (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary analyzes Peter Thiel's evolving perspective on biotechnology investing as an intelligent outsider entering drug discovery. The article focuses on Thiel's investment in Stemcentrx, a cancer stem cell company, through his Founders Fund. At the time, Stemcentrx commanded a high valuation of $5 billion and was developing Rova-T, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting DLL3 on cancer stem cells.

The piece highlights Thiel's acknowledgment that "biology doesn't do what it's told" (unlike software) and his quantitative approach to drug development risk, where he calculated valuations by discounting at each stage from basic research through FDA approval. Thiel expressed concern that many biotech companies accept too much randomness, believing Stemcentrx had systematically reduced uncertainty at each step. However, the author questions whether the cancer stem cell hypothesis itself is sufficiently validated to justify such confidence, noting the controversial nature of targeting cancer stem cells therapeutically.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent history starkly illustrates the risks Thiel identified. In April 2016, just months after this article, **AbbVie acquired Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion upfront plus up to $4 billion in milestones**, representing one of the largest biotech acquisitions that year. The acquisition centered on Rova-T (rovalpituzumab tesirine), the DLL3-targeting antibody-drug conjugate.

**Clinical outcomes were devastating:** Rova-T failed spectacularly in clinical trials. In 2018, a Phase 3 trial (TAHOE) in third-line small cell lung cancer was stopped early due to **worse survival compared to chemotherapy**. Additional trials in earlier lines of therapy also failed. By 2019, AbbVie announced it would **discontinue all Rova-T development**, taking a **$5.1 billion write-down** on the Stemcentrx acquisition. This represented one of the most expensive clinical failures in recent pharmaceutical history.

The broader cancer stem cell field also struggled. While the biological concept of cancer stem cells remained scientifically valid for certain malignancies, **therapeutic targeting proved far more difficult than anticipated**. Many companies pursuing similar approaches either pivoted or failed, and no cancer stem cell-targeting therapy achieved FDA approval in the subsequent decade.

The Stemcentrx failure significantly impacted AbbVie's oncology strategy and served as a cautionary tale about high-valuation biotech acquisitions predicated on unproven biological hypotheses.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Thiel's central prediction: Stemcentrx had "designed to get these probabilities as close to one as possible at every step"**  
  **Outcome:** Completely failed. The drug failed at multiple clinical stages, ultimately showing worse outcomes than standard care. The approach did not reduce uncertainty as claimed.

- **Implicit prediction: Cancer stem cells represented a validated therapeutic target**  
  **Outcome:** Partial biological validation, but therapeutic failure. While cancer stem cell biology continued to be studied, no successful therapies emerged from this approach. The DLL3 target did show some utility in diagnostics but failed as a therapeutic target.

- **Author's skepticism: "I hope an outside observer can be forgiven for wondering if things really are different this time"**  
  **Outcome:** Vindicated. The author's caution proved prescient—despite Thiel's confidence in reducing randomness, fundamental biological uncertainty remained.

- **Thiel's valuation model based on sequential probability discounts**  
  **Outcome:** The model itself was reasonable, but inputs were wrong. The actual probability of success for Stemcentrx's approach was near zero, not the 50% Thiel estimated.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment where Silicon Valley's approach to biotech investing met harsh biological reality, and the prescient skepticism it expresses makes it valuable for understanding systematic risks in drug development that remain relevant today.
