# More Herbal Goodness (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a 2015 action by the New York State Attorney General's office targeting major retailers (including Wal-Mart, GNC, Target, and Walgreens) for selling allegedly fraudulent herbal supplements. DNA barcode testing at Clarkson University found that the vast majority of supplements analyzed contained no detectable DNA from the advertised plants—Wal-Mart's store brand failed in 94% of samples. Instead, the tests revealed contamination with rice, beans, wild carrot, asparagus, wheat, palm tree, daisy, and even houseplants like dracena.

The piece examines the industry's defense that solvent-based plant extracts might not contain detectable DNA, but argues this explanation is undermined by the presence of contaminant DNA from other plants. The author concludes that the herbal supplement industry represents a "massive, whalloping" example of regulatory failure enabled by the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which shields supplement makers from rigorous FDA oversight.

## 2. HISTORY

**2015-2016: Regulatory Aftermath and Industry Response**
- Following the NY Attorney General's action, major retailers temporarily pulled certain supplements but most products returned to shelves within weeks
- GNC reached a settlement with the NY AG in 2015, agreeing to implement DNA barcode testing and stricter quality controls
- The FDA issued new draft guidance in 2016 on dietary supplement ingredient identity testing, though enforcement remained limited

**Industry Patterns (2015-2024)**
- Multiple independent studies continued finding similar contamination and substitution issues:
  - 2015-2020 studies in Canada, Australia, and Europe replicated findings of widespread mislabeling
  - A 2019 study published in JAMA Network Open found 67% of Ayurvedic herbal supplements tested contained unlabeled heavy metals
  - 2021 research showed 40% of curcumin supplements failed quality testing

**Regulatory Developments**
- The FDA established the Dietary Supplement Ingredient Directory in 2018 to improve oversight
- DSHEA remained intact; no major legislative changes to supplement regulation passed despite criticism
- The FDA issued warning letters to companies making COVID-19 treatment claims in 2020-2021
- FTC increased enforcement against supplement companies making false health claims

**Market Consequences**
- The herbal supplement market continued growing despite quality concerns, reaching $9.5 billion in the US by 2023 (up from $6.4 billion in 2015)
- Direct-to-consumer genetic testing largely moved to blood-based methods rather than plant DNA barcoding
- Quality certifications like USP and NSF became more common but remained voluntary

**Clinical Impact**
- No significant change in supplement efficacy evidence; most herbal supplements still lack FDA approval for treating specific conditions
- Emergency room visits due to supplement adverse events remained a documented problem
- No major pharmaceutical companies entered the traditional herbal supplement market with FDA-approved botanical drugs based on this controversy

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in the Article:**
- **That regulatory action would lead to industry reform**: Only partially materialized. While GNC implemented some quality controls and the FDA issued guidance, DSHEA remained unchanged and widespread quality issues persisted in independent testing through 2024.
- **That market consequences would follow from exposure of quality problems**: The market proved highly resilient—supplements returned quickly to shelves, and overall market size grew substantially between 2015 and 2023 despite ongoing quality concerns.
- **That the industry's extract defense would not withstand scrutiny**: Subsequent research confirmed that both contamination issues and mislabeling remained widespread even in extract products.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses a persistent public health concern with clear evidence and presents a regulatory governance case study that remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade as the supplement industry continued operating under similar frameworks despite documented quality problems.
