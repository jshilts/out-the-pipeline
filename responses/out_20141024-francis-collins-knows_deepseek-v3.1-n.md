# Francis Collins Knows Why We Don't Have An Ebola Vaccine (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary challenges NIH Director Francis Collins' claim that budget constraints prevented the development of an Ebola vaccine by 2014. The author argues that Collins' assertion during Congressional testimony and in media articles was misleading, characterizing it as political posturing typical of agency heads seeking funding increases. The article critiques Collins' implication that more funding would have guaranteed a vaccine, pointing out that drug development involves inherent uncertainty and clinical trial failures regardless of funding levels. The author notes that while NIH budgets had declined about 10% from their 2004 peak in inflation-adjusted terms, they had remained relatively stable in the $30-35 billion range, contradicting the narrative of "slashed budgets." The piece endorses UC Berkeley professor Michael Eisen's characterization of Collins' claims as misleading and advocates for funding basic research on its own merits rather than through disease-of-the-week appeals.

## 2. HISTORY

**Vaccine Development Outcome:**
The rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine (Ervebo) was indeed developed and received FDA approval in December 2019, approximately five years after this article. The vaccine demonstrated approximately 97.5% efficacy in clinical trials and became the first FDA-approved Ebola vaccine. Crucially, this timeline supports the article's skepticism—while development continued and ultimately succeeded, it did not happen with the immediacy suggested by Collins' 2014 statements.

**Funding:**
Collins continued as NIH Director until 2021, spanning multiple administrations. The budget argument remained largely unchanged, with agency heads continuing similar advocacy strategies for research funding. The fundamental tension Collins identified—between basic research justification and crisis-response funding appeals—persisted throughout subsequent years.

**Scientific Process:**
The Ebola vaccine development did follow the skeptical path the article correctly outlined: Phase 1 trials began in 2014-2015, with multiple candidates entering clinical evaluation. Not all candidates succeeded, validating the article's emphasis on clinical trial uncertainty and the reality that additional funding cannot guarantee successful medical products, only enable more attempts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Collins' implicit prediction**: With more funding, an Ebola vaccine would have been available by 2014 or shortly thereafter.
  - **Outcome**: The FDA-approved vaccine emerged in 2019, five years later. While development succeeded, it did not align with the accelerated timeline Collins suggested.

• **Article's position**: Emphasized that drug/vaccine development has inherent failure rates and cannot be guaranteed by funding alone.
  - **Outcome**: Validated—Ebola vaccine development proceeded through systematic clinical trial phases with uncertain outcomes, as predicted.

• **Article's prediction about funding advocacy**: That agency heads would continue using similar crisis-based arguments rather than making the case for basic research.
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed—similar advocacy patterns continued throughout subsequent years for NIH and other research agencies.

• **Implicit article stance**: That funding should support the scientific process rather than promise specific guaranteed outcomes.
  - **Outcome**: This more measured approach aligned with how the Ebola vaccine actually developed, with funds enabling research rather than purchasing predetermined results.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article demonstrates accurate skepticism about claims that funding alone guarantees scientific success, and correctly emphasizes that medical research proceeds through uncertain clinical trial processes. However, it primarily addresses budget advocacy rhetoric rather than addressing the deeper scientific challenge, and its importance diminishes with the successful 2019 vaccine approval. The piece would have been strengthened by acknowledging that while the timeline arguments were questionable, the underlying scientific effort was indeed valuable and under-resourced compared to reasonable public health needs.
