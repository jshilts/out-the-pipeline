# The Latest Protein-Protein Compounds (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a commentary article reviewing the state of protein-protein interaction (PPI) drug discovery as of 2014, focusing on the "hot spots" concept and small molecule approaches. The author notes that while the field is of intrinsic scientific interest, practical drug development faces significant challenges. The key problems identified are: (1) finding protein surfaces that offer sufficient binding energy for small molecules to effectively disrupt the interaction; (2) concerns about whether existing compound screening libraries contain the right types of structures for PPI targets; and (3) the likelihood that PPI-targeting compounds would face pharmacokinetic and formulation challenges due to their typically larger, flatter molecular structures. The article references several examples and describes the ongoing scientific struggle in this area without claiming major breakthroughs.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent developments from 2014 onward showed that PPI drug discovery has made important advances. Several clinically successful PPI inhibitors have reached the market, including venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor), navitoclax, and sotorasib (KRAS inhibitor). These drugs demonstrate that the "hot spot" targeting strategy can be clinically viable when the right targets and small-molecule approaches are employed. BCL-2 inhibitors, in particular, have shown real-world clinical uptake and patient benefit for leukemia treatment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Challenge prediction**: The author predicted that finding small molecules with sufficient binding energy for PPI surfaces would remain difficult.
- **Structural bias prediction**: The article anticipated that PPI-targeting compounds would likely be "big lunker molecules with lots of aryl rings," posing PK and formulation challenges.  
- **Progress prediction (implicit)**: The author's skepticism about current screening libraries containing appropriate compounds for PPI targets.

**How predictions compared to reality**: While PPI drug discovery has indeed produced successful drugs, the general challenges the author identified remain largely valid. Successes like BCL-2 inhibitors validate the hot spot approach, but these represent specific cases where the biology and chemistry aligned favorably.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article offers reasonably relevant commentary on the ongoing challenges in PPI drug discovery, though it reflects a moment when the field was still struggling to demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept.
