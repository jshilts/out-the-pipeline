# New Looks At Two Classic Reactions (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses two research papers that re-examined fundamental organic chemistry reactions involving amides and palladium-catalyzed couplings - workhorse reactions in medicinal chemistry and drug synthesis.

The first paper from the Szostak group demonstrated that intentionally making amide bonds non-planar (by N-functionalization with Boc or tosyl groups) dramatically increases their reactivity, enabling transamidation reactions at room temperature that would otherwise take years to occur with traditional planar amides. This provides a mild method to manipulate one of organic chemistry's most fundamental functional groups.

The second paper from Eli Lilly and academic collaborators systematically tested how various functional groups interfere with Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings, a widely used but often finicky palladium-catalyzed reaction crucial for drug synthesis. Using high-throughput screening across 3,000+ reaction conditions, they identified functional groups that suppress yields and systematically optimized conditions to rescue these problematic couplings. The work revealed surprising sensitivities - for example, switching from dimethoxyethane to dioxane (chemically similar solvents) changed yields from 5% to quantitative for one model reaction.

## 2. HISTORY
**Non-planar amide chemistry:** The Szostak group's non-planar amide strategy has evolved into an important synthetic methodology. This work contributed to the broader recognition that twisting amides away from planarity fundamentally alters their reactivity profile. The approach has been adopted by synthetic chemists for selective amide modifications and has influenced subsequent development of amide activation strategies. While not leading to specific FDA-approved drugs directly, the methodology provided new tools for medicinal chemists attempting challenging amide transformations in drug candidate synthesis.

**Buchwald-Hartwig optimization:** The systematic robustness testing approach pioneered in the Lilly work influenced how pharmaceutical companies approach reaction optimization and process development. The high-throughput screening methodology became more widely adopted for challenging Pd-catalyzed couplings. However, Buchwald-Hartwig couplings remain substrate-dependent and challenging to generalize - while optimization strategies have improved, they still require case-by-case optimization for many substrates.

**Broader context:** Both research directions reflect the ongoing challenge in pharmaceutical chemistry of making reactions more predictable and robust. The need for such systematic studies persists as drug molecules become increasingly complex with multiple functional groups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Article predictions:**
• *"if you can make amides and run palladium-catalyzed couplings, then you've pretty much got the whole toolkit to make a success of yourself in the lab"* - This remains largely true for medicinal chemistry roles, though contemporary drug discovery increasingly requires expertise in additional areas like PROTAC synthesis, peptide chemistry, and C-H activation.
• *"every single Pd-catalyzed coupling can be optimized to high yield if you're just willing to spend enough of your life messing around with the conditions"* - This intuitive understanding has largely held true, with systematic optimization and high-throughput approaches making the process more efficient than suggested
• *Implicit prediction that sharing systematic optimization data would benefit the community* - This has proven valuable, with increased sharing of reaction databases, though challenges remain in translating specific optimal conditions across different substrates

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article highlights important but incremental methodological advances in fundamental organic chemistry. While valuable to practicing chemists, these techniques represent refinements rather than transformational breakthroughs that would reshape drug discovery paradigms.
