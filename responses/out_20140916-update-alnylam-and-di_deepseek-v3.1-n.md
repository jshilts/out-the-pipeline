# Update on Alnylam (And the Direction of Things to Come) - September 2014

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary assesses the resurgence of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, focusing on Alnylam's progress with a drug for familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) in advanced human trials. The article notes that after initial hype around RNAi in the mid-2000s and subsequent skepticism, the technology appeared to be "turning the corner," with Alnylam's lead candidate showing over 80% reduction in disease-causing protein production.

The author highlights renewed pharmaceutical industry interest, including Sanofi's $700 million investment in Alnylam and Roche's $450 million acquisition of RNAi startup Santaris. Alnylam had 11 drugs in development targeting conditions like hemophilia, hepatitis B, and high cholesterol, with approximately 15 RNAi-based drugs across the industry in clinical trials at the time. The commentary contextualizes RNAi within broader biotechnology trends—comparing it to earlier cycles with monoclonal antibodies and antisense technology—and speculates about potential industry disruption if genomic-based therapies prove viable.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's timing proved prescient. Alnylam's FAP drug, patisiran (brand name Onpattro), **received FDA approval in August 2018**, becoming the first RNAi therapeutic approved in the United States. The drug demonstrated significant clinical benefit in the Phase III trial referenced in the article, validating the technology's therapeutic potential. Patisiran achieved broad patient uptake and became a standard treatment for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (the condition the article calls FAP).

Following patisiran's success, **Alnylam achieved multiple additional FDA approvals**: givosiran (Givlaari) for acute hepatic porphyria in 2019, lumasiran (Oxlumo) for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 in 2020, and inclisiran (Leqvio, partnered with Novartis) for high cholesterol in 2021—directly validating the "high cholesterol" target mentioned in the 2014 pipeline. Several other Alnylam drugs are now approved or in late-stage development.

The broader RNAi field indeed "turned the corner" as predicted. By 2022-2024, **RNAi therapeutics became an established therapeutic modality**, with multiple approved drugs treating thousands of patients globally. The technology proved particularly valuable for rare genetic diseases where targeting the root cause protein production offered advantages over traditional approaches.

**Sanofi's investment strategy evolved**: while maintaining RNAi partnerships, they shifted more focus to other modalities, but their early $700M bet positioned them well in the space. The broader pharmaceutical industry made substantial RNAi investments, with **Novartis, Pfizer, and other majors entering or expanding RNAi programs**.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **RNAi success would enable other genomic therapies**: **Largely accurate**. The article predicted mRNA therapies and CRISPR gene editing would benefit from RNAi's development. **Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines** (2020-2021) and multiple **CRISPR therapeutics now in clinical trials** (including approved treatments like Casgevy for sickle cell disease) validate this. The foundational delivery and manufacturing knowledge from RNAi directly informed subsequent nucleic acid therapies.

• **Creative destruction in small molecules and rare disease models**: **Accurate, though slower than implied**. RNAi and other genomic therapies haven't eliminated small molecules (which remain ~90% of prescriptions), but they have **disrupted treatment paradigms for specific rare diseases**. Diseases like hereditary ATTR amyloidosis and certain metabolic disorders now prioritize RNAi or gene therapy approaches over traditional small molecules when applicable.

• **25-year transformation of therapeutic landscape**: **Moderately accurate, though timeline is ongoing**. While 10 years in (2024), the landscape has changed substantially with RNAi approvals, mRNA vaccines, and CRISPR advances, the full transformation predicted for 2039 remains to be seen. The author's 25-year horizon was appropriately cautious—these technologies are indeed reshaping medicine, but therapeutic development operates on decade-plus timescales.

• **Alnylam's FAP drug would pass Phase III testing**: **Accurate**. Patisiran succeeded in its Phase III trial (2017), leading to FDA approval (2018) and establishing RNAi as a viable therapeutic platform—exactly the "reality check" the author referenced.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified a genuine inflection point in RNAi therapeutics at precisely the right moment, correctly predicted the technology's maturation into approved medicines, and contextualized it within broader genomic therapy trends. Its insights about creative destruction and industry transformation remain relevant to ongoing therapeutic development.
