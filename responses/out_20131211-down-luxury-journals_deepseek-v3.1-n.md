# Down With the Luxury Journals? (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Nobel laureate Randy Schekman's public declaration that he would no longer submit manuscripts to high-profile "luxury journals" such as Nature, Science, and Cell. Schekman argued that these journals create distorted incentives in science by artificially restricting publication space and using "impact factors" to cultivate exclusive brands, much like luxury fashion designers create scarcity to drive demand. The article notes that while Schekman faced criticism for this stance (particularly since he was editor of the open-access journal eLife and had already won a Nobel Prize), his position highlighted a genuine problem: funding and appointment panels often use journal prestige as a lazy proxy for research quality, leading to career incentives that don't necessarily serve science's best interests. The piece also mentions Nature editor Philip Campbell's response, which distinguished between open access as a business model and selectivity in publishing, while acknowledging concerns about overemphasis on impact factors.

## 2. HISTORY
In the decade following this 2013 saw significant evolution in academic publishing practices following this 2013 declaration:

**Open Access Growth**: The open access movement gained substantial momentum. eLife, which Schekman edited, became a respected venue, though it never displaced the luxury journals in perceived prestige. However, major funders began implementing open access mandates - the NIH had already started this trend, but it accelerated. By 2021, Plan S in Europe required publicly funded research to be published open access, fundamentally changing the landscape.

**Impact Factor Criticism Intensified**: The problems Schekman identified with impact factors became more widely acknowledged. In 2016, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology issued a declaration against impact factor use in hiring and promotion decisions, signed by hundreds of organizations. Major publishers like Springer Nature and Elsevier began downplaying impact factors on their websites, though they still prominently displayed them.

**The Luxury Journals Persisted**: Despite the criticism, Nature, Science, and Cell maintained their premier status in academic hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. No mass boycott materialized among scientists. The journals made some concessions - publishing more papers, increasing transparency - but their business models and prestige remained intact. Faculty hiring committees continued to heavily weight publication in these venues.

**New Publishing Models Emerged**: Preprint servers like bioRxiv (launched 2013) grew dramatically, allowing rapid dissemination without journal gatekeeping. However, preprints didn't eliminate the status hierarchy - they became a supplement rather than replacement for traditional publication.

**Practical Impact Mixed**: While awareness of the problems increased, concrete changes in academic evaluation remained limited. Some institutions modified tenure guidelines to emphasize article quality over journal title, but the luxury journals still dominated CVs of successful job candidates. The fundamental incentives Schekman criticized persisted largely unchanged.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several implicit predictions about how academic publishing might evolve:

• **That Schekman's boycott might catalyze broader change**: This partially materialized - awareness increased and some reforms occurred, but no widespread boycott happened. The luxury journals retained their dominance.
• **That impact factors would be increasingly recognized as problematic**: This proved correct - by 2016-2018, major scientific organizations formally condemned impact factor use, though the metric's influence persisted.
• **That open access alternatives like eLife would gain prominence**: Partially true - eLife became respected, but it didn't displace the luxury journals in perceived prestige or influence on careers.
• **That the current system distorts scientific incentives**: This criticism gained broader acceptance, though the underlying incentive structures remained largely unchanged in practice.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/10**

This article highlighted a persistent structural problem in academic science that remains relevant. While it didn't catalyze the revolution some hoped for, it captured a moment when longstanding concerns about scientific publishing reached mainstream awareness, leading to meaningful (if incomplete) reforms.
