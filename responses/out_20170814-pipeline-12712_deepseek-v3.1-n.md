# Blogging Break (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a short personal blog post from August 2017 in which the author announces they are taking a vacation break from blogging. The author plans to travel with family and hopes to view a total solar eclipse, while joking about the possibility of bad weather interfering. The post includes a brief update addressing then-President Trump's Twitter comments about Merck and Ken Frazier (Merck's CEO at the time), noting the author's established critical views of Trump but deciding not to engage with the controversy while on vacation. The post is primarily a notice of temporary blogging hiatus rather than a substantive industry analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

This was not a commentary article about biotechnology - it was a personal vacation notice from a science blogger. However, some context around the Merck/Frazier incident mentioned in the update is relevant:

Ken Frazier, as Merck's CEO, had resigned from President Trump's American Manufacturing Council in August 2017 following the Charlottesville "Unite the Right" rally and Trump's controversial response. Trump subsequently criticized Frazier on Twitter. Frazier remained CEO of Merck until 2021, leading the company through significant developments including Merck's substantial COVID-19 treatment research efforts and the acquisition of Acceleron Pharma for $11.5 billion in 2021.

The eclipse referenced (August 21, 2017) did occur as a total solar eclipse visible across much of the United States, though I cannot verify whether this particular blogger successfully viewed it.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained no predictions about biotechnology or any substantive industry analysis. It was purely a personal announcement about taking time off from blogging.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **1/10**

This post has minimal relevance as it contains no analysis or commentary about biotechnology. It is a personal vacation announcement with a brief political aside, making it unsuitable for the type of retrospective analysis requested in the prompt template that focuses on biotech industry developments, predictions, and real-world impacts.

*Note: This appears to be a meta-blogging post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog rather than a substantive biotechnology commentary article, which explains its low relevance for retrospective industry analysis.*
