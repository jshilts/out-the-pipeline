# J&J and Novavax Data (January 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes newly released COVID-19 vaccine efficacy data from Novavax and Johnson & Johnson from January 2021. The Novavax recombinant protein vaccine showed 89% efficacy in UK trials (with ~50% of cases being the B.1.1.7 variant) but only ~50% efficacy in South Africa where the B.1.351 variant dominated. Johnson & Johnson's single-dose adenovirus vector vaccine demonstrated 72% efficacy in North America, 66% in Latin America, and 57% in South Africa - with the lower South African numbers attributed to B.1.351. Both vaccines showed no significant safety signals.

The author notes that while these efficacy numbers are lower than the 95%+ seen with mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech), the J&J vaccine showed 85% effectiveness at preventing severe disease requiring hospitalization and completely prevented COVID deaths in the vaccinated group. A key consideration is that mRNA vaccine trials occurred before variant spread, so their real-world performance against variants like B.1.351 remained uncertain.

The article highlights logistical advantages: non-mRNA vaccines (J&J, Novavax, AstraZeneca) don't require ultra-cold storage and can reach areas with limited infrastructure, plus they use different manufacturing processes enabling parallel production scale-up. The author also discusses the potential for vaccine updates against variants, suggesting mRNA and protein vaccines may adapt more easily than viral-vector platforms.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the January 2021 data, both vaccines progressed through regulatory approval and real-world deployment, though with notably different trajectories.

**Johnson & Johnson (Janssen):**
The FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization to the J&J vaccine on February 27, 2021, making it the third COVID-19 vaccine available in the U.S. The single-dose regimen and standard refrigeration storage (36-46°F for 3 months) made it logistically attractive for mass vaccination campaigns and hard-to-reach populations. However, manufacturing challenges plagued the company throughout 2021, with multiple production facility issues and quality control problems limiting supply. More critically, in April 2021, reports of rare but serious blood clotting events (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome) prompted temporary pauses and ultimately led to label warnings, recommendations for alternatives in certain populations, and reduced uptake. By 2022, the J&J vaccine had been largely supplanted by mRNA vaccines in many countries, though it continued to see use in lower-resource settings due to its logistical advantages. The U.S. CDC largely shifted recommendations away from J&J in favor of mRNA vaccines.

**Novavax:**
Novavax faced prolonged regulatory delays and manufacturing hurdles throughout 2021. The company struggled with production scale-up and quality consistency, failing to meet delivery commitments. The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (branded as Covovax when produced by Serum Institute of India) received its first emergency authorization in Indonesia in November 2021 and WHO Emergency Use Listing in December 2021. The FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization much later - on July 13, 2022, making it the fourth COVID-19 vaccine available in the U.S. By this time, much of the U.S. population was already vaccinated or had been exposed to COVID-19. The vaccine found use in individuals allergic to mRNA vaccine components or those avoiding mRNA technology, but represented a small fraction of vaccinations. It did see broader adoption in countries seeking alternatives to viral vector vaccines due to safety concerns or as boosters.

**Variant Evolution:**
The B.1.351 variant discussed in the article (first identified in South Africa) largely disappeared as subsequent variants including Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) became dominant. These newer variants further reduced efficacy across all vaccines, leading to recommendations for boosters and updated vaccine formulations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and strategic assessments:

• **Prediction**: The J&J vaccine would play a role in beating back the pandemic, especially in areas with less infrastructure due to its single-dose regimen and less demanding cold chain requirements.
- **Outcome**: **Mostly correct**. J&J did get deployed globally and was valuable in low-resource settings, though manufacturing issues, safety concerns, and reduced effectiveness against variants limited its ultimate impact. It saved lives but never achieved the widespread adoption initially hoped for.

• **Prediction**: Non-mRNA vaccines would have greater penetration into areas with poor infrastructure due to easier cold chain requirements.
- **Outcome**: **Correct**. This remained true throughout the pandemic, with viral vector and protein subunit vaccines seeing greater use in middle- and lower-income countries despite the challenge that mRNA vaccines could also be stored at higher temperatures for shorter periods after thawing.

• **Prediction**: Different manufacturing processes would enable scaling multiple vaccines simultaneously rather than creating a "zero-sum cage match."
- **Outcome**: **Mostly correct with complications**. While different manufacturing did enable some parallelization, the reality proved more complex. Supply chain bottlenecks for raw materials, vials, and other components affected all vaccines. Novavax struggled for months with manufacturing consistency, and J&J faced significant production issues requiring third-party oversight, demonstrating that manufacturing complexity remained a barrier regardless of platform diversity.

• **Prediction**: The need for vaccine updates against variants, with mRNA and protein vaccines being easier to retool than viral-vector platforms.
- **Outcome**: **Partially correct in practice**. All platforms showed they could be updated, some more readily than others. However, the regulatory framework remained the main bottleneck for variant-updated boosters, requiring full trial data rather than the streamlined seasonal flu vaccine approach mentioned in the article. B.1.351 largely disappeared before updated vaccines reached widespread use, and subsequent Omicron subvariants drove the need for bivalent and updated boosters later, especially with mRNA platforms most quickly adaptable and produced at scale.

• **Implied prediction**: Lower efficacy numbers like 50-60% against certain variants would still provide important public health benefits by preventing severe disease and death.
- **Outcome**: **Correct**. This became a crucial insight: absolute efficacy against PCR-positive infection decreased with variants, but protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death proved more durable, driving public health value of all authorized vaccines even with waning efficacy against mild breakthrough infections.

• **Prediction**: The B.1.351 variant and future variants would continue pushing efficacy numbers down, creating an ongoing arms race.
- **Outcome**: **Correct**. Successive variants notably Delta, Omicron, and subvariants progressively reduced vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection, though protection against severe outcomes remained relatively robust and led to recommendations for boosters/updated vaccines.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article is fairly interesting for its contemporary analysis of what were then newly emerging vaccine platforms and variant impacts, capturing a moment when it became clear that high efficacy against ancestral strains wouldn't guarantee the same performance against variants. It represents a sober turning point recognizing that vaccine effectiveness needed evaluation against both infection and severe disease, a perspective that became central to public health strategy. While much of the technical content remains relevant, later developments with variant escape and vaccine updates largely followed the trajectories outlined here, limiting its retrospective insight value.
