# The Cost to Develop a Drug: Your Own Numbers? (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary notes that Bruce Booth, a partner at the Cambridge‑based venture firm Atlas Venture, has posted an online form inviting anyone who has actually worked on drug development to submit their own estimate of the total cost of bringing a new medicine to market. Booth’s motivation is to challenge the widely cited “Light and Warburton” figure (roughly $1 billion‑plus, later inflated to $2–3 billion when capital costs are included) by crowdsourcing “real‑world” numbers from practitioners. The author suggests that such a bottom‑up approach could produce a more realistic benchmark for investors and policymakers.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 research on drug‑development cost**  
- **Light & Warburton (2011)** originally estimated a pre‑tax out‑of‑pocket cost of about **$1 billion**; when the cost of capital is added the figure rises to **$2.6 billion**.  
- **DiMasi et al. (2016, 2020)** from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development repeatedly published updated estimates that hover around **$2.5–$2.8 billion** (including risk‑adjusted capital). Their methodology still relies on industry surveys and financial modeling rather than crowdsourced practitioner data.  
- **Critiques and lower‑bound studies** – a 2018 analysis by the Center for Medicines Research (CMR) using publicly disclosed R&D spend and success rates argued for a **median out‑of‑pocket cost of ≈$1.3 billion**, suggesting the capital‑cost component may be overstated.  
- **Industry spending trends** – despite the debate, total U.S. biotech R&D expenditure has continued to climb, reaching **≈$200 billion** annually by 2023, with the number of FDA‑approved NMEs (new molecular entities) staying in the 30‑50 range per year.  

**Impact of Booth’s crowdsourcing effort**  
- The Atlas Venture form received limited public attention; there is no evidence it generated a widely accepted dataset or altered industry cost estimates.  
- Venture‑capital (VC) funding for biotech has nonetheless surged since 2011, with median early‑stage rounds rising from **≈$10 M** (2011) to **≈$30 M** (2022). The “cost‑to‑develop” figure remains a reference point in pitch decks, but investors now tend to focus on **milestone‑based financing** and **portfolio risk** rather than a single aggregate cost number.  

**Policy and regulatory outcomes**  
- The high‑cost narrative has been used in discussions about **drug pricing reform** (e.g., the 2016 “Blueprint for Reform” and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act). However, no specific policy was enacted directly because of Booth’s crowdsourcing initiative.  
- The FDA’s **Breakthrough Therapy** and **Accelerated Approval** pathways, expanded in the 2010s, have modestly shortened development timelines for certain products, but the overall cost per approved drug has not shown a decisive drop in the published estimates.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Crowdsourced practitioner estimates will produce a lower, more realistic cost figure than the Light & Warburton number.*  
  - **Outcome:** The crowdsourced data never achieved enough breadth to replace the established academic/industry surveys. Subsequent independent studies still cite the $2–3 billion range, though a minority of analyses argue for lower out‑of‑pocket costs (~$1.3 billion). The specific “choose‑your‑own‑numbers” effort did not shift the consensus.

- **Prediction 2:** *A more accurate cost estimate will influence VC investment decisions and possibly temper the hype around biotech valuations.*  
  - **Outcome:** VC activity in biotech has accelerated dramatically since 2011, with larger fund sizes and higher valuations, despite the persistent high‑cost narrative. Investors now incorporate **risk‑adjusted portfolio models** and **milestone financing** rather than relying on a single cost figure, so Booth’s initiative had negligible direct effect on capital allocation.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The piece is a brief snapshot of an early‑2010s debate on drug‑development economics; it is historically useful but did not spark lasting change or generate a notable dataset.
