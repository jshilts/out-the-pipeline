# Getting Around to Reporting Clinical Data, Real Soon Now (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary by Derek Lowe examines clinical trial results reporting compliance following the 2017 Final Rule that mandated results disclosure on ClinicalTrials.gov. The article analyzes 4,700 trials that should have reported under the law by January 2020, two years after penalty provisions went into effect.

The key findings: while disclosure rates improved overall, enforcement appeared nonexistent. Academic institutions showed particularly poor compliance—M.D. Anderson, Mayo Clinic, and UCSF had the majority of their eligible trials reported late or not at all. The University of Virginia was about nine months behind on average, Yale reported only 3 of 19 trials on time. Even federal agencies struggled, with most NIH institutes reporting less than half their trials on time.

Remarkably, biopharma industry showed the strongest compliance, with several companies having perfect reporting records. Only one pharmaceutical company (Sanofi) had unreported trials, and the worst-performing pharma company (Teva) still outperformed most academic institutions. This contrasted with the common narrative that drug companies bury unfavorable trial results while being more transparent than academic and government research organizations.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2020, clinical trial transparency has continued evolving with mixed progress:

**Regulatory Developments:**
- The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative and other stakeholders maintained pressure for improved reporting
- FDA began more systematic enforcement through warning letters and potential funding restrictions
- Expanded requirements included posting results for trials of unapproved products and expanded data elements

**Enforcement Actions:**
Multiple institutions received FDA warning letters for non-compliance:
- September 2020: FDA issued warning letters to several institutions for failure to submit required trial results
- FDA began citing non-compliance in inspection findings with potential funding implications
- Gradual increase in compliance rates across all sectors, though academic institutions continued lagging industry

**Ongoing Challenges:**
- Studies published in 2021-2023 continued showing significant reporting gaps, particularly for academic trials
- The COVID-19 pandemic both highlighted the importance of trial transparency (through rapid sharing of vaccine/ treatment data) and potentially disrupted routine compliance
- International harmonization efforts progressed, including alignment with EU requirements

**Impact on Drug Development:**
- The transparency emphasis contributed to faster sharing of COVID-19 trial results
- Increased public and researcher access to trial data, enabling meta-analyses and preventing duplication
- Some evidence suggests improved reporting may have contributed to better research prioritization

**Industry vs. Academic Gap:**
Studies through 2023 generally confirmed Lowe's observation—industry continued showing better compliance rates than academic institutions, though overall rates improved across sectors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction (implicit):** Enforcement would remain weak, and compliance improvements might not persist without stronger accountability.

**Actual Outcome:** Partial validation. FDA did begin issuing warning letters and systematic compliance letters starting in 2020, representing some enforcement escalation. However, fundamental structural issues persisted—the gap between industry and academic compliance continued through 2023, suggesting that stronger enforcement didn't eliminate the reporting culture differences between sectors.

**Prediction (implicit):** The new FDA commissioner (former M.D. Anderson CMO) might not significantly improve compliance given the institution's poor reporting record.

**Actual Outcome:** Mixed. While comprehensive sector-wide improvement remained incremental, some previously poor-performing institutions did show improvement. The broader policy direction continued emphasizing transparency, but systematic compliance improvement proved slower than advocates hoped.

**Broader Mechanism Impact:** The prediction that weak enforcement would undermine compliance improvements proved partially correct—while overall compliance rates gradually improved, the gap between compliant and non-compliant institutions persisted, and full universal compliance remained elusive through 2023.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article addresses a persistent, systemic issue in clinical research that affects evidence-based medicine, research efficiency, and public trust. The counterintuitive finding about industry outperforming academia on transparency makes it more valuable than a simple compliance audit, highlighting structural differences in accountability and incentives between sectors.
