# Innovation and Return (Europe vs. the US) (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery commentary examined why pharmaceutical productivity had been falling. Using a database of ≈ 18 000 drug projects launched between 1990 and 2007, the authors reported three main findings:  

1. **Rising attrition** – failure rates increased at every stage of development, especially in Phase III trials.  
2. **Shift toward riskier biology** – companies were allocating more money and time to targets with historically low success probabilities (oncology, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, arthritis) and less to “safer” areas such as cardiovascular disease and HIV. The authors argued that the higher expected rewards of breakthrough therapies were being outweighed by the higher failure risk.  
3. **Geography of risk** – after controlling for portfolio composition, European and U.S. organizations showed similar success rates, but U.S. firms pursued riskier, first‑in‑class projects more often and therefore earned higher price premiums when successful. The piece concluded that “we’re in trouble for innovating too much,” because payers reward incremental (“me‑too”) drugs less, pushing R&D toward high‑uncertainty targets that drive higher attrition.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Attrition trends (2011‑2025)**  
- Phase‑III failure rates have remained high (≈ 50‑60 % across therapeutic areas) and, in some sectors (oncology, neuro‑degeneration), have even risen modestly.  
- Overall “productivity” measured as NMEs per $1 billion R&D spend has continued to decline, prompting industry‑wide “R&D efficiency” initiatives (adaptive trial designs, biomarkers, AI‑driven target validation).  

**Therapeutic focus outcomes**  
- **Oncology**: The risk‑heavy strategy paid off in volume. Between 2011 and 2025, > 150 oncology NMEs received FDA approval, including many checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and CAR‑T cell products (Kymriah 2017, Yescarta 2017). However, the average success probability for oncology programs stayed below 10 % from pre‑clinical to launch.  
- **Neuro‑degeneration**: The “high‑risk” focus largely failed to deliver durable breakthroughs. Aducanumab (2021) received accelerated approval but was later withdrawn from the market (2022) after post‑marketing data failed to confirm clinical benefit. Lecanemab (2023) achieved conditional approval for early Alzheimer’s, but uptake has been limited by cost and payer restrictions. Overall, only two disease‑modifying Alzheimer’s agents have reached the market since 2011, far below expectations.  
- **Cardiovascular**: The “safer” area did not disappear. PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab) were approved in 2015‑2016, providing a high‑impact, first‑in‑class therapy for hypercholesterolemia. More recently, inclisiran (2023) and bempedoic acid (2020) expanded the cardiovascular pipeline, showing that the sector still yields profitable launches.  
- **HIV**: Long‑acting injectable regimens (cabotegravir/rilpivirine, 2021) entered the market, confirming that incremental innovation can still be commercially successful when paired with differentiated delivery.  

**U.S. vs. European R&D**  
- The United States has maintained a larger share of global biotech financing (≈ 70 % of venture capital in 2024) and continues to dominate first‑in‑class approvals.  
- European firms have narrowed the gap through increased collaboration with U.S. partners and the rise of “Euro‑centric” biotech hubs (e.g., Cambridge, UK; Basel, Switzerland). The European Medicines Agency’s harmonized regulatory pathway (EU‑CPMP) has helped reduce time‑to‑market, but price‑control policies (reference pricing, HTA) keep premiums lower than in the U.S.  
- By 2025, the success‑rate gap reported in the 2011 paper remained statistically insignificant after adjusting for portfolio mix, confirming the authors’ original conclusion.  

**Policy and payer influence**  
- Many European countries tightened reference‑pricing and HTA thresholds, reinforcing the article’s claim that “incremental innovation” is financially discouraged.  
- In the U.S., the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and subsequent FDA guidances encouraged accelerated pathways, but the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced price‑negotiation provisions for certain high‑cost drugs, nudging companies toward truly differentiated products.  

**Business outcomes**  
- Large pharma’s R&D spend grew from ≈ $100 bn (2011) to > $150 bn (2024) but the number of NMEs launched per $10 bn spent fell from ~ 2.5 to ~ 1.2.  
- Several “risk‑heavy” biotech firms (e.g., Alnylam, Moderna) succeeded by leveraging novel modalities (RNAi, mRNA) that were still considered high‑risk in 2011. Their success has spurred a wave of platform‑centric companies, partially offsetting the overall productivity decline.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several forward‑looking statements. Below is a bullet‑point assessment of each, based on the record up to January 2026.

- **Prediction:** *Attrition rates will continue to rise, especially in Phase III.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely correct. Phase‑III failure rates have stayed high (≈ 55 % overall) and have risen modestly in oncology and neuro‑degeneration.  

- **Prediction:** *Companies focusing on “novel” targets will experience higher failure but, when successful, will earn higher price premiums.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. First‑in‑class oncology and rare‑disease drugs (e.g., CAR‑T, gene therapies) have commanded premium pricing, but many novel neuro‑degenerative programs have failed without delivering any premium.  

- **Prediction:** *European firms will not lag behind U.S. firms once portfolio composition is accounted for.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Adjusted success rates are statistically indistinguishable; the main difference remains the higher proportion of U.S. “risk‑taking” projects.  

- **Prediction:** *Payers’ discouragement of “me‑too” drugs will push R&D toward high‑uncertainty, first‑in‑class projects, which in turn drives the productivity decline.*  
  **Outcome:** Mixed. Payer pressure did shift some pipelines toward novel mechanisms, but “me‑too” drugs still dominate many therapeutic classes (e.g., statins, SGLT2 inhibitors). The productivity decline is now attributed to a broader set of factors (regulatory complexity, trial design, pricing pressure), not solely to the “innovation‑too‑much” effect.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *The shift away from cardiovascular and HIV toward oncology/neurology would be sustained.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. Oncology’s share of R&D budgets grew from ~ 30 % (2010) to ~ 45 % (2024). Cardiovascular R&D share rebounded modestly after 2015 due to PCSK9 and novel anti‑thrombotic agents, but it remains lower than pre‑2010 levels. HIV R&D stayed relatively flat, with a focus on long‑acting formulations rather than novel targets.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in pharma‑industry analysis, correctly identifying rising attrition and the strategic shift toward high‑risk biology—issues that continue to shape R&D today. Its geographic comparison remains relevant, though some of its causal claims (innovation as the primary driver of productivity loss) have been nuanced by later research.
