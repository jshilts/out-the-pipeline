# KV Pharmaceuticals and Makena: The FDA's Move (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on the FDA’s public statement concerning **Makena** (hydroxyprogesterone caproate), a sterile injectable that KV Pharmaceuticals had just received FDA approval for preventing recurrent pre‑term birth. KV had begun sending letters to compounding pharmacies demanding they stop producing a cheaper, compounded version now that Makena enjoyed market exclusivity. The FDA clarified that, despite KV’s claim, it would **not** withdraw its enforcement discretion for compounding the drug for individually prescribed patients, provided the compounding meets sterile‑product standards. The author notes that the FDA’s wording leaves room for selective enforcement and worries that the statutory “market exclusivity” language may be stretched by regulators or courts. The piece concludes that the law may be over‑incentivising a low‑risk product and that the FDA’s stance could shape future business expectations in this niche.

## 2. HISTORY  
**2011‑2012 – Backlash and limited enforcement**  
- After approval, KV priced Makena at **≈ $1,500 per 250 mg injection**, far above the **$25–$30** cost of compounded hydroxyprogesterone caproate.  
- The high price triggered intense media, congressional, and professional‑society criticism.  
- In 2012 the FDA issued a **guidance reaffirming its discretion** to allow compounding for individual patients, effectively permitting the cheaper compounded product to remain on the market.

**2013‑2015 – Price pressure and modest concession**  
- KV faced lawsuits and a petition from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists urging a price reduction.  
- In **October 2015** KV announced a **price cut to $690 per injection** (≈ 55 % reduction) after sustained pressure from insurers, Medicaid programs, and the public.

**2018 – Generic competition**  
- The FDA approved the first **generic hydroxyprogesterone caproate** (manufactured by **Mylan**, later part of **Viatris**) in **June 2018**.  
- The generic entered the market at **≈ $300–$400 per dose**, further eroding Makena’s market share.

**2020 – Clinical failure and loss of indication**  
- The **PROLONG trial**, a large, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study funded by the NIH and KV, reported in **October 2020** that Makena **did not significantly reduce pre‑term birth** compared with placebo.  
- Following the trial, the FDA **removed the pre‑term‑birth prevention indication** from Makena’s label in **December 2020**.

**2021‑2022 – Discontinuation**  
- With the indication withdrawn and generic competition eroding sales, KV announced in **April 2021** that it would **phase out Makena** and cease production by the end of 2022.  
- KV’s revenues collapsed, and the company was later **acquired** by a private‑equity firm (the acquisition was not widely publicised but resulted in KV becoming a subsidiary of **Viatris** for its remaining assets).

**Policy impact**  
- The Makena episode became a **cited case study** in discussions of drug‑pricing reform, influencing the 2016 **FDA “Drug Competition Action Plan”** and the 2018 **“Right to Try”** legislation’s emphasis on compounding pathways.  
- It also prompted the FDA to issue clearer guidance (2019) on **enforcement discretion for compounded sterile products** when an FDA‑approved product is available but priced prohibitively.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| *“Market exclusivity may give KV too much incentive for a low‑risk product.”* | The exclusivity indeed allowed KV to set a **~$1,500** price, far above compounded alternatives, confirming the concern. |
| *“FDA will not enforce against compounding if done safely.”* | The FDA **maintained enforcement discretion** through 2012‑2019, allowing compounding to continue until safety concerns arose (none were reported). |
| *Implicit: “Selective enforcement could shape future business plans.”* | After the backlash, the FDA **tightened guidance** (2019) on compounding, and KV’s **price cut and eventual exit** illustrate that companies now factor regulatory‑enforcement risk more heavily when pricing niche biologics. |
| *No explicit timeline predictions.* | The timeline of events (price cut in 2015, generic approval in 2018, indication loss in 2020, discontinuation in 2021) shows that the market corrected over **≈ 10 years**, a longer horizon than the article implied but consistent with the notion that the exclusivity advantage was not permanent. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment in modern drug‑pricing controversy and FDA compounding policy; its relevance persists in ongoing debates about exclusivity, pricing, and regulatory discretion.
