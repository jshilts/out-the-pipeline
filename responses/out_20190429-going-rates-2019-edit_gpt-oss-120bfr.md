# The Going Rates, 2019 Edition (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post is a follow‑up to a 2014 informal “salary survey” of biopharma professionals.  The author asks readers to self‑report their compensation, together with experience level, scientific discipline (e.g., discovery chemistry, clinical development, data science), and geographic region.  The goal is to generate a rough, crowd‑sourced benchmark of what people in the Boston/Cambridge corridor—and elsewhere—were earning in 2019, spanning entry‑level post‑doc positions up through senior consulting roles.  The author explicitly notes that the data are anecdotal, not a controlled study, but that the previous 2014 exercise proved useful for gauging market expectations.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 salary trends in biotech/pharma**

| Period | Main drivers | Observed impact on compensation |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **Late 2019 – early 2020** | Strong hiring before COVID‑19; low unemployment; continued venture‑capital inflow. | Salaries were already rising 3‑5 % YoY versus 2018, especially for data‑science and AI‑focused roles. |
| **2020 (COVID‑19 pandemic)** | Hiring freezes at many large pharma; shift to remote work; increased demand for vaccine‑related R&D. | Overall hiring slowed, but compensation for senior scientists and clinical‑trial staff in vaccine programs saw modest bumps (+2‑4 %). Entry‑level post‑doc salaries were largely flat. |
| **2021 – 2023 (Biotech boom)** | Massive VC funding (US $150 bn+ in 2021), high‑profile IPOs (e.g., Moderna, BioNTech), talent shortage in AI/ML and cell‑therapy. | Base salaries for senior scientists rose 8‑12 % (e.g., $150‑180 k for senior chemists in Boston). Total‑comp packages (sign‑on bonuses, RSUs) for senior managers and consultants often exceeded $250 k. Remote‑work flexibility reduced the “Boston premium” for some roles, but demand for on‑site wet‑lab expertise kept regional differentials. |
| **2022 – 2024 (Market correction & inflation)** | Inflation peaked at ~7 % (U.S.), some biotech IPOs under‑performed, hiring slowed modestly. | Companies introduced cost‑of‑living adjustments (≈3‑5 % in high‑cost metros). Base salaries continued modest growth, but a larger share of compensation shifted to performance‑based bonuses and equity. |
| **2024 onward** | Growing emphasis on decentralized clinical trials, AI‑driven drug discovery, and sustainability. | Emerging roles (e.g., computational biologist, digital health product manager) command 10‑15 % higher base salaries than comparable 2019 levels. |

**Concrete outcomes**

* **Industry salary surveys** – Biospace, BioSpace Salary Survey (2022, 2023) and the annual *Nature Biotechnology* “Biotech Salary Survey” confirm the upward trend described above, with median total compensation for senior scientists in Boston moving from ≈$180 k (2019) to ≈$210 k (2023).  
* **Geographic shifts** – The pandemic accelerated remote‑work acceptance; many companies opened satellite offices in lower‑cost cities (e.g., Raleigh, Austin). Salary differentials between Boston and these hubs narrowed by ~15 % by 2023.  
* **Consulting** – Large consulting firms (e.g., McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte) and boutique life‑science consultancies continued to pay premium rates. Senior consultants in biotech practice saw base salaries rise from $130‑150 k (2019) to $155‑180 k (2023), with bonuses often exceeding 30 % of base.  
* **Equity** – The boom‑and‑bust cycle of 2021‑2022 increased the proportion of total compensation coming from stock options/RSUs. Employees who joined high‑growth startups in 2020‑2021 realized sizable upside (e.g., 5‑10 × returns on pre‑IPO equity for several 2021 IPOs). Conversely, those who joined later (2022‑2023) faced more modest equity appreciation.  

Overall, the 2019 crowdsourced snapshot proved useful as a baseline; the subsequent five years have shown consistent salary growth, especially for senior and data‑intensive roles, while geographic premiums have softened.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original post did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied that salaries would continue to rise and that geographic differences might be informative.  The implied predictions and how they panned out are:

- **Prediction:** *Biotech salaries will keep climbing, reflecting strong venture capital and talent demand.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely correct.  From 2019 to 2023, median base salaries for senior scientists rose 10‑15 % and total compensation rose 20‑30 % when equity is included.  The growth slowed in 2022‑2023 as inflation and market correction set in, but the upward trajectory remained.

- **Prediction:** *Boston/Cambridge will retain a premium due to concentration of biotech firms.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct.  Boston still commands a premium (≈$10‑15 k higher base for comparable roles), but remote‑work and satellite hubs have eroded the gap by ~15 % compared with 2019.

- **Prediction:** *Consulting salaries will stay high relative to industry bench‑marks.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  Consulting compensation continued to outpace pure‑R&D salaries, driven by performance bonuses and higher base pay.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The informal survey model would remain valuable for community insight.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  Subsequent informal surveys (e.g., 2022 “Going Rates” thread on the same blog, and community‑driven posts on Reddit’s r/biotech) have been cited by recruiters and HR teams as quick market checks.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The post is a useful historical data point for salary benchmarking and illustrates community‑driven information sharing, but it lacks deep analysis or novel scientific content, limiting its broader long‑term significance.
