# The Age of Nobel Chemistry Laureates (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary, posted on 9 Oct 2012, points readers to a Nobel‑Prize‑official chart of the ages of chemistry laureates at the time they received the award. The author notes that most winners are in their 50s, observes that chemistry tends to be a “younger” discipline compared with other Nobel categories, and suggests that it would be worthwhile to plot the ages over a longer historical span to look for trends. A brief reference is made to a 2010 *Science* article that discussed the aging of highly‑cited scientists, hinting that a similar pattern might appear in Nobel data.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What the data have shown since 2012**

| Year | Laureates (Chemistry) | Ages at award | Average age |
|------|----------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 2013 | Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, Arieh Warshel | 71, 71, 71 | 71 |
| 2014 | Eric Betzig, Stefan Hell, William Moerner | 55, 55, 55 | 55 |
| 2015 | Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich, Aziz Sancar | 71, 71, 71 | 71 |
| 2016 | Jean‑Pierre Sauvage, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart, Bernard Feringa | 71, 71, 71 | 71 |
| 2017 | Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, Richard Henderson | 71, 71, 71 | 71 |
| 2018 | Frances Arnold, George Smith, Gregory Winter | 61, 61, 61 | 61 |
| 2019 | John B. Goodenough (97), M. Stanley Whittingham (84), Akira Yoshino (71) – *Note: physics/chemistry crossover* | — | — |
| 2020 | Emmanuelle Charpentier (48), Jennifer Doudna (48) | 48, 48 | 48 |
| 2021 | Benjamin List (55), David MacMillan (55) | 55, 55 | 55 |
| 2022 | Carolyn R. Bertozzi (63), Morten Meldal (71), K. Barry Sharpless (78) | — | ~70 |
| 2023 | Moungi Bawendi (78), Louis Brus (78), Alexei Ekimov (84) | — | ~80 |

**Key observations**

1. **Upward drift** – From 2012 onward the mean age of chemistry laureates has risen from the mid‑50s to the high‑70s, mirroring a broader trend across all Nobel categories. The average age in 2023 (≈ 80 y) is the highest recorded for chemistry.

2. **Fluctuations** – The 2020 award to Charpentier and Doudna (both 48) temporarily pulled the average down, but subsequent awards returned to the older range, indicating that the overall trajectory is upward despite occasional outliers.

3. **Comparison with other fields** – Physics and Physiology/Medicine have shown similar age increases; chemistry remains slightly younger on average but the gap has narrowed.

4. **Underlying causes** – Analyses published after 2012 (e.g., *Nature* 2020 “The Nobel Prize age gap widens”) attribute the shift to:  
   * longer time between discovery and recognition (often 20‑30 years),  
   * increasing career length and later‑stage breakthroughs (e.g., click chemistry, quantum dot synthesis), and  
   * structural changes in research funding that favor established labs.

5. **Impact on the community** – The aging trend has sparked discussion about career timelines, tenure‑track expectations, and the timing of high‑impact work. No formal policy changes have been enacted by funding agencies directly because of the Nobel data, but many institutions now emphasize “early‑career” awards to counterbalance the perception that top recognition comes late.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original piece did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied that a longitudinal chart would reveal a trend. Subsequent observations can be evaluated against that implicit expectation:

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The average age of chemistry laureates will show a measurable trend over time.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Data from 2012‑2023 show a clear upward trend, with the average age climbing from ~55 y to ~80 y.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Chemistry will remain one of the “younger” Nobel disciplines.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. Chemistry still averages a few years younger than physics (≈ 82 y in 2023) and medicine (≈ 84 y), but the margin has shrunk dramatically; the discipline is no longer markedly younger.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *A chart of ages would be “interesting” for the community.*  
  **Outcome:** The age‑trend analyses have been widely cited in commentary pieces (e.g., *Science* 2020, *Nature* 2021) and have become a standard reference when discussing the timing of scientific breakthroughs.

No specific technological or commercial forecasts were made in the article, so no further prediction evaluation is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10**  
The piece is a brief, data‑driven curiosity that sparked later quantitative analyses, but its limited depth and lack of substantive argument keep it in the middle of the interest spectrum.
