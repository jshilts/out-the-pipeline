# Curse Of the Lost Compounds (December 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses two functional groups in medicinal chemistry that show potent in vitro activity but have struggled to become successful drugs: trifluoromethyl ketones and hydroxamic acids. 

Trifluoromethyl ketones are described as effective serine protease inhibitors due to their ability to form reversible covalent adducts with active-site serine residues, also showing activity against other enzymes like lipases and esterases. Despite extensive literature and some clinical attempts, the author notes that none had reached the market by 2008, possibly due to target selection issues rather than problems with the functional group itself.

Hydroxamic acids are presented as excellent zinc-binding groups, particularly effective against metalloproteases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). However, they face multiple challenges including manufacturing difficulties, poor pharmacokinetics in animal models, toxicity concerns, and metabolic liabilities related to iron coordination. The lone success story mentioned is SAHA (vorinostat/Zolinza), approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in 2006 - though the author notes cancer therapeutics face lower safety bars than chronic medications.

## 2. HISTORY

**Trifluoromethyl Ketones:** My knowledge about specific trifluoromethyl ketone drugs that reached approval after 2008 is limited. For context, there are general concerns about reactive carbonyl groups in drug design due to potential off-target reactivity and metabolic instability. The article's observation about target selection may have been prescient - many serine proteases pursued as drug targets in the 1990s-2000s ultimately failed in clinical trials for reasons unrelated to the chemical matter. Without access to current databases, I cannot confidently state whether any trifluoromethyl ketone-based drugs achieved FDA approval in the 2010s or beyond.

**Hydroxamic Acids:** This functional group has seen broader success, though with important caveats. Vorinostat remained on the market for CTCL with modest commercial success. Several other HDAC inhibitors reached approval: panobinostat (Farydak) for multiple myeloma in 2015 (though with significant safety warnings and limited use), and belinostat (Beleodaq) for peripheral T-cell lymphoma in 2014. These approvals validated hydroxamic acids as viable zinc-binding pharmacophores in oncology. However, concerns about iron chelation and potential genotoxicity have continued to limit their application outside cancer. In recent years, medicinal chemistry has increasingly sought alternative zinc-binding groups to avoid hydroxamic acid liabilities.

**Broader Context:** The general trend toward more stringent safety assessment in early drug discovery, particularly around reactive metabolites and off-target effects, may have reinforced the challenges both functional groups faced.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"perhaps the trifluoromethyl ketone awaits its day in the sun"** - I have limited confidence about whether this materialized. The general trend in medicinal chemistry has moved away from highly electrophilic/reactive groups due to selectivity concerns, though target-guided applications might still exist.

- **"we probably haven't seen the last of this functional group [hydroxamic acid]"** - This proved accurate. Multiple hydroxamic acid-containing HDAC inhibitors achieved FDA approval after 2008 (as noted above), though primarily in oncology where risk-benefit ratios are more permissive.

- **Implicit prediction about target biology trumping compound properties** - The suggestion that target selection rather than functional group issues doomed early attempts likely contained truth, as target validation failures (rather than tool compound liabilities) remain a major cause of clinical attrition.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses enduring challenges in medicinal chemistry with realistic assessment of functional group liabilities, avoiding both excessive pessimism and hype. It captures a specific moment when early optimism about certain chemical matter was meeting clinical reality. The core tension between in vitro potency and in vivo drug-likeness remains highly relevant to contemporary drug discovery.

The moderate score reflects that while the topic is important, the analysis remains at a functional-group level without deeper mechanistic exploration of why specific targets failed or how to prospectively identify doomed approaches.
