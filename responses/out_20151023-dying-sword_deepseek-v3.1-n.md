# Dying By the Sword (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 commentary analyzes the pharmaceutical industry business model of acquiring existing drugs and dramatically increasing their prices—pioneered by Turing Pharmaceuticals (led by Martin Shkreli) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The article focuses on Daraprim (pyrimethamine), an antiparasitic drug whose price Turing increased from $13.50 to $750 per pill (a 5,000% hike). It describes how Imprimis Pharmaceuticals responded by making compounded versions available at approximately $1 per pill, using existing legal compounding pharmacy pathways.

The piece also examines broader industry dynamics, including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) trade group distancing itself from such companies, characterizing them as "hedge fund" operations rather than research-based pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, the article notes that short-sellers and financial skeptics were beginning to challenge Valeant's opaque accounting practices and debt-fueled acquisition strategy, while politicians like Hillary Clinton were criticizing drug pricing policies. The article frames the controversy as a clash between genuine pharmaceutical innovation and pure financial engineering.

## 2. HISTORY
**Turing Pharmaceuticals and Martin Shkreli:**
Following the Daraprim price increase, Shkreli became one of the most vilified figures in recent pharmaceutical history. In December 2015, he was arrested on securities fraud charges unrelated to Turing but stemming from his previous hedge fund operations. He was convicted in 2017 and sentenced to seven years in prison (served 2018-2023). Turing ultimately lowered Daraprim's price after intense public pressure, but it remained substantially elevated compared to historical levels.

**Valeant's Collapse:**
The financial scrutiny referenced in the article proved prescient. In late 2015 and 2016, Valeant's stock plummeted from over $260 per share to under $20, losing approximately 90% of its value. The company faced multiple investigations over its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services, which was found to have engaged in questionable billing practices. Valeant eventually severed ties with Philidor. The company, renamed Bausch Health Companies in 2018, spent years restructuring debt and settling lawsuits. By 2020, its market capitalization remained a fraction of its 2015 peak.

**Imprimis and Compounding Pharmacies:**
Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (now Harrow) successfully established a compounded alternative to Daraprim, demonstrating that competitive pressure could constrain extreme pricing strategies. However, FDA regulations around compounding pharmacies remained restrictive, and such workarounds proved more limited than initially hoped for broader drug price reform.

**Drug Pricing Policy Changes:**
The public outcry catalyzed by Shkreli's actions contributed to sustained political attention on drug pricing. However, major federal legislative changes remained limited through 2024. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included Medicare drug price negotiation provisions, but implementation proceeded slowly. Pharmaceutical pricing remains a contentious political issue with incremental rather than transformative policy changes.

**Pharmaceutical Industry Response:**
PhRMA's strategy of distinguishing innovative companies from "bad actors" became standard industry messaging. However, drug price increases continued across the sector, though rarely with the brazenness of the Daraprim case. The industry increasingly emphasized value-based pricing and patient assistance programs while continuing to raise prices on existing medications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction about compounding pharmacies as competitive constraints**: The article suggested that compounding pharmacies could effectively counteract extreme price increases by offering lower-cost alternatives. **Outcome**: This proved partially correct but limited. While Imprimis successfully competed with Daraprim, the compounding pharmacy pathway remained narrow federally, failing to become a broad solution to high drug prices.

• **Prediction that financial/accounting issues would harm Valeant more than political/regulatory scrutiny**: **Outcome**: Correct. Valeant's collapse stemmed primarily from revelations about fraudulent accounting and improper relationships with specialty pharmacies, not the drug pricing controversy itself. The company's stock decline correlated most strongly with financial transparency concerns rather than pricing policies.

• **Implicit prediction that Shkreli's model was unsustainable**: **Outcome**: Correct. While Shkreli's downfall related to securities fraud rather than pharmaceutical pricing directly, his business model became untenable due to legal, reputational, and competitive pressures.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7**

This article captured a watershed moment in pharmaceutical industry public perception through the lens of financial engineering rather than scientific innovation. It accurately identified the underlying dynamics of companies prioritizing accounting advantages over drug development, and its skepticism about Valeant's business model proved remarkably prescient regarding the eventual collapse.
