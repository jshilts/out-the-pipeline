# Why Small-Molecule Chemists Should Be Worried (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights two major trends in the pharmaceutical industry circa 2006. First, it notes from a Forbes analysis that among the top-selling drugs, five were already showing declining sales—a typical lifecycle pattern for blockbusters past their peak. More significantly, the fastest-growing drugs included three antibodies and another protein therapeutic, signaling the rising commercial importance of biologics and protein-based medicines. The author observes that small-molecule medicinal chemists often overlook these antibody products, but they represent substantial and expanding business.

Second, the article expresses concern about outsourcing trends in medicinal chemistry. The author recounts discussions about extensive contract work shifting to China and India, and warns that routine chemical synthesis and combinatorial chemistry library production—once viable careers—were becoming commoditized and vulnerable to offshoring. The author urges medicinal chemists to develop distinctive capabilities that cannot be easily replicated or undercut by lower-cost offshore providers, emphasizing the need to add unique value beyond standard "methyl-ethyl-butyl-futyl" chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent two decades largely validated both of the author's observations, with profound implications for drug development and medicinal chemistry careers.

**Biologics Growth**: The biologics market exploded after 2006. By 2022, biologics represented over 40% of new drug approvals in some years and consistently dominated lists of top-selling drugs. Humira (adalimumab), an antibody not yet in its prime in 2006, became the world's best-selling drug for nearly a decade, generating over $20 billion annually at its peak. Other antibody blockbusters like Keytruda, Opdivo, and newer oncology and immunology biologics became therapeutic mainstays, with some exceeding $10 billion in annual sales.

The biologics pipeline also matured significantly. As of 2024, antibodies and proteins comprise substantial portions of pharmaceutical R&D pipelines, with hundreds of approved antibodies and many more in development. This shifted pharmaceutical company portfolios significantly toward biologics.

**Outsourcing and Offshoring**: The trend toward pharmaceutical outsourcing to China and India accelerated dramatically post-2006. Large CROs (Contract Research Organizations) like WuXi AppTec and Pharmaron, and Indian companies like Syngene and Dr. Reddy's, grew into major global players handling substantial chemistry, manufacturing, and clinical research work for Western pharmaceutical companies. By the 2020s, offshore CROs were handling enormous volumes of medicinal chemistry, process chemistry, and drug development work.

**Medicinal Chemistry Career Impact**: The commoditization of routine chemistry work reshaped medicinal chemistry careers in developed markets. Academic programs and industrial hiring increasingly emphasized specialized skills—computational chemistry, structure-based drug design, biophysics, and interfacing with biologics. The era of large internal combichem groups and routine parallel synthesis largely ended, with many pharmaceutical companies downsizing early-stage chemistry groups in favor of collaborative models with CROs or specialized biotechs.

Many companies adopted hybrid models: retaining high-value discovery and design expertise internally while outsourcing synthesis scale-up and library production. This bifurcated the landscape into high-skill design roles and commoditized synthesis roles, with the latter often concentrated at CROs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Antibodies becoming very big business and getting bigger every year**: ✓ **Accurate**. Biologics, particularly antibodies, became dominant revenue drivers. However, the prediction slightly understated the magnitude—antibodies didn't just grow steadily, they became central pillars of pharma portfolios and launched the immunotherapy revolution in oncology.

- **Medicinal chemists need to add value to the antibody field**: ✓ **Largely accurate**. While some chemists developed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) expertise—a hybrid small-molecule/biologics approach—many medicinal chemists remained siloed. The rise of ADCs and small-molecule modulators of protein-protein interactions did open some integration opportunities, but smaller than implied. More commonly, chemistry roles specialized separately.

- **Routine medicinal chemistry work becoming outsourced**: ✓ **Extremely accurate**. Within 5-10 years, standard library synthesis, analog production, and even early lead optimization were heavily outsourced to offshore CROs. Large pharma companies significantly reduced internal synthesis capacity, with outsourcing now routine globally rather than novel.

- **US custom synthesis companies forced into specialized niches**: ✓ **Accurate**. The small US custom synthesis sector either perished (common) or evolved into highly specialized providers—GMP manufacturing, complex natural products, proprietary technology platforms—where competitors couldn't easily undercut them.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article possessed strong foresight about biologics ascendancy and outsourcing trends that fundamentally reshaped pharmaceutical R&D and chemistry careers. While not especially deep, its dual focus captured two critical economic shifts just as they accelerated, making it unusually prescient in retrospect.
