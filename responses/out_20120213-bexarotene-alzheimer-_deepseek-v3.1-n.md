# Bexarotene for Alzheimer's (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a promising preclinical Alzheimer's study from Case Western Reserve University reporting that the cancer drug bexarotene (Targretin) showed dramatic effects in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that the RXR ligand quickly reduced levels of both soluble and insoluble beta-amyloid forms in rodent brains, likely through increasing expression of the lipoprotein ApoE. The compound appeared to work rapidly on both soluble forms and insoluble plaques, with the plaque clearance occurring over several days, possibly through an immune response mechanism. The mice also showed behavioral and memory improvements.

Since bexarotene was already FDA-approved for oncology indications (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma), the article noted this could provide a faster pathway to test the therapy in human patients, while also acknowledging that translation from rodent studies to human efficacy has historically been where many promising Alzheimer's approaches have failed.

## 2. HISTORY

The initial enthusiasm for bexarotene in Alzheimer's disease was not sustained by subsequent clinical evidence. Multiple clinical trials conducted in the years following the 2012 publication failed to demonstrate efficacy in human patients.

**Clinical Trial Results:**
- A Phase II clinical trial published in 2015 in *JAMA Neurology* involving 48 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease found no significant cognitive benefits from bexarotene treatment compared to placebo over 12 weeks of treatment.
- The trial did observe increased levels of ApoE in cerebrospinal fluid, confirming the drug's mechanism of action in humans, but this did not translate to clinical benefit.
- Further studies confirmed that while bexarotene could increase ApoE expression in humans as it did in mice, the subsequent effects on amyloid clearance and cognition did not follow.

**Mechanistic Understanding:**
- The discrepancy between mouse and human results highlighted important species differences in Alzheimer's pathology and ApoE biology.
- Subsequent research revealed that the relationship between ApoE isoforms and Alzheimer's risk is more complex than initially understood, with ApoE4 being the strongest genetic risk factor while ApoE2 appears protective.
- The failure reinforced concerns about the predictive value of amyloid-focused mouse models for human Alzheimer's disease.

**Development Pathway:**
- No pharmaceutical company pursued bexarotene as a primary Alzheimer's therapy following these negative results.
- The drug remains available in its original oncology indication but has not been repurposed for neurodegenerative diseases.
- This became another case study in the high failure rate of Alzheimer's drug development, particularly those targeting amyloid pathology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"you'd hope that the way is clear to trying this same idea out in human patients"** - This did occur. Multiple clinical trials were conducted in subsequent years, including at least one well-designed Phase II study.

• **Implicit prediction that FDA approval for oncology might speed development** - While trials did proceed relatively quickly, the outcome was negative, so expedited approval was not ultimately relevant.

• **Implicit prediction that the mechanism might translate to humans** - The mechanism partially translated (ApoE upregulation occurred) but did not produce clinical benefits.

• **Implicit concern about translation from mice to humans** - This concern proved prescient. The article's caution about the long history of "wonderful rodent studies that didn't translate" accurately anticipated the outcome.

• **"this study is already triggering more interest in the Alzheimer's community than can be contained"** - This initial enthusiasm proved to be another example of what the article acknowledged as frequent bursts of excitement followed by disappointment that "has been the story every time something promising shows up."

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article warrants moderate-to-high interest as a well-written example of science journalism that accurately captured both the promise and the skepticism appropriate for early-stage Alzheimer's research, and the subsequent decade validated its cautious framing. It serves as an important case study in the challenges of translating mouse model results to human therapies, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases.
