# The Original Nanotechnology (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2009 article by an organic chemist reflects on the gap between human synthetic chemistry capabilities and the efficiency of biological enzyme systems. The author acknowledges that while organic chemists have successfully synthesized complex natural products like palytoxin and vancomycin, these achievements often require enormous effort under harsh, non-scalable conditions. In contrast, microorganisms can produce these same molecules at ambient temperature in water while simultaneously maintaining cellular functions. The article cites cytochrome P450 enzymes as exemplifying superior catalytic capabilities—performing regio- and stereoselective oxidations on complex molecules that remain challenging or impossible for contemporary synthetic chemistry. The author characterizes enzymes as "the original nanotechnology," highlighting their ability to manipulate molecules with precision that far surpasses current laboratory methods.

## 2. HISTORY

**Enzyme Engineering and Directed Evolution:** In the years following this article, Frances Arnold received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for pioneering directed evolution of enzymes, demonstrating that enzymes could be engineered for chemical transformations previously exclusive to synthetic chemistry. This validated the article's premise about enzyme superiority while showing pathways to harness and improve it.

**Biocatalysis in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing:** Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted enzyme-catalyzed reactions for drug manufacturing. Examples include sitagliptin (Januvia) synthesis using engineered transaminases, artemisinin semi-synthesis using engineered yeast enzymes, and various P450-catalyzed hydroxylations in steroid synthesis. These applications moved from niche academic examples to commercially viable, scalable processes.

**Cytochrome P450 Applications:** The specific P450 enzyme family mentioned in the article became central to multiple FDA-approved drug metabolism predictions and design tools. Pharmaceutical companies now routinely use P450 profiling in drug development. Engineered P450 enzymes found industrial applications in synthesizing drug intermediates.

**Industrial Biotechnology Growth:** Companies specializing in enzyme engineering (Codexis, Gevo, Amyris, Genomatica) demonstrated commercial viability of enzyme-catalyzed processes for pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and specialty chemicals. Several achieved successful IPOs and commercial product launches.

**Scientific Publications:** The field of biocatalysis expanded significantly in academic literature, with enzyme engineering papers increasingly appearing in top-tier chemistry journals alongside traditional synthetic chemistry work.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: Enzymes represent superior synthetic capabilities compared to current laboratory methods**
**Outcome: Confirmed.** Subsequent developments in directed evolution and enzyme engineering demonstrated that engineered enzymes can outperform traditional synthetic methods in regio- and stereoselectivity for specific transformations. However, synthetic chemistry continues to excel in robustness and substrate scope.

**• Implicit prediction: Enzyme-based approaches will become more important in chemical synthesis**
**Outcome: Partially realized.** Biocatalysis gained significant traction in pharmaceutical manufacturing and industrial applications, though traditional synthetic chemistry remains dominant overall. The complementarity rather than replacement of methods emerged as the practical outcome.

**• Implicit prediction: Chemists should aspire to enzyme-level precision**
**Outcome: Confirmed.** The field moved toward this goal through developments in supramolecular chemistry, organocatalysis, and molecular recognition, though achieving enzyme-level efficiency in abiotic systems remains challenging.

The article's central premise about the superior capabilities of biological catalysis proved prescient, especially in the context of subsequent directed evolution breakthroughs and industrial applications in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured an important conceptual shift just before the field of enzyme engineering matured into Nobel-recognized achievements and widespread industrial adoption, demonstrating insightful understanding of chemistry's fundamental direction.
