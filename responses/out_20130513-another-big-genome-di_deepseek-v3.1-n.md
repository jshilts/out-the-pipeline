# Another Big Genome Disparity (With Bonus ENCODE Bashing) (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary critiques media coverage of the bladderwort plant genome sequencing and contrasts it with earlier sensationalist headlines about the ENCODE project. The author notes that the bladderwort's tiny genome (82 million base pairs) was being portrayed as proof that "junk DNA" is non-functional, while the ENCODE consortium's human genome analysis generated headlines claiming "80% functional" DNA and declaring the death of junk DNA.

The article points out the fundamental contradiction in these narratives by highlighting the massive variation in genome sizes across species: bladderwort at 82 Mbp, humans at 3 billion base pairs, pine trees at 24 billion, and the Japanese canopy plant at 150 billion base pairs (two thousand times larger than bladderwort, fifty times larger than humans). The author argues that if most DNA is truly functional, one must explain why some organisms need vastly more "functional" DNA than others—a problem the ENCODE project ignored while claiming ubiquitous functionality across the human genome.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade largely vindicated the author's skepticism about ENCODE's claims. The interpretation that 80% of the human genome is "functional" faced sustained criticism from evolutionary biologists and genomics researchers, who argued that ENCODE had inappropriately broadened the definition of "function" to include any biochemical activity.

**Scientific Community Response**: The ENCODE definition of function (transcription, protein binding, chromatin marks) was widely criticized for conflating biochemical activity with biological function in an evolutionary sense. Critics noted that most mutations are neutral and that vast amounts of DNA can show biochemical activity without contributing to organismal fitness.

**Junk DNA Debate Evolution**: Subsequent research reinforced that much non-coding DNA consists of inactive transposable elements, viral remnants, and pseudogenes. While some non-coding DNA has regulatory functions, estimates of truly functional non-coding regions settled around 10-15% of the genome, far below ENCODE's 80% figure. The concept of "junk DNA" remained scientifically useful, though nuanced.

**Comparative Genomics Developments**: Continued genome sequencing reinforced the C-value paradox (lack of correlation between genome size and organismal complexity). The variation in genome sizes among related species continued to challenge simplistic notions of universal functionality.

**No Major Policy or Clinical Impact**: No FDA-approved drugs or clinical applications resulted from reinterpretations of genome functionality percentages. The functional annotation of genomes progressed through more nuanced approaches that distinguished between different types of genomic elements rather than broad functional claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions and Outcomes:**

• **That ENCODE's broad functionality claims would face sustained scientific criticism**: **Correct**. The ENCODE controversy continued for years, with prominent evolutionary biologists publishing detailed critiques arguing that ENCODE had misrepresented biochemical activity as biological function.

• **That genome size variation would remain problematic for universal functionality claims**: **Correct**. The C-value paradox remained unresolved, with no evidence that organisms with larger genomes have proportionally more biological functions. This continued to undermine claims that most DNA is functional.

• **That media coverage would continue to oversimplify complex genomic findings**: **Partially correct**. While some coverage improved, oversimplified narratives about "junk DNA" continued to appear, though the scientific consensus moved toward more nuanced interpretations rather than definitive extremes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article accurately identified fundamental flaws in the ENCODE project's interpretation and media presentation, correctly predicting that genome size variation posed insurmountable problems for claims of ubiquitous functionality. The piece addresses a significant scientific controversy with lasting implications for how genomic data should be interpreted. It represents clear scientific thinking cutting through media hype, though the specific topic remains somewhat specialized for general audiences.
