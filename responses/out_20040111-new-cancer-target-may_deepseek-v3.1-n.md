# A New Cancer Target - Maybe (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses drug target classes in pharmaceutical research, contrasting well-established targets like GPCRs and hydrolytic enzymes (with defined binding pockets) against the more challenging "interaction" targets—particularly protein-protein interactions. The author highlights a Roche research breakthrough targeting MDM2, which inhibits the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The Roche team discovered orally active polyaryl imidazoline compounds that block MDM2-p53 binding by exploiting a small binding pocket identified in a 1996 crystal structure. While celebrating this achievement, the author expresses skepticism about broad applicability, noting that well-defined pockets like MDM2's are rare anomalies in protein-protein interaction targets. The article concludes with cautious optimism as Roche moves toward clinical development.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2004 article, MDM2 inhibitors underwent significant clinical development, though with mixed success. **Nutlins** (the imidazoline compounds mentioned) became foundational research tools but faced formulation challenges. Several companies advanced MDM2 inhibitors into clinical trials, including Roche's **idasanutlin**, Sanofi's **SAR405838**, and **milademetan** (RAIN-32). By the mid-2010s to 2020s, these programs showed modest efficacy: idasanutlin demonstrated some activity in liposarcoma and AML trials, but generally failed to achieve breakthrough results or broad approval. Other companies like Merck, Novartis, and Daiichi Sankyo also pursued MDM2 targets. The most significant real-world outcome has been **milademetan's conditional approval in Japan (2023)** for dedifferentiated liposarcoma—a rare cancer subtype. However, MDM2 inhibitors have not achieved widespread clinical adoption or blockbuster status. The field shifted toward **combination therapies** (MDM2 inhibitors with chemotherapy or targeted agents) rather than monotherapy. From a drug development perspective, MDM2-p53 targeting validated the concept of drugging protein-protein interactions in certain contexts but proved more challenging than initially hoped.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: "They'll be the first to find out what blocking MDM2 binding is going to do to animals - how well it'll treat those with cancer, and what side effects it might have on those without."
  - **Reality**: Clinical trials revealed that MDM2 inhibition has **narrow therapeutic windows**. While some efficacy was observed in specific cancers (especially liposarcomas), **dose-limiting toxicities** and **hematological side effects** proved challenging. Combination approaches became necessary to improve tolerability.

- **Prediction**: The author was pessimistic about broad applicability, stating MDM2 is an "anomaly" and similar well-defined pockets are rare in protein-protein interactions.
  - **Reality**: This assessment proved largely **accurate**. While MDM2 remains one of the most druggable protein-protein interactions, the broader PPI landscape has remained challenging. Success in PPI drug discovery has been highly selective, with pockets generally requiring unique structural features. The fishing-boat analogy was prescient.

- **Prediction**: News of success would stimulate more work in protein-protein interaction targets.
  - **Reality**: MDM2 work **did spur research** into other PPI targets, but progress remained slow. Novel approaches emerged (stapled peptides, PROTACs, molecular glues) to address these challenges. However, PPIs remain under-represented in approved drugs compared to traditional targets.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article demonstrates sound scientific judgment and accurately anticipated the challenges in drugging protein-protein interactions. It correctly identified MDM2's unusual characteristics while maintaining appropriate skepticism about broader applicability—predictions that largely held over two decades of subsequent drug development.
