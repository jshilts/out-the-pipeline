# IGFR Therapies Wipe Out. And They're Not Alone. (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary laments the collapse of the insulin‑like growth factor‑1 receptor (IGF‑1R) drug development effort.  After years of pre‑clinical promise—over‑expression of IGF‑1R in several solid tumours, mouse‑model data showing tumour shrinkage, and a mechanistic analogy to the successful EGFR‑targeted drugs—numerous biotech firms launched antibody and small‑molecule programmes.  By 2012 the author notes that more than ten companies had been working on IGF‑1R inhibitors, but none had produced a marketable therapy.  Citing pessimistic statements from field pioneers, the piece argues that the failures are largely invisible to the public and that a systematic catalogue of such “quiet” failures would help illustrate how difficult drug discovery truly is.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical outcomes (2012‑2024)**  
- **Antibody programmes** – Figitumumab (AstraZeneca), cixutumumab (Immunex/Pfizer), ganitumab (Amgen), and dalotuzumab (Eli Lilly) all progressed to phase III trials in various solid tumours (non‑small‑cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma, breast cancer).  Each trial failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and the sponsors discontinued development between 2014 and 2016.  
- **Small‑molecule kinase inhibitors** – Linsitinib (OSI‑906, Novartis) and BMS‑754807 (Bristol‑Myers Squibb) entered phase III studies for adrenocortical carcinoma and metastatic breast cancer, respectively.  Both programs were halted after negative results (2015 for linsitinib, 2016 for BMS‑754807).  
- **Combination strategies** – A handful of later trials attempted to pair IGF‑1R blockade with other targeted agents (e.g., EGFR inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors) or with chemotherapy.  None produced a regulatory‑approved indication, and most were terminated early for futility.  

**Regulatory status** – As of early 2026, **no IGF‑1R‑directed drug has received FDA, EMA, or PMDA approval** for any indication.  

**Business impact** – Companies that had built sizable pipelines around IGF‑1R either pivoted to other targets or were acquired.  Amgen’s ganitumab programme was folded into its broader oncology portfolio; Pfizer’s cixutumumab assets were sold to a private‑equity group and later abandoned.  The overall market expectation for IGF‑1R inhibitors evaporated, and venture capital funding for new IGF‑1R projects dried up after 2015.  

**Scientific legacy** – The failures prompted a reassessment of the IGF axis as a monotherapy target.  Researchers now view IGF‑1R signaling as a **resistance mechanism** rather than a primary driver in most tumours.  The field shifted toward using IGF‑1R inhibitors only in highly selected biomarker‑defined subpopulations (e.g., certain pediatric sarcomas with IGF‑1R amplification), but even those niche trials have not yielded approvals.  The broader lesson—over‑reliance on target over‑expression without robust predictive biomarkers—has been incorporated into modern oncology drug‑development frameworks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “This may be the end of the story… now this may be the last one that gets put on the shelf.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  By 2020 all major IGF‑1R programmes were discontinued; no new large‑scale IGF‑1R‑focused oncology trials have been launched since 2021.  

- **Prediction:** “More than ten companies were developing these drugs; now the field is collapsing.”  
  **Outcome:** Correct.  The number of active sponsors fell from >10 in 2010 to essentially zero by 2017.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** “Targeting IGF‑1R might still be useful for preventing metastasis in colorectal cancer.”  
  **Outcome:** No clinical evidence has emerged to support this claim; no colorectal‑cancer indication has been approved or advanced to phase III after 2012.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** “Negative results will remain invisible to the public.”  
  **Outcome:** Largely true.  Most failures were reported only in conference abstracts or company press releases; mainstream media coverage was minimal.  

Overall, the author’s pessimistic outlook proved prescient; the IGF‑1R class has not produced a successful drug and is now regarded as a “failed target” in oncology.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise, candid snapshot of a high‑profile target’s collapse, offering a valuable case study for drug‑development strategy and for understanding why many biologically plausible targets never translate into medicines.  Its relevance persists for anyone studying translational failure modes.
