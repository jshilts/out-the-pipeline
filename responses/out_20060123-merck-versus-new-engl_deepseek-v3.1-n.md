# Merck versus the New England Journal (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Merck's legal strategy in an upcoming Vioxx lawsuit trial in Texas, where the company's attorneys were scheduled to question Dr. Gregory Curfman of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) under oath. The central issue revolves around NEJM's handling of published Vioxx data from the VIGOR study, which was becoming a key element in the litigation. The article notes that the case involves a plaintiff who had taken Vioxx for only seventeen days before dying, highlighting the high stakes of what might seem like limited exposure. Both sides appeared confident: plaintiffs arguing that a recent NEJM editorial confirmed Merck tried to hide Vioxx risks, while Merck planned to challenge the journal's suspicions about altered data. The author speculates whether Merck might also explore whether the journal had been approached by plaintiff representatives, suggesting potential legal strategy around journal independence and integrity. The piece frames this as unusual legal maneuvering, with Merck's decision to depose a journal editor indicating they believed they had strong justification for doing so.

## 2. HISTORY

The Vioxx litigation that began around 2004-2005 ultimately became one of the largest pharmaceutical liability cases in history. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market in September 2004 after a study showed increased cardiovascular risks. The company eventually faced approximately 27,000 lawsuits from patients who had taken the drug.

The legal strategy involving the New England Journal of Medicine became significant because NEJM published an "expression of concern" in December 2005 about the VIGOR study data that had been published in 2000, suggesting Merck had not adequately disclosed cardiovascular risks. This editorial became ammunition for plaintiffs' attorneys arguing that Merck had concealed safety data.

Merck's decision to depose journal editors was indeed unusual and reflected the high stakes of the litigation. While the specific case mentioned (Rio Grande City, Texas) was just one of thousands, the broader legal strategy paid off for Merck in many instances. The company ultimately settled the majority of cases rather than continuing with individual trials.

In November 2007, Merck announced a $4.85 billion settlement to resolve most Vioxx-related lawsuits, which was significantly less than many analysts had predicted. This outcome suggested that while the company faced massive litigation costs, their legal strategy—including challenging the evidence presentation and journal integrity—helped limit their overall exposure compared to worst-case scenarios.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Merck's legal strategy assessment**: The article suggested Merck must have "pretty good reason" for deposing a journal editor, implying this was a risky but calculated move. This proved accurate—Merck's aggressive legal approach, including challenging scientific publication practices, contributed to their ability to manage the litigation crisis better than initially feared.

• **Implications for liability law system**: The reference to a Fordham law professor criticizing the spectacle's impact on the liability system presciently captured how the Vioxx litigation would become a landmark case in pharmaceutical liability, though the professor's concerns about the system's reputation may have been less significant than the ultimate settlement's impact on future drug safety oversight.

• **Trial significance**: The article treated this particular Texas case as potentially important for legal strategy testing. While individual cases had varying outcomes, the broader legal pattern (including the eventual mass settlement) validated that both sides were indeed testing strategic approaches that would shape the ultimate resolution.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures a specific moment in a major pharmaceutical litigation that would become historically significant, offering insight into legal strategies around scientific publishing and liability. However, it represents just one small piece of a much larger story unfolding at the time.
