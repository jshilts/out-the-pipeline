# Calculating A Few Too Many New Compounds (Nov 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques a 2016 arXiv paper from Harvard, Toronto, and Cambridge researchers on "automatic chemical design" using variational autoencoders to generate novel drug-like molecules. The author acknowledges the theoretical value of encoding molecules into continuous latent representations that can be optimized toward desired properties, but identifies a crucial flaw: approximately 20% of aspirin-derived compounds generated by the method are chemically implausible or unstable (acid chlorides, anhydrides, reactive small rings). The critique highlights that the research team notably lacked chemistry department members, and that popular media coverage (MIT Technology Review) overhyped the results with misleading headlines about "software dreaming up wonder drugs." While the author doesn't dismiss the approach entirely, they emphasize that the method produces too many chemically defective structures to be taken seriously in drug discovery pipelines.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2016 paper initiated what became the field of **deep generative models for molecular design**. After initial criticism:

**Academic Trajectory**: The approach evolved significantly. Researchers soon integrated **graph neural networks** and **transformer architectures**, which proved more robust than the original autoencoder framework. By 2018-2020, numerous groups demonstrated improved chemically valid generation rates (85-95% validity versus the ~80% apparent in 2016). These methods became part of the broader AI drug discovery toolkit.

**Commercialization**: Several companies built platforms around this technology, though often with mixed results:

- **Insilico Medicine**: Used generative models in their AI drug discovery platform, advancing compounds to clinical trials (notably an AI-generated drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis entered Phase 1 in 2021). However, no FDA-approved drugs have resulted directly from these generative approaches as of 2024.

- **Atomwise**: Focused on AI-based virtual screening rather than pure de novo generation, demonstrating more practical success with pharmaceutical partnerships.

- **BenevolentAI**: Used various AI methods including generative models; their clinical trial results have been inconsistent, with some programs terminated.

**FDA Regulation**: No specific regulatory pathway emerged for drugs designed by generative AI, though FDA increasingly acknowledges AI/ML in drug development. Most AI-designed drugs still require traditional validation pipelines.

**Adoption in Industry**: Major pharma companies (GSK, AstraZeneca, Pfizer) began pilot programs with generative chemistry, but deployment remained limited. Most chose to integrate AI for **lead optimization** rather than de novo generation, recognizing the chemical validity problems highlighted in the 2016 critique.

**Impact**: By 2024, generative models for molecules became a standard research tool but did not replace traditional medicinal chemistry. The field progressed from proof-of-concept to practical implementation, though with more modest clinical outcomes than initially predicted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained few explicit predictions, focusing on critique rather than futurism. However, several implicit expectations can be evaluated:

- **Implicit prediction that the method needed serious refinement**: This proved correct. The field required 3-5 years of development to reach chemically reliable generation, with approaches shifting from autoencoders to graph neural networks and attention mechanisms.

- **Implicit assumption that generating novel structures was not the rate-limiting step in drug discovery**: This view depends on the context. While virtual compound libraries already existed (as the author noted), generative models found their niche in exploring *unconventional chemical space* that traditional libraries missed. The author's skepticism about the fundamental need was partially warranted, but generative approaches revealed valuable not-yet-synthesized molecules.

The major missed point was that while the 2016 method had ~20% flawed outputs, subsequent refinements made generative models genuinely useful tools for hit-to-lead optimization and scaffold hopping, not as replacements for medicinal chemists but as complementary discovery engines.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a critical problem at a field's inception and correctly anticipated that chemical validity would be a persistent challenge. Had the critique been written by a chemistry expert rather than a science blogger, it would rate 9-10/10. As it stands, it serves as a cautionary milestone in the maturation of AI-driven drug discovery.
