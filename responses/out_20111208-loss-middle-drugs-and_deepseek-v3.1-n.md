# The Loss of the Middle (Drugs and the People Who Find Them) (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes comments by Roche CEO Severin Schwan about the pharmaceutical industry moving toward a bimodal distribution—with highly innovative drugs on one end and generics on the other, squeezing out "me-too drugs" and line extensions in the middle. The author extends this analogy to R&D personnel, citing Pfizer's organizational plans to create a smaller group of elite "drug designers" alongside a larger, lower-cost workforce handling routine compound synthesis. The piece raises concerns about identifying and retaining top talent, and questions what happens to the experienced scientists who fall into the disappearing middle tier.

## 2. HISTORY
The bimodal distribution prediction proved remarkably accurate for both drugs and employment patterns over the subsequent decade:

**Industry Consolidation & Job Market**: The years following 2011 saw significant pharmaceutical layoffs and continued consolidation. Pfizer alone announced major restructuring, including cutting 15% of its workforce in 2013 and shutting down research sites. The industry eliminated an estimated 150,000+ jobs between 2011-2016. This consolidation accelerated the predicted bimodal employment structure.

**Drug Market Evolution**: The market indeed bifurcated into high-price specialty drugs and generics. Breakthrough therapies like CAR-T treatments (Kymriah, Yescarta), gene therapies (Luxturna), and immunotherapies (Keytruda, Opdivo) emerged as ultra-premium products with six-figure price tags. Meanwhile, generic competition intensified, with companies like Mylan and Teva expanding their generic portfolios aggressively. The "middle" segment of me-too drugs faced pricing pressure, leading many companies to abandon certain therapeutic areas.

**R&D Restructuring**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly outsourced routine chemistry work to lower-cost CROs in Asia, while concentrating high-value research internally. This created the predicted two-tier system where innovative drug discovery remained in-house while commoditized synthesis moved offshore.

**Policy Impact**: The drug pricing debate intensified through the 2010s, culminating in policy discussions around value-based pricing and reference pricing systems that further reinforced the bimodal structure—payors became more willing to pay premium prices for breakthrough therapies while squeezing costs on everything else.

**Talent Migration**: Many experienced pharma scientists who lost jobs moved to biotechnology startups, consulting, or completely different industries. The biotech sector expanded significantly as venture capital flowed to startups pursuing breakthrough innovations, while mid-tier pharmaceutical roles continued to shrink.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Bimodal drug distribution**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - The market clearly separated into premium innovative drugs and low-cost generics, with me-too drugs facing severe pricing pressure
• **Bimodal employment structure**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Companies created smaller elite research groups and outsourced routine work, eliminating middle-tier positions
• **Difficulties identifying star designers**: ⚠ **PARTIAL** - While creating elite teams proved challenging, companies generally managed to restructure through attrition and selectivity, though not always optimally
• **Waste of human capital**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Experienced scientists were laid off and some migrated to biotech startups, representing both loss to traditional pharma and opportunity for innovation elsewhere

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about industry structural changes, accurately predicting both the business model transformation and its profound human capital implications, making it valuable reading for understanding a decade of pharmaceutical evolution.
