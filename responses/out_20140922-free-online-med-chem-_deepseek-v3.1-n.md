# A Free Online Med-Chem Course (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2014 post announced two upcoming massive open online courses (MOOCs) focused on medicinal chemistry. The primary offering was an 8-week course on the EdX platform taught by Erland Stevens at Davidson College, covering fundamental topics including the drug approval process, enzymes and receptors, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, molecular diversity, lead discovery and optimization, and important drug classes. The course could be audited for free, had previously attracted 14,000 students in a spring run, and was scheduled to start in October 2014. The article also noted a similar medicinal chemistry course on Coursera from UCSD focused on drug discovery, indicating growing availability of free online education in pharmaceutical sciences.

## 2. HISTORY

Online education platforms like EdX and Coursera experienced significant growth and evolution after 2014. MOOCs, which began gaining mainstream traction around 2012-2013, became a well-established educational delivery method, with both platforms expanding their course catalogs across STEM disciplines including pharmaceutical and medical sciences.

The Davidson College medicinal chemistry course represented the broader trend of universities making specialized scientific content accessible to global audiences through partnerships with MOOC platforms. This democratization of pharmaceutical education enabled professionals, students, and interested learners worldwide to access content previously restricted to enrolled university students.

However, the MOOC model also revealed challenges, including typically low completion rates (often under 10%) despite high enrollment numbers, questions about assessment rigor and credential value, and the need for sustainable business models. Over time, both EdX and Coursera evolved their strategies, with increased emphasis on professional certificates, microcredentials, and paid specializations alongside free audit options.

There is no information available about whether this particular course continued running in subsequent years, how enrollment fluctuated, or whether it led to specific educational or career outcomes for participants. The broader pharmaceutical education landscape continued to be dominated by traditional degree programs, though online and hybrid learning became standard pedagogical approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in medicinal chemistry education or the MOOC platform space.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the availability of free medicinal chemistry education is valuable for learners, this article is a time-limited announcement of specific course offerings rather than an analysis of biotechnology industry trends, drug development innovations, or scientific breakthroughs. Its relevance is confined to educational opportunities available in 2014.
