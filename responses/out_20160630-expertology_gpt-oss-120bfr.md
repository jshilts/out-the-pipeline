# Expertology (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post uses the “right‑to‑try” (RTT) movement—state and later federal laws that let terminally ill patients obtain investigational drugs outside of FDA‑approved compassionate‑use programs—as a springboard to discuss a broader cultural problem: how much society should rely on experts. The author sketches four epistemic categories (​“Just Plain Facts,” “Matter for Experts,” “Flat‑Out Unknowable,” and “Matters of Opinion”) and argues that many contemporary disputes (vaccines, glyphosate, Brexit, the 2016 U.S. election) are fights over which category a question belongs to, rather than about the underlying facts.  

The piece concludes with a pragmatic prescription for “right‑to‑try” debates: keep the issue firmly in the “Matter for Experts” bucket, lower the informational barriers for patients, and avoid making them feel patronised. The tone is a mix of philosophical reflection, political commentary, and a call for better communication between experts and the public.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Right‑to‑try legislation and its impact  
| Year | Milestone | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **2015‑2017** | 10 U.S. states (e.g., Connecticut, Colorado, Florida) pass RTT statutes. | Limited use; most patients still rely on FDA’s Expanded Access (EA) program. |
| **May 2018** | Federal **Right‑to‑Try Act** signed into law (signed by President Trump). | Created a uniform pathway for any FDA‑investigational drug that has passed Phase I. |
| **2018‑2023** | ~30‑40 documented RTT cases (e.g., Gilead’s remdesivir for a single COVID‑19 patient in 2020; several oncology drugs from Novartis, Roche). | Companies often declined to supply drugs citing liability, lack of data, or manufacturing constraints. |
| **2020‑2022** | COVID‑19 pandemic triggers Emergency Use Authorisations (EUAs) and accelerated approvals (e.g., mRNA vaccines, monoclonal antibodies). | Demonstrated that a more flexible regulatory approach can be safe and effective when paired with rigorous post‑market surveillance—contrasting with the largely unused RTT route. |
| **2023‑2024** | FDA reports > 100 000 patients treated via EA annually; RTT accounts for < 0.1 % of all investigational‑drug accesses. | Confirms that RTT has not materially altered patient access; EA remains the dominant mechanism. |

### Expert trust and misinformation  
* **Vaccine hesitancy** – The anti‑vaccine movement grew after the 2017–2019 measles resurgence and peaked during the COVID‑19 rollout. Surveys (e.g., Pew Research 2021) show a modest decline in confidence in medical experts among U.S. adults (≈ 5 percentage‑point drop since 2016).  
* **Glyphosate controversy** – The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic” in 2015; subsequent regulatory reviews (EPA 2020, EFSA 2021) concluded it is unlikely to pose a cancer risk at typical exposure levels. The scientific split persisted in public discourse, illustrating the “Matter for Experts vs. Opinion” clash described in the article.  
* **Brexit** – The UK formally left the EU on 31 January 2020. In the biotech sector, the UK retained a strong life‑science ecosystem (≈ £5 bn annual R&D spend in 2023) and negotiated separate regulatory alignment with the EMA, but companies faced new customs and data‑sharing hurdles. The political debate over expert advice (e.g., economic forecasts) mirrored the article’s claim that “expert versus lay” framing shaped voter sentiment.  

### Political polarization and the “expert” narrative  
* The 2016 U.S. election and the subsequent Trump administration amplified rhetoric that dismissed “the establishment” and “expert elites.”  
* Post‑2020, congressional hearings (e.g., on COVID‑19 origins, vaccine safety) repeatedly featured clashes between scientists and partisan politicians, reinforcing the article’s observation that “down‑with‑experts” rhetoric can become a rallying point.  

Overall, the trends anticipated in the 2016 post—expansion of RTT laws, heightened public skepticism of expertise, and politicisation of scientific advice—have materialised, though the specific impact of RTT on drug access has been far smaller than many advocates originally hoped.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the article) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **RTT will become a major route for patients to obtain experimental drugs.** | The federal RTT law passed (2018) but usage has remained marginal (< 0.1 % of all investigational‑drug accesses). EA continues to dominate. |
| **Distrust of experts will fuel political movements (e.g., Brexit, Trump’s candidacy).** | Both events occurred; surveys and election analyses attribute a significant share of voter motivation to perceived “elite” dismissal. |
| **The “expert‑vs‑opinion” split will intensify around issues like vaccines, glyphosate, and climate change.** | Confirmed: vaccine hesitancy surged, glyphosate debates persisted, and climate‑change denial remained a partisan marker in 2020‑2024 polls. |
| **Lowering informational barriers will make patients more comfortable with complex medical decisions.** | Some patient‑education initiatives (e.g., FDA’s “Expanded Access” portal, disease‑specific advocacy sites) improved transparency, but most RTT participants still reported limited understanding of risks. |
| **Regulatory flexibility (as seen in COVID‑19 EUAs) will demonstrate that expert oversight can be streamlined without sacrificing safety.** | The rapid EUA rollout for COVID‑19 therapeutics and vaccines was largely successful, showing that data‑driven flexibility is possible—though this was not directly tied to RTT. |

The article did not make many concrete numeric forecasts, so the evaluation focuses on the qualitative direction of its expectations.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The piece is a thoughtful, interdisciplinary take on a timely policy debate (RTT) and the broader crisis of expert credibility. Its blend of philosophy, politics, and biotech makes it relevant for historians of science and policy analysts, though the lack of concrete data limits its immediate utility for specialists.
