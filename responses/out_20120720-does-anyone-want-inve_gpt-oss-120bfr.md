# Does Anyone Want to Invest in Pharma? (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary questions why the world’s cash‑rich technology giants—Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon—seem reluctant to pour billions into the research‑intensive pharmaceutical and biotech sectors. Citing a televised exchange between Eric Schmidt and Peter Thiel, the author argues that these firms have amassed massive cash piles but lack “ideas” for high‑return, R&D‑driven investments. The piece contrasts this with the perpetual “treadmill” of drug development, where companies must constantly fund costly pipelines and cannot simply buy back stock without jeopardising future innovation. The author wonders whether the perceived difficulty of generating robust returns in pharma is scaring off even the most capital‑rich investors.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Big‑Tech involvement in life sciences (2012‑2026)  
- **Alphabet (Google)** launched **Verily Life Sciences** (2015) and **Calico** (2013) with multi‑billion‑dollar budgets aimed at data‑driven health research, disease‑prevention platforms, and aging. Neither has produced a marketed drug, but both have generated extensive datasets, partnered on clinical‑trial infrastructure, and spun out several diagnostics (e.g., Verily’s glucose‑monitoring sensor, partnership on the **Google‑Verily COVID‑19 testing** effort).  
- **DeepMind** (acquired 2014) contributed AI tools for protein‑folding (AlphaFold, 2020) that have become foundational for drug‑discovery pipelines across the industry. While not a direct investor, the technology dramatically lowered computational costs for biotech firms.  
- **Amazon** entered health through **Amazon Pharmacy** (2020) and the acquisition of **PillPack** (2018). It also launched **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Health** services, providing cloud infrastructure for biotech data. Direct drug‑development investment remains limited.  
- **Microsoft** has pursued health‑AI collaborations (e.g., with **Novartis** on AI‑driven drug design, 2021) and built the **Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare** platform, but again has not allocated a dedicated multi‑billion‑dollar fund to early‑stage biotech.  

Overall, big‑tech firms have **invested heavily in enabling technologies** (AI, cloud, data platforms) rather than directly funding R&D pipelines. Their total capital allocated to life‑science subsidiaries is estimated in the **low‑single‑digit‑billion‑dollar range**, far below the cash piles discussed in the 2012 interview.

### Venture‑capital and public markets for biotech  
- **VC funding** for biotech surged from ~US$5 bn in 2012 to >US$30 bn annually by 2022, driven by the rise of **gene‑editing**, **CAR‑T**, and **mRNA** platforms.  
- **SPACs** (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) created a wave of public listings 2020‑2022, though many have since underperformed, prompting a market correction.  
- **IPO activity** rebounded in 2023‑2025 with notable offerings from **Moderna**, **Beam Therapeutics**, and **Allogene** (CAR‑T).  

### Drug‑development outcomes  
- **mRNA vaccines** (Pfizer‑BioNTech, Moderna) validated a new platform and generated >US$100 bn in sales, reshaping investor appetite for biotech.  
- **Gene‑therapy approvals**: **Zolgensma** (2020) and **Luxturna** (2017) demonstrated commercial viability of ultra‑expensive, one‑time treatments.  
- **CAR‑T therapies** (Kymriah, Yescarta) achieved FDA approval and sizable market uptake, though pricing and reimbursement remain contentious.  

### Pharma corporate finance trends  
- **R&D spending** by the top 10 pharma companies grew from ~US$70 bn (2012) to >US$100 bn (2024), despite periodic cost‑cutting initiatives.  
- **Share‑buybacks** continued robustly; from 2012‑2022, the industry repurchased >US$300 bn of equity, a practice that some analysts argue diverts funds from pipeline investment.  
- **M&A activity** remained high, with megadeals such as **Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s acquisition of Celgene (2019)** and **Pfizer’s purchase of Seagen (2023)**, reflecting a strategic shift toward acquiring innovative pipelines rather than building them internally.  

### Overall assessment  
The fear expressed in 2012—that cash‑rich tech firms would ignore biotech—proved **partially correct**: they have not become primary direct investors in drug pipelines. However, their **technology contributions (AI, data, cloud)** have become indispensable to modern biotech R&D, indirectly shaping the sector’s productivity. Meanwhile, **traditional biotech financing** (VC, public markets) expanded dramatically, and several high‑impact therapies reached patients, contradicting the notion that robust returns are unattainable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article or implied) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Big‑tech will stay out of pharma because they lack ideas** | True for *direct* drug‑development investment; Alphabet’s life‑science subsidiaries have modest budgets and no marketed drugs. However, AI breakthroughs (AlphaFold) and health‑platform services have become critical tools for biotech. |
| **A billion‑dollar “spare” fund could be deployed into biotech** | No single tech giant announced a dedicated $1 bn biotech fund. Alphabet’s Verily and Calico together have received multi‑billion allocations, but these are spread across many health‑tech projects, not a focused pharma pipeline. |
| **Pharma companies’ cash‑burn on R&D will be unsustainable, leading to share‑buybacks as a “luxury”** | Share‑buybacks did increase, but R&D budgets also grew. The industry has largely balanced buybacks with continued pipeline investment, though critics argue buybacks sometimes crowd out longer‑term research. |
| **If tech firms invested, biotech would see a wave of breakthroughs** | Indirectly, tech‑driven tools (AI, cloud) accelerated target identification and trial design, contributing to the rapid development of mRNA vaccines and gene therapies. Direct capital infusion remained limited. |
| **Investors would be scared off from biotech altogether** | Contrary to the article’s fear, biotech capital inflows grew dramatically, especially after 2020 when the pandemic highlighted the value of rapid vaccine development. Investor enthusiasm peaked in 2021‑2022, though a correction followed. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a prescient snapshot of a broader debate about capital allocation to high‑risk R&D. Its relevance endures because the tension between cash‑rich tech firms and the capital‑intensive biotech sector continues to shape investment strategies, even if the exact predictions were only partially realized.
