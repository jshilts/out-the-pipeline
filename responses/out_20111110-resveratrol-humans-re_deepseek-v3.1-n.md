# Resveratrol in Humans: Results of a Controlled Trial (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a landmark controlled trial of resveratrol in obese human subjects. The study, conducted by researchers in the Netherlands and Switzerland, was an 11-person double-blind crossover trial using 150mg of resveratrol daily for 30 days. The results showed that resveratrol reduced metabolic rate during rest and sleep while activating AMPK and increasing SIRT1 and PGC-1α protein levels in muscle tissue. The compound appeared to mimic the effects of calorie restriction by improving mitochondrial function, reducing liver fat content, lowering blood glucose and triglycerides, decreasing inflammation markers, and improving blood pressure.

The article notes the study came amid ongoing controversy about resveratrol's mechanisms and effects, with GSK having halted development of resveratrol-based compounds the previous year. The author highlights a key discrepancy: while mice showed increased energy expenditure with resveratrol treatment, these human subjects showed decreased metabolic rate, despite similar plasma concentrations achieved (though mice required 200-fold higher doses). The findings suggested resveratrol might be most beneficial under conditions of metabolic stress like obesity, with over 400 genes showing altered expression in muscle tissue, particularly affecting metabolic and inflammation pathways.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2011 study represented a peak of optimism about resveratrol's therapeutic potential, but subsequent developments proved disappointing. Despite promising mechanism-based evidence, resveratrol has not led to any FDA-approved drugs for metabolic conditions, longevity, or any other indication. Larger clinical trials failed to replicate the dramatic effects suggested by this early study.

Major pharmaceutical development programs for resveratrol and related sirtuin activators were ultimately abandoned. GSK, which had acquired Sirtris Pharmaceuticals for $720 million in 2008 based on resveratrol research, discontinued development of SRT501 (their lead resveratrol formulation) due to poor bioavailability and lack of efficacy in later trials. Subsequent sirtuin-targeted drug candidates also failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefits.

Long-term human studies of resveratrol supplementation have shown minimal effects on health outcomes. Meta-analyses of clinical trials indicate that while resveratrol may have some minor effects on inflammatory markers, it does not meaningfully impact body weight, insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular outcomes, or longevity in healthy or obese individuals. The compound's poor bioavailability remains a fundamental limitation. The sirtuin pathway's role in human aging and metabolism turned out to be far more complex than initially hoped, and the field has largely moved away from resveratrol as a therapeutic intervention.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **That resveratrol would lead to clinically meaningful metabolic improvements**: This did not materialize. Larger trials showed minimal to no clinical benefits for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or obesity-related conditions.

• **That this study would help resolve questions about sirtuin mechanisms and lead to better compounds**: While research continued, the specific sirtuin activation hypothesis has not translated into effective therapeutics. The fundamental mechanistic understanding remains incomplete and controversial.

• **That long-term effects on human morbidity and mortality would be established**: After more than a decade of additional research, no consistent evidence supports resveratrol providing meaningful longevity or healthspan benefits in humans.

• **That the metabolic stress hypothesis would be validated (benefits primarily in obese subjects)**: Subsequent research showed that while some biomarker effects may be more pronounced in metabolic disease, these rarely translate to clinically meaningful outcomes even in target populations.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article captured a pivotal moment when mechanistic understanding of resveratrol appeared poised to translate into therapeutic applications, but the field's subsequent failure to deliver on this promise makes it an instructive case study in the challenges of drug development and the gap between cellular mechanisms and clinical benefits.
