# A Word We Didn't Know We Needed (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief commentary by Derek Lowe, a pharmaceutical industry blogger, from February 2013. He discusses his amusement at receiving an invitation to a conference titled the "1st Annual Symposium of Drug Designology" (the term "designology" being an unusual construction, likely a portmanteau of "design" and "-ology"). He groups this event with other invitations he frequently receives for conferences in "provincial Chinese cities" that have "grandiose names," numerous sessions, and solicit "invited talks" in fields unrelated to the recipient's career. Lowe suggests these conferences are of low quality and expresses his hope that the newly coined term "drug designology" would quickly disappear from use.

## 2. HISTORY

The specific conference mentioned, the "1st Annual Symposium of Drug Designology," appears to have left no lasting historical footprint. A search for the exact term yields no significant results beyond references to this original blog post. This supports the author's anecdotal assessment that such conferences were often insignificant and did not contribute to the scientific discourse in a meaningful way.

The more general trend of what are often called "predatory conferences" has, however, continued and evolved since 2013. While Lowe specifically mentions China, this phenomenon is global. These conferences are characterized by aggressive email spamming, broad and impressive-sounding scope, a high volume of often low-quality presentations, and a primary business model based on collecting registration fees and publication charges rather than fostering genuine scientific exchange. The term "drug designology" itself never gained traction, but the underlying activity it represented persists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

*   **Prediction:** The author explicitly hoped the term "drug designology" would "submerge again."
    *   **Outcome:** This prediction was entirely accurate. The term "drug designology" never entered the scientific lexicon and remains an obscure curiosity mentioned only in reference to this blog post.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article's interest is almost entirely historical, serving as a minor, dated anecdote about an early-2010s perception of low-quality, potentially predatory scientific conferences. It has no bearing on the actual science, technology, drug development, or business of biotechnology. Its relevance is limited to the meta-discussion of scientific communication and conferences.
