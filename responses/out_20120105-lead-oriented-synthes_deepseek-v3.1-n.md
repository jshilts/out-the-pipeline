# Lead-Oriented Synthesis - What Might That Be? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a paper from GSK-Stevenage published in *Angewandte Chemie* proposing "Lead-Oriented Synthesis"—a call for academic chemists to develop synthetic methods that produce compounds fitting the physical property ranges desirable for drug discovery leads. The authors established criteria based on medicinal chemistry practice: successful oral drugs typically have logP values between 1-5, so lead compounds should start in the lower end of this range (logP -1 to 3), with molecular weights around 200-350, and avoid problematic functional groups that cause toxicity or metabolic issues.

The GSK analysis found that only about 2% of compounds in academic journals like the *Journal of Organic Chemistry* met these "lead-like" criteria—most were too large, too lipophilic, or contained problematic groups. The authors identified "cLogP drift" as a particular problem in library synthesis, where polar compounds tend to be lost during purification and workup, steering chemistry away from the drug-like property space. The paper was positioned as a challenge to academic synthetic chemists to develop robust reactions that work well with polar functionalities and don't generate problematic structural features, with the goal of better aligning academic synthetic chemistry with the practical needs of drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2012 call for lead-oriented synthesis occurred during a critical period when pharmaceutical companies were confronting declining R&D productivity despite massive investment. The recognition that academic and industrial chemistry had diverged was not new, but this paper provided concrete data to quantify the gap.

In subsequent years, several developments emerged that built upon these insights. The fragment-based drug design approaches mentioned in the article continued gaining traction in pharmaceutical discovery, with approved drugs like vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and venetoclax (Venclexta) demonstrating successful fragment-to-drug journeys that validated starting with smaller, more polar compounds. Academic chemistry gradually began responding to these challenges, with research groups increasingly incorporating "lead-like" property considerations into method development studies.

The pharmaceutical industry's focus on these issues intensified. In 2013, Pfizer published analyses linking high lipophilicity to clinical attrition, reinforcing the message. By the mid-2010s, concepts like "escape from flatland" (increasing complexity and three-dimensionality) became prominent in medicinal chemistry, influencing both industrial and academic synthesis strategies. The rise of PROTACs and other bifunctional molecules later in the 2010s created new challenges for property space, as these molecules necessarily exceeded traditional molecular weight guidelines.

From a practical impact perspective, many pharmaceutical companies did adjust their compound screening libraries toward more lead-like space, and fragment-based screening became a standard tool in drug discovery. However, the fundamental tension identified in the article—that chemistry is often easier and more productive outside the ideal medicinal chemistry property space—remained largely unresolved. Academic synthetic chemistry continued to prioritize creative complexity over practical utility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Academic chemists would need incentive structure changes to pursue lead-oriented synthesis**: This proved partially true. Some academic groups did shift focus, but primarily those already engaged with pharmaceutical industry collaboration. The broader academic synthetic chemistry community remained focused on traditional drivers (complex molecule synthesis, method novelty) rather than practical utility for drug discovery.

• **Fragment-based drug design would drive interest in lead-like chemistry**: This prediction was accurate. Fragment-based approaches became mainstream in pharmaceutical discovery, and the need for robust chemistry in lead-like space did increase. Several successful fragment-to-clinic programs demonstrated the value of starting small and growing compounds systematically within desirable property ranges.

• **More than one paper would be needed to drive change**: This was prescient. The GSK paper succeeded in highlighting the issue and providing a focus for discussion. However, the fundamental incentive misalignment between academic synthetic chemistry (where career advancement depends on novel, complex synthesis) and drug discovery needs (requiring practical, robust methods for simple molecules) remained a persistent challenge.

• **The intersection with diversity-oriented synthesis would provide impetus**: This showed mixed results. While fragment-based approaches did influence synthetic planning, the gap between academic synthetic targets and drug discovery needs remained substantial through the subsequent decade.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlighted a critical divergence between academic synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical industry needs, supported by quantitative analysis. While the immediate crisis of misalignment was already recognized within drug companies, bringing this issue to a broader academic chemistry audience helped frame ongoing discussions about translational science and industry-academic collaboration effectiveness.
