# Dear Practitioner, You Say? (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes a 2014 phishing email that appeared to come from the American Medical Association, inviting the recipient to click a link to access a shared Google Docs document. The author notes that while spam was common, this was the first medical/scientific phishing attack they had encountered. The article reflects on how phishing attacks differ from traditional spam by appearing plausible rather than obviously fraudulent, and raises concerns about whether fake emails from organizations like the American Chemical Society (ACS) might emerge and how successful they might be.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication, phishing attacks targeting the scientific and medical communities became increasingly common:

- **Rise in scientific phishing**: By 2016-2017, researchers and institutions began reporting sophisticated phishing campaigns specifically targeting scientists, including fake emails from scientific societies, conference organizers, and funding agencies.

- **Ransomware targeting healthcare**: The healthcare sector experienced major cyberattacks, most notably the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack that disrupted NHS hospitals in the UK and affected medical facilities worldwide.

- **Research data theft**: Several universities and research institutions reported breaches where attackers specifically targeted scientific data, though comprehensive statistics on success rates remain limited.

- **Email security improvements**: Scientific organizations implemented better email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and many adopted two-factor authentication by the late 2010s.

The author's concern proved prescient—scientific phishing attacks became a significant cybersecurity issue, though specific success rate data for these targeted campaigns is not publicly available in detailed form.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: Fake ACS emails would emerge
  - **Outcome**: The ACS and other scientific organizations did indeed become targets of phishing campaigns, with documented cases of fake conference invitations and grant notifications. However, many organizations improved their email security protocols, and the problem remained more limited than worst-case scenarios suggested.

- **Prediction**: Interest in success rates of such attacks
  - **Outcome**: Cybersecurity research did track scientific phishing success rates, though comprehensive public data remained limited due to underreporting. Some studies suggested academic institutions had higher vulnerability rates than private sector organizations.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article proved to be moderately prescient about emerging cybersecurity threats targeting the scientific community, correctly identifying a trend that would grow significantly in subsequent years. While not groundbreaking, it provided early awareness of a real and evolving threat vector.
