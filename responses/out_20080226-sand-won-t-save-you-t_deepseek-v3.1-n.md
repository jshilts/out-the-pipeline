# Sand Won't Save You This Time (February 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃), an extremely reactive chemical compound described as perhaps the most vigorous fluorinating agent known—more difficult to handle than fluorine gas itself. The author notes that the Germans during World War II investigated using it for flamethrowers but deemed it too dangerous to work with. The compound is described as a stronger oxidizing agent than oxygen, capable of burning materials typically considered non-flammable or already fully oxidized, including bricks, asbestos tile, and sand.

The article references a reported incident from the early 1950s where a one-ton spill burned through a foot of concrete floor and continued through a meter of sand and gravel beneath, producing toxic and corrosive by-products including hot hydrofluoric acid. Most notably, the author quotes extensively from John Clark's book "Ignition!" describing ClF₃ as hypergolic (self-igniting) with every known fuel, as well as with materials like cloth, wood, asbestos, and even test engineers. The piece serves as both a technical description and a warning about handling this exceptionally dangerous chemical.

## 2. HISTORY

Chlorine trifluoride continues to be a subject of discussion in chemical safety literature and industrial applications, maintaining its reputation as one of the most dangerous chemicals in routine industrial use. The compound has remained in limited but important applications, primarily in the semiconductor industry for cleaning oxides off surfaces, as mentioned in the original article.

Safety protocols and handling procedures for ClF₃ have evolved to become even more stringent since 2008. Major chemical safety organizations, including the US Chemical Safety Board and various industrial safety groups, continue to reference chlorine trifluoride in safety training materials as a case study in extreme chemical reactivity and the importance of proper industrial hygiene. The compound has seen some continued research interest in very specialized applications, including certain etching processes in microfabrication where its extreme reactivity is advantageous in controlled environments.

However, no major new applications have emerged that would increase its widespread use. The semiconductor industry has generally moved toward processes that avoid the most hazardous chemicals when possible, though chlorine trifluoride remains irreplaceable for certain specific applications. The compound is typically produced only by specialized chemical companies with appropriate safety infrastructure, and handling requires extensive training and specialized equipment.

The book "Ignition!" by John Clark, which the original article quoted, was republished in 2018, reintroducing Clark's classic descriptions of chlorine trifluoride and other dangerous rocket propellants to a new generation of readers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article made no explicit predictions about the future, functioning instead as a safety warning and technical description of chlorine trifluoride's properties. The piece was descriptive rather than predictive in nature. The author's concluding remark—"I'll be lacing mine up if anyone tries to bring the stuff into my lab"—was clearly hyperbolic and intended as a humorous safety warning rather than a testable prediction.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article provides an entertaining and educational discussion of an exceptionally dangerous chemical, its long-term significance is limited to a specialized niche of industrial chemistry and safety education. The piece serves its purpose as a safety warning effectively, but it does not address broader technological, scientific, or policy developments that would give it enduring importance.
