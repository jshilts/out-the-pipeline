# Getting Real With Real Cells (February 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a JACS paper from Benjamin Cravatt's lab at Scripps that examined activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) using a modified version of SAHA (Vorinostat), an FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor. The researchers attached both a photoaffinity label and an alkyne handle to SAHA to create a probe that could permanently bind to target proteins when exposed to light, then be fluorescently labeled via click chemistry. 

When tested on cell lysates (broken cells), the probe showed significant non-specific binding to many proteins beyond HDACs. Surprisingly, when tested in living cells, the labeling became much cleaner and more specific to HDAC enzymes. Further experiments with modified SAHA scaffolds showed that results from cell lysates didn't predict how well probes would perform in living cells. The paper's key finding was that in vitro labeling doesn't necessarily predict in situ labeling for activity-based protein profiling probes.

## 2. HISTORY

The specific experimental findings from this 2007 JACS paper highlighted a methodological principle rather than reporting a therapeutic breakthrough. After this publication:

**Scientific Method Adoption**: Activity-based protein profiling became increasingly sophisticated over the following decade. The Cravatt lab and others continued refining ABPP methods, developing more selective probes, and applying them to study various enzyme families including kinases, phosphatases, and proteases. The general principle of testing compounds in more physiologically relevant systems gained wider acceptance.

**Vorinostat's Clinical Journey**: SAHA (Vorinostat) had already received FDA approval in October 2006 for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma before these experiments. Post-2008, Vorinostat saw expanded use in combination therapies and off-label applications, though it never became a blockbuster drug. Later studies explored its use in solid tumors and other hematologic malignancies, with varying success.

**HDAC Inhibitor Development**: Multiple HDAC inhibitors entered clinical development following Vorinostat's approval. Romidepsin (Istodax) received FDA approval in 2009 for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, followed by belinostat (Beleodaq) in 2014 for peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and panobinostat (Farydak) in 2015 for multiple myeloma. However, success remained limited to specific hematologic malignancies rather than broad anticancer applications.

**Technique Evolution**: The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) for bioorthogonal chemistry, referenced in the article as a "click" reaction, became a standard tool in chemical biology. The Sharpless group received the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, validating the long-term importance of these methods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article doesn't make explicit predictions about future developments. Instead, it articulates a philosophical position about research methodology. If we consider this methodological stance as an implicit prediction:

• **Prediction**: That researchers should test compounds in the most complex biological systems possible rather than relying on simplified in vitro systems, because "the living system was much nicer than the surrogate."

• **Outcome**: This perspective became increasingly validated over time. The limitations of reductionist approaches in drug discovery became more apparent as drug development faced historically low success rates. The pharmaceutical industry gradually shifted toward more physiologically relevant assays, including 3D cell cultures, organoids, and earlier in vivo testing, though this transition was incremental rather than revolutionary. The complexity gap between cell lysates and intact organisms remains a significant challenge in drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses an important methodological insight with broad relevance to drug discovery, using a specific example from chemical biology. While not earth-shattering, it articulates a valuable principle about system complexity that has enduring relevance for how biological research and drug development should be conducted.
