# Not The Sort Of Thing You'd Work With, Given a Choice (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article critiques a research paper demonstrating SETD8 inhibitors discovered through high-throughput screening. The author, Derek Lowe, strongly questions the validity of three quinone-containing compounds (NSC663284, BVT948, and ryuvidine) as useful chemical tools for studying SETD8, an epigenetic enzyme that methylates lysine 20 on histone H4.

Lowe highlights the fundamental problem that quinones are undesirable in drug discovery due to their promiscuous reactivity—they can act as Michael acceptors, participate in redox reactions, and react with various nucleophiles. He specifically identifies them as "PAINS" (Pan-Assay Interference Compounds) that tend to produce false positives in screening assays. The article questions whether the cell cycle arrest phenotypes observed are truly due to SETD8 inhibition rather than the compounds' notorious off-target effects. Lowe notes that these compounds were already known to inhibit other enzymes (CDC25, CDK2/4, protein tyrosine phosphatases), undermining confidence in their selectivity for SETD8 research.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade largely validated Lowe's concerns about quinone-based SETD8 inhibitors:

**Scientific trajectory:** The specific quinone compounds discussed (NSC663284, BVT948, ryuvidine) did not become widely adopted chemical probes for SETD8. Instead, the field moved toward more selective inhibitors with better-defined mechanisms of action.

**SETD8 research progress:** Research on SETD8's biological functions continued, but with improved tools. Later studies established SETD8's critical roles in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and maintenance of genomic integrity. However, the quinone-based compounds from this 2014 paper did not emerge as standard research tools.

**Drug development outcomes:** No SETD8 inhibitor has reached FDA approval as of 2024. This target has proven challenging, though research on epigenetic modulators more broadly has advanced significantly. The compounds discussed in this article did not advance to clinical development, consistent with Lowe's concerns about their liabilities.

**PAINS awareness growth:** The scientific community's awareness of PAINS compounds substantially increased following this period, with more systematic approaches to flagging problematic chemotypes in early drug discovery. Many journals and screening facilities now employ PAINS filters to avoid wasting resources on promiscuous compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit predictions about the compounds' fate and broader implications:

- **Prediction:** That quinone-based inhibitors would be problematic for studying SETD8 function.
- **Actual outcome:** ✅ **Correct** - These compounds did not become standard SETD8 research tools, and the field pursued better characterized inhibitors.

- **Prediction:** That the selectivity profiles were insufficient (2.5-fold selectivity is "not a whole lot").
- **Actual outcome:** ✅ **Correct** - Adequate selectivity for chemical probes requires much more stringent criteria, typically at least 10-fold and often 100-fold selectivity.

- **Prediction:** That the "collective use of three compounds to offset off-target effects" strategy was flawed.
- **Actual outcome:** ✅ **Correct** - Such approaches are not standard practice because they compound rather than clarify off-target effects.

- **Prediction:** That these compounds would not advance without significant chemistry optimization.
- **Actual outcome:** ✅ **Correct** - The quinone compounds did not progress, though some later non-quinone SETD8 inhibitors emerged.

- **Prediction:** Quinones' reactive nature makes them poor starting points for lead optimization.
- **Actual outcome:** ✅ **Correct** - The drug discovery field generally avoids quinones due to reactive liability concerns.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates the critical importance of chemical validity in early drug discovery and represents a valuable teaching example about PAINS compounds that remains relevant to contemporary drug discovery challenges.
