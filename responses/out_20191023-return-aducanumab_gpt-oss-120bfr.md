# The Return of Aducanumab (Oct 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article recounts how Biogen / Eisai revived their Alzheimer’s‑targeting antibody aducanumab (marketed later as **Aduhelm**) after an earlier “futility” analysis in early 2019 had led the companies to abandon the drug. Biogen presented re‑analysed data from the two Phase III trials—**EMERGE** and **ENGAGE**—arguing that higher‑dose exposure, which occurred later in the studies, produced a modest but statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline on several clinical scales (most notably the CDR‑SB). The author notes that the two trials gave conflicting results, that the high‑dose subgroup in ENGAGE was very small, and that the FDA might demand another confirmatory trial or issue a conditional approval. He also warns of the huge financial and policy stakes if a disease‑modifying Alzheimer’s drug were approved, given the unmet need and potential billions in revenue.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome**  
* **June 2021** – The FDA granted **accelerated approval** to aducanumab (Aduhelm) on the basis of amyloid‑PET reduction, a surrogate endpoint, despite a split advisory committee (11 yes / 11 no). The approval required a post‑marketing confirmatory trial.  
* **March 2022** – Biogen announced that the confirmatory trial (the high‑dose ENGAGE cohort) failed to meet its primary clinical endpoint.  
* **January 2023** – Biogen voluntarily **withdrawn Aduhelm from the U.S. market** and stopped commercial distribution after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) decided not to cover the drug under Medicare.  

**Pricing and reimbursement**  
* Initial list price was **US $56 k per patient per year** (≈ $4.8 M per 85‑patient trial).  
* After backlash, Biogen cut the price to **US $28 k** in early 2022, but CMS still refused coverage, limiting uptake to a few specialty clinics and private insurers.  

**Commercial performance**  
* 2021 sales were negligible (drug launched July 2021).  
* 2022 reported **≈ US $1.2 B** in Aduhelm revenue, far below the multi‑billion‑dollar expectations expressed in the article.  
* By early 2023, sales had essentially ceased.  

**Impact on the field**  
* The controversy sharpened scrutiny of the **amyloid hypothesis** and of surrogate‑endpoint approvals.  
* **Lecanemab (Leqembi)**, another anti‑amyloid antibody from Eisai/Biogen, received FDA accelerated approval in **January 2023** and full approval in **July 2023**, with CMS granting conditional coverage after a confirmatory trial showed modest clinical benefit.  
* **Donanemab** (Eli Lilly) remains in Phase III; its outcome will be watched closely as a test of whether the amyloid approach can succeed under stricter trial designs.  

**Policy and payer response**  
* CMS’s “non‑coverage” decision set a precedent that FDA approval alone does not guarantee reimbursement for high‑cost Alzheimer’s therapies.  
* Several state Medicaid programs and private insurers followed CMS’s lead, further curtailing market penetration.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **FDA may grant approval (possibly conditional) without another Phase III** | FDA granted **accelerated (conditional) approval** in June 2021, but required a confirmatory trial. |
| **If approved, the drug could generate > $10 B/year in revenue** | Peak sales were **≈ $1 B/year** (2022) and fell to zero after withdrawal; the $10 B forecast never materialised. |
| **FDA might request a new Phase III trial** | The FDA’s post‑marketing requirement was exactly that: a confirmatory Phase III. The trial failed, leading to withdrawal. |
| **CMS/Medicare could be pressured to cover the drug** | CMS **refused coverage**, citing insufficient evidence of clinical benefit, which dramatically limited uptake. |
| **The drug’s approval would reshape Alzheimer’s drug‑expenditure landscape** | The short‑lived approval sparked debate but did **not** lead to widespread reimbursement; the anticipated reshaping of US drug spending did not occur. |
| **Other amyloid antibodies would soon follow if Aducanumab succeeded** | **Lecanemab** succeeded later (2023) under a more rigorous evidentiary framework; its path was arguably paved by the Aduhelm controversy. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The piece is highly interesting because it captured a pivotal moment in Alzheimer’s drug development, foreshadowed regulatory and payer battles that later unfolded, and highlighted the economic and ethical stakes that continue to influence the field.
