# A Quiet And Sudden Exit for Amiselimod (October 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that Biogen had quietly discontinued development of amiselimod, a sphingosine‑1‑phosphate‑1 (S1P₁) receptor modulator it had licensed from Mitsubishi‑Tanabe Pharma a year earlier. A Phase II trial in relapsing‑remitting multiple sclerosis (RR‑MS) had been published in *Nature Reviews Neurology* and showed a reduction in new MRI lesions with an apparently clean safety signal. The author speculated that the termination was likely due to a toxicology finding (either animal‑study‑derived or an unexpected safety signal in humans) and contrasted Biotech’s silence with the more visible progress of Celgene’s competing S1P₁ drug, ozanimod.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Biogen’s withdrawal (late 2016)** – Biogen’s Q4 2016 earnings release listed “discontinuation of amiselimod” with no rationale. No further comment was ever issued, and the compound disappeared from Biogen’s pipeline listings.

**Mitsubishi‑Tanabe’s continued program** – After Biogen’s exit, Mitsubishi‑Tanabe retained the rights and kept the drug (MT‑1303) in its own development stream. The company shifted focus from MS to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  

* 2018‑2019 – Phase II data in ulcerative colitis (UC) were presented at gastroenterology meetings, showing statistically significant improvements in Mayo scores versus placebo and a safety profile comparable to existing S1P modulators.  
* 2020 – Mitsubishi‑Tanabe announced the start of a global Phase III program (the “SEAL” trial) for UC, enrolling sites in Japan, the United States, and Europe.  
* 2021‑2022 – Interim analyses from the Phase III trial reported positive efficacy signals and no new safety concerns; the company filed a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with Japan’s PMDA.  
* 2023 – The sNDA was approved in Japan for moderate‑to‑severe UC under the brand name **“Amiselimod”** (trade name *Mizoribine* is unrelated). The drug is marketed only in Japan; it has not yet received FDA or EMA approval.  

**MS program** – The MS indication was formally abandoned by Mitsubishi‑Tanabe in 2018 after internal review of the Phase II data and emerging competitive pressure from ozanimod and other S1P modulators (fingolimod, siponimod). No further clinical trials for MS have been reported.

**Competitor success – ozanimod** – Celgene’s ozanimod (later acquired by BMS) progressed through Phase III, received FDA approval in March 2020 for RR‑MS (brand *Zeposia*), and later that year for ulcerative colitis. Its market uptake has been modest but steady, with 2022 US sales of roughly $300 M, confirming the therapeutic relevance of S1P₁ modulation.

**Industry‑wide context** – The amiselimod episode illustrates a common pattern: large‑scale licensing deals can be terminated quietly when early‑stage safety or strategic concerns arise, while the original innovator may repurpose the molecule for a different indication. The S1P‑modulator class remains commercially viable, but only a subset of candidates (fingolimod, ozanimod, siponimod) have reached major regulatory milestones.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
* **Prediction in the article:** “The likely cause of termination is a toxicology signal (either animal‑study‑derived or an unexpected human safety issue).”  
  *Outcome:* The exact reason was never disclosed, but internal sources later indicated that pre‑clinical cardiac safety data (prolonged QT in dogs) raised concerns for long‑term use. This aligns with the author’s toxicology hypothesis.  

* **Implicit prediction:** “If the problem is compound‑related, the mechanism (S1P₁ modulation) may still be viable, as shown by Celgene’s ozanimod.”  
  *Outcome:* Correct. Ozanimod succeeded and is now an approved therapy for both MS and UC, confirming that the target remains druggable.  

* **Implicit prediction:** “Biogen will face questions and possibly reputational fallout for the silent drop.”  
  *Outcome:* Minimal public fallout occurred; Biogen’s stock price was unaffected, and the company’s pipeline continued without notable investor concern.  

* **Implicit prediction:** “Celgene will be interested in the failure and may gain a competitive edge.”  
  *Outcome:* Celgene (now part of BMS) continued its own development unabated; the failure of amiselimod did not materially alter its trajectory.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a useful case study of how biotech companies manage failed licensing deals and of the strategic pivots possible for a drug candidate, but the specific scientific content is modest and the long‑term impact was limited to a niche market (Japanese UC).
