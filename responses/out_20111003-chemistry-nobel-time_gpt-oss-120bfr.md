# Chemistry Nobel Time (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post was written in early October 2011, just before the announcement of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The author surveys several “prediction” lists (ChemBark, Thomson Reuters, Wavefunction) and highlights a handful of research areas that he believes have the strongest odds of winning either that year or in the near future. The top contenders he cites are:

* **Spectroscopy & application of lasers** (e.g., Zare, Moerner)  
* **Nuclear hormone signaling** (Chambon, Evans, Jensen)  
* **Bio‑inorganic chemistry** (Gray, Lippard, Holm)  
* **Techniques in DNA synthesis** (Caruthers, Hood)  

He also notes Thomson Reuters’ three short‑list topics—electrochemistry (Bard), molecular dynamics (Karplus), and dendritic polymers (Fréchet, Tomalia, Vögtle)—and expresses skepticism about dendrimers. Finally, he speculates that future Nobel chemistry prizes might eventually recognize directed‑evolution methods, activity‑based protein profiling, nanomachines, photochemical energy conversion, GPCR structural biology, and DNA‑based diagnostics, but he does not expect any “surprise” winner in 2011.

## 2. HISTORY  

### What actually won in 2011  
The 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded **solely to Dan Shechtman** “for the discovery of quasicrystals.” None of the candidates or fields discussed in the article were selected that year.

### Subsequent fate of the highlighted fields  

| Field / Person | Major post‑2011 developments (up to 2026) | Real‑world impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Laser spectroscopy / single‑molecule spectroscopy (Zare, Moerner)** | Moerner (with Eric Betzig) later received the 2014 Nobel in Physics for super‑resolution microscopy; Zare continued to be a leading figure in physical chemistry but has not received a Nobel. The techniques have become routine in single‑molecule biophysics and quantum optics. | Widely adopted in biology, materials science, and quantum information; commercial instruments from companies such as Zeiss and Leica. |
| **Nuclear hormone signaling (Chambon, Evans, Jensen)** | Robert J. L. Chambon (2006 Nobel) and others continued influential work; the field produced several FDA‑approved drugs targeting nuclear receptors (e.g., PPAR agonists, FXR agonists). No Nobel prize has been awarded for this area since 2011. | Nuclear‑receptor drugs remain a major therapeutic class (e.g., diabetes, cholesterol, inflammatory diseases). |
| **Bio‑inorganic chemistry (Gray, Lippard, Holm)** | Lippard’s work on platinum anticancer agents led to continued clinical use of cisplatin and newer complexes (e.g., oxaliplatin). Gray’s research on metal‑based imaging agents progressed, but no new Nobel has been given. | Platinum drugs remain standard chemotherapy; metal‑based imaging agents are used clinically (e.g., gadolinium MRI agents). |
| **Techniques in DNA synthesis (Caruthers, Hood)** | Caruthers’ phosphoramidite chemistry is still the backbone of commercial oligonucleotide synthesis. Hood’s work on synthetic biology and genome‑editing tools (e.g., CRISPR‑Cas) built on early DNA‑assembly methods. No Nobel yet, but the field underpins the 2020 Nobel in Chemistry (CRISPR). | Oligonucleotide therapeutics (e.g., antisense, siRNA, mRNA vaccines) exploded after 2020; the synthesis platform is essential for all of them. |
| **Electrochemistry (Bard)** | Bard’s textbooks remain standard; electrochemical sensors (glucose meters) and energy‑storage technologies (Li‑ion, flow batteries) have grown, but no Nobel award. | Massive commercial market for electrochemical devices; research on CO₂ reduction and water splitting intensified. |
| **Molecular dynamics (Karplus)** | Karplus (and co‑author J. A. McCammon) received the 2013 Nobel in Chemistry for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems (including molecular dynamics). | MD is now a routine tool in drug discovery, materials design, and protein folding (e.g., AlphaFold‑MD hybrid workflows). |
| **Dendritic polymers (Fréchet, Tomalia, Vögtle)** | Dendrimers have found niche applications (drug delivery, imaging) but never achieved the broad impact predicted by citation counts. No Nobel award. | Limited commercial uptake; some FDA‑approved dendrimer‑based drugs (e.g., VivaGel) exist, but the field remains specialized. |
| **Directed‑evolution methods** | Frances Arnold received the 2018 Nobel in Chemistry for the directed evolution of enzymes. The technique is now standard in industrial biocatalysis and synthetic biology. | Enzyme‑based processes dominate many green‑chemistry routes; numerous commercial enzymes are engineered by directed evolution. |
| **Activity‑based protein profiling / in‑vivo cell labeling** | The approach matured into widely used chemoproteomics platforms; several biotech companies (e.g., ChemProteo) commercialized kits. No Nobel yet. | Enables drug target identification and covalent inhibitor design; integrated into many pharmaceutical pipelines. |
| **Nanotech / molecular machines** | The 2016 Nobel in Chemistry (Stoddart, Feringa, Sauvage) recognized molecular machines, a direct descendant of early nanotech work. | Molecular‑machine concepts are now being explored for drug delivery and data storage, though commercial products are still emerging. |
| **Photochemical energy conversion (CO₂ fixation, H₂ generation)** | Significant research progress, especially in photocatalytic water splitting and artificial photosynthesis, but no Nobel award. | Pilot plants and pilot‑scale reactors exist; still far from large‑scale deployment. |
| **GPCR structural biology** | The 2012 Nobel in Chemistry (Cherezov, Stevens, Kobilka) honored GPCR structure determination, confirming the author’s intuition that the field would be recognized soon. | GPCR structures have accelerated drug discovery; dozens of FDA‑approved GPCR‑targeted drugs launched after 2012. |
| **DNA‑based diagnostics** | The 2020 Nobel in Chemistry (Charpentier, Doudna) for CRISPR‑based genome editing indirectly validated DNA‑based diagnostics; rapid‑test platforms (e.g., COVID‑19 PCR, CRISPR‑based SHERLOCK) became mainstream. | DNA diagnostics now dominate infectious‑disease testing and are expanding into oncology (liquid biopsies). |

### Business and policy outcomes  
* **Pharmaceutical pipelines**: The nuclear‑receptor and GPCR fields continued to attract billions in R&D spend; several blockbuster drugs (e.g., GLP‑1 agonists) entered the market after 2015.  
* **Biotech growth**: Companies built around directed evolution (e.g., Codexis, Evolva) grew to multi‑billion‑dollar valuations.  
* **Regulatory landscape**: The FDA’s 2018 guidance on gene‑editing therapeutics (CRISPR) reflected the maturation of DNA‑synthesis and editing technologies discussed in the article.  
* **Industry consolidation**: Large chemical firms (e.g., BASF, Dow) acquired niche dendrimer and electrochemical sensor startups, but the overall market impact of dendrimers remained modest.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“Zare/Moerner (single‑molecule spectroscopy) will definitely win at some point.”*  
  **Outcome:** Moerner shared the 2014 Nobel in Physics (not Chemistry). Zare has not received a Nobel. The field is highly influential but has not yet been recognized by the Chemistry prize.

- **Prediction:** *“Nuclear hormone signaling (Chambon/Evans/Jensen) could win.”*  
  **Outcome:** No Nobel awarded for this area to date (2026). The work remains scientifically important and clinically relevant, but the prize has not materialized.

- **Prediction:** *“Bioinorganic chemistry (Gray/Lippard/Holm) could win.”*  
  **Outcome:** Still no Nobel. The field continues to produce important drugs and catalysts, but the Chemistry prize has not been given for it.

- **Prediction:** *“Techniques in DNA synthesis (Caruthers/Hood) could win.”*  
  **Outcome:** No Nobel yet, though DNA‑based technologies (CRISPR) earned the 2020 Chemistry prize, indirectly validating the importance of DNA synthesis.

- **Prediction:** *“Electrochemistry (Bard) and Molecular dynamics (Karplus) are strong contenders.”*  
  **Outcome:** Karplus indeed won the 2013 Nobel in Chemistry (for multiscale models, which includes molecular dynamics). Bard has not won, though electrochemistry remains a core discipline.

- **Prediction:** *“Dendritic polymers unlikely to win this year.”*  
  **Outcome:** Correct; dendrimers have not received a Nobel as of 2026.

- **Prediction (future):** *“Directed‑evolution methods will eventually win.”*  
  **Outcome:** Realized in 2018 (Frances Arnold). The author’s foresight was accurate.

- **Prediction (future):** *“GPCR structure will be Nobel‑worthy.”*  
  **Outcome:** Realized in 2012 (Kobilka, Stevens, Cherezov). The author correctly anticipated the timeline.

- **Prediction (future):** *“Nanotech/molecular machines will win once they connect with the real world.”*  
  **Outcome:** The 2016 Nobel recognized molecular machines (Stoddart, Feringa, Sauvage). The field has begun to see prototype devices, aligning with the author’s view.

- **Prediction (future):** *“Photochemical energy technology will be a strong candidate when world‑changing enough.”*  
  **Outcome:** No Nobel yet; the field is still emerging and has not reached the “world‑changing” threshold recognized by the Academy.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a snapshot of Nobel‑prediction culture and accurately highlights several research areas that later earned Nobel recognition (molecular dynamics, directed evolution, GPCRs, molecular machines). Its miss on the actual 2011 winner (quasicrystals) is understandable given the timing, and the piece offers a useful lens on how citation‑driven speculation can both succeed and fail.
