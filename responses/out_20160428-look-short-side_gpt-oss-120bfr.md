# A Look From the Short Side (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a commentary on Jim Chanos’s short‑sell thesis against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (later Bausch Health).  Chanos argued that Valeant’s “no‑R&D, buy‑and‑price‑hike” strategy was a financial illusion built on aggressive acquisitions, aggressive price increases (often 800 % on legacy drugs), and accounting tricks that treated acquisition‑related amortisation as non‑cash “pro‑forma” earnings.  The author echoes Chanos’s warning, noting the similarity to past corporate scandals (WorldCom, Enron) and pointing out that the company’s reliance on a handful of former McKinsey consultants and accountant‑type CEOs should be a red flag.  The article concludes that the market’s temporary enthusiasm was driven by herd‑like hedge‑fund buying, and that once reality set in the stock would (and eventually did) tumble.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2016 fallout**  
* **Leadership and re‑branding** – Michael Pearson resigned as CEO in October 2016; Joseph Papa took over in early 2017.  In April 2018 the firm renamed itself **Bausch Health Companies Inc.** to distance from the Valeant brand.  
* **Financial performance** – After the peak of ~US$260 per share in mid‑2015, the stock fell to below US$30 by the end of 2016 and has hovered in the US$15‑30 range through 2025.  Revenue has remained roughly flat (≈US$8 billion annually) while profit margins have been squeezed by price‑cut pressures and higher R&D spend.  
* **Regulatory and legal outcomes** – Valeant settled a series of investigations: a 2017 U.S. Department of Justice settlement over alleged “price‑inflation” schemes with specialty pharmacies (including a $45 million civil penalty), and a 2019 settlement with the New York Attorney General for $45 million related to alleged misrepresentations to investors.  No criminal charges were filed against executives.  
* **Business model shift** – The “ditch‑R&D” approach was largely abandoned.  Starting in 2018 Bausch Health increased its R&D budget to ~US$1 billion (≈12 % of sales) and began developing its own pipeline (e.g., dermatology and ophthalmology candidates).  The company now markets a mix of legacy products, newly acquired assets, and a modest pipeline, but has not returned to the high‑growth acquisition‑only model.  
* **Industry impact** – Valeant’s collapse heightened scrutiny of “price‑gouging” practices.  The 2016‑2019 wave of U.S. congressional hearings on drug pricing referenced Valeant as a cautionary example, and the FDA and state attorneys general have been more aggressive in reviewing specialty‑pharmacy arrangements.  However, other “acquisition‑first” firms (e.g., Mylan, now Viatris; and later, Alvogen) continued to pursue similar strategies, albeit with more transparent accounting and modest price‑increase policies.  
* **Product outcomes** – Since 2016 Bausch Health has secured a handful of FDA approvals (e.g., a 2020 dermatology topical for acne, a 2021 ophthalmic anti‑inflammatory).  None have become blockbuster revenues; the company’s top‑selling products remain legacy drugs such as **Jublia** (onychomycosis) and **Cymbalta** (depressed after the 2019 sale of the latter to Eli Lilly).  

**Bottom line:** The firm survived the scandal but never regained its former valuation, and the aggressive “no‑R&D, price‑hike” playbook proved unsustainable at scale.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article contains several implicit or explicit forecasts.  Their actual outcomes are listed below.

| Prediction (as expressed in the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Valeant’s model would collapse once the “magic money box” ran out of steam.** | The stock crashed > 90 % from its 2015 peak, the company was forced to restate earnings, and the acquisition‑only model was largely abandoned. |
| **Other pharma firms would be reluctant to copy the “ditch‑R&D” approach.** | True for large, diversified pharma (e.g., Pfizer, Merck).  Some specialty‑focused firms continued acquisition‑heavy strategies, but they paired them with modest R&D spend and faced tighter regulatory review. |
| **Regulators and investigators would eventually expose the accounting tricks.** | Multiple investigations (DOJ, NY AG) resulted in civil settlements and forced changes to how acquisition amortisation is disclosed. |
| **Hedge‑fund herd behavior would reverse once reality set in.** | Hedge‑funds that had been long Valeant turned short or exited by late 2016; the “follow‑the‑leader” buying stopped, and the stock’s volatility increased dramatically. |
| **The price‑inflation model would be unsustainable because payers would push back.** | Payers (e.g., Medicare, large pharmacy benefit managers) increasingly demanded rebates and price‑justifications; Valeant’s 2015‑2016 price hikes were cited in congressional hearings, leading to broader industry pressure on price‑setting. |

Overall, the article’s warnings were largely borne out by subsequent events.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a concise, prescient critique of a high‑profile corporate scandal that foreshadowed major regulatory and market shifts; its relevance persists for anyone studying finance‑driven biotech strategies, even though the specific firm’s story is now largely a cautionary footnote.
