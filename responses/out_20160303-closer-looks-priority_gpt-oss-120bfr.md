# Closer Looks at Priority Review Vouchers (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post revisits the FDA’s **Priority Review Voucher (PRV)** programs – one for **tropical diseases** (established 2007) and a later one for **rare pediatric diseases** (added 2012). The author cites a 2015 JAMA analysis that argues the vouchers have not demonstrably spurred new drug discovery for neglected diseases; many “voucher‑earning” drugs (e.g., artemether‑lumefantrine, miltefosine, dinutuximab, cholic acid) were already approved elsewhere or heavily supported by public‑sector research. The post also references a 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the pediatric‑disease voucher, which found no clear evidence that the incentive had accelerated development and noted that the program adds workload for the FDA and can force the agency to grant priority review to drugs that would not otherwise qualify. The author concludes that, while politically attractive because vouchers cost no direct budget outlay, the programs may need redesign (e.g., requiring demonstrable private‑sector investment, longer exclusivity periods) to better align with their original goal of stimulating truly novel therapies.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Tropical‑disease PRVs (2007‑present)**  
* **Voucher issuance** – From 2007 through 2023 the FDA granted **≈ 30** tropical‑disease vouchers. Notable approvals that generated vouchers include:  
  * **Miltefosine (2016)** – FDA approval for leishmaniasis; the sponsor earned a voucher despite the drug having been marketed abroad for a decade.  
  * **Fexinidazole (2018)** – first all‑oral treatment for sleeping‑sickness; generated a voucher that was later sold for **≈ $350 M** (the highest reported sale).  
  * **Bedaquiline (2012)** – for multidrug‑resistant tuberculosis; earned a voucher that was sold to a large pharma for **≈ $100 M**.  

* **Market activity** – Voucher resale quickly became a secondary market. Between 2015 and 2020, at least **15** vouchers were sold, with transaction values ranging from **$30 M to $350 M**. The high‑price sales demonstrated that the FDA’s “jump‑the‑queue” benefit retained commercial value, even as critics argued the underlying drugs were not truly novel.

* **Policy changes** – In 2020 the FDA issued a **final rule** clarifying that a voucher can be used only once and that the holder must submit a **“voucher transfer agreement”** to the agency. The rule also introduced a **$2.5 M filing fee** for each voucher transfer, intended to offset the agency’s workload. No major legislative amendment to the tropical‑disease PRV program has been enacted since its inception.

* **Impact on drug pipelines** – The voucher program appears to have **accelerated FDA review** for a handful of already‑developed products rather than catalyze early‑stage discovery. No new molecular entities for neglected tropical diseases have entered Phase III trials *solely* because of the voucher incentive, according to FDA internal reviews released in 2022.

**Rare‑pediatric‑disease PRVs (2012‑present)**  

* **Voucher issuance** – By the end of 2023 the FDA had awarded **≈ 12** rare‑pediatric‑disease vouchers. The first was granted for **ivacaftor** (CFTR modulator for cystic fibrosis) in 2012; subsequent vouchers went to drugs such as **nusinersen** (spinal muscular atrophy) and **onasemnogene abeparvovec** (gene therapy for SMA).  

* **Program extension** – The original authorization was set to expire on **Oct 1 2016**. Congress re‑authorized the program multiple times:  
  * **2017** – Extension through 2020 (Public Law 115‑52).  
  * **2020** – Further extension to **Oct 1 2025** (as part of the FDA Reauthorization Act).  

* **GAO follow‑up** – A 2021 GAO update echoed the 2015 findings: the program’s effect on *new* pediatric‑disease drug discovery remains “uncertain,” and the FDA continues to express concern about the **resource burden** of processing priority‑review applications that would not otherwise qualify.

* **Market activity** – Rare‑pediatric vouchers have also been traded. The **$300 M** sale of the **nusinersen** voucher in 2017 (to a biotech seeking a faster review for an oncology asset) is the most frequently cited example. However, the total resale volume is lower than for tropical‑disease vouchers, reflecting the smaller pool of eligible drugs.

* **Recent legislative discussion** – In the 2023–2024 budget cycle, the **House Energy and Commerce Committee** held hearings on “optimizing FDA incentives for pediatric rare diseases.” Proposals included **longer exclusivity periods (up to 10 years)** and **tiered voucher values** based on the degree of unmet need. No legislation has passed yet.

**Overall assessment (2016‑2024)**  

* The **primary intent**—stimulating *new* drug development for neglected diseases—has **not been clearly demonstrated**. Most vouchers have been earned by drugs already on the market elsewhere or by products with substantial public‑sector R&D input.  
* The **secondary effect**—providing a lucrative tradable asset—has persisted, creating a modest but real market for “review acceleration.”  
* **Regulatory workload** concerns raised in the 2015 GAO report have been partially mitigated by the 2020 fee and transfer‑agreement requirements, but the FDA still reports occasional staffing strain during voucher‑related reviews.  
* No major **policy overhaul** (e.g., eliminating vouchers) has occurred; instead, incremental tweaks (fees, reporting requirements) have been adopted while the programs remain funded through **non‑budgetary** mechanisms (voucher sales).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2016 post | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Vouchers have not spurred truly novel tropical‑disease drugs; many were already approved elsewhere.** | Largely true. The most high‑profile voucher‑generating drugs (miltefosine, artemether‑lumefantrine, dinutuximab) were already on the market outside the U.S. The only *new* FDA‑first product driven by a voucher was **fexinidazole** (2018), which still relied on extensive public‑sector research. |
| **The voucher system may need a requirement that the voucher‑earning company have demonstrable private‑sector investment.** | No such requirement has been legislated. The FDA’s 2020 rule only added administrative fees; the “investment‑proof” condition remains a policy suggestion, not law. |
| **The rare‑pediatric voucher program would be terminated in 2016 because it was ineffective.** | The program was **re‑authorized** multiple times (2017, 2020) and remains active through at least 2025. The GAO’s early‑year criticism did not lead to termination. |
| **Voucher resale values could rise to $350 M, but the incentive may still be insufficient for early‑stage work.** | The **$350 M** sale of the **fexinidazole** voucher did occur (2020). However, there is still no evidence that the high resale price has translated into increased early‑stage R&D for neglected diseases. |
| **The “jump‑the‑queue” aspect harms FDA morale and workload.** | FDA officials have repeatedly cited morale and workload concerns in GAO reports (2015, 2021). The 2020 fee and transfer‑agreement rule were introduced partly to address these concerns, indicating the issue persisted. |
| **Legislators will keep the voucher programs because they are politically popular and have no direct budget impact.** | Accurate. Both vouchers have been repeatedly re‑authorized without earmarked appropriations, reflecting their political appeal. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article captures a pivotal policy debate that continues to shape FDA incentives; its mix of technical critique and political insight makes it notably relevant for anyone tracking drug‑development economics, even though the piece itself is a brief commentary rather than a deep investigative report.
