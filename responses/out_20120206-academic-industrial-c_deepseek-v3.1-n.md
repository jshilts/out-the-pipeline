# The Academic-Industrial Collaboration in Drug Discovery Panel: Today (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post announced a panel discussion on industry-academic collaborations in drug discovery taking place at the SLAS (Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening) meeting in San Diego on February 6, 2012. The author, who served as moderator, provided a live stream link and invited readers to submit questions for the panel via comments, noting they would monitor feedback during the event. The post included an update linking to the full recorded session afterward, making the discussion available to those who missed the live stream.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2012 panel occurred during a period of significant transformation in pharmaceutical R&D. Major developments in the subsequent decade included:

**Industry consolidation and outsourcing trends**: Many large pharmaceutical companies continued to reduce internal discovery research while expanding external partnerships with academia and biotech. For example, between 2010-2020, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline closed or downsized multiple R&D sites while increasing collaboration spending.

**NIH funding impact**: The NIH budget faced sequestration in 2013, constraining academic research funding and increasing pressure on universities to seek industry partnerships. From 2012-2022, NIH funding growth averaged approximately 2-3% annually in real terms, below historical averages.

**Collaboration models evolved**: New models emerged including "open innovation" platforms, academic drug discovery centers, and risk-sharing partnerships. Notable examples include the Structural Genomics Consortium (founded earlier but expanded significantly post-2012), and various biotech incubators co-located with academic institutions.

**Regulatory changes**: The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) included provisions encouraging FDA-academic-industry collaborations, though implementation has been gradual with mixed results in accelerating drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original post did not contain specific predictions about future developments in industry-academic collaborations. The post was primarily an announcement of the panel discussion rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This post serves primarily as an event announcement with limited analytical content. While industry-academic collaboration remained an important topic, this specific post contributed minimal substantive content beyond logistical information about one panel discussion.
