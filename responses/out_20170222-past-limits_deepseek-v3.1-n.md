# Past the Limits (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses Michael Gilman's proposal to expand drug discovery beyond traditional protein targets by targeting RNA with small molecules. The author notes that while RNA interference and oligonucleotide therapies had dominated RNA-focused drug development, conventional small molecules targeting RNA structures deserved more attention. Evidence included approved antibiotics that bind ribosomal RNA, Novartis's LMI070 (a small molecule binding SMN2 pre-mRNA for spinal muscular atrophy), and Merck's ribocil (targeting bacterial riboswitches). The article extends this reasoning to other underexplored biomolecule classes—complex carbohydrates and lipids—arguing that these represent vast untapped opportunities in medicinal chemistry due to their biological importance and the lack of systematic screening approaches.

## 2. HISTORY
The article's timing proved prescient for RNA-targeting small molecules. **Risdiplam (RG7916)**, closely related to the mentioned LMI070 mechanism, received FDA approval in August 2020 for spinal muscular atrophy, with strong patient uptake and robust clinical efficacy data. **Branaplam (LMI070)** itself continued development but faced challenges and Novartis revised its strategy, eventually discontinuing some trials while pursuing others in different populations.

The broader field of RNA-targeted small molecules expanded significantly:
- **H3 Biomedicine and Eisai** advanced RNA-splicing modulators for oncology
- **Skyhawk Therapeutics** emerged as a major player, raising over $100M and advancing multiple RNA splicing programs
- **Arrakis Therapeutics** launched with RNA-targeting platforms and built a substantial pipeline
- **Ribometrix** (acquired by Vertex in 2022 for undisclosed terms) developed RNA structure-based drug discovery platforms
- **Expansion Therapeutics** (founded 2018) raised $55M Series A focusing on RNA small molecule therapeutics

By 2024, dozens of small molecules targeting RNA were in clinical development across companies including **Reviral, Anima Biotech, Storm Therapeutics, and Gotham Therapeutics**.

For **complex carbohydrates**, progress remained limited. **Glycomimetics** continued developing selectin antagonists, with **Uproleselan** (GMI-1271) reaching Phase 3 trials for AML. The Novo Nordisk glucose binder challenge mentioned was indeed withdrawn without publicized success. Carbohydrate-targeting small molecules largely remained confined to specific applications like influenza neuraminidase inhibitors and some antiviral agents, but systematic screening platforms failed to achieve widespread adoption.

In **lipids**, the situation evolved more positively. **Eicosanoid pathway drugs** (targeting prostaglandins, leukotrienes) saw expanded use. **S1P receptor modulators** like **Fingolimod**, **Siponimod**, and **Ozanimod** demonstrated clinical success for multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. The **PCSK9 inhibitors** (evolocumab, alirocumab) addressed lipid metabolism indirectly. More direct lipid-targeting approaches emerged with **Elamipretide** (targeting cardiolipin) and various **fatty acid synthase inhibitors** in oncology trials. However, lipid target validation remained challenging due to complex biology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Small molecules targeting RNA deserved more development than they'd received**
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Post-2017 saw significant industry investment, multiple biotech IPOs/funding rounds totaling hundreds of millions, and a robust clinical pipeline of RNA-targeting small molecules across various therapeutic areas.

• **Prediction: RNA interference and oligonucleotides had taken up too much focus, crowding out small molecule approaches to RNA**
  - **Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. Oligonucleotide therapies continued advancing (e.g., **Inclisiran** approved 2021, **Vutrisiran** 2022), but small molecule RNA targeting emerged as a complementary rather than competitive approach. The two modalities generally addressed different therapeutic niches.

• **Prediction: Complex carbohydrates were "almost completely underexploited" and represented major opportunities**
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate but unresolved**. The field remained underexploited through 2024. While important advances occurred in glycobiology understanding and some glycan-targeting drugs emerged, systematic small molecule development against carbohydrate targets never achieved the traction seen in RNA targeting.

• **Prediction: Lipids were starting to get more attention but knowledge remained inadequate**
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate directionally**. Lipid-targeting drugs expanded significantly (S1P modulators, PCSK9 inhibitors), and lipid metabolism became a major therapeutic area. However, fundamental lipid biology complexity continued limiting rapid progress, confirming the article's assessment of inadequate knowledge.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience about the emerging RNA-targeting small molecule field, correctly identifying an important shift in drug discovery paradigms while effectively contextualizing it within broader untapped biomolecular opportunities.
