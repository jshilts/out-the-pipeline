# What Compound Will You Never Forget? (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal blog post by Derek Lowe, written in his "In the Pipeline" column at Science magazine. The author reflects on how seeing references to 1,6-anhydroglucose (levoglucosan) triggers mixed feelings—interest combined with dread—even thirty years after his experiences with the compound. He links to a 2006 post explaining his history with the substance, indicating it likely caused significant difficulties or memorable challenges during his work.

The piece is framed as an informal question to the chemistry community, asking fellow chemists to share their own memorable compounds—whether positive or negative experiences—that left lasting impressions. The tone is conversational and anecdotal, seeking personal stories rather than technical analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

This article is a reflective piece rather than a predictive or analytical one, so there were no specific developments to track or concrete impacts to measure. The post served its purpose as intended: it generated community engagement and personal anecdotes in the comments section, where chemists shared their own memorable compound experiences.

The broader context is that Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog remained an influential voice in chemistry and pharmaceutical industry commentary for years after this post, continuing until at least 2024 with his regular analysis of drug development, clinical trials, and industry trends. The blog's format of blending technical knowledge with personal perspective and community engagement proved enduring and popular within the chemistry community.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contained no predictions about scientific developments, industry trends, or future technologies. It was explicitly retrospective and anecdotal in nature, asking readers to share past experiences rather than anticipate future ones.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While enjoyable for chemistry enthusiasts and valuable for community building, the article has limited broader scientific or societal significance. It's a personal reflection piece with narrow scope and no analytical content about biotechnology industry developments or scientific advances.
