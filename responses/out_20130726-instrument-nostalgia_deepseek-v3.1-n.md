# Instrument Nostalgia (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog-style commentary reflects on old laboratory NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) equipment, prompted by a blog post on "Lab Instrument Nostalgia." The author acknowledges some sentimental value in vintage instruments but primarily expresses relief at no longer using outdated technology. Specific examples include JEOL NMR machines with blue screens and light pens, and a water-cooled 80 MHz NMR instrument manufactured by IBM. The tone is light and nostalgic rather than substantive, with the author describing their reaction to such equipment today as "interested horror" rather than genuine longing for older technology.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in 2013, NMR technology continued its steady evolution toward higher field strengths, improved digital interfaces, automation, and cryogenically-cooled probes. Field strengths progressed from common 400-600 MHz systems in 2013 to widespread adoption of 800-1000+ MHz systems in major research facilities, enabling better resolution and faster data acquisition. The trend toward user-friendly software interfaces and automated sample changers accelerated, making modern NMR more accessible than the light-pen and blue-screen systems referenced in 2013. CryoProbe technology became more widely adopted, significantly improving sensitivity. NMR also found expanded applications in drug discovery, structural biology, and metabolomics. However, a complete "death of NMR" did not occur; rather, older or simpler NMR instruments remain in active use in teaching labs and routine analysis settings, demonstrating considerable longevity and cost-effectiveness for basic applications despite the author's personal preference for modern equipment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about obsolescence of old equipment**: The author suggests old NMR equipment like the IBM 80 MHz and JEOL blue-screen systems should be viewed as obsolete curiosities rather than functional tools. In reality, while high-end research moved to advanced systems, many institutions retained and continued to operate older NMR instruments, especially for teaching or routine analytical work, indicating that obsolescence is more gradual than implied.

• **Tone suggesting rapid replacement of legacy equipment**: The article's dismissive tone toward "interested horror" at old equipment implies rapid obsolescence cycles. Actual practice showed more measured adoption of new technology due to cost considerations and the continued utility of older instruments for basic applications, suggesting the transition has been more evolutionary than revolutionary for much of the field.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a personal blog reflection with limited scope, addressing only individual nostalgia rather than broader scientific, technological, or industry developments. The second decile seems appropriate for a piece that offers little analytical depth beyond personal sentiment about aging laboratory equipment.
