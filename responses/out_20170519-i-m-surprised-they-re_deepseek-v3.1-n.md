# I'm Surprised That They're Surprised (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary article reflects on the FDA's approval of Sarepta Therapeutics' eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which occurred despite an FDA advisory committee voting 7-6 against approval and significant concerns about sparse clinical data. The author notes that FDA official Janet Woodcock overruled the committee's recommendations to grant accelerated approval.

The article focuses on revelations from a Wall Street Journal report that Sarepta leveraged emotional appeals from patients' families, with the company's consultant helping prepare parents for FDA hearings. The author expresses surprise not at these lobbying tactics—which he considers standard practice in drug approval processes—but at FDA committee members claiming they were unaware such coordination occurred. The piece questions whether this lack of awareness should have mattered, arguing that decisions should be based on clinical trial data rather than emotional appeals that elevate pathos over logos.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2016 approval, eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51) remained on the market. The FDA required Sarepta to conduct a confirmatory trial to verify the drug's clinical benefit, as is standard for accelerated approvals. However, the confirmatory trial results remained controversial, with ongoing debates about whether the therapy produced meaningful clinical benefits for DMD patients.

The approval set a significant precedent at the FDA. In subsequent years, patient advocacy and emotional testimony became increasingly influential in FDA decisions, particularly for rare diseases with limited treatment options. This trend continued across multiple therapeutic areas.

Sarepta faced continued scrutiny over eteplirsen's efficacy and high cost (approximately $300,000 annually). The company expanded its exon-skipping platform to develop additional DMD therapies targeting different genetic mutations, building on the regulatory precedent established by eteplirsen's approval.

The broader exon-skipping therapeutic approach had mixed results following this approval. While some subsequent therapies showed promise, the field continued to face challenges demonstrating clear clinical benefits in rigorous trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Prediction:** The author implied that emotional appeals and company-patient coordination would continue to influence FDA decisions, stating "this happens all the time" and is "exactly how it works with every other key decision taken by a government body."

**Outcome:** This proved largely accurate. The FDA increasingly incorporated patient perspectives and quality-of-life considerations into regulatory decisions for rare diseases throughout the late 2010s and 2020s. Patient advocacy became more systematically integrated into FDA processes.

**Prediction:** The author suggested that lobbying tactics should be disclosed to maintain transparency, analogous to campaign finance disclosure requirements.

**Outcome:** While FDA advisory committee processes maintained disclosure requirements for financial conflicts, the transparency around patient advocacy group coordination with pharmaceutical companies remained an ongoing area of discussion and concern in regulatory policy circles.

**Prediction:** Embedded in the commentary was concern that elevating emotional appeals (pathos) over evidence-based decision making (logos) could undermine regulatory standards.

**Outcome:** This tension persisted in FDA regulatory decisions, particularly for rare pediatric diseases where traditional randomized controlled trials are challenging. The balance between access and evidence standards remained a central debate in drug development and regulatory policy.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article captures a significant regulatory precedent moment and highlights important ongoing tensions in drug approval processes, though it focuses more on the meta-discussion of lobbying tactics than the underlying scientific or clinical questions.
