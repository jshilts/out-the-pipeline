# Another Shot at Major Depression Fails (December 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from December 2019 reports on the negative Phase 3 (MOUNTAIN) trial results for Sage Therapeutics' drug SAGE-217 (zuranolone) in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The author provides context: Sage had previously found success with brexanolone (Zulresso), a neurosteroid and GABA-A receptor modulator, which was approved for post-partum depression (PPD). Hopes were high for zuranolone as an oral follow-up with a similar mechanism, intended for the much larger MDD market, especially after promising Phase 2 data.

The article strongly emphasizes the fundamental lack of scientific understanding of the biochemical basis of depression, treating the GABAergic mechanism as an unproven hypothesis rather than a confirmed fact. It details how the Phase 3 trial failed to meet its primary endpoint at day 15, with the drug's apparent efficacy waning compared to the smaller Phase 2 study. The author interprets the company's focus on earlier, statistically significant time points as a weak defense. The immediate consequence was a massive, approximately 63%, drop in Sage's stock price, erasing billions in market capitalization, highlighting the high stakes and immense difficulty of developing new antidepressants.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2019 failure, Sage Therapeutics re-evaluated its zuranolone program. The company initiated new pivotal trials using a modified, shorter-duration dosing regimen (e.g., a 14-day course) and adjusted its strategy.

*   **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** In 2022, zuranolone met the primary endpoint in the **WATERFALL** and **CORAL** studies for MDD. Based on this data, it was submitted for FDA approval. In August 2023, the FDA approved zuranolone (brand name **Zurzuvae**) as the first oral medication for adults with postpartum depression (PPD).
*   **Postpartum Depression (PPD):** Concurrently, zuranolone was trialed for PPD. It succeeded in its pivotal trials (e.g., the **SKYLARK** study) and, crucially, this indication was the one granted **FDA approval in August 2023**. The precedent set by the earlier brexanolone approval likely helped to validate this mechanism for PPD.

The drug's market reception has been cautious. As an oral therapy, it is vastly more convenient than the IV infusion of Zulresso, but its launch was much slower than anticipated, facing significant access and reimbursement hurdles from insurers. This real-world uptake has been a challenge for the company's commercial success.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

*   **Prediction:** The author strongly implied that the MOUNTAIN trial failure was a decisive blow, a "case of 'smaller trial good, larger trial bad'" and that the drug "just doesn't work" for MDD. The future success of the entire program was cast in extreme doubt, tied to the company's shaky scientific foundation regarding depression.
*   **Reality:** The prediction of total failure proved to be premature, but the skepticism was well-founded. The drug did not succeed on its original path and timeline for MDD. However, Sage was able to pivot. By modifying the study design and placing greater emphasis on the PPD indication, they achieved clinical success. The ultimate outcome was a partial validation: the drug and its mechanism were not a dead end, but their initial application in the large MDD market did not materialize quickly. The company's value did not evaporate entirely, and it found a viable, albeit narrower, path to market.

*   **Prediction:** The author questioned the company's scientific premise, stating "we don't understand the detailed biochemical differences between post-partum depression, bipolar depression, and major depressive disorder, either."
*   **Reality:** This point was proven prescient by the subsequent events. Zuranolone failed its initial large trial for MDD but succeeded in trials for PPD. This clinical outcome starkly illustrates that the underlying disease biology and patient populations are different enough that efficacy in one major depressive disorder subtype does not guarantee success in another. The empirical trial data, as the author predicted, ruled over a simple theory-based assumption of universal efficacy.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article serves as a crucial real-time case study in the extreme difficulty and unpredictability of neuropsychiatric drug development. It highlights how a single clinical trial failure can reshape a company's entire pipeline and valuation, while also underscoring the strategic importance of being able to pivot based on empirical data rather than being wedded to a single hypothesis or market. It remains highly relevant as zuranolone's commercial performance continues to provide lessons for the biopharma industry on the challenges of post-approval success.
