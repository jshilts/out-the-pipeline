# Article Title (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses alternative models to traditional scientific publishing, particularly in response to the Elsevier boycott movement. It examines a provocative proposal where researchers would be paid substantial sums ($10,000 to authors, $2,000 to reviewers) for publishing in a new journal, funded through institutional subscriptions at "drastically reduced prices." The author critically analyzes this inverse publishing model where money flows toward authors rather than away from them, highlighting fundamental flaws in the economics: if subscription prices are drastically reduced, there would be insufficient revenue to fund the large author payments being proposed. The article contrasts scientific publishing's mixed motivations (sharing knowledge, career advancement, professional necessity) with commercial publishing where money naturally flows toward authors based on market demand. It traces scientific publishing back to its roots in personal correspondence among scientists, noting that journals essentially function as collections of such letters, and explores whether costs could be minimized through centralized electronic archives.

## 2. HISTORY
The period following this 2013 article saw significant evolution in scientific publishing, though not in the "pay authors" direction proposed in the piece. The open access movement gained substantial momentum, with Plan S launching in 2018-2019 requiring publicly funded research to be published in open access journals. Many universities and institutions worldwide canceled "big deal" subscriptions with major publishers like Elsevier between 2015-2020, with some successfully negotiating reduced costs or open access components. The article's proposed author-payment model did not materialize in the way described - no major journals emerged paying researchers $10,000 per publication. Instead, the problematic trend of article processing charges (APCs) expanded, where authors pay thousands of dollars to publish open access, creating different financial barriers. Preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv) grew significantly as communication channels, somewhat realizing the author's vision of distributed scientific communication, though they haven't replaced peer-reviewed journals. The "predatory publisher" problem worsened, with fraudulent journals exploiting the APC model. Major publishers like Elsevier maintained profitability and market dominance, though facing increased public scrutiny and policy pressure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not make explicit predictions about the future, but rather analyzed a proposed alternative publishing model. However, several implicit assumptions about scientific publishing dynamics can be evaluated:

• **Institutional subscription cost pressures**: The article correctly identified that institutional subscription costs and resistance to them would remain central to debates. This proved accurate - major cancellations and renegotiations occurred (SUNY, University of California systems, German consortiums, etc.).

• **Mixed motivations in scientific publishing**: The article's description of competing motivations (career advancement, knowledge sharing, professional necessity) remained accurate and continued shaping researcher behavior.

• **Economic viability of proposed models**: The analysis that the specific "pay authors" model was economically unworkable proved correct - no such system emerged successfully.

• **Technology costs**: The expectation that server and distribution costs would remain non-zero but manageable was generally accurate, with preprint servers and institutional repositories demonstrating sustainable low-cost models.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses enduring structural issues in scientific publishing with genuine insight into economics and incentives, though the proposed solutions didn't materialize as envisioned. While not forecasting major regulatory changes or pandemic-driven shifts, it correctly identified core tensions that remained relevant throughout the decade.
