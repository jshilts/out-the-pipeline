# Big Cuts at Bayer (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Bayer's announcement of significant workforce reductions following the completion of its acquisition of Monsanto. Approximately 10% of the company's global workforce was being eliminated as part of a corporate restructuring to focus on three core business units: Pharma, Consumer Products, and Crop Science. 

The cuts included 4,100 jobs in Crop Sciences, 900 positions in worldwide Pharma R&D, 350 jobs at a German Factor VIII production facility in Wuppertal, and up to 6,000 positions across corporate functions and business services. The author notes the difficult position of affected employees, drawing from personal experience with previous Bayer restructuring following the Schering AG merger.

## 2. HISTORY

Bayer's post-2018 trajectory has been shaped by both the Monsanto acquisition consequences and broader pharmaceutical challenges:

**Monsanto Integration Outcomes**: The $63 billion Monsanto acquisition created significant long-term liabilities for Bayer. The Roundup (glyphosate) litigation crisis escalated dramatically after 2018, with Bayer facing tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging the herbicide causes cancer. By 2020, Bayer had agreed to pay over $10 billion to settle Roundup claims, and the legal and financial repercussions continued beyond that timeline.

**Corporate Restructuring Reality**: The job cuts described in the article were part of Bayer's larger strategic repositioning. The company did divest its Animal Health division, which was sold to Elanco in 2020 for $7.6 billion. Bayer also continued restructuring its pharmaceutical operations, including further R&D adjustments and facility rationalization.

**Pharmaceutical Division Performance**: Following these cuts, Bayer's pharmaceutical division experienced mixed results. The company faced patent expirations on key drugs and pipeline setbacks. However, Bayer maintained strength in certain therapeutic areas including oncology and cardiovascular drugs, while continuing to navigate the post-Monsanto financial pressures.

**Hemophilia Business**: The decision to abandon the Wuppertal Factor VIII facility reflected broader challenges in the hemophilia market, including pricing pressures and competition from newer therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**No explicit predictions were made in the article**, which focused on describing the immediate workforce reductions and expressing concern for affected employees. The article was primarily analytical rather than forward-looking, and the author did not venture specific predictions about Bayer's future performance, drug pipeline outcomes, or market dynamics.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article captures an important moment in pharmaceutical industry consolidation, but its impact was primarily immediate corporate news rather than long-term biotechnology significance. The Monsanto acquisition's broader implications were more substantial than the workforce reductions themselves.
