# [C&E News Covers the Apocalypse (December 2012)]

## 1. SUMMARY

The article appears to be a brief, tongue-in-cheek blog post referencing both a Science magazine post and a Chemjobber blog entry from December 2012, written in the context of Mayan calendar "apocalypse" predictions that were circulating at the time. The title suggests that Chemical & Engineering News (C&E News) should have covered what the author characterizes as "apocalypse" coverage, but instead it was Chemjobber (a chemistry industry blog) that addressed the topic. The post includes a hyperlink to the referenced Chemjobber article titled "We're all here, right?" published around the supposed December 21, 2012 end-of-world date.

## 2. HISTORY

The December 2012 "apocalypse" predictions were based on misinterpretations of the Maya Long Count calendar cycle ending, which some interpreted as predicting catastrophic events. In reality, this simply marked the end of a calendar cycle (the 13th b'ak'tun) and the beginning of a new one. Subsequent to December 21, 2012, no apocalyptic events occurred, and the date passed without incident globally.

Chemjobber's chemistry career blog, referenced in the article, continued operating for several more years, providing commentary on the chemical industry job market and chemistry profession until it ceased regular updates around 2017-2018. The publication Chemical & Engineering News (C&E News), published by the American Chemical Society, remained an active and influential trade publication covering chemical industry developments, regulatory changes, and scientific breakthroughs throughout the following decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The "apocalypse" prediction**: The implied context (Mayan calendar end-of-world predictions for December 2012) did not materialize - December 21, 2012 passed without any catastrophic events.

• **C&E News coverage expectations**: The article's title suggests C&E News "should have" covered apocalypse stories, which appears to be ironic commentary rather than a serious prediction about editorial choices.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 0**

This appears to be a dated pop culture reference with minimal relevance to biotechnology or significant long-term importance, essentially serving as period-appropriate snark about 2012 Mayan calendar hype.
