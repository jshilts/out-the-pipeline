# ChemDraw on the iPad (June 5, 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article announced the release of ChemDraw and Chem3D apps for the iPad platform on June 5, 2013. The ChemDraw app was priced at $10, while Chem3D was offered for free. The author mentioned they hadn't personally tried the apps yet but referenced early reviews from other chemistry bloggers who had begun testing the software.

For organic chemical structures, the apps appeared to work well, though an inorganic chemist reviewer noted some difficulties with text labels. The article linked to several early hands-on reviews and invited readers to share their experiences with the touch-screen interface for chemical structure drawing.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2013 iPad release, ChemDraw expanded significantly across mobile and desktop platforms over the subsequent decade. By the mid-2010s, mobile chemistry software became increasingly integrated into research workflows, though desktop versions remained dominant for serious research applications.

The mobile chemistry app market grew substantially, with ChemDraw maintaining its position as the industry standard chemical drawing software. However, alternative solutions also emerged, including open-source options and web-based platforms. PerkinElmer (which acquired CambridgeSoft in 2011) continued developing the ChemDraw suite, later integrating it into broader scientific informatics platforms.

Cloud integration became a major focus, with features allowing seamless transfer between mobile and desktop versions. Educational adoption of tablet-based chemistry tools increased, particularly in undergraduate chemistry courses where the iPad version found a receptive audience for teaching and learning activities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The 2013 article was more of an announcement than a predictive piece, so it contained no explicit predictions about the future of mobile chemistry software or its broader industry impact.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article captures a notable milestone in chemistry software mobility, but its scope is limited to a straightforward product announcement with minimal broader scientific or industrial significance.
