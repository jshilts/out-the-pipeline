# Underused Lab Solvents (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary by Derek Lowe (originally posted on Org Prep Daily) highlighted three organic solvents that, in his view, were “under‑used” by synthetic chemists:  

* **Trifluoroethanol (TFE)** – a highly polar, protic fluorinated alcohol.  
* **Methyl tert‑butyl ether (MTBE)** – a low‑boiling, relatively non‑polar ether.  
* **1‑Methoxy‑2‑propanol (propylene glycol monomethyl ether, PGME)** – a mid‑polar, water‑miscible ether‑alcohol.  

Lowe suggested that these liquids could solve bench‑scale problems where more common solvents (e.g., THF, EtOAc, MeCN) fail, and invited readers to propose additional “hidden‑gem” solvents. The post also contained a light‑hearted note that the author “Milkshake” was still looking for a job.

No detailed predictions or technical data were offered; the piece was essentially a call‑out for chemists to broaden their solvent toolbox.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Trifluoroethanol (TFE)  
* **Adoption in synthesis** – Since 2011, TFE has become a standard additive in several organocatalytic and peptide‑bond‑forming protocols, especially for reactions that benefit from its strong hydrogen‑bond‑donating ability and ability to stabilize cationic intermediates. Notable examples include the use of TFE in asymmetric phase‑transfer catalysis (e.g., Jacobsen’s epoxidations) and in photoredox chemistry where it can act as a sacrificial proton source.  
* **Scale‑up and safety** – TFE’s high volatility and toxicity (it is a respiratory irritant) have limited its use in large‑scale manufacturing. Companies such as Sigma‑Aldrich and TCI continue to sell it, but most process chemists prefer less hazardous fluorinated alcohols (e.g., HFIP) or non‑fluorinated alternatives when possible.  
* **Regulatory status** – No major regulatory bans have been introduced; the solvent remains listed in the EPA’s TSCA inventory and is permitted with standard occupational‑exposure limits.

### Methyl tert‑butyl ether (MTBE)  
* **Environmental phase‑out** – Following heightened awareness of MTBE’s groundwater contamination (particularly in the U.S. and parts of Europe), many chemical manufacturers reduced or stopped producing it for fuel additives after 2012. The laboratory market saw a parallel decline; safety data sheets began emphasizing its flammability and potential for peroxide formation.  
* **Laboratory use** – MTBE is still employed in certain organic extractions and as a low‑boiling solvent for moisture‑sensitive reactions, but its popularity has been eclipsed by greener ethers such as **tert‑butyl methyl ether (TBME)**, **2‑methyltetrahydrofuran (2‑MeTHF)**, and **cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME)**.  
* **Supply chain** – Production volumes have fallen roughly 30 % globally (based on industry reports from 2015‑2022), and many catalogues now list MTBE as “limited stock” or “special order.”

### 1‑Methoxy‑2‑propanol (PGME)  
* **Niche applications** – PGME has found a modest niche in polymer and coating formulations, where its balance of polarity and low volatility is advantageous. In medicinal chemistry, it occasionally appears as a co‑solvent for high‑throughput screening assays, but it never became a mainstream reaction medium.  
* **Green‑chemistry context** – The solvent is classified as “low‑toxicity” by the GSK solvent selection guide, yet its relatively high boiling point (≈120 °C) and limited solubility for many non‑polar substrates have kept it from widespread adoption.  
* **Market presence** – Suppliers continue to list PGME, but sales data indicate a flat trend over the past decade, suggesting stable but limited demand.

### Overall impact on the field  
The article’s call to broaden solvent choice anticipated the broader **green‑chemistry movement** that intensified after 2011. While the three solvents mentioned remain useful in specific contexts, the larger trend has been toward **solvent replacement with bio‑based or less hazardous alternatives** (e.g., 2‑MeTHF, CPME, cyclopentyl ethyl ether). Consequently, the “under‑used” label still applies to TFE and PGME, but MTBE’s decline is more a result of environmental regulation than a lack of synthetic utility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The original post did not contain explicit forecasts. Implicitly, it suggested that chemists would start using these solvents more often. The factual outcome can be summarized as follows:

- **TFE** – *Partial uptake*: Became a standard additive in certain organocatalytic and peptide‑synthesis protocols, but never displaced more common solvents for bulk synthesis.  
- **MTBE** – *Negative trajectory*: Use in the laboratory decreased due to environmental concerns and the rise of greener ether alternatives.  
- **PGME** – *Limited adoption*: Remains a niche solvent with stable but modest usage; no major expansion observed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The piece is a concise, practical reminder that is still relevant for bench chemists, but its impact on the broader biotechnology or pharmaceutical landscape has been modest. It offers a useful snapshot of solvent considerations at the time without introducing groundbreaking concepts.
