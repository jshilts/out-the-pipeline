# "How Goes the War?" (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses The Atlantic piece titled "More Money Won't Win the War on Cancer," which reviews Clifton Leaf's book "The Truth in Small Doses." The central argument is that funding alone isn't the primary bottleneck in cancer research progress. Instead, Leaf identifies problems within the research ecosystem itself: the federal grant process drives creative minds away from academic labs, favors low-risk incremental studies over ambitious projects, and traps researchers in lengthy post-docs and funding-chasing cycles that stifle innovation during their most productive years.

The author agrees with Leaf's concerns about the academic research culture, while noting that real therapeutic development typically requires industry's heavy lifting to translate basic insights into clinical treatments—a distinction the public often misunderstands. The piece also cautions against the "war on cancer" metaphor, which misleadingly suggests a single enemy rather than acknowledging our fundamental ignorance of cancer biology. However, it references Sidney Farber's perspective that clinical progress sometimes precedes full mechanistic understanding, though pursuing such high-risk trials at scale remains controversial.

## 2. HISTORY
Following 2013, significant developments reshaped cancer research and treatment, though many structural issues raised in the article persisted or evolved:

**Funding and Research Structure:**
Federal research budgets remained constrained while administrative burdens increased. The NIH budget saw modest growth, but grant success rates continued declining, with R01 success rates falling below 20% by the mid-2010s and remaining low. This intensified the competitive pressures Leaf described.

**Scientific Progress Areas:**
- **Immunotherapy breakthrough**: PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) gained FDA approval starting 2014, representing the first major new treatment modality in decades with durable responses in multiple cancers
- **CAR-T cell therapy**: The first CAR-T therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta) were approved 2017, achieving remarkable success in certain blood cancers
- **Precision medicine expansion**: Next-generation sequencing became routine in oncology, with targeted therapies like osimertinib (EGFR-mutant lung cancer, approved 2015) and various ALK inhibitors demonstrating improved outcomes
- **Liquid biopsies**: Blood-based cancer detection and monitoring technologies moved toward clinical implementation

**Clinical Translation Challenges:**
Industry continued bearing the primary burden of drug development, with academic discoveries requiring extensive industrial refinement. The 2016 21st Century Cures Act attempted to accelerate approval pathways, but the fundamental gulf between academic insights and viable therapies remained.

**Research Culture Evolution:**
The reproducibility crisis in science drew increased attention from 2015 onward, particularly affecting cancer research. Concerns about publication bias, statistical rigor, and experimental design led to various reform efforts, though grant conservatism likely persisted as funding remained scarce.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that more NIH funding alone wouldn't solve research productivity**: **Largely validated**. Despite increased cancer research investment and specific initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot (launched 2016), fundamental structural issues in academic research culture persisted. Grant success rates remained low, and many researchers reported spending excessive time on funding applications rather than actual research.

• **Concern about conservatism in grant review favoring incremental questions**: **Appears validated**. The NIH's own evaluations and external analyses continued documenting risk aversion in peer review. While programs like the NIH Director's Pioneer Awards aimed to support innovative research, the broader R01 system remained relatively conservative throughout the 2010s.

• **Distinction between academic discovery and industry development**: **Strongly validated**. The immunotherapy and CAR-T breakthroughs exemplified this pattern—fundamental insights from academic labs (James Allison's checkpoint inhibition work, Carl June's CAR-T research) required extensive pharmaceutical company investment and expertise for clinical translation, approval, and manufacturing scale-up.

• **Skepticism about curing cancer as a single entity**: **Validated**. Cancer treatments became increasingly stratified by molecular markers rather than anatomical location, validating the complexity perspective. The "precision medicine" paradigm that dominated 2010s oncology reflected the reality that cancer comprises hundreds of distinct diseases requiring different therapeutic approaches.

• **Concern about research career pipeline problems**: **Worsened**. Postdoctoral training periods lengthened further, academic job markets became more competitive, and concerns about research career sustainability grew. By the late 2010s, discussions of "alternative careers" for PhDs became mainstream, and junior researcher job satisfaction remained problematic.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This piece demonstrated prescient understanding of structural problems in cancer research that remained relevant throughout the subsequent decade, accurately predicting that funding increases alone wouldn't solve deeper systemic issues in academic research culture and translation.
