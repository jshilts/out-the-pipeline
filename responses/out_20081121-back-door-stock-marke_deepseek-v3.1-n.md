# The Back Door to the Stock Market
November 2008

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes how Nitromed, a biotech company that successfully brought its cardiovascular drug BiDil to market, faced commercial failure after launch—leaving the company "worse off than before." Despite this, Nitromed maintained its NASDAQ listing, which became valuable as a "back door" to public markets during the difficult IPO climate of 2008.

Archemix, an aptamer-focused therapeutics company, had been planning an IPO but shelved those plans due to poor market conditions. The two companies announced a merger with a 70:30 stock split favoring Archemix, essentially allowing Archemix to go public through the reverse merger route. Notably, Nitromed's CEO was slated to lead the combined entity, a decision characterized as surprising to Archemix employees.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Merger and Aftermath:**
In 2009, the Archemix-Nitromed merger closed as planned, creating a publicly traded aptamer company. However, the combined entity faced significant challenges in the subsequent years. Despite expectations that aptamers could become a new therapeutic modality, the company struggled with clinical development.

**Clinical and Regulatory Setbacks:**
Archemix's most advanced program was ARC1779, an aptamer targeting von Willebrand factor for acute coronary syndrome and thrombotic microangiopathy. However, the company encountered substantial obstacles. In 2011, Archemix suspended a Phase 2 trial of ARC1779 due to serious adverse events, including bleeding complications that raised safety concerns.

**Business Outcome:**
By 2012, Archemix had substantially downsized its operations and shifted focus away from its clinical programs. The company essentially became a shell focused on monetizing its intellectual property rather than advancing drug development. The "back door IPO" ultimately led to a public listing for a company that failed to deliver on its therapeutic promise, though it continued to exist in a diminished form and explored partnerships related to its aptamer technology platform.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in the Article:**
• **Aptamers as viable therapeutics**: The article framed aptamers as "interesting and risky" but more promising than Nitromed's failed cardiovascular approach.
  - **Reality**: Subsequent clinical trials revealed significant safety issues with aptamer therapeutics. While aptamers found success in diagnostic applications, therapeutic applications largely failed due to off-target effects and safety concerns.

• **Successful reverse merger strategy**: Implicit approval of creative financing strategies.
  - **Reality**: The merger succeeded in maintaining a public listing but failed to create meaningful shareholder value. The company struggled to advance its pipeline and ultimately suspended its lead program.

• **Archemix as going concern**: Belief that the company's technology platform would lead to viable drugs.
  - **Reality**: No aptamer therapeutics from Archemix reached FDA approval or achieved clinical success. The company pivoted from drug development to IP monetization.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**

This article captures an interesting moment in biotech financing history—the reverse merger as an alternative to traditional IPOs during difficult market conditions. However, the substance lacks broader significance, as both the financing vehicle and underlying technology platform ultimately failed to deliver meaningful therapeutic breakthroughs.
