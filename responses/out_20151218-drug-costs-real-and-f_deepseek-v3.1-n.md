# Drug Costs, Real and Fake (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes the pricing structure of CroFab, a rattlesnake antivenom, which had been criticized as an example of outrageous drug prices in U.S. healthcare. The piece references a study examining the cost breakdown of a hypothetical arachnid antivenom, where the final charge would be approximately $14,000 per vial. The analysis reveals that only a small fraction represents actual production costs: manufacturing ($9/vial), R&D ($1/vial), and venom acquisition ($0.02/vial). The largest component—over $10,000—comes from "hospital charges later discounted for contracted payers," which the author characterizes as "not real costs" but rather inflated MSRP figures used in complex negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies. The article argues that these artificially inflated "sticker prices" distort public perception of drug costs and distract from understanding actual underlying expenses.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the issues it highlighted continued and arguably intensified:

**Continued Price Transparency Debates**: The discrepancy between drug list prices and actual net prices remained a persistent issue. In 2016-2018, several studies confirmed that hospitals routinely charge 3-5 times what they expect to be paid, using inflated prices as negotiating tools with insurers.

**Policy Responses**: In 2018, the Trump administration proposed requiring hospitals to publish their chargemaster rates, which took effect in 2019. However, studies showed this had limited impact on actual price transparency, as the posted prices remained the inflated "sticker prices" rather than negotiated rates.

**CroFab's Continued Market Presence**: The antivenom continued to be marketed, with prices remaining high. In 2020-2021, some hospitals reported CroFab costs of $5,000-$10,000 per vial, with typical treatments requiring multiple vials. The underlying issue of complex pricing negotiations persisted.

**PBM and Insurance Dynamics**: The role of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and their rebate systems became increasingly scrutinized, particularly how rebates incentivized higher list prices while providing discounts to insurers.

**Public Perception**: Drug pricing remained a major political issue, with public attention often focused on list prices rather than net prices after discounts and rebates. This led to legislative proposals but limited concrete policy changes that addressed the fundamental pricing mechanisms described in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

I did not find any specific predictions in this article—it was primarily analytical rather than predictive in nature.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5**

This article addresses an important and persistent issue in healthcare economics, but it covers well-documented territory that was already being discussed in 2015 and has remained largely unchanged since then. The pricing mechanisms it describes continue to be relevant, but the piece doesn't break new conceptual ground.
