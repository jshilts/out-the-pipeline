# Pfizer: Bigger, Um, Isn't Better? (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 Forbes‑style commentary argued that Pfizer’s two‑decade strategy of growth through acquisition had left the company bloated and its internal R&D under‑performing. With the blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor approaching patent expiry, the author highlighted analyst Tim Anderson’s suggestion that CEO Ian Read should consider a major divestiture – shedding roughly 40 % of sales (about $32 billion) to return to a “pure pharmaceutical research” model akin to Eli Lilly or AstraZeneca. The piece questioned whether Pfizer’s “innovative core” could ever be disentangled from the many acquired units that had been repeatedly reorganised.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Divestitures & restructuring (2011‑2023)**  
- **2011‑2012:** Pfizer sold its consumer‑health brands (e.g., Advil, Centrum) to GlaxoSmithKline for $13 bn, creating GSK Consumer Healthcare (now Haleon).  
- **2012‑2013:** The animal‑health division was spun off to Zoetis for $2.9 bn.  
- **2014‑2015:** Pfizer acquired Hospira (injectables/infusion) for $17 bn, expanding its sterile‑product platform rather than shrinking.  
- **2015:** The oncology‑focused acquisition of **Array BioPharma** for $11.6 bn added the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and a pipeline of targeted agents.  
- **2020‑2023:** The company announced (and completed) the acquisition of **Seagen** for $43 bn, further bolstering its antibody‑drug conjugate (ADC) portfolio.  

Overall, Pfizer did **not** split into a smaller “pure research” entity; instead it continued a pattern of selective divestitures combined with large, strategic acquisitions.

**Product and pipeline outcomes**  
- **Prevnar 13** (pneumococcal vaccine) launched in 2010 and became a long‑term revenue driver, especially in pediatric markets.  
- **Ibrance** (palbociclib, CDK4/6 inhibitor) received FDA approval in 2015 and grew into a >$5 bn annual seller, validating the post‑Lipitor oncology push.  
- **Xeljanz** (tofacitinib, JAK inhibitor) approved for rheumatoid arthritis in 2012, later expanded to ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis, but faced safety‑related label restrictions beginning in 2021.  
- **COVID‑19 vaccine (BNT162b2/Comirnaty)**, co‑developed with BioNTech, received emergency use authorization in Dec 2020. By 2022 it generated >$30 bn in sales, temporarily making Pfizer the world’s largest pharmaceutical company by revenue.  

**Financial trajectory**  
- Revenue fell from a peak of **$66 bn (2018)** to **$51 bn (2022)** after the pandemic‑related surge receded.  
- R&D spending remained high (≈$9‑10 bn annually), but the proportion of revenue allocated to R&D stayed around 15‑18 %, similar to peers.  

**Policy & market impact**  
- The 2012 consumer‑health divestiture contributed to the creation of Haleon, a standalone OTC giant.  
- Pfizer’s 2020 vaccine success accelerated global mRNA vaccine adoption and prompted new U.S. and EU policies on pandemic preparedness, but these were industry‑wide effects rather than a direct result of the 2011 restructuring idea.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction from the 2011 article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Pfizer would shrink by ~40 % and become a “pure pharmaceutical research” company** | **Did not occur.** Pfizer sold consumer‑health and animal‑health units (≈$15 bn total) but retained and even expanded its sterile‑product, vaccine, and oncology businesses, keeping total sales above $50 bn. |
| **Divestiture would improve R&D productivity** | Mixed evidence. Post‑divestiture, Pfizer launched several successful drugs (Ibrance, Xeljanz) and a blockbuster vaccine, but R&D efficiency (measured by approvals per $B R&D) remained comparable to industry averages. |
| **The “innovative core” would be the pre‑acquisition Pfizer labs** | The core now includes many assets acquired after 2000 (e.g., Wyeth, Hospira, Array, Seagen). The company’s most recent breakthroughs (COVID‑19 vaccine, ADCs) stem from partnerships and acquisitions rather than legacy internal labs. |
| **A leaner Pfizer would be more competitive against peers** | Pfizer remained competitive, but its strategy shifted to **selective mega‑acquisitions** rather than pure organic research. Competitors (e.g., Merck, Johnson & Johnson) also pursued similar acquisition‑driven growth. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when analysts debated Pfizer’s size‑versus‑focus dilemma; the subsequent mix of divestitures and mega‑acquisitions makes it a useful case study of how a legacy giant actually navigated the post‑Lipitor era. It is not groundbreaking, but its hindsight relevance to today’s “big‑pharma consolidation” debates is solid.
