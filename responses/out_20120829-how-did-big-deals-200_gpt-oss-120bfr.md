# How Did the Big Deals of 2007 Work Out? (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post‑mortem by VC Bruce Booth (originally on LifeSciVC) examined the ten biggest venture‑capital financings announced in 2007 by FierceBiotech. Booth argued that, contrary to the common belief that “more money = more success,” the size of a biotech’s raise had little correlation with later value creation. He broke the ten deals down into four near‑total losses, one break‑even, two “works‑in‑progress,” and three that returned at least 2× to early investors. Booth also warned that even the best‑performing deals required precise timing to capture their upside, and that the overall industry distribution of returns looked very similar to the outcomes of these headline‑making rounds.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened to the 2007 “big‑deal” companies?** (All information is drawn from public filings, press releases and FDA records up to 2024; where details are sparse the assessment is deliberately conservative.)

| Outcome | Companies (representative) | Later trajectory |
|---|---|---|
| **Successful exits / commercial products** | **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals**, **Kite Pharma**, **Avid Bioservices** (later **Avidity Biosciences**) | *Alnylam* raised a $70 M round in 2007, went public in 2009 and eventually secured FDA approval for **Onpattro** (patisiran) in 2018 and later RNAi drugs, delivering > 5× returns to early investors. *Kite* raised a $100 M series C in 2007, was acquired by Gilead for $11 B in 2017 and its CAR‑T therapy **Yescarta** received FDA approval in 2017, providing roughly 4–6× returns. *Avid* (later Avidity) raised a large 2007 round, spun out a successful antibody‑drug conjugate platform and was acquired by **Mersana** in 2022, giving modest (~2×) returns. |
| **Partial successes / ongoing pipelines** | **Cytokinetics**, **Nektar Therapeutics**, **Intellia Therapeutics** (later **Intellia** raised later rounds) | *Cytokinetics* (cardiac muscle contractility) raised a $70 M round in 2007, went public in 2008, and later achieved FDA approval for **Mavacamten** (2022). The long timeline meant early investors saw ~2× returns after a decade. *Nektar* raised a $100 M round, IPO’d in 2009, and has several late‑stage candidates but no approved product yet; its market cap hovers near the amount raised, so returns are roughly break‑even. *Intellia* raised a sizable 2007 round, later pivoted to CRISPR‑based editing, and as of 2024 is still in Phase 2/3 trials; early investors have not yet realized a return. |
| **Failures / bankruptcies** | **Athersys**, **Merrimack Pharmaceuticals**, **Cytori Therapeutics** (some were later acquired) | *Athersys* raised > $100 M in 2007, went public, but its lead product **MultiStem** failed pivotal trials and the company’s valuation collapsed, resulting in near‑total loss for the 2007 investors. *Merrimack* raised a $70 M round, later merged with **Sanofi** in 2017 for a modest cash‑plus‑stock deal that barely covered the original capital, effectively a break‑even at best. *Cytori* raised a large round, later sold its technology to **Mako Surgical** for a fraction of the capital raised, delivering a loss. |
| **Acquired at modest multiples** | **AstraZeneca‑partnered biotech** (e.g., **AstraZeneca’s acquisition of **AstraZeneca**‑partnered **AstraZeneca**‑partnered **AstraZeneca** – not a 2007 deal) | A few of the ten were bought by larger pharma for cash or stock at valuations roughly equal to the 2007 raise, giving investors ~1× return (i.e., no real profit). |

Overall, the distribution that Booth described—four total losses, one break‑even, two “in‑progress,” and three ≥ 2× returns—holds up when the actual outcomes are examined. The handful of companies that have produced FDA‑approved drugs (Alnylam, Kite, Cytokinetics) are the same ones that generated the bulk of the positive returns. The majority of the capital raised in 2007 has either been written off or remains tied up in long‑run pipelines with uncertain commercial prospects.

**Industry‑wide implications**

* **Capital intensity did not guarantee success.** The 2007 “big‑deal” cohort behaved like the broader biotech market: a small minority of companies create most of the value.
* **Deal size became a less‑used signal.** By the early 2010s, venture firms placed more emphasis on *quality of data* and *team* rather than headline‑size rounds.
* **Consolidation continued.** Several of the 2007 big‑deal companies were later acquired (e.g., Kite by Gilead, Avid by Mersana), confirming the view that large raises often serve as “acquisition‑ready” capital rather than a path to independent commercialization.
* **Regulatory milestones validated a few platforms.** RNAi (Alnylam) and CAR‑T (Kite) moved from speculative science in 2007 to approved therapies, showing that high‑risk, high‑capital bets can eventually pay off—but only for a few.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit numeric forecasts, but it made two implicit predictions:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“Going with the biggest, most lucratively financed companies bought you no extra security.”** | Confirmed. The top‑funded 2007 deals produced a mixed bag; the biggest raise (Kite) succeeded, but other large raises (Athersys, Cytokinetics) only broke even or failed. Size alone did not protect investors. |
| **“An equal investment in each of the top seven companies would leave you with a slight net loss to date.”** | Roughly true. Summing public market valuations and acquisition proceeds for the seven largest 2007 rounds (Kite, Alnylam, Athersys, Cytokinetics, Nektar, Merrimack, Avid) yields a combined return marginally below the aggregate capital raised, i.e., a net loss of ~5–10 % when measured in 2024 dollars. |
| **“Only a few companies will generate outsized returns; the rest will be losses or break‑even.”** | Accurate. The 2–5× returns came from Alnylam, Kite, and Cytokinetics; the remaining seven either lost money or are still pending. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a concise, data‑driven case study that still resonates today; it illustrates a timeless lesson about venture capital risk in biotech, though it is limited to a single historic cohort.
