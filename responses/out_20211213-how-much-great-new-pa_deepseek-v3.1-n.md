# How Much Of That Great New Paper is Real? (Dec 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines the reproducibility crisis in scientific research, focusing on findings from the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology. The project attempted to reproduce 193 experiments from 53 high-profile cancer biology papers published between 2010-2012, but only succeeded in evaluating 50 experiments from 23 papers due to incomplete protocols and lack of cooperation from original authors. Results showed that effect sizes were 85% smaller than originally reported, positive results replicated only 40% of the time (versus 80% for negative results), and only 5 of 53 papers could be fully reproduced. The author identifies problems including insufficient experimental detail, refusal to share reagents, and publication bias favoring positive results, then proposes solutions such as stricter journal requirements for protocol reporting and consequences for researchers who don't share materials.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2021, reproducibility issues have remained a prominent concern in biomedical research, with ongoing efforts but persistent challenges:

**Institutional Responses**: Major funders and journals have strengthened policies requiring data sharing and protocol transparency. The NIH implemented stricter data management and sharing requirements, while journals like Nature and Science enhanced reporting standards for life sciences papers. However, compliance remains inconsistent.

**Continued Replication Studies**: Additional large-scale replication efforts have been published across various fields. A notable 2023 study in Nature Human Behaviour examined reproducibility in social sciences, finding similar patterns to earlier efforts. In cancer biology specifically, no comparable large-scale follow-up to the Reproducibility Project has been published, though smaller replication studies continue appearing.

**Practical Impact**: The reproducibility crisis has had concrete effects on pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D. Companies increasingly conduct internal validation studies before pursuing external academic findings, and some have reported that 50-70% of published academic findings in target validation fail to replicate in industry settings. This has contributed to a shift toward more rigorous internal validation and skepticism about early-stage academic discoveries.

**Regulatory Considerations**: FDA and EMA have not fundamentally changed approval processes based on reproducibility concerns, but there's increased emphasis on robust statistical design and pre-specified endpoints in clinical trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions about reproducibility efforts:

• **Prediction**: Journals would "come down harder on the reporting of more detailed experimental protocols"
• **Outcome**: Mixed success. Major journals have indeed strengthened reporting requirements (e.g., Nature's reporting summaries, ARRIVE guidelines for animal studies), but compliance remains incomplete. The problem persists, though awareness is higher.

• **Prediction**: Need for "serious consequences" for researchers who don't share materials, including publication restrictions
• **Outcome**: Limited implementation. While some journals now require data availability statements, substantive penalties for non-compliance remain rare. Bad actors can still publish, though reputational pressure has increased.

• **Prediction**: Animal studies would show "a lot of problems" due to being statistically underpowered
• **Outcome**: Confirmed by subsequent research. Multiple meta-analyses have reinforced that preclinical animal studies often lack statistical power, and initiatives like the UK's Experimental Design Assistant have emerged to improve study design.

• **Implicit prediction**: The reproducibility problem would persist because publication bias favors positive, attention-getting results
• **Outcome**: Confirmed. Publication bias remains a significant problem. Pre-registration and registered reports have gained traction but haven't fundamentally solved the issue across most fields. Negative results remain difficult to publish.

• **Implicit prediction**: That clinical trials mentioned (two animal studies with positive trial results) might not hold up
• **Outcome**: Cannot assess without specific drug identification, but overall drug development success rates have remained relatively constant (~10% from Phase I to approval), suggesting many promising preclinical findings still fail.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a fundamental, ongoing problem in scientific research with real implications for drug development costs and research efficiency. While not introducing new primary data, it synthesizes important reproducibility findings in accessible form and proposes concrete changes. The issues raised remain highly relevant today.
