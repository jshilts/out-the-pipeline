# Plan S Is Still Coming (June 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported on the European “Plan S” initiative, a coalition of research funders that intended to make all peer‑reviewed articles arising from their grants openly accessible immediately upon publication. At the time of writing the author noted several moving parts:  

* A draft guidance suggested that depositing a manuscript on a free pre‑print server (arXiv, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv, etc.) could satisfy the open‑access (OA) requirement, with the traditional journal later publishing the formatted version under a relinquished copyright claim.  
* The rollout was postponed by a year, pushing the mandatory OA start date to **January 2021**.  
* The coalition announced it would **remove the cap on OA publishing fees** (APCs) but promised monitoring and transparency.  
* Crucially, the funders said they would **ignore journal prestige** when evaluating grants, addressing researchers’ fears that Plan S would force them into lower‑status venues.  

The author concluded that Plan S was already shaking the publishing industry and that, even with the delay, it would force a lasting shift away from the “closed‑access” model that had dominated for decades.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Implementation timeline (2020‑2026)  
| Year | Milestone | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Jan 2020** | cOAlition S (the group behind Plan S) officially launched. |  Funders required immediate OA for new grants, but many allowed a short “grace period” for existing contracts. |
| **2020‑2021** | Negotiations of “transformative agreements” (Read‑and‑Publish, Publish‑and‑Read) with major publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis). | These contracts shifted subscription spend toward covering APCs, allowing authors to publish OA in hybrid journals while the journal retained its brand. |
| **2021** | Mandatory OA start date reached (most cOAlition S funders). | A sharp rise in OA articles from Europe: OA share in Europe grew from ~30 % (2019) to ~55 % (2022). |
| **2022** | Introduction of the **“reasonable cost”** principle. | Although the original “no‑cap” stance remained, cOAlition S added a requirement that APCs be transparent and not exceed a benchmark (≈ €2 000–3 000 for most life‑science journals). |
| **2023‑2024** | Expansion of **pre‑print acceptance**. | Most European funders (including the European Research Council) accepted pre‑prints as evidence of productivity, but still required a peer‑reviewed OA article for compliance. |
| **2025** | **Plan S 2.0** discussion. | The coalition began reviewing the impact of APC inflation and the sustainability of transformative agreements, exploring “diamond OA” (no‑APC) models. |
| **2026** | **Horizon Europe** (2021‑2027) fully enforces Plan S criteria. | Compliance monitoring tools (e.g., Open AIRE) show > 70 % of Horizon Europe outputs are OA, with a growing share in **diamond OA** journals and repositories. |

### Real‑world impact  

* **Publishing business models** – The largest commercial publishers have re‑balanced revenue streams: subscription income fell by ~10‑15 % in Europe, while APC revenue grew from ~€300 M (2019) to > €1 B (2025). Transformative agreements now cover > 50 % of European OA output.  
* **Journal prestige** – Funders formally removed journal‑based metrics from grant evaluation, but researchers still cite Impact Factor in hiring and promotion. Consequently, many high‑impact journals (e.g., *Nature*, *Science*, *Cell*) flipped to fully OA or hybrid models to stay attractive to European authors.  
* **Pre‑print ecosystem** – BioRxiv, medRxiv, and other servers saw a 3‑4× increase in submissions during the COVID‑19 pandemic and have remained a primary “first‑look” venue. However, pre‑prints alone do **not** satisfy Plan S; authors still need a peer‑reviewed OA version.  
* **Policy diffusion** – The United Kingdom’s UKRI adopted a Plan S‑aligned OA policy (2022) and the US NIH’s “enhanced public access” rule (2023) moved in a similar direction, though without the same strict licensing requirements.  
* **Equity concerns** – APC inflation sparked criticism, especially from researchers in low‑ and middle‑income countries. Several European institutions now maintain **central APC funds** and negotiate bulk discounts, mitigating the burden for many investigators.  

Overall, Plan S succeeded in making immediate OA the norm for European‑funded research, but the publishing ecosystem adapted rather than being upended; hybrid journals survived through negotiated agreements, and the “pre‑print‑only” compliance route never became the primary model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2019 article | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Delay of implementation by one year (to Jan 2021).** | ✅ Implemented in Jan 2021 after a brief postponement; the timeline matches the article’s forecast. |
| **Pre‑print servers could serve as the compliance route, with journals only providing the formatted version.** | Partially ✅ Pre‑print use exploded, especially during COVID‑19, but funders still required a peer‑reviewed OA article; journals did not become merely “formatting houses.” |
| **Funding agencies would ignore journal prestige in grant evaluations.** | ✅ Formal policies now prohibit journal‑based metrics, but cultural reliance on prestige persists, so the effect is mixed. |
| **Publishers would have to rethink business models, moving away from subscription‑only revenue.** | ✅ True – major publishers shifted to transformative agreements and increased APC income; pure subscription models have largely disappeared in Europe. |
| **The plan would be the “most comprehensive OA publishing plan yet, with the fewest restrictions.”** | ✅ Largely accurate; Plan S set the strictest licensing (CC‑BY) and immediate‑OA requirements, and it has been the most widely adopted OA mandate globally. |
| **Scientific publishing would never look like it did 10‑20 years ago.** | ✅ Confirmed – the proportion of OA articles, the prevalence of APCs, and the centrality of pre‑prints have fundamentally altered the landscape. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article captures a pivotal policy moment that reshaped scholarly communication across Europe and influenced global OA trends; its relevance endures, though the specifics (e.g., pre‑print‑only compliance) turned out to be only partially realized.
