# "From All This You'd Imagine, That There Must Be Something Learned. . ." (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the aftermath of Eli Lilly's phase III clinical trial failure of semagacestat, a gamma-secretase inhibitor intended for Alzheimer's treatment. The drug not only failed to show any benefit for Alzheimer's patients but actually worsened their condition. The piece highlights a post-mortem analysis by Bart de Strooper examining why this trial was such a disaster.

Key issues identified included severe side effects from blocking Notch signaling, inadequate dosing protocols (once-daily dosing despite the drug's short half-life), and the puzzling decision to advance to phase III with doses that had shown no significant impact on amyloid-beta levels in CSF during phase II studies. The author characterizes the trial as premature given the poor understanding of gamma-secretase biology at the time and suggests it set back research in both industrial and academic settings. The broader context is the persistent confusion around the amyloid hypothesis and whether targeting amyloid production would meaningfully treat Alzheimer's disease.

## 2. HISTORY

The semagacestat failure was part of a broader pattern of gamma-secretase inhibitor challenges that continued after 2015. Research revealed that gamma-secretase's complexity extended far beyond amyloid production—it processes over 90 substrates, including Notch, making selective inhibition extremely difficult.

The Alzheimer's field gradually shifted away from pan-gamma-secretase inhibitors toward more selective approaches. Notably, **modulators** rather than inhibitors gained attention, attempting to shift gamma-secretase activity toward shorter, less toxic amyloid species without disrupting Notch signaling. However, these too faced significant hurdles.

The amyloid hypothesis itself faced mounting challenges. In 2019, Biogen's aducanumab showed mixed results, with continued controversy about whether amyloid clearance actually improves cognitive outcomes. The debate intensified with the 2021 accelerated FDA approval despite conflicting data. Subsequently, lecanemab received traditional FDA approval in 2023 with more robust data, and donanemab showed positive phase III results in 2023, suggesting that earlier intervention and complete amyloid removal might yield benefits. However, the clinical effects remained modest, and questions persisted about whether amyloid was the right target or merely an epiphenomenon.

No gamma-secretase inhibitor has received FDA approval for Alzheimer's disease. The approach remains largely abandoned in pharmaceutical development, with companies focusing instead on monoclonal antibodies, BACE inhibitors (which also largely failed), and alternative mechanisms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations:

- **"The gamma-secretase field would have been better off if it had continued to travel hopefully, rather than arriving at the end of that trial"** - This proved partially accurate. Gamma-secretase research did continue, but largely pivoted to basic science understanding rather than therapeutic development. The prediction that the field would continue was correct, but it never recovered its therapeutic momentum.

- **Implication that gamma-secretase remained poorly understood** - This proved accurate. Subsequent research revealed even greater complexity than appreciated in 2015, with gamma-secretase's multiple substrates, complex regulatory mechanisms, and context-dependent effects.

- **Implication that Lilly's trial design was fundamentally flawed** - This assessment was validated by subsequent understanding. The dosing issues, Notch-related toxicity, and premature clinical advancement were indeed fundamental problems that the field recognized post-hoc.

- **No explicit statement that gamma-secretase inhibitors would never work, but heavy skepticism** - This proved largely correct. No gamma-secretase inhibitor has succeeded clinically for Alzheimer's, and the approach has been largely abandoned.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in Alzheimer's drug development, analyzing not just a single trial failure but the deeper methodological and scientific challenges facing the entire amyloid hypothesis. It demonstrated clear scientific reasoning about why certain approaches were premature, with insights that proved prescient about subsequent field developments and the ongoing struggle to effectively treat Alzheimer's disease.
