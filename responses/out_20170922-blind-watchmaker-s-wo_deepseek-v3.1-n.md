# The Blind Watchmaker's Workshop (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article analyzes a 2017 Nature paper from researchers at the University of Chicago examining protein evolution through the lens of steroid receptor evolution. The researchers reconstructed an ancestral steroid receptor (AncSR1) that was selective for estrogen-response-elements (ERE) in DNA, then systematically tested all 160,000 possible mutants at four key DNA-binding sites to understand evolutionary contingency and determinism.

The key findings were striking: The team identified 828 variants that achieved steroid-response-element (SRE) selectivity (functioning as well or better than natural receptors), with these functional sequences reachable through multiple single-point mutation paths—no evolutionary "bottleneck" existed. The actual historical path to SRE selectivity was neither the shortest nor highest-affinity route; over 90% of SRE-selective mutants could be reached by paths no longer than the historical one, suggesting strong stochasticity in evolution.

However, when the researchers removed eleven "permissive mutations" (changes not directly in the DNA-binding site), the landscape became extremely constrained—only 84 functional variants remained out of 160,000, with functional sequences disconnected from each other through non-functional intermediates. This revealed that "preparatory" mutations had to create a permissive protein landscape before productive exploration of DNA-binding mutations could occur.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2017 work by Bridgham, Ortlund and colleagues represented a methodological milestone in experimental evolutionary biology. Their approach of systematically constructing and testing comprehensive mutant libraries became increasingly influential in protein engineering and directed evolution studies.

The conceptual framework from this paper—distinguishing between permissive "ground-preparing" mutations and functional "realizing" mutations—has shaped how researchers understand protein evolvability. Subsequent work in various protein families has confirmed that many proteins require promiscuous or generalist intermediates to access new functions, creating "gateway" states that open evolutionary paths.

Notably, these insights have practical applications in protein engineering for biotechnology and therapeutics. Understanding evolutionary contingency helps rationalize why some protein engineering efforts fail (insufficient "preparation" of the starting scaffold) and informs strategies like consensus design or ancestral sequence reconstruction. However, I cannot provide specific details about FDA-approved drugs directly stemming from this work without risk of hallucination, as that would require accessing current pharmaceutical development data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that "things could have been many other ways":** **CONFIRMED.** The next several years of protein evolution research consistently demonstrated that functional protein space contains numerous sequence solutions, with different organisms often arriving at similar functions through different molecular mechanisms. The concept of "many roads to Rome" in protein evolution is now well-established.

• **Prediction about the importance of permissive mutations influencing engineering success:** **CONFIRMED.** Subsequent protein engineering literature has increasingly recognized that success depends not just on mutations at active sites but on "second shell" and "global" mutations that create favorable biophysical properties, including stability, solubility, and dynamic properties. Rational protein design now routinely considers these preparative modifications.

• **Implicit prediction that systematic mutant screening would become more common:** **CONFIRMED.** High-throughput screening of comprehensive mutant libraries has become increasingly routine, enabled by improvements in gene synthesis, sequencing costs, and robotic automation. The $160,000 library construction described as notable in 2017 is now relatively standard technology.

• **Prediction that evolutionary contingency is widespread in protein evolution:** **CONFIRMED.** Multiple studies since 2017 have shown that evolutionary paths are often constrained by historical accidents rather than optimal design principles, though the deterministic influence of biophysical constraints (stability, folding, etc.) remains substantial—the interplay between chance and necessity remains an active research area.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addressed fundamental questions about evolutionary contingency using experimentally rigorous methods, and the framework of permissive versus functional mutations has proven broadly applicable to protein engineering and synthetic biology.
