# Where the Startup Cash Has Been Going (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses venture capital allocation patterns in biopharma from 2004-2013, based on data from LifeSciVC and BIO. The analysis reveals that over 80% of VC funding went toward new therapies rather than improvements on existing drugs, with biologics steadily increasing their share compared to small molecules. Most investment focused on early-stage companies, defined broadly as pre-Phase I through Phase I.

The author provides commentary on the biotech funding boom, noting 2013 represented the strongest year in the survey period, with indications that 2014 would exceed it. The piece concludes with speculation about whether companies founded during the boom period (2014-2015) would show different success rates compared to historical norms, and whether the timing of IPOs could indicate market peaks.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2015 article appeared during what became known as the "biotech bubble" period (roughly 2013-2015), characterized by unusually high valuations and IPO activity. Subsequent developments showed mixed outcomes:

**Investment Trends**: The biologics shift identified in the article accelerated substantially. By 2018-2020, biologics and gene therapies dominated biopharma investment, with cell and gene therapy companies raising over $19 billion in 2020 alone. The early-stage funding preference continued, but Series A rounds grew significantly larger, often $50-100M+ for promising platforms.

**Market Evolution**: Many companies that went public during 2014-2015 experienced volatile performance. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index peaked in July 2015, then declined approximately 30% by early 2016, suggesting the article's speculation about market saturation was prescient. Numerous 2014-2015 IPOs later traded below offering prices or were acquired at modest premiums.

**Therapeutic Outcomes**: CAR-T therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta) received FDA approval in 2017, validating substantial investment in immuno-oncology. However, many high-profile gene therapy and checkpoint inhibitor programs faced clinical setbacks or failed to meet primary endpoints, demonstrating that heavy funding doesn't guarantee clinical success.

**Company Fates**: Companies founded in the 2010-2013 period showed varied outcomes. Some became major successes (Moderna, founded 2010; Spark Therapeutics, founded 2013, acquired by Roche for $4.8B in 2019). Others struggled with pipeline failures or were acquired at fire-sale prices, consistent with the author's differentiation between value acquisitions and distress sales.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Companies formed before the "hot period" would have higher survival rates than those from 2014-2015**: **Mixed accuracy**. The 2016 biotech market correction did affect later-IPO companies disproportionately, but many 2014-2015 startups eventually succeeded after weathering the downturn. The prediction correctly anticipated market saturation issues.

- **IPO timing could indicate market peaks**: **Accurate**. The biotech IPO market indeed peaked in 2014-2015, with the subsequent 2016 correction validating the concern about market timing and saturation.

- **Success rates might differ from historical norms for the 2010s startup classes**: **Partially accurate**. The eventual outcome was heterogeneous—some sectors (immuno-oncology, gene therapy) exceeded historical success rates, while others (many platform technology companies) performed worse than expected.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article provides thoughtful analysis of biopharma investment patterns during a crucial market period, with several predictions that proved directionally correct, making it valuable for understanding venture capital dynamics in biotechnology.
