# Phenylalanine Crystals (22 Oct 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief article highlights a surprising crystallography challenge: the simple amino acid L-phenylalanine had proven extraordinarily difficult to characterize using small-molecule crystallography for decades, despite numerous attempts by researchers. The primary difficulty stemmed from the compound existing in multiple polymorphic forms (different crystal structures of the same molecule), which complicated obtaining high-quality crystals suitable for definitive structural determination and space group assignment. The article references a 2014 paper in Angewandte Chemie that reportedly resolved this long-standing crystallographic puzzle.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2014 paper in question (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201406886) appears to represent a technical solution to a fundamental crystallographic problem, rather than a development with direct therapeutic or commercial applications. 

L-phenylalanine is an essential amino acid that has been used in nutritional supplements and medical foods for decades, particularly for phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, a metabolic disorder where individuals cannot metabolize phenylalanine properly. However, the crystallographic challenges mentioned in the article relate primarily to basic scientific understanding rather than practical applications.

After 2014, there is no indication that this crystallographic breakthrough led to new drug approvals, clinical treatments, or significant changes in public policy regarding phenylalanine-based therapies. The compound itself remains important in biochemical and pharmaceutical contexts, but primarily as a building block for protein synthesis and in existing formulations rather than as a result of new structural insights.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article does not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It appears to be reporting on the resolution of a technical crystallographic challenge rather than forecasting therapeutic or commercial implications.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This article focuses on a narrow crystallography problem of primarily academic interest. While the structural solution was scientifically noteworthy for crystallographers, it had minimal broader impact on biotechnology, medicine, or public health compared to other developments in the field.
