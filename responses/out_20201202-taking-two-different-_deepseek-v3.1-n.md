# Taking Two Different Vaccines? (December 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article addresses the practical question of whether individuals could or should receive two different COVID-19 vaccines, given that multiple vaccine platforms were emerging simultaneously during the pandemic. The author notes that this was an unprecedented situation with mRNA, adenovirus vector, and protein subunit vaccines all potentially available at the same time.

The article draws parallels from historical vaccine experience, noting that mixing polio vaccines (oral Sabin followed by injectable Salk) actually produced stronger intestinal immunity than repeated doses of the same type. Conversely, hepatitis A and B vaccines appeared interchangeable without negative consequences. However, the author also cites cautionary examples like pneumococcal vaccines, where giving a polysaccharide vaccine before a conjugate version reduced antibody responses—demonstrating that order and platform matter. For COVID-19, since all vaccines targeted the Spike protein, the author expressed cautious optimism that mixing would likely work or perhaps even enhance immunity, but emphasized that clinical data was needed.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this article's publication, mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccination strategies became both studied and implemented globally:

**Clinical Studies and Regulatory Actions:**
- Multiple countries conducted heterologous prime-boost studies, notably including the UK's Com-COV and Com-COV2 trials (2021), which systematically tested combinations of Pfizer/BioNTech (mRNA) and Oxford/AstraZeneca (adenovirus vector) vaccines
- Findings generally showed that mixing vaccines produced robust immune responses, often with mRNA vaccines as boosters generating particularly strong antibody levels after adenovirus vector priming
- Several countries (including Canada, Germany, and others) authorized mixed schedules, particularly after safety concerns emerged about adenovirus vector vaccines

**Real-World Implementation:**
- Mix-and-match strategies were adopted pragmatically during supply shortages and in response to rare adverse events (such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia associated with adenovirus vector vaccines)
- The approach proved valuable for boosting campaigns, with many countries recommending mRNA boosters regardless of primary series vaccine type

**FDA/EUA Status:**
- The FDA's guidance evolved to permit mixing in certain circumstances, particularly for booster doses, though initial authorization remained product-specific
- Heterologous boosting became standard practice during Omicron variant waves and subsequent booster campaigns

**Impact on Vaccine Uptake:**
Mix-and-match flexibility likely contributed to improved vaccination coverage by reducing logistical constraints and addressing individual vaccine preferences or contraindications, though quantifying this impact is challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** The author suggested that mixing COVID-19 vaccines would "work out" and might even enhance immunity because all targeted the Spike protein, similar to how hepatitis vaccines proved interchangeable
  - **Outcome:** This proved largely correct. Multiple studies confirmed heterologous regimens generated robust responses

• **Prediction:** Citing the polio vaccine example (oral Sabin followed by injectable Salk), the author noted this combination produced stronger mucosal immunity than repeated same-vaccine doses
  - **Outcome:** While the mechanism analogy was apt, the specific emphasis on mucosal immunity proved prescient—later research showed mucosal responses gained importance for transmission blocking as variants evolved

• **Prediction:** The author worried about potential adenovirus vector interference and differences between chimpanzee adenovirus (Oxford/AZ) and Ad26 (J&J)
  - **Outcome:** Initial concerns about anti-vector immunity affecting boosters proved partially valid; this drove adoption of heterologous boosting, though both homologous and heterologous adenovirus boosting were eventually shown to work

• **Prediction:** The author explicitly stated that clinical proof was needed since "educated guesses will only take you so far"
  - **Outcome:** This caution was well-founded. Subsequent trials systematically evaluated safety and immunogenicity of mixed regimens before widespread recommendation

• **Bigger Picture:** The article raised the right question at the right time. Mix-and-match strategies became a crucial tool in global vaccination programs, enabling flexibility during supply constraints and response to emerging variant threats. The Spike protein targeting indeed proved a unifying principle that made heterologous approaches viable.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article identified a practical, high-stakes question at a critical moment and provided a useful framework from historical vaccine experience, correctly anticipating both the opportunity and need for clinical validation at a time when the answer genuinely wasn't known.
