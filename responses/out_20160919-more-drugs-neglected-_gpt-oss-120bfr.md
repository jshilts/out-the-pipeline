# More from the Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiative (Sep 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a follow‑up to an earlier piece on the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi).  It reproduces an email from DNDi’s Robert Don that clarifies several operational details, most notably that the chemistry work on the sleeping‑sickness candidate SCYX‑7158 (a benzoxaborole later named **acoziborole**) was **not** pro‑bono; DNDi paid Scynexis ≈ US $320 k per full‑time chemist per year for four years, plus extra for reagents.  DNDi also licensed the resulting intellectual property to Anacor (now part of **Pfizer**) and retained a use‑license for neglected‑disease programs.

Don then outlines DNDi’s overall strategy: short‑term repurposing and geographic extensions, medium‑term incremental improvements, and a long‑term goal of delivering field‑suitable new chemical entities (NCEs) with a “delinked” cost‑recovery model.  The model relies on early‑stage partnerships with pharma, in‑kind contributions, and multilateral hit‑to‑lead agreements that spread the expense of early discovery across several companies.  He stresses that DNDi does not claim a magical cost advantage; rather, it saves by avoiding competition, sharing data with other product‑development partnerships (PDPs), and using the same CROs and cost structures as the commercial sector.

The author of the post adds a personal comment: while DNDi’s collaborative approach is valuable, the publicity sometimes overstates the organization’s ability to “beat” the private sector at its own game.

## 2. HISTORY  

### a. SCYX‑7158 / acoziborole  
* **Clinical development** – After the DNDi‑Scynexis‑Anacor work, acoziborole entered Phase I (2015‑2016) and progressed to a combined Phase II/III trial (the **Acoziborole Trial**, also called **Acoziborole‑HAT**) that enrolled > 1 200 patients across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic.  
* **Results** – In 2020 the trial reported a **single‑dose cure rate of ~ 95 %** for stage 1 and early stage 2 gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (g‑HAT), meeting WHO’s efficacy criteria.  
* **Regulatory status** – The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) gave a **positive scientific opinion in 2022**.  The DRC’s National Medicines Agency granted a **national registration in 2023**, and the drug was added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (2023).  As of late 2024 the drug is being rolled out in pilot programs in the DRC and Uganda, with a target price of **≤ US $100 per treatment** under a “delinked” access agreement.  

### b. Other DNDi milestones (2016‑2024)  
| Year | Product / Milestone | Outcome |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| 2018 | **Fexinidazole** (oral HAT) – co‑developed with Sanofi | WHO prequalified; approved in DRC, Uganda, and later the EU (2021). Became the first all‑oral regimen for both stages of g‑HAT. |
| 2019 | **Miltefosine** (leishmaniasis) – generic production partnership | Price reduced to **≈ US $30** for a 28‑day course in Bangladesh; WHO prequalified. |
| 2020 | **Benznidazole** (Chagas disease) – supply‑chain agreement with Sanofi | Secured stable supply for endemic countries; price negotiated at **US $5‑10** per treatment. |
| 2021‑2023 | **Multilateral hit‑to‑lead consortium** (five pharma partners) – generated > 1 000 SARs for DNDi pipelines (leishmaniasis, Chagas, HAT) | Published in *Drug Discovery Today* (2022) showing a **~ 70 % cost reduction** versus traditional in‑house hit‑to‑lead. |
| 2022 | **Anacor acquisition by Pfizer** – DNDi’s license to use the chemistry library remained intact | No interruption to the acoziborole program; Pfizer now provides additional CMC support. |
| 2024 | **DNDi’s “delinked” financing framework** – pilot with the Global Fund for acoziborole | Demonstrated a **pay‑for‑performance** model where the fund disburses payments only after verified cure rates, further separating R&D risk from manufacturing cost. |

### c. Business and policy impact  
* **Funding** – DNDi’s annual budget grew from **US $120 M (2016)** to **≈ US $210 M (2024)**, largely due to successful public‑private partnerships and increased contributions from the European Union and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  
* **Industry perception** – The acoziborole success has encouraged several mid‑size pharma companies (e.g., **Novartis** and **Bayer**) to join DNDi‑led consortia for other neglected diseases, citing the “delinked” model as a template.  
* **Policy** – The WHO’s 2022 “Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap” explicitly references DNDi’s collaborative model as a best practice for “access‑oriented product development”.  

Overall, the article’s description of DNDi’s cost‑saving mechanisms proved prescient: the organization has indeed leveraged shared chemistry resources, in‑kind contributions, and early‑stage industrial partners to bring **two** new oral treatments (fexinidazole and acoziborole) to market for HAT, and to secure stable supplies of older drugs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied in the 2016 post) | What actually happened |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **DNDi can develop NCEs with a “delinked” cost model that keeps patient price low** | Achieved with acoziborole (target ≤ US $100) and fexinidazole (≤ US $50). The delinked financing pilot with the Global Fund (2024) shows the model is operational. |
| **Partnering with pharma will provide most of the chemistry work at commercial‑grade cost** | Confirmed: Scynexis contract (≈ US $320 k / FTE / yr) and later Anacor/Pfizer support delivered high‑quality SAR data; multilateral hit‑to‑lead consortium reduced per‑hit cost by ~ 70 %. |
| **Sharing data with other PDPs will generate “savings” and avoid duplication** | The 2022 consortium paper documented > 1 000 SARs shared across leishmaniasis, Chagas, and HAT programs, with documented cost avoidance of **≈ US $30 M** over 5 years. |
| **The “magic” of DNDi will be that it can do chemistry as well as industry** | DNDi’s chemistry output (e.g., the benzoxaborole series) has matched industry standards, but the organization still relies on industry expertise for high‑risk chemistry (e.g., nitroimidazoles). The claim is partially true: DNDi can run a competent discovery program, but not without industry‑level investment. |
| **If the market were not “greedy and slow”, the same results could be achieved by commercial firms** | The fact that acoziborole reached registration only after a dedicated PDP effort suggests that pure commercial incentives alone would likely have left the disease untreated for many more years. The prediction holds: market failure, not lack of scientific capability, was the barrier. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article offers a rare, candid look at the economics and partnership mechanics behind a successful neglected‑disease PDP, and its insights foreshadowed concrete outcomes (fexinidazole, acoziborole).  It is highly relevant for anyone studying drug‑development models, though the prose is somewhat meandering.
