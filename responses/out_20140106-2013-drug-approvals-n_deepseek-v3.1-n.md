# The 2013 Drug Approvals: Not So Great? (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the FDA's 2013 approval of 27 new drugs, a sharp decline from 39 approvals in 2012. Various industry commentators express concern about whether this represents a worrisome downturn in pharmaceutical R&D productivity, especially since the 2013 numbers are closer to the "bleak average" of 24 approvals per year seen in the first decade of the 2000s, rather than the 35 per year that had been projected by McKinsey through 2016.

Bernard Munos suggests that looking at the industry as a whole obscures a split between companies—2013 was "good or great for half of big pharma, and forgettable for the rest." He also notes that the average output of 11 new drugs per year from big pharma over the previous five years is insufficient to support companies' existing sales, especially since only a few become blockbusters. The author (Derek Lowe) remains cautious, suggesting that drug discovery and approval is a statistically noisy process and that drawing firm conclusions from a single year's data may be premature.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following 2013, FDA drug approvals actually rebounded and eventually reached record highs, suggesting that 2013 was indeed statistical noise rather than a sustained downturn in productivity:
- **2014**: The decline continued with 22 novel drug approvals
- **2015**: Recovered to 45 approvals
- **2016**: 22 approvals
- **2017**: 46 approvals (highest since 1996)
- **2018**: 59 approvals (record high, excluding diagnostic imaging agents)
- **2019**: 48 approvals
- **2020**: 53 approvals, despite COVID-19 disruptions
- **2021**: 50 approvals
- **2022**: 37 approvals
- **2023**: 55 approvals

The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation program, established in 2012, significantly impacted approval timelines and numbers throughout this period, with breakthrough-designated drugs often reaching approval faster than traditional pathways.

Bernard Munos's observation about success clustering around certain companies proved prescient—throughout this period, companies with strong pipelines continued to perform well, and the gap between highly productive R&D organizations and struggling ones remained significant.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article and cited sources made several predictions and observations that can be evaluated:

- **McKinsey's projection of 35 approvals per year through 2016**: 
  - *Prediction*: Sustained higher approval rates
  - *Reality*: Highly variable—22 (2014), 45 (2015), 22 (2016), 46 (2017), 59 (2018)—but on average exceeded projections

- **Concern about reversion to the "bleak average" of 24 approvals**:
  - *Prediction*: Industry might return to low productivity baseline
  - *Reality*: While approvals fluctuated annually, the period 2014-2024 showed significantly higher average approval numbers than the pre-2010 baseline
  
- **Bernard Munos's observation about success clustering**:
  - *Prediction*: Today's winners will be tomorrow's winners due to success begetting success
  - *Reality*: This pattern largely held true; companies with strong R&D pipelines maintained better approval records

- **Concern that 11 new drugs per year from big pharma is insufficient**:
  - *Prediction*: Industry structure unsustainable at current approval rates
  - *Reality*: The concern remained valid throughout the decade; many large pharma companies continued facing patent cliffs and pipeline gaps

- **The author's caution about statistical noise**:
  - *Prediction*: Single-year data insufficient for drawing conclusions
  - *Reality*: This proved wise—the multi-year trend showed much more variability than suggested by focusing on 2013 alone

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important moment of industry uncertainty about R&D productivity trends, but in hindsight, 2013 proved to be just statistical variation in a generally upward trend of FDA approvals. The discussion about success clustering in certain companies and the challenges of sustaining large pharma business models remain relevant.
