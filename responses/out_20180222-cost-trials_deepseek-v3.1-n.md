# Cost of Trials (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article examines pharmaceutical R&D productivity and drug pricing through the lens of rising clinical trial costs. The author cites John Tucker's analysis showing that medical services inflation—which has dramatically outpaced general consumer price inflation since the mid-to-late 1980s—drives up clinical trial expenses. Despite rising costs, Tucker's data indicates that drug approvals have increased since 2005 while trial sizes, success rates, and the number of Phase 2/3 trials have remained relatively stable.

The article discusses Alzheimer's disease as a problematic case study: expensive, lengthy trials with near-100% historical failure rates, yet companies continue investing despite weak underlying clinical rationales. The central argument focuses on perverse incentives in pharmaceutical companies, where advancement decisions are driven by end-of-year goals, bonuses, and promotions rather than scientific merit. The author draws parallels to counterproductive metrics in medicinal chemistry departments (rewarding compound quantity over quality) and argues that organizational incentives often encourage pushing marginal candidates into expensive trials simply to meet bureaucratic targets.

## 2. HISTORY

**Evolution of Clinical Trial Costs**: In the years following this 2018 article, clinical trial costs continued their upward trajectory. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) introduced new complexities and expenses related to remote monitoring, patient recruitment challenges, and supply chain disruptions. However, it also accelerated adoption of decentralized clinical trial models and digital health technologies, which some analysts hoped might eventually moderate cost growth through improved efficiency.

**Alzheimer's Disease Landscape**: The article's skepticism about Alzheimer's trials proved prescient. Between 2018-2021, multiple high-profile Alzheimer's programs failed, including several targeting beta-amyloid. However, in June 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Biogen's aducanumab (Aduhelm) despite mixed clinical evidence, generating significant controversy. This approval—criticized by many experts as premature—illustrated the exact perverse incentives the article described: intense pressure to approve something, even with uncertain benefit-risk profiles.

In January 2023, another anti-amyloid antibody, lecanemab (Leqembi), received traditional FDA approval with somewhat more convincing (though still modest) clinical benefit data. However, uptake has been limited by practical concerns including the need for frequent infusions, monitoring for brain swelling/bleeding side effects, and questions about meaningful clinical impact for patients.

**R&D Productivity Trends**: Major pharmaceutical companies continued facing productivity challenges. A 2021 analysis by the consulting firm Deloitte found that return on investment for R&D among large pharma companies had declined to its lowest point in over a decade. The average cost to bring a drug to market remained controversial, with estimates ranging from \$1-2+ billion depending on methodology, but there was broad consensus that costs were not decreasing.

**Regulatory and Policy Developments**: The FDA's real-world evidence framework gained momentum, potentially offering pathways to reduce trial costs through expanded use of electronic health records and patient-generated data. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) continued influencing regulatory flexibility, including expanded use of surrogate endpoints and adaptive trial designs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article implicitly predicted that Alzheimer's trials would continue facing high failure rates unless fundamental understanding of the disease improved.

  **Outcome**: Mixed. Traditional approaches (especially beta-amyloid targeting) continued showing limited success, though lecanemab did eventually achieve approval with modest clinical benefit. The broader mechanistic approach has not been abandoned, but remains controversial.

• **Prediction**: Perverse incentives would continue driving marginal candidates into expensive trials.

  **Outcome**: This pattern persisted. The Aduhelm controversy exemplified institutional pressure to advance candidates despite uncertain scientific rationales. However, some companies began implementing more sophisticated portfolio management and early-stage filtering mechanisms.

• **Prediction**: Rising trial costs would create unsustainable financial pressure on drug development.

  **Outcome**: Confirmed. Clinical development costs remained a central challenge for the industry, contributing to consolidation and increased focus on later-stage acquisitions rather than internal R&D.

• **Prediction**: The disconnect between medical service costs and general inflation would continue.

  **Outcome**: Confirmed. Medical inflation consistently outpaced general CPI through 2024, maintaining upward pressure on trial budgets.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrated strong analytical insight into structural problems plaguing pharmaceutical R&D, particularly its accurate diagnosis of perverse incentives and the continued struggles in Alzheimer's drug development. Its framework for understanding trial cost inflation remains relevant to ongoing industry challenges.
