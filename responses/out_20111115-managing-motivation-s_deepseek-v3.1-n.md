# Managing For Motivation, The Simple Way (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary article from November 2011 that tells an anecdotal story adapted from Kingsley Amis' memoirs about a pork-pie factory in England. The factory was remarkably productive, producing far more pork pies than seemed possible given their workforce size. American management consultants visited to learn the company's secret, asking about various management techniques like Pareto chart analysis and Six Sigma methodologies, but the owner claimed no knowledge of any of these approaches. When pressed for his management secret, the owner explained that periodically he would stick his head through a window overlooking the factory floor and shout "FASTER, YOU BASTAAAAARDS!" The article implicitly satirizes the contrast between this crude management approach and the complex management theories that consultants typically promote.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article was published in November 2011, there have been significant developments in management theory and workplace practices that provide relevant context. The years following 2011 saw continued evolution of management approaches, with evidence-based management gaining more traction in business literature and practice. Management consulting continued as a major industry, with firms like McKinsey, Bain, and BCG maintaining substantial influence. However, there was also growing emphasis on employee engagement, positive workplace culture, and more sophisticated approaches to motivation beyond simple productivity pressure.

The post-2011 period also witnessed the continued rise of agile methodologies, lean management practices, and increased focus on employee wellbeing and mental health in the workplace. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020 led to significant shifts in management practices, including widespread adoption of remote work and greater emphasis on flexible management approaches. The simple "speed and pressure" approach satirized in the article became increasingly recognized as counterproductive for sustained performance and employee retention.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit predictions about the future. As a satirical commentary using a historical anecdote, the piece was primarily descriptive rather than predictive in nature. The implicit message was critical of both simplistic coercive management and complex management consulting jargon, but it did not make testable forecasts about how management practices would evolve in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

**2/9**

While the article is entertaining and makes a valid satirical point about management culture, its limited scope and purely anecdotal nature restrict broader scientific or industrial importance. The humor is effective but the content lacks substantial analytical depth or empirical grounding that would warrant higher interest for serious business or biotech industry analysis.
