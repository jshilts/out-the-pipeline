# Dimebon for Alzheimer's: A Black Box Indeed (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 commentary discusses Dimebon (dimebolin), an old Russian antihistamine being repurposed for Alzheimer's treatment, then in Phase III trials through Medivation and Pfizer. The author highlights the drug's unclear mechanism—it promiscuously hits many CNS targets (histamine, serotonin, NMDA/AMPA glutamate receptors, calcium channels)—making it a "black box." Earlier Phase II data (2008) looked promising, which drove investor enthusiasm and Medivation's stock gains. The author voices cautious skepticism, anticipating that Phase II hype often fades in Phase III, and advises treating Alzheimer's drug development as high-risk while hoping Dimebon might break the field's long drought of effective treatments.

## 2. HISTORY

- **Phase III trial outcomes (March 2010):** The CONNECTION study **failed to meet primary or secondary endpoints**, showing **no significant cognitive or functional benefit** versus placebo. Results were announced shortly after the article's publication.

- **Further trial failures (2010–2012):** The subsequent CONCERT and CONTACT trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's also **missed endpoints**, ending development for the Alzheimer's indication.

- **Regulatory/commercial impact:** After the Phase III failures, Medivation's stock plummeted, and Pfizer **discontinued partnership activities** for Dimebon in Alzheimer's. The FDA approved **no new Alzheimer's drugs** between 2003 and the 2021 accelerated approval of aducanumab; Dimebon did not change clinical practice.

- **Scientific understanding:** The "black box" mechanism remains incompletely resolved. Research suggested mitochondrial and cholinesterase interactions, but the pathways and clinical translation stayed unclear and did not lead to new therapeutic strategies.

- **Company trajectory:** Medivation later pivoted and, in 2016, was **acquired by Pfizer** for about $14 billion based on success with other assets (e.g., enzalutamide for prostate cancer), not Dimebon. Dimebon's failures underscored the high bar in Alzheimer's trials and contributed to skepticism about repurposed non-selective CNS drugs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Phase III would likely "flatten out" Phase II's "eye-catching numbers."**  
  **✓ Accurate.** Phase III (CONNECTION, then CONCERT and CONTACT) unequivocally failed across primary and secondary endpoints, matching this skeptical forecast.

- **Unraveling how Dimebon works "will take quite a while."**  
  **✓ Accurate.** The drug's polypharmacology remained a "black box," and insights did not meaningfully translate into improved mechanistic understanding or therapies.

- **Cautious hope it "could turn out to have beneficial effects" or equally "could miss."**  
  **✓ Balanced and accurate.** The author neither bet heavily on success nor dismissed it, which aligned with the eventual failure. The broader field remained in a long drought until later anti-amyloid antibodies with controversial efficacy post-2021.

- **(Implicit by tone) Alzheimer's remains a high-risk space.**  
  **✓ Accurate.** Robust, widely accepted disease-modifying therapies proved elusive well into the 2020s, underscoring authors caution that the field is difficult and unpredictable.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**  
This article provides a sharp, concise case study in early-phase hype versus late-phase reality in Alzheimer's drug development, highlighted by Dimebon's Phase III failures and Pfizer's withdrawal. It offers enduring lessons about the "black box" problem in CNS pharmacology and the perils of overinterpreting small trials.

## 5. REFLECTIONS

- The author's caution against overconfident mechanistic claims and hype-driven investment was well-founded and prescient given Dimebon's subsequent failures.
- The "black box" metaphor remains diagnostically useful for CNS drugs whose exact disease-relevant targets are unknown, especially as repurposing oral agents with pleotropic effects is still attempted today.
- Dimebon did not fit the emerging amyloid/tau framework in Alzheimer's; its failure reinforced field-wide risk and may have indirectly pushed emphasis toward targeted biology (e.g., anti-amyloid antibodies) even though their efficacy and clinical value remain contentious post-2021.
