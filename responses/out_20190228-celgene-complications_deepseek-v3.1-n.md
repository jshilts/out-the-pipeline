# Celgene Complications (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the uncertainty surrounding Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) proposed acquisition of Celgene after Wellington Management, BMY's largest institutional shareholder (holding 8% of common shares), publicly opposed the deal. Wellington objected based on three concerns: BMY shareholders would bear too much risk while Celgene shareholders received favorable terms below implied asset value, execution success would prove more difficult than management suggested, and alternative paths could better create value for BMY shareholders.

The opposition immediately impacted the market—Celgene's stock fell 8% while BMY's rose—setting up a contentious shareholder vote scheduled for April 2019. The article notes Celgene's business strategy relied heavily on aggressive drug pricing and limiting generic competition, while the company's deal-making track record had been problematic. A secondary opposition emerged from Starboard Value, further complicating the acquisition's prospects.

## 2. HISTORY

The Bristol-Myers Squibb acquisition of Celgene ultimately went through despite shareholder opposition, completing in November 2019 for approximately $74 billion (about $95 per share including Celgene debt). This represented one of the largest pharmaceutical mergers in history at the time.

In the years following the acquisition, Bristol-Myers Squibb faced significant challenges integrating Celgene's portfolio. Most critically, key Celgene drugs faced patent cliffs, including blockbuster Revlimid (lenalidomide), which began losing patent protection in 2022. Revlimid had been a cornerstone of Celgene's revenue, treating multiple myeloma, but faced generic competition that eroded billions in annual revenue.

The deal did bring Bristol-Myers valuable assets, including several CAR-T cell therapies and oncology drugs in development. However, generic competition intensified, and the company had to manage the complex integration while navigating patent expirations across multiple therapeutic areas. The acquisition positioned Bristol-Myers as a leader in hematology and oncology, but the timing coincided with increasing pricing pressure and policy changes affecting the biopharmaceutical industry.

Wellington Management's concerns about execution difficulty proved prescient to some degree—pharmaceutical mega-mergers typically face integration challenges, risk concentration, and portfolio management issues that can dilute shareholder value over time.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions about the acquisition's outcome:

• **Deal would likely fail due to shareholder opposition** — **OUTCOME: INCORRECT** — Despite strong institutional opposition from Wellington Management and Starboard Value, the deal closed successfully.

• **Shareholder meeting in April would be contentious and potentially decisive** — **OUTCOME: PARTIALLY CORRECT** — The meeting and vote process involved significant debate, but ultimately shareholders approved the transaction.

• **Wellington's specific concerns about overpaying and execution risk** — **OUTCOME: ARGUABLE** — The deal structure did cause significant debt accumulation, and integration challenges were substantial, though whether returns justified the premium remains debated among investors and analysts.

• **Implicit suggestion that someone else might bid for Celgene given 8% stock drop** — **OUTCOME: INCORRECT** — No competing bids emerged despite the price volatility.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides insight into the complexities of major pharmaceutical mergers, particularly shareholder activism's role in shaping corporate strategy in the biotech sector. The specific case proved historically significant due to the deal's eventual completion despite opposition, making it relevant for understanding M&A dynamics in large-cap biopharma.
