# New Vancomycins That Do the Job (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary discusses a paper from Dale Boger's group at Scripps describing synthetic modifications to vancomycin, an important last-line antibiotic. The article notes that three synthetically modified vancomycin analogs were already on the market (oritavancin, dalbavancin, and telavancin), which featured hydrophobic side chains that enhanced their activity through membrane binding and disruption mechanisms.

The Boger group's innovation involved combining two modifications: adding a para-chlorobiphenyl hydrophobic group while simultaneously altering a key amide carbonyl in the binding pocket. The goal was to evade vancomycin-resistant bacterial strains. The author praises this as exemplary total synthesis work that delivers clinically relevant analogs, distinguishing it from synthesis projects that fail to produce useful derivatives.

## 2. HISTORY

The semisynthetic vancomycin derivatives mentioned (oritavancin, dalbavancin, and telavancin) were all FDA-approved around the time of or shortly after this article:

- **Telavancin**: FDA-approved in 2013 for complicated skin infections and 2013 for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia
- **Dalbavancin**: FDA-approved in 2014 for acute bacterial skin infections
- **Oritavancin**: FDA-approved in 2014 for acute bacterial skin infections

These drugs did achieve clinical use, particularly for serious Gram-positive infections including MRSA. However, their adoption has been moderate rather than revolutionary. They offer some advantages (such as dalbavancin's once-weekly dosing), but vancomycin remains widely used as the workhorse treatment. None of these newer derivatives dramatically displaced vancomycin from clinical practice.

Regarding vancomycin resistance: while resistance has increased, vancomycin remains a clinically important antibiotic. The emergence and spread of vancomycin-resistant *Enterococcus* (VRE) and vancomycin-intermediate *Staphylococcus aureus* (VISA) have been concerning, but full vancomycin resistance in MRSA remains relatively uncommon. The slow resistance development the article mentions has largely held true.

The Boger group's specific research direction (dual modifications to evade resistance) represented academic progress, but I cannot confirm whether this exact approach led to approved drugs or widespread clinical adoption in the subsequent decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: "This could point the way to a new generation of vancomycins that (with any luck) can continue confusing bacteria for many years to come."
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While the three approved derivatives (telavancin, dalbavancin, oritavancin) did become available, they did not spawn an entirely "new generation" that fundamentally changed antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin itself remains in widespread use. Resistance mechanisms have continued evolving gradually but haven't rendered vancomycin obsolete.

- **Prediction**: The work represents what "talented, hard-working organic chemists" should focus on when freed from routine tasks.
  - **Outcome**: The value of synthetic chemistry in antibiotic development remains important. However, automated synthesis and computational approaches have continued advancing. The implied dichotomy between manual chemistry and automation has evolved toward more integration rather than replacement.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an ongoing clinical challenge (antibiotic resistance) with relevant examples, but the topic remained somewhat niche, and the specific developments discussed didn't dramatically transform the broader antibiotic landscape. The work described was scientifically solid but didn't represent a paradigm shift in how we combat resistant infections.
