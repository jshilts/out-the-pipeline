# Pfizer Versus BMS, Since 1989 (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes a Forbes piece by Bernard Munos comparing Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug development efficiency from 1989 to 2015. Using a simple but powerful metric—cumulative R&D spending divided by FDA drug approvals over a 26-year period—Munos found that BMS achieved approximately the same number of approvals as Pfizer (26 vs. 25 drugs) while spending dramatically less ($56 billion vs. $122 billion). The article highlights that Pfizer's massive R&D inefficiency coincided with its post-1999 mega-merger era, during which $62 billion of the $66 billion spending gap accumulated. The piece also discusses Pfizer's then-pending tax inversion deal with Allergan (projected to save $2 billion annually) and questions whether addressing R&D inefficiency (costing ~$4 billion annually extra) should take priority over tax optimization strategies.

## 2. HISTORY

**Merger Activity:** Pfizer's merger trajectory continued as predicted. The Allergan tax inversion deal mentioned in the article was terminated in April 2016 due to new Treasury Department regulations, costing Pfizer a $150 million breakup fee. However, Pfizer pursued other major acquisitions including the $14 billion acquisition of Medivation (2016), and the $11.4 billion acquisition of Array Biopharma (2019). The company maintained its strategy of large-scale M&A despite the identified R&D inefficiencies.

**Bristol-Myers Squibb:** BMS maintained its more focused approach but also engaged in strategic M&A, most notably the $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019 (completed 2020), which some analysts viewed as a departure from their historically disciplined approach.

**Drug Approvals:** Both companies continued to bring drugs to market, though the efficiency gap persisted. Pfizer maintained strong commercial success with drugs like Ibrance (palbociclib) for breast cancer (approved 2015) and the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty (BNT162b2) developed with BioNTech (approved 2021), which became the highest-grossing pharmaceutical product in history, generating $36.8 billion in 2021 revenue. BMS continued its focused portfolio approach with notable approvals including Opdivo (nivolumab) expansion into multiple cancer indications and Reblozyl (luspatercept) for blood disorders.

**R&D Productivity Trends:** The fundamental critique in the 2016 article remained largely valid through 2024. Academic studies continued to show that mega-mergers in pharmaceuticals often failed to improve R&D productivity and frequently disrupted research pipelines. Industry-wide drug development costs continued rising, with estimates reaching $2.8 billion per new drug when accounting for failures, though these figures remain methodology-dependent.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that Pfizer would continue pursuing tax optimization and M&A over fundamental R&D restructuring**: ✓ **Accurate**. The Allergan inversion failed, but Pfizer maintained its M&A-heavy strategy with Medivation and Array acquisitions, and continued focusing on financial engineering (including multiple restructuring efforts and Upjohn spin-off that created Viatris in 2020).

• **Implicit prediction that Pfizer's R&D inefficiency would persist without radical changes**: ✓ **Accurate**. While Pfizer achieved major successes (especially the COVID vaccine), the fundamental critique remained relevant. The company continued to rely heavily on acquisitions for pipeline growth rather than internal discovery productivity improvements.

• **Implicit prediction that mergers would continue disrupting R&D**: ✓ **Accurate**. Industry data continued to show that mega-mergers typically reduced R&D productivity for several years post-merger and often led to pipeline consolidation rather than innovation acceleration.

• **Munos's thesis that leaner, more focused R&D organizations outperform massive ones**: ✓ **Partially accurate**. BMS maintained relatively strong performance, but the 2019 Celgene acquisition (>$70 billion) arguably contradicted this philosophy, suggesting even "efficient" companies face pressure to scale through M&A.

• **Structural prediction about incentive misalignment for CEOs**: ✓ **Accurate**. The article correctly identified that short CEO tenures relative to drug development timelines create preference for immediate financial engineering over long-term R&D transformation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article accurately identified persistent structural problems in pharmaceutical R&D and predicted Pfizer's continued reliance on financial engineering despite massive inefficiency. Its insights about the tension between short-term incentives and long-term productivity remain highly relevant to understanding pharmaceutical industry dynamics and the limited progress in improving drug discovery economics.
