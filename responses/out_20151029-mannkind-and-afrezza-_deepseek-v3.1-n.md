# Mannkind and Afrezza: Reality Intrudes. Or Should, Anyway. (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques the persistent enthusiasm for inhaled insulin products despite clear market failures. It highlights how Pfizer's $2.8 billion Exubera collaboration ended in 2007 with catastrophic sales and product withdrawal due to lack of demand. The piece then focuses on Mannkind's Afrezza, noting that despite Exubera's failure, the company and its dedicated investors continued to believe in the inhaled insulin concept.

The article specifically references Sanofi's Q3 2015 earnings showing poor Afrezza sales, with speculation that Sanofi would end its partnership with Mannkind as early as contractually possible. The author characterizes continued optimism about Afrezza's prospects as "delusional," pointing to devoted investor communities on Twitter (including the "#inalmannitrust" hashtag) while suggesting Mannkind faced a grim future given market realities.

## 2. HISTORY
The article's pessimistic predictions about Afrezza largely proved accurate:

**Sales Performance**: Afrezza's commercial performance remained poor. In January 2016, just months after this article, Sanofi announced it was terminating the collaboration agreement with Mannkind, returning full rights by November 2016. 

**Mannkind's Trajectory**: The company faced severe financial struggles. Stock prices plummeted from around $5-6 in 2015 to pennies by 2020. Mannkind implemented multiple reverse stock splits to maintain NASDAQ listing compliance, and struggled with debt restructuring and ongoing cash burn issues.

**No Market Transformation**: Contrary to enthusiastic predictions, inhaled insulin never became a standard diabetes treatment. The medical community and patients showed continued preference for traditional injection methods, and concerns about pulmonary safety data availability persisted for Afrezza.

**No Major Buyout**: Despite speculation about the Tel Aviv stock exchange listing leading to acquisitions, no significant buyout occurred. Instead, Mannkind remained an independent company facing persistent challenges in establishing Afrezza commercially.

**Clinical Evidence**: While Afrezza maintained FDA approval, broader adoption was hindered by slower-than-expected uptake and continued physician preference for established insulin delivery methods. The predicted market transformation never materialized.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several predictions:

- **Sanofi would dump Mannkind when contractually possible**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Sanofi terminated the collaboration in January 2016
- **Mannkind looked "doomed" from that point forward**: ✓ **MOSTLY ACCURATE** - The company survived but faced severe financial difficulties, stock decline, and failed to achieve commercial success with Afrezza
- **True believers would continue hanging in there**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Investor communities continued supporting the company despite mounting evidence
- **2016 wouldn't be great as predicted by enthusiasts**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - 2016 included Sanofi termination announcement and continued poor performance

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article demonstrated clear-eyed biotech sector analysis that correctly identified the disconnect between investor enthusiasm and market realities for a specific drug delivery platform, making it a valuable case study in therapeutic development commercial viability assessment.
