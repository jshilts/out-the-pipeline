# Alnylam Sues Dicerna (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article reports on a trade secret misappropriation lawsuit filed by Alnylam against Dicerna related to GalNAc conjugate technology for delivering siRNAs to the liver. The dispute centered on allegations that Dicerna hired former Merck employees after Alnylam acquired Sirna Therapeutics from Merck for $175 million in 2014. The legal question revolved around what proprietary knowledge these employees brought with them to Dicerna and whether Alnylam had adequately protected its GalNAc technology as trade secrets under applicable law (Massachusetts and New Jersey trade secret statutes). The author speculated the case would likely settle out of court.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Lawsuit Resolution**: The Alnylam-Dicerna litigation was indeed settled, with the companies reaching an agreement that allowed both to continue developing RNAi therapeutics with GalNAc conjugates without further legal conflict.

**GalNAc-Conjugate Technology Evolution**: Following this period, GalNAc-conjugate delivery became the dominant platform for targeted liver delivery of RNAi therapeutics. Multiple RNAi drugs using this technology gained FDA approval and entered clinical use.

**Company Trajectories**:
- **Alnylam**: Went on to achieve multiple FDA approvals using GalNAc technology, including Onpattro (patisiran, 2018), Givlaari (givosiran, 2019), Oxlumo (lumasiran, 2020), and Leqvio (inclisiran, partnered with Novartis, 2021). These approvals established RNAi as a validated therapeutic modality.
- **Dicerna**: Continued developing RNAi therapeutics and was ultimately acquired by Novo Nordisk in December 2021 for approximately $3.3 billion, demonstrating the significant commercial value that RNAi technology achieved.
- **Novartis**: Partnered with Alnylam on inclisiran, which became the first RNAi therapeutic for cardiovascular disease.
- The market moved beyond early disputes as the field matured and multiple companies successfully commercialized RNAi drugs.

**Clinical and Commercial Outcomes**: RNAi therapeutics demonstrated real-world clinical efficacy, with approved drugs showing measurable patient benefits and achieving commercial success, establishing the technology as a legitimate therapeutic platform beyond experimental status.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I'm guessing that this is one of those cases that's going to end in some sort of settlement"**  
  - **Outcome**: **Substantially correct**. The lawsuit did settle, and both companies went on to develop successful RNAi programs without ongoing legal conflict.

• **Implicit prediction that GalNAc technology would be commercially valuable**  
  - **Outcome**: **Significantly exceeded expectations**. The GalNAc delivery platform became foundational to RNAi therapeutics, leading to multiple FDA-approved drugs and multi-billion dollar acquisitions, representing one of the most successful drug delivery technologies in biopharmaceutical history.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when RNAi technology was transitioning from experimental to commercial, highlighting both the technical importance of GalNAc delivery and the competitive dynamics that would shape the industry.
