# The Portable Chemist's Consultant (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article reviews "The Portable Chemist's Consultant," an iPad application/book by Prof. Phil Baran and co-authors Yoshihiro Ishihara and Ana Montero. The review describes it as a high-quality educational resource based on Baran's heterocyclic chemistry course, featuring interactive transformations with animations, detailed reference lists, and "Consumer Reports"-style tables comparing synthetic methods. 

The author praises the work's academic excellence for heterocyclic chemistry but notes two significant limitations: (1) scope - the title is misleading as it focuses almost exclusively on heterocyclic chemistry while missing other areas mentioned in the subtitle such as scale-up chemistry, medicinal chemistry considerations (pharmacokinetics, metabolism), analytical chemistry, and radiolabeling; and (2) platform - it's only available on iPad, excluding many chemists who don't own iPads or can't use them in lab settings.

The reviewer concludes that while it's a valuable resource for iPad-owning organic chemists, the work feels incomplete and platform-limited, though notes Baran's commitment to ongoing updates.

## 2. HISTORY
The Portable Chemist's Consultant evolved significantly after this 2013 review. The project expanded beyond the initial iPad-only version, though comprehensive documentation of its complete trajectory is limited. The original concept represented an early experiment in interactive digital chemistry education tools, predating the widespread adoption of mobile-first scientific reference materials.

Over the subsequent decade, the broader landscape of chemistry resources underwent substantial digital transformation. The chemistry community witnessed an explosion of online databases, computational tools, and mobile applications for chemical information. However, many early platform-specific chemistry apps faced challenges with longevity and cross-platform compatibility, particularly as tablet ownership patterns among scientists evolved more slowly than the general consumer market.

Phil Baran's research group continued its influential work in synthetic methodology, with Baran becoming one of the most cited chemists and a leading figure in practical synthetic chemistry, particularly in heterocyclic synthesis and scalable methods. His group's research productivity suggests the foundational knowledge in the PCC likely remained relevant, though specific updates to the PCC project are not well-documented in publicly accessible sources.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made no explicit predictions about future events in the article, focusing instead on evaluation of an existing product. The reviewer's observations about platform limitations and content gaps were astute assessments of the then-current state rather than forecasts of future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
While professionally written and insightful about chemistry education, this review of a niche chemistry reference app has limited broader scientific or societal impact compared to major biotech innovations or breakthrough discoveries.
