# AI Will Not Threaten Pharma Patents – Not This Way (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 Nature letter argues that, even if an artificial‑intelligence (AI) system proposes a novel, potent small‑molecule scaffold, the resulting patent‑ability will still rest on human inventorship. The author contends that a patent requires **novelty** and **utility**, and that the “inventor” must be a natural person who can explain how the compound was arrived at. Because AI‑generated hits would still need extensive human optimisation (bioavailability, toxicity, synthesis, formulation, etc.), the final drug‑candidate would be the product of human inventive steps, not the algorithm itself. Consequently, the writer predicts that AI will be a useful tool—much like high‑throughput screening equipment—but will not undermine the existing pharmaceutical patent regime.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Patent law developments (2018‑2024)**  
* The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) reaffirmed in 2020‑2022 that only natural persons can be listed as inventors. Applications naming an AI system (e.g., the “DABUS” cases) were rejected, and the USPTO issued formal guidance (2022) requiring a human to be identified as the inventor.  
* The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) briefly allowed an AI‑named inventor in 2021, but a 2023 appeal reversed that decision, aligning the UK with the USPTO stance.  
* No major jurisdiction has yet adopted a rule that permits an AI to be a statutory inventor, so the “human‑inventor” requirement remains the norm.

**AI‑driven drug discovery outcomes**  
* **Exscientia** (UK) used its Centaur platform to design DSP‑1181, a dopamine‑D2 agonist for Parkinson’s disease. The molecule entered Phase I in 2020 and progressed to Phase II by 2023. While the compound is still under clinical evaluation (as of early 2024), the underlying patents list human scientists as inventors, with the AI platform described only as a “tool.”  
* **Insilico Medicine** announced in 2020 the discovery of a novel fibrosis inhibitor (INS‑001) generated de novo by its generative‑AI pipeline. The compound entered pre‑clinical studies and was patented by the company; again, the inventorship is attributed to the research team.  
* **Atomwise**, **BenevolentAI**, **Cyclica**, and several biotech start‑ups have filed dozens of composition‑of‑matter patents on AI‑suggested scaffolds. The USPTO has granted the majority of these applications, provided the applicants supplied experimental data (synthesis, activity, etc.) and identified human inventors.  
* No drug that is **entirely** designed by AI (i.e., the final marketed molecule is the exact output of the algorithm without subsequent human optimisation) has reached regulatory approval as of 2024. All marketed AI‑influenced drugs have undergone substantial human‑directed medicinal‑chemistry work before filing.

**Industry adoption**  
* By 2023, AI‑assisted hit‑finding and lead‑optimization were incorporated into the R&D pipelines of several large pharma companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Roche). The tools are treated as “knowledge‑discovery platforms” rather than autonomous inventors.  
* Investment in AI‑driven biotech surged: venture capital funding for AI‑focused drug‑discovery firms grew from ≈ $300 M in 2018 to > $2 B cumulative by 2023. This reflects confidence in the technology’s ability to accelerate early‑stage discovery, not in its capacity to bypass the patent system.

**Policy and litigation**  
* No high‑profile litigation has successfully challenged the validity of AI‑generated composition‑of‑matter patents on the basis that the AI should be considered the inventor. Courts have generally upheld patents where a human inventor is named and the disclosure meets statutory requirements.  
* The USPTO’s “AI‑inventor” guidance has prompted companies to structure their patent strategies (e.g., filing “method‑of‑use” claims or “AI‑assisted design” claims) to avoid inventorship disputes.

Overall, the legal framework and industry practice have evolved **in line with the article’s core claim**: AI is a powerful tool, but patents continue to be granted to human inventors who can satisfy the statutory requirements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the 2018 letter | What actually happened (2024) |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **AI‑generated compounds will not be listed as inventors; patents will still require a human inventor.** | Confirmed. USPTO, EPO, and UKIPO all require a natural‑person inventor. AI‑named inventors have been rejected. |
| **The AI will only suggest “lead” structures; humans will perform the optimisation (bioavailability, toxicity, synthesis, formulation, etc.).** | Accurate. All AI‑derived molecules that entered the clinic underwent extensive human‑directed optimisation before filing patents. |
| **Patents on AI‑suggested molecules will be granted as long as the usual novelty/utility data are provided.** | Largely true. Hundreds of composition‑of‑matter patents on AI‑suggested scaffolds have been issued worldwide, provided experimental support and human inventorship. |
| **AI will not “destroy” the pharmaceutical patent system.** | Correct. No systemic erosion of patent rights has been observed; the system remains robust, with only procedural adjustments (inventorship rules). |
| **AI tools will be treated like high‑throughput screens or plate readers—useful but not a legal threat.** | Consistent with practice. Companies describe AI platforms as “tools” in their patent filings and internal R&D documentation. |

No major prediction in the letter was demonstrably false; the only nuance is that the **speed and volume** of AI‑generated patent filings have increased far beyond what the author may have imagined, but this has not altered the fundamental legal outcome.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a concise, prescient commentary on a legal‑technical issue that remains highly relevant as AI permeates drug discovery. It scores above average because it correctly anticipated the main patent‑law trajectory, yet it is narrowly focused on inventorship rather than broader scientific or commercial implications.
