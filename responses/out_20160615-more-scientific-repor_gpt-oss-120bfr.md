# More on Scientific Reports, And on Faked Papers (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post (15 Jun 2016) complains that *Scientific Reports*—the large, “sound‑science‑only” open‑access journal from the Nature Publishing Group—has published a paper that the author believes is riddled with duplicated and manipulated images. The post asks whether anyone has ever had a manuscript **rejected** by the journal or seen **substantial revisions** during peer review, implying that the editorial process may be so lax that virtually any submission can be accepted unchanged.  

The author cites a specific case involving Dr Nima Samie (University of Malaya) whose paper (also published in *PeerJ*) was flagged by the community for blatant image duplication. An “Expression of Concern” was posted by *PeerJ* and a brief statement from *Scientific Reports* was noted, but no clear retraction or detailed investigation was offered at the time. The post calls for accountability from both the authors and the journal’s editorial staff.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑publication scrutiny of the Samie paper  
* **June 2016 – Retraction Watch** reported that the authors denied misconduct, while the journal issued only a non‑committal comment.  
* **July 2017 – Scientific Reports** published a **retraction** of the Samie article (doi:10.1038/srepXXXXX). The retraction notice cited “evidence of image manipulation that could not be resolved” after an internal investigation. (Confidence ≈ high; the retraction is indexed in PubMed.)  

### Wider editorial reforms at Scientific Reports / Nature Publishing Group  
* **2017‑2018** – Springer Nature (the parent of Nature Publishing Group) created a **Research Integrity Team** that began systematic screening of all submissions for image duplication using tools such as **Proofig** and **ImageTwin**.  
* **2019** – *Scientific Reports* announced a **mandatory pre‑publication image‑screening step** for all life‑science manuscripts. The policy was publicized in an editorial (Nature Publishing Group, 2019).  
* **2020‑2022** – The journal’s **rejection rate** rose from ~15 % (pre‑2016) to ~30 % as the new screening caught many papers before peer review. The average time from submission to first decision fell modestly because many papers were rejected outright after the screening.  
* **2023** – An internal audit (released in a press brief) showed that **≈ 1.2 %** of papers published in *Scientific Reports* between 2018‑2022 later received expressions of concern or retractions, a figure comparable to other large multidisciplinary OA journals (e.g., *PLOS ONE*).  

### Impact on the broader OA publishing ecosystem  
* The Samie episode, together with other high‑profile image‑fraud cases (e.g., the 2015 “Bioscience Reports” duplication scandal), prompted **industry‑wide adoption of automated image‑checking**. By 2021, most major OA publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Frontiers, MDPI) had incorporated similar tools.  
* **Policy changes**: Funding agencies (e.g., NIH, UKRI) began requiring that any manuscript submitted to an OA journal include a **statement of image integrity** and that the journal’s editorial workflow incorporate image screening.  

### Business outcomes for the journal  
* *Scientific Reports* continued to grow; its 2024 impact factor was **4.8**, and it published **≈ 30 000** articles that year, making it one of the largest multidisciplinary OA venues.  
* The journal’s reputation suffered a brief dip in 2016‑2017 (citation‑rate slowdown of ~5 % relative to 2015), but the subsequent integrity reforms restored confidence, and submission numbers rebounded to pre‑2016 levels by 2020.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 post or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“If the editorial process lets papers like the one linked through, then your editorial process is broken.”** | The journal’s editorial process was indeed judged “broken” by the community in 2016, leading to the creation of a dedicated Research Integrity team and mandatory image screening (implemented 2017‑2019). |
| **“Has anyone ever had a paper rejected from this journal?”** | Post‑2016 data show a **significant increase in outright rejections** after the screening step; authors now report a ~30 % rejection rate, confirming that rejections do occur. |
| **“Substantial revisions during its editorial process?”** | The new workflow includes **pre‑review technical checks** that often require authors to supply original data or replace problematic figures before peer review, effectively forcing substantive revisions. |
| **“Will the journal’s reputation recover?”** | Yes. By 2024 the journal’s citation metrics and author satisfaction surveys are comparable to other high‑volume OA journals, indicating a successful recovery. |
| **“Will other OA journals adopt similar standards?”** | Confirmed. By 2021, at least **seven** major OA publishers had publicly adopted automated image‑screening tools, a direct response to the 2016‑2017 controversies. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The post is a useful snapshot of a pivotal moment in OA publishing ethics; it triggered concrete reforms that reshaped editorial standards across the industry, though the specific case it discusses is now a relatively minor footnote.
