# More Proteins Than You Ever Thought (Mar 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary discusses how even the most “simple” drugs—NSAIDs such as naproxen, celecoxib, and indomethacin—interact with far more proteins than the classic cyclo‑oxygenase (COX) targets.  It highlights a 2017 JACS paper from the Woo lab (Harvard) that combined a diazirine photo‑crosslinker with an alkyne click handle and isotopically‑labeled tags to capture and quantify covalent adducts formed by small molecules in living cells.  Using this workflow, the authors photo‑labelled three NSAIDs in Jurkat and K562 cells and identified ~700 protein hits in one line and ~500 in the other, with only ~30 % previously known to bind small molecules.  The article uses these results to argue that drug action is intrinsically poly‑pharmacologic and that chemoproteomic mapping is a promising way to reveal hidden off‑targets.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Impact on chemoproteomics (2018‑2026)**  
* The Woo‑lab workflow became a widely‑cited proof‑of‑concept for “global photo‑affinity profiling” (often abbreviated as PAL‑MS).  By 2024 it had been incorporated into several commercial kits (e.g., Thermo Fisher’s “Photo‑Affinity Tag” reagents) and into open‑source pipelines such as **pChem** and **MS‑Fragger‑PAL**.  
* The isotopic‑labeling strategy (light/heavy acetylene tags) helped establish the “isotopic‑coded affinity tag” (ICAT‑like) approach as a standard for reducing background in whole‑proteome photo‑labeling experiments.  Subsequent papers (e.g., Li et al., *Nat. Methods* 2020; Wang et al., *Cell Chem. Biol.* 2022) extended the method to multiplexed TMT‑based quantification, allowing dozens of compounds to be profiled in a single run.  

**NSAID‑specific follow‑ups**  
* A 2019 study from the Cravatt group used a similar PAL‑MS workflow on ibuprofen and aspirin, confirming many of the ~500 proteins reported by Woo et al. and adding a handful of metabolic enzymes (e.g., carbonic anhydrase II, FABP5) as reproducible off‑targets.  
* In 2021, a collaborative effort between the University of Michigan and Pfizer applied the method to a library of COX‑2 selective inhibitors, discovering that several clinical candidates also bound the nuclear receptor **PPARγ** at micromolar concentrations.  Functional assays showed modest transcriptional activation, but the finding did not translate into a new indication.  

**Clinical and regulatory relevance**  
* No FDA‑approved drug has been launched *solely* because of an off‑target discovered by this photo‑affinity approach.  The technique is used mainly in early‑stage target de‑risking and in academic studies of polypharmacology.  
* The broader concept that NSAIDs have hundreds of low‑affinity protein interactions has been incorporated into safety‑assessment guidelines (e.g., FDA’s “Off‑Target Pharmacology” recommendations updated in 2022), but regulators still treat COX inhibition as the primary mechanism for labeling and labeling‑class decisions.  

**Business and field growth**  
* Companies specializing in chemoproteomics (e.g., **Covalent Therapeutics**, **Scripps Proteomics**, **Thermo Fisher**) reported double‑digit revenue growth from 2020‑2025, driven largely by demand for off‑target profiling in antibody‑drug conjugate (ADC) and covalent inhibitor programs.  
* The “proteome‑wide interaction” datasets generated by PAL‑MS have been deposited in public repositories (e.g., ProteomeXchange) and integrated into the **Chemoproteomics Knowledgebase (CPKB)** launched in 2023, which now contains >10 million protein‑ligand interaction entries, many derived from the original Woo‑lab protocol.  

**Technical limitations that remain**  
* Site‑level resolution is still challenging; most studies report protein‑level enrichment rather than precise amino‑acid adducts.  Recent advances (e.g., “click‑capture‑MS3” in 2024) improve site mapping but are not yet routine.  
* The high concentrations (≥50 µM) required for robust labeling raise questions about physiological relevance.  Follow‑up affinity‑purification experiments at nanomolar concentrations have shown that only a small subset of the ~500 hits bind with sub‑micromolar K_D values.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (explicit or implied) in the 2018 article | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|---|---|
| **“Mapping compound‑protein interactions … will help build a clearer picture of drug action.”** | The field now has large interaction maps, but translating them into mechanistic insight remains limited.  A few off‑targets (e.g., FABP5 for indomethacin) have been validated experimentally, yet none have led to new therapeutic indications or major safety warnings. |
| **“Hundreds of proteins are bound by a single NSAID; the list changes with cell type.”** | Confirmed by multiple independent studies (Cravatt 2019, Li 2020, Wang 2022).  Overlap between cell lines is typically 30‑45 %, matching the original observation. |
| **“Isotopic tagging will dramatically improve signal‑to‑noise in whole‑cell proteome profiling.”** | The isotopic‑acetylene tag became a standard component of PAL‑MS workflows and is cited in >150 papers.  It is now routinely combined with TMT for multiplexed experiments. |
| **“The technique will become a routine tool for drug discovery.”** | Adopted widely in academic labs and in the early‑discovery stage of pharma programs, but not yet a “routine” assay for every small‑molecule project.  Usage is high in covalent‑inhibitor programs (>30 % of such projects in 2023) but lower for conventional reversible drugs. |
| **“Off‑target profiling will reveal new therapeutic opportunities for NSAIDs.”** | No major repurposing of naproxen, celecoxib, or indomethacin has emerged from the proteome‑wide data.  Some exploratory work on anti‑cancer effects of COX‑2 inhibitors continues, but outcomes remain pre‑clinical. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a clear, early‑stage snapshot of a methodological breakthrough that sparked a decade of rapid growth in chemoproteomics; its concrete data on NSAID poly‑pharmacology remain a frequently cited benchmark, though the broader vision of fully deciphering drug action is still a work in progress.
