# A New Parkinson's Therapy - Possibly (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Lancet-published clinical trial investigating exenatide, a GLP-1 agonist diabetes medication, as a potential therapy for Parkinson's disease. The Phase II double-blind trial involved approximately 60 patients (30 per group) treated for 48 weeks with 12 weeks washout. Results showed modest motor function improvement in the treatment group while controls continued to decline, though the p-value of 0.03 fell short of the proposed stricter threshold of p=0.005. Previous open-label work by the same team had also shown motor benefits along with cognitive improvements, though the cognitive findings did not replicate in the double-blind study. The article notes exenatide crosses the blood-brain barrier and has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in vitro. While acknowledging the promise, the author emphasizes that larger trials are needed to confirm the results given the modest statistical significance and small sample size.
  
## 2. HISTORY

The 2017 trial initiated a wave of further research into GLP-1 receptor agonists for Parkinson's disease. Following the Lancet study, larger Phase II and Phase III trials were conducted to validate the initial findings. The most significant subsequent trial was published in 2023, which demonstrated more robust evidence of efficacy. Several other GLP-1 agonists (including liraglutide and lixisenatide) have also been investigated in Parkinson's trials.

As of the present time, **no GLP-1 agonist has received FDA or EMA approval specifically for Parkinson's disease treatment**, though research continues. The original exenatide work led to expanded clinical investigation and established the GLP-1 pathway as a credible therapeutic target for Parkinson's neuroprotection. However, overall progress has been slower than hoped when this article was written, with multiple companies conducting trials but no breakthrough approval yet achieved. The clinical development pathway for neuroprotective agents in Parkinson's remains challenging, requiring large, long-duration studies to demonstrate disease-modifying effects.
  
## 3. PREDICTIONS

-  **Prediction: The initial findings would need validation in larger patient cohorts to confirm clinical benefit**
  - **Outcome**: Larger trials were indeed conducted (2018-2023), showing mixed but generally supportive results. The pathway proved viable for further development.
  
- **Prediction: The therapy could represent "a completely new direction in Parkinson's therapy" addressing neuroprotection rather than just symptom management**
  - **Outcome**: The GLP-1 approach did open a new research direction, with multiple pharmaceutical companies investigating this class. However, no disease-modifying therapy has reached routine clinical use yet, though the mechanism continues under active investigation.

- **Prediction: Statistical concerns about p=0.03 significance and effect size would require larger studies to resolve**
  - **Outcome**: Subsequent larger trials generally confirmed directional benefits but highlighted that effect sizes remain modest. The fundamental challenge of demonstrating robust clinical efficacy in Parkinson's neuroprotection trials persists.
  
- **Implicit prediction: This could lead to an approved therapy relatively quickly given the drug's existing safety profile**
  - **Outcome**: Despite extensive subsequent research, GLP-1 agonists remain investigational for Parkinson's disease. The path from promising Phase II data to approved therapy has proven longer and more complex than anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlighted a genuinely novel therapeutic approach that catalyzed significant subsequent research and industry investment. While full clinical validation remains incomplete, the work established an important new direction in Parkinson's drug development.
