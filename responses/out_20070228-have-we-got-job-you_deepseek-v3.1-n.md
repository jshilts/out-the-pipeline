# Have We Got a Job For You! (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a personal commentary from a medicinal chemist who was job hunting after experiencing a company closure. The author complains about the poor quality of many recruiters and headhunters in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry. They describe being pitched completely mismatched positions - such as "Formulations Chemist" or "Clinical Research Data Scientist" roles - that showed the recruiters had neither industry knowledge nor had they even reviewed the author's CV. Specific examples include being offered positions focused on generic injectables development and entry-level medicinal chemistry roles that were beneath their decades of experience. The author contrasts these incompetent recruiters with the few good ones who actually understand the field and properly match candidates to positions.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was written during a transitional period for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. From 2007 onwards, the sector experienced several significant developments:

**Industry Consolidation and Job Market Changes**: The late 2000s and early 2010s saw major pharmaceutical mergers (Pfizer-Wyeth in 2009, Merck-Schering-Plough in 2009, Roche-Genentech in 2009) that resulted in significant job cuts and increased competition for positions. This likely intensified the problems the author described.

**Rise of Specialized Biotech Recruiting**: The recruiting industry evolved to become more specialized, with firms focusing specifically on life sciences, clinical research, regulatory affairs, and specific therapeutic areas. However, the fundamental problems of mismatched recruitment persisted.

**Shift to Online Platforms**: Job searching increasingly moved to specialized online platforms like LinkedIn (founded 2003, gained significant traction in the late 2000s), BioSpace, and Indeed, which allowed for better candidate-employer matching but didn't eliminate the recruiter quality issues.

**Industry Geographic Concentration**: The biotech/pharma job market became more concentrated in established hubs (Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Research Triangle), making location a more significant factor in job matching.

Nothing in the subsequent 17+ years suggests the core recruitment quality problems described were fundamentally solved industry-wide.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article was primarily descriptive rather than predictive - it was observing current conditions rather than making specific forecasts about the future. The author did not include explicit predictions about how the recruitment landscape or biotechnology job market would evolve.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a routine industry commentary piece voicing common frustrations about job searching rather than examining substantive developments in biotechnology science, drug development, regulatory policy, or business models. While relatable to industry professionals, it lacks the long-term importance or broad relevance that would make it genuinely interesting to analyze with hindsight.
