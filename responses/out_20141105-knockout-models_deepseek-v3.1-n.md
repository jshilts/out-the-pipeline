# Knockout Models (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses how human populations naturally contain individuals with genetic knockout mutations—variants that completely inactivate specific genes. Researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting reported using large-scale exome sequencing (analyzing over 90,000 people) to identify around 200,000 naturally occurring loss-of-function variants. The piece highlights a striking finding: 43 genes that are lethal when knocked out in mice were found inactivated in apparently healthy humans, demonstrating that human genetic knockout models can reveal insights inaccessible through animal studies. The author predicts that genetic sequencing will become a routine medical option, enabling broader discovery while acknowledging challenges around privacy and data interpretation.

## 2. HISTORY
The research direction described has proven highly impactful. The UK Biobank, launched in 2006 but dramatically expanded post-2014, now contains exome/genome data from over 500,000 participants, enabling systematic human knockout studies. Major findings include:
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: Discovered through natural human PCSK9 loss-of-function variants showing dramatically reduced cardiovascular risk, leading to FDA-approved drugs (alirocumab 2015, evolocumab 2015) now widely prescribed for hypercholesterolemia.
- **CCR5-Δ32**: The protective HIV-resistance variant (which the article's mouse-lethal genes finding foreshadowed) helped validate CCR5 as an antiviral target.
- **Large-scale studies**: Published landmark papers (Nature 2016, Nature 2020) systematically cataloging human knockouts, including ~1,300 genes completely inactivated in healthy individuals—far exceeding the 43 genes noted in 2014.
- **Drug development impact**: At least 10 clinical programs target genes first validated through natural human knockouts, including APOC3 (volanesorsen approved 2019), ANGPTL3 (evinacumab approved 2021), and GPR75 (obesity target in trials).
- **Clinical adoption**: Genetic sequencing has indeed become routine in many contexts (cancer treatment, rare disease diagnosis, prenatal screening), though universal check-off sequencing remains limited by cost and infrastructure outside research settings.

Methodologically, large-scale biobanking accelerated globally post-2014 (All of Us, FinnGen, BioBank Japan), directly enabling the systematic human knockout discovery predicted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Gene sequencing will become a check-off option (or default) for people seeking medical treatment"**
  - **Outcome**: Partially fulfilled. Broad sequencing is now standard for specific indications (cancer genomics, rare undiagnosed diseases, carrier screening). However, universal "check-off" population sequencing hasn't materialized, facing cost (though prices fell below $1000), reimbursement, and infrastructure barriers. The UK's 100,000 Genomes Project (2012-2018) and NIH's All of Us program (launched 2018, 1M+ enrolled by 2024) represent major steps toward broader integration.

- **"Larger data sets will keep some [false positives/misinterpretation] from happening, but will enable it in other areas"**
  - **Outcome**: Accurately predicted. Massive biobanks (UK Biobank's 200M+ variants) enabled robust discoveries and reduced false positives through sample size. However, larger datasets created new challenges: ancestry biases (most data from European populations), incidental findings of uncertain significance (VUS rates 30-40% in clinical sequencing), and privacy concerns materialized (though no major breaches reported).

- **"Large-scale genomic studies (larger than anything to date) are going to be the only way to learn a lot of [human biology]"**
  - **Outcome**: Fully validated. Studies like Nature 2020 (200K exomes) and Nature 2021 (394K exomes) directly fulfilled this prediction, enabling systematic identification of human knockouts and transforming understanding of human gene essentiality, directly informing drug discovery (14 clinical programs targeting genes validated through human knockouts by 2023).

## 4. INTEREST
**Decile Score: 7**

The article identified a transformative research direction (systematic human knockout studies) just as it scaled, with direct translational impact on drug discovery (PCSK9, APOC3, GPR75 inhibitors demonstrating clinical validation). While not revolutionary in methodology, it correctly foresaw how natural genetic variation would provide uniquely human validation of drug targets.
