# Does An Ancient Retrovirus Have Anything to Do with ALS? (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the discovery that remnants of ancient retroviruses embedded in human DNA—specifically HERV-K (human endogenous retrovirus K)—may play a role in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). While up to 8% of the human genome consists of these viral remnants previously considered "junk DNA," research in 2011 suggested HERV-K was more active in ALS patients. A 2015 follow-up study by Avindra Nath's team found that three HERV-K proteins were expressed at higher levels in autopsy brain tissue of sporadic ALS patients, and that overexpressing HERV-K in mouse neurons caused motor neuron and muscle pathology.

The article mentions that the investigation began after HIV-positive ALS patients showed neurological improvement on antiretroviral drugs, leading to plans for a clinical trial testing antiretroviral cocktails in sporadic ALS patients. However, it notes that HERV expression is elevated in many conditions, making the signal "very noisy," and cautions that the hypothesis needs rigorous testing.

## 2. HISTORY
The years following this 2015 article have largely failed to validate HERV-K as a therapeutic target or definitive causal factor in ALS. Several clinical trials have been conducted or attempted:

**Clinical Trial Results:**
- The antiretroviral trial pathway did not proceed as optimistically envisioned. There is no FDA-approved antiretroviral therapy for ALS as of 2024.
- The most notable trial was a small pilot study published in 2019 (NCT02868580) involving combination antiretroviral therapy (abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir) in ALS patients, which showed mixed and ultimately inconclusive results.

**Research Progression:**
- Subsequent research has continued to explore HERV-K in ALS, with some studies confirming elevated expression in subsets of patients, but others failing to replicate findings consistently across larger cohorts.
- The field has largely moved toward more established ALS mechanisms (TDP-43 proteinopathy, C9orf72 repeat expansions, SOD1 mutations) rather than HERV-K as primary therapeutic targets.

**Business/Clinical Impact:**
- No antiretroviral drugs have been repurposed for ALS treatment.
- The hypothesis did not lead to any approved drugs for ALS.
- The "cleaner signal" the article hoped for has not materialized at scale.

**Current Status (2024):**
While HERV-K remains an area of ongoing investigation in neurodegeneration, it has not become a major therapeutic pathway. The most promising recent ALS advances have centered on other mechanisms—notably the 2023 FDA approval of tofersen for SOD1-ALS and continued development of therapies targeting C9orf72 and other genetic forms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: "A clinical study is being planned to put sporadic ALS patients on an antiretroviral cocktail, and the results of this should be of great interest."
  - **Outcome**: Such trials were indeed conducted, but results were largely negative or inconclusive, failing to demonstrate significant clinical benefit.

- **Prediction**: The article suggested that existing antiretroviral drugs, while not optimized for HERV-K, should show "enough of an effect to see" based on initial observations.
  - **Outcome**: The anticipated therapeutic signal did not materialize in subsequent systematic trials, suggesting either that the original observations were anecdotal or that the mechanism is more complex than initially hypothesized.

- **Implicit prediction**: That a clearer understanding of HERV-K's role would emerge.
  - **Outcome**: Nearly a decade later, the role of HERV-K in ALS remains ambiguous and controversial rather than clearly established.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4/9**

The article represents an important moment of scientific exploration into viral mechanisms in neurodegeneration and exemplifies the challenge of translating correlative findings into therapeutic breakthroughs. While the underlying hypothesis has not fundamentally changed ALS treatment, it illustrates the process of hypothesis testing in biomedicine and the caution required when initial signals appear promising.
