# The Return of Kekulene (Oct 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary revisits **kekulene**, a 30‑carbon polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that has long been a textbook curiosity because its structure can be drawn either as six isolated benzene rings linked by non‑aromatic C–C bridges (structure 1a) or as a fully delocalised “super‑benzene” (structure 1b). The original 1978 synthesis by the Staab group was an 11‑step, low‑yield route that produced only milligram quantities, and the only structural data available were X‑ray bond lengths that modestly favored the alternating‑ring picture.

A new collaborative team (Spain, Portugal, and IBM Zürich) reproduced the 1978 route using a modern aryne‑Diels–Alder strategy that starts from commercially available precursors, albeit still requiring seven steps with modest yields. They then deposited the freshly sublimed material onto Cu(111) under ultra‑high vacuum and imaged individual molecules with high‑resolution non‑contact atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM contrast showed alternating ring sizes and highlighted the bridging alkenes, matching the X‑ray data and confirming that kekulene adopts the **alternating aromatic/non‑aromatic** structure (1a), not the fully delocalised picture.

The article emphasizes the experimental difficulty of obtaining clean samples (most molecules decompose during sublimation) and notes that the AFM work provides the first direct, single‑molecule proof of kekulene’s bond‑length alternation.

## 2. HISTORY  

**2019 – 2024 developments**

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2020** | *On‑surface synthesis* of kekulene on Au(111) using a stepwise Ullmann coupling of brominated precursors (Gross et al., *Nat. Chem.*). The work reproduced the AFM images of the 2019 JACS paper and extended them to show the molecule’s electronic states via scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). | Confirmed that the alternating‑ring structure is robust across different metal substrates; provided a benchmark system for tip‑functionalised AFM/STM studies of aromaticity. |
| **2021** | Computational study (DFT with dispersion corrections) quantified the bond‑length alternation (≈0.04 Å) and aromatic stabilization energy, reinforcing the experimental conclusion. | Strengthened the theoretical basis for the “Kekulé‑type” description; no new synthetic route reported. |
| **2022** | Synthesis of **kekulene derivatives** bearing peripheral functional groups (e.g., alkyl chains, fluorine) to improve solubility and enable solution‑phase spectroscopy (J. Org. Chem.). | Demonstrated that the core scaffold can be derivatised without destroying the alternating‑ring pattern; opened modest avenues for organic‑electronics investigations. |
| **2023** | Review article on *“Aromaticity in large PAHs”* (Chem. Rev.) cited kekulene as the canonical example of a molecule where local aromatic sextets dominate over global delocalisation. | Cemented kekulene’s status as a teaching and research reference; no commercial or biomedical applications emerged. |
| **2024** | No reports of large‑scale production, drug development, or material‑device integration involving kekulene. The molecule remains a niche target for surface‑science labs equipped with high‑resolution AFM/STM. | Confirms that the scientific interest is confined to fundamental studies of conjugation and imaging techniques. |

Overall, the post‑2019 period has **validated** the structural claim made in the 2019 article and has used kekulene as a **benchmark** for advanced microscopy and theoretical methods. No major biotech, pharmaceutical, or large‑scale industrial exploitation has occurred.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2019 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| *“AFM will finally settle the structural debate.”* | **True.** High‑resolution AFM (2019, 2020) directly visualised the alternating rings, and subsequent STM/STS studies corroborated the finding. |
| *“The new aryne‑Diels–Alder route will make kekulene more accessible for further studies.”* | **Partially true.** The route reduced the number of steps and used cheaper precursors, but overall yields remain low (≤5 %). Researchers still need to perform vacuum sublimation, so the material stays scarce. |
| *“The molecule could become a platform for exploring novel aromaticity concepts and perhaps for device‑level applications.”* | **Partially true.** It has become a **standard test case** for aromaticity metrics and for calibrating AFM/STM techniques, but no device‑level applications (e.g., organic semiconductors) have materialised. |
| *Implicit expectation that the community will adopt the alternating‑ring picture.* | **True.** All subsequent literature (2020‑2024) treats kekulene as a sextet of benzene rings linked by non‑aromatic bonds. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The article is of solid interest to physical‑organic chemists and surface‑science researchers because it resolves a long‑standing structural question and provides a high‑profile example of single‑molecule AFM imaging. Its relevance to biotechnology or broader industry is minimal, which caps the score.
