# Another Alzheimer's Antibody Goes Down (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Roche's discontinuation of a Phase III clinical trial for gantenerumab, an amyloid-targeting antibody for Alzheimer's disease, following disappointing interim results. The author notes that this failure maintains the "perfect" 100% clinical failure rate for disease-modifying Alzheimer's therapies at that time. The article describes several complicating factors in Alzheimer's drug development: companies' desperation to recoup massive investments in these expensive trials, scientists' career commitments to the amyloid hypothesis, slow clinical readouts, and the immense market demand for any effective treatment. Roche's strategy was shifting toward testing antibodies in milder or earlier-stage Alzheimer's patients, where any potential benefit might be more detectable, though the author expresses skepticism about these prospects.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 article, Alzheimer's antibody development experienced both continued failures and eventual breakthroughs:

**Continued failures (2015-2018):** Multiple other amyloid-targeting antibodies failed in clinical trials, including Eli Lilly's solanezumab (multiple Phase III failures through 2016-2017) and Merck's verubecestat (BACE inhibitor, failed 2017-2018). The amyloid hypothesis faced increasing skepticism, with some prominent researchers calling for alternative approaches. The 100% failure rate persisted through most of this period.

**Limited success (2019-2021):** Biogen's aducanumab showed mixed results but eventually received controversial FDA approval in June 2021 based on surrogate biomarkers rather than clear clinical benefit, sparking significant scientific and regulatory debate. The approval was criticized by many Alzheimer's experts and led to resignations from FDA advisory committee members.

**Clear clinical validation (2023):** Eisai and Biogen's lecanemab became the first amyloid antibody to demonstrate clear, though modest, clinical benefit in a Phase III trial, showing 27% slowing of cognitive decline. It received FDA approval in January 2023 and launched commercially. By late 2023, lecanemab had achieved substantial patient uptake despite concerns about side effects (ARIA brain swelling/bleeding) and treatment costs.

**Gantenerumab's trajectory:** Roche continued gantenerumab trials in early Alzheimer's patients. Results from the GRADUATE Phase III trials presented in late 2022 showed the drug failed to meet primary endpoints, leading to discontinuation of development—confirming the 2014 article's skepticism about this particular antibody.

**Policy impact:** The Alzheimer's drug approval landscape became highly politicized, with the 2021 aducanumab approval occurring amid pressure from patient advocacy groups despite weak evidence. Medicare initially restricted coverage, then expanded it for lecanemab after stronger data emerged.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations:

• **"The clinical failure rate for disease-modifying Alzheimer's therapies remains perfect, unfortunately: a flat 100%"** – This remained largely true until 2023. While aducanumab was approved in 2021, it didn't clearly break the efficacy failure pattern (approved on biomarkers). Only lecanemab in 2023 provided the first clear clinical success, ending the streak after nearly a decade.

• **"If an antibody approach is going to show something, those are probably the patients where it will"** (referring to earlier/milder stages) – This prediction proved correct. Both aducanumab and lecanemab trials focused on early Alzheimer's patients, and lecanemab's success came specifically in mild cognitive impairment/early dementia populations. Later-stage trials continued to fail, validating the early-intervention approach.

• **Skepticism about gantenerumab's prospects** – This was prescient. The article's doubt about gantenerumab specifically was validated when the antibody ultimately failed in 2022 Phase III trials despite Roche's continued investment.

• **Implication that the amyloid hypothesis might be fundamentally flawed** – This was partially correct and partially wrong. While many amyloid-targeting approaches continued to fail, the eventual success of lecanemab suggested the hypothesis had validity but required better drug design and patient selection. The modest 27% benefit, however, also suggested amyloid is only part of the pathology.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Score: 7**

This article captures a pivotal moment when Alzheimer's drug development faced peak skepticism, yet its cautious analysis accurately anticipated both continued failures and the eventual strategy (early intervention) that would lead to the first real breakthrough nearly a decade later.
