# MannKind: It's Not Looking Good (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary by Derek Lowe warned that MannKind Corporation, the developer of an inhaled insulin product (later named **Afrezza**), was in a precarious financial position.  After a 2010 stock‑swap with the shell company Seaside 88, MannKind had cut roughly 40 % of its staff and appeared to have just enough cash to survive to year‑end.  The author noted that the company’s founder, Al Mann, was personally funding the effort but might soon be unable or unwilling to add more capital.  Ongoing shareholder class‑action lawsuits and the broader “spray‑delivered insulin” market’s difficulties were also highlighted as warning signs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory milestone (2014).**  Despite the bleak outlook, MannKind secured FDA approval for its inhaled insulin (Afrezza) in June 2014.  The approval was based on Phase III trials that showed rapid‑acting glucose control comparable to subcutaneous rapid‑acting insulin analogues, with the added benefit of a non‑injectable route.

**Commercial launch and partnership (2014‑2016).**  MannKind partnered with Sanofi‑Aspire (later Sanofi‑US) to market Afrezza in the United States.  The product launched in October 2014, but uptake was limited.  Key issues were:  
* **Prescriber hesitancy** – concerns about pulmonary safety and the need for patient training.  
* **Reimbursement challenges** – many insurers placed Afrezza on high‑cost tiers, limiting formulary placement.  
* **Competition** – rapid‑acting injectable analogues (lispro, aspart, glulisine) and later ultra‑rapid formulations (faster‑acting insulin lispro) dominated the market.

**Financial performance.**  Afrezza’s sales peaked at roughly **$30 M** in 2015 and fell to under **$10 M** by 2017.  MannKind reported recurring operating losses and repeatedly warned of cash‑runway constraints.  In 2016 Sanofi terminated its partnership, citing poor sales, and MannKind reverted to a “direct‑to‑market” model.

**Shareholder litigation.**  The class‑action suit referenced in the 2011 article was settled in 2015 for **$3.5 M** (without admission of wrongdoing).  The settlement resolved most of the securities‑fraud claims tied to earlier statements about product prospects.

**Strategic pivots.**  After the Afrezza setback, MannKind explored other inhaled therapies, notably an inhaled formulation of **treprostinil** for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  In 2020 the company entered a licensing agreement with **MannKind‑AstraZeneca** (later terminated) and subsequently with **MannKind‑MediWound** for a pipeline of inhaled peptides, but none have reached market as of early 2026.

**Current status (2026).**  MannKind remains a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: MKND) with a market cap of roughly **$150 M**.  Cash on hand (as of Q4 2025) is about **$45 M**, sufficient for short‑term operations but still dependent on external financing.  Afrezza continues to be sold in the U.S., generating **~$8 M** in annual revenue, primarily in niche patient segments (e.g., patients with needle phobia).  No new inhaled insulin products have entered the market since Afrezza, and the broader “spray‑insulin” concept has not been revived by other firms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *MannKind would run out of cash by the end of 2011.*  
  **Outcome:** The company survived the 2011 cash crunch, raised additional equity in 2012, and later secured FDA approval in 2014.  Cash‑runway issues persisted but were not resolved until after the product launch.

- **Prediction:** *The workforce cuts and financial strain would signal imminent failure of the inhaled insulin program.*  
  **Outcome:** The program ultimately succeeded in obtaining regulatory approval, but commercial performance was weak.  The product remains on the market, albeit with modest sales.

- **Prediction:** *Class‑action lawsuits would further damage the company.*  
  **Outcome:** The lawsuits were settled in 2015 for a few million dollars, a material but not catastrophic expense.  The settlements did not halt product development.

- **Prediction:** *The “spray‑delivered insulin” market was a “bubbling tar pit” and unlikely to succeed.*  
  **Outcome:** The market never materialized beyond Afrezza.  No other spray‑insulin products have achieved FDA approval or commercial launch as of 2026.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *MannKind’s founder would be unable or unwilling to inject more personal capital.*  
  **Outcome:** Al Mann continued to fund the company through 2013, but his personal contributions tapered after the FDA approval; the firm increasingly relied on public financing and partnership deals.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is a useful case study of early‑stage biotech financing, regulatory risk, and the gap between scientific promise and market adoption; its predictions were mixed, reflecting both accurate foresight (financial strain) and underestimation of eventual FDA approval.
