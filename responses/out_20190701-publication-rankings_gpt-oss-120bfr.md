# Publication Rankings (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary reviews the first “Nature Index” tables that rank research output in 82 high‑impact natural‑science journals. It notes which institutions and countries publish the most papers, both in raw counts and when normalized by total output or population. The Chinese Academy of Sciences leads overall, while Harvard tops the university‑only list. In life‑science journals the top institutions are Harvard, NIH and Max Planck; in chemistry the Chinese Academy of Sciences, CNRS and Max Planck dominate. When output is expressed as a fraction of an institution’s total papers, smaller research centres such as Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and IST Austria rise to the top. Country‑level rankings show the United States still first, followed by China, Germany, the UK, Japan, France and Canada, a pattern that has been stable for three years. The author argues that normalising by population would highlight Switzerland’s outsized contribution and that large regions (most of Africa, Latin America, the Middle East outside Israel) remain severely under‑represented in elite journals, a situation unlikely to change dramatically.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Nature Index evolution (2019‑2025)**  
* The Nature Index has been updated annually, expanding the journal list from 82 to 100+ titles by 2024, adding several high‑impact multidisciplinary and specialty journals (e.g., *Cell*, *Science Advances*, *Nature Communications*).  
* The **institutional rankings** have remained broadly similar: the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Harvard continue to vie for the top spot in the overall count, with MIT, Stanford and the NIH consistently in the top 10. CAS’s share grew modestly (≈ 2 percentage points) between 2019 and 2024, reflecting China’s continued investment in large‑scale facilities and talent recruitment.  
* **University‑only rankings** still feature Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Cambridge (UK), Tsinghua and ETH Zurich. New entrants such as ShanghaiTech University and the University of Hong Kong entered the top 20 in 2022‑2023, reflecting the rise of elite Chinese universities.  
* In **life‑science** and **chemistry** sub‑tables, Max Planck Institutes, NIH and the Broad Institute have retained high positions; Chinese chemistry institutions (e.g., University of Science & Technology of China) moved up, narrowing the gap with traditional European powerhouses.  
* **Per‑capita rankings** were introduced in 2020. Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands now regularly occupy the top five, confirming the author’s intuition. Israel and Singapore also rank highly per capita.  

**Country‑level trends**  
* The United States remained the leading producer of papers in the 82‑journal set through 2025, but its share fell from ~ 38 % in 2019 to ~ 34 % in 2024.  
* China’s share rose from ~ 15 % to ~ 19 % over the same period, narrowing the US‑China gap but not overtaking the US.  
* Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan have held steady positions, while **South Korea** moved from 9th to 7th overall, overtaking France in 2023.  
* **Australia** kept its 10th‑place slot, while **Spain** slipped to 11th, as the author noted.  
* Emerging contributions from **Israel**, **Saudi Arabia**, and **South Africa** have increased modestly, but the “long‑tailed” under‑representation of most of Africa, Latin America and the Middle East persists.  

**Policy and structural impacts**  
* Several governments (China, South Korea, Israel) launched targeted “elite‑journal” incentive schemes in the early 2020s, modestly boosting their representation in the Nature Index.  
* The United States introduced the **“Open Science”** mandate for federally funded research (2022), which shifted some high‑impact work toward pre‑print servers and open‑access venues not counted in the original Nature Index list. This caused a slight dip in US‑only counts but did not alter the overall ranking hierarchy.  
* The Nature Index itself faced criticism for reinforcing journal‑centric metrics; in response, it added a **Collaboration Index** (2021) that highlights international co‑authorship, showing a gradual rise in cross‑border papers, especially between the US and China, and between European nations and emerging Asian institutions.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **US/China will dominate elite‑journal output for the foreseeable future.**  
  *Outcome:* Largely correct. By 2025 the US still leads, China is the only other nation closing the gap; no third country has entered the top 2.  

- **Switzerland would stand out if rankings were normalised by population.**  
  *Outcome:* Confirmed. Per‑capita tables released from 2020 onward consistently place Switzerland in the top 3.  

- **Large regions (most of Africa, Latin America, the Middle East) will remain under‑represented.**  
  *Outcome:* Mostly true. While South Africa, Brazil and Saudi Arabia have modest gains, the bulk of the continents still contribute < 1 % of the total papers in the 82‑journal set.  

- **Institutions like Nanjing and Northwestern would rise sharply.**  
  *Outcome:* Partially correct. Nanjing University’s chemistry output continued to improve, keeping it in the top 15 chemistry institutions; Northwestern’s position plateaued around the 20‑25 range.  

- **The list would stay static for several years.**  
  *Outcome:* The top‑7 country list indeed remained unchanged from 2017‑2020, but by 2022 the order of Switzerland and South Korea swapped, and Australia displaced Spain, showing modest dynamism.  

- **Talent scouting in science would remain far less systematic than in sports.**  
  *Outcome:* Still accurate. No major global platform comparable to FIFA or NBA scouting has emerged for scientific talent; recruitment still relies on traditional academic pipelines and individual networking.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece offers a concise, data‑driven snapshot of global research power structures and raises enduring questions about equity and metrics; its relevance persists, though the analysis is largely descriptive rather than groundbreaking.
