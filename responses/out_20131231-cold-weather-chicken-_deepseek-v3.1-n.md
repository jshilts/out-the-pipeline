# Cold-Weather Chicken Soup (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article presents a chicken soup recipe adapted from Craig Claiborne, described by the author as a reliable cold-weather dish they had been making for twenty years. The recipe calls for a whole chicken (3-4 pounds), corn (fresh or frozen), egg noodles, hard-boiled eggs, and fresh parsley. The preparation involves simmering the chicken for 60-90 minutes until the meat easily comes off the bone, then shredding the meat, skimming fat from the broth, and adding corn and egg noodles before finishing with grated hard-boiled eggs and parsley. The article was published on a science blog as a lighthearted cooking interlude during cold weather conditions.
