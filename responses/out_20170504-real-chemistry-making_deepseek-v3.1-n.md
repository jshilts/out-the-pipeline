# Article Title (Month Year)
The Real Chemistry of Making Drugs (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article reviews a 2017 *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* paper analyzing the chemical synthesis routes for 29 small-molecule drugs approved by the FDA in 2015. The author, Derek Lowe, observes that drug manufacturing relies heavily on classic, reliable organic reactions suitable for large-scale production, such as amide formation, ether synthesis, and nucleophilic displacements. 

The article notes surprising inclusions of more challenging reactions like Grignard reactions, Wittig reactions, Mitsunobu reactions, and asymmetric hydrogenations—reactions that aren't typically associated with industrial scale-up. The analysis also covers solvent choices, favoring standard industrial solvents like toluene and methanol, with some use of less-preferred solvents like THF and dichloromethane when yields justify them. Notably absent were pericyclic reactions (Diels-Alder, Claisen), photochemical transformations, and in-situ fluorination reactions—fluorine atoms typically being introduced via pre-fluorinated starting materials rather than fluorination steps in the synthesis.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2015 approvals referenced in the article represent a significant year for drug development, though the practical impact varied by therapeutic area. Of note among 2015 approvals: oncology drugs like osimertinib (Tagrisso) for EGFR-mutant lung cancer, which achieved widespread clinical adoption and became a standard-of-care therapy; ivacaftor/lumacaftor combinations for cystic fibrosis; and various cardiovascular and metabolic agents.

Post-2017 developments have largely validated the article's observations about manufacturing chemistry. The pharmaceutical industry has continued relying on proven synthetic methodologies while selectively adopting new technologies. Biocatalysis and continuous flow chemistry have gained traction in specific applications. The trend toward using pre-fluorinated building blocks in drug synthesis has accelerated as fluorine incorporation remains strategically important for metabolic stability and binding affinity.

Industrial-scale synthesis strategies have increasingly emphasized process robustness, cost efficiency, and green chemistry principles, with some migration away from certain halogenated solvents where alternatives exist.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article does not contain explicit forward-looking predictions but rather observations about contemporary practice. No specific predictions about future approvals or chemical trends are presented.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **6/10**
This provides valuable insight into pharmaceutical manufacturing practices and industrial organic chemistry, offering a realistic counterpoint to academic synthetic preferences and demonstrating practical constraints in drug production.
