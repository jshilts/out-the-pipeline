# What Makes an Ugly Molecule?

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the concept of "ugly molecules" in medicinal chemistry – structures that deviate significantly from established drug-like properties. Key criteria for ugliness include: excessive molecular weight (problems with absorption and transport), inappropriate number of polar functional groups (either poorly absorbed if too greasy or membrane penetration issues if too polar), reactive functional groups that could interact unfavorably with biological systems, acid-labile structures that won't survive stomach conditions, and compounds that are simply too difficult to synthesize efficiently.

The author acknowledges that while these guidelines (like the Rule of Five) shouldn't be applied dogmatically, they reflect accumulated experience about what structural features correlate with successful drug development.

## 2. HISTORY

The principles outlined in this 2005 article have largely stood the test of time and evolved into more sophisticated computational approaches:

**Lipinski's Rule of Five** (referenced as "Rule of Five") became even more foundational in drug discovery, with most major pharmaceutical companies implementing computational filters based on these principles. However, the field also recognized important exceptions, particularly for natural products, peptides, and certain target classes.

**The rise of "beyond Rule of Five" (bRo5) chemical space** emerged as an important area. Drugs like cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and various macrocycles demonstrated that larger, more complex molecules could indeed become successful therapeutics, leading to more nuanced understanding of molecular properties.

**Synthetic accessibility** became increasingly important as chemical libraries grew larger. Computational tools like SA Score (synthetic accessibility score) and retrosynthetic analysis software (e.g., Chematica/ASKCOS, IBM RXN) now routinely assess synthetic complexity before compounds are even made.

**The reactive group paradigm** evolved with better understanding of covalent drugs. While reactive groups like acid chlorides remain problematic, controlled reactivity (e.g., Michael acceptors, activated carbonyls) became recognized as viable strategies for targeted covalent inhibitors, exemplified by drugs like afatinib and ibrutinib.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the direction of medicinal chemistry:

• **Prediction**: The Rule of Five framework would continue guiding drug design
  - **Outcome**: Partially correct. While RO5 remains important, the field expanded significantly into bRo5 space, with more flexible guidelines

• **Prediction**: Synthetic accessibility would become increasingly important
  - **Outcome**: Correct. Computational assessment of synthetic complexity became standard in pharmaceutical industry, with tools routinely flagging molecules as "too difficult/too expensive to synthesize"

• **Prediction**: Reactive functional groups would generally remain problematic for drug design
  - **Outcome**: Nuanced outcome. While broadly true for promiscuously reactive groups, controlled covalent reactivity became a viable strategy with important FDA-approved drugs (ibrutinib, neratinib, osimertinib)

The underlying principle that "ugly" molecules have higher failure rates was validated by continued drug development experience, but the definition of "ugly" became more sophisticated and context-dependent.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures an important conceptual framework in medicinal chemistry that has maintained relevance. While not presenting breakthrough science, it articulates fundamental principles that still guide drug discovery decisions today, making it historically significant for understanding the evolution of drug design paradigms.
