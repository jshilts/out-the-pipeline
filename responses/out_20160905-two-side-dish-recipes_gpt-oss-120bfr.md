# Two Side Dish Recipes (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article is a personal blog post that shares two “kitchen‑chemistry” recipes meant for Labor Day weekend: a grilled tomato salsa and a grilled onion pickle. Both dishes use a 3:1 lime‑juice/orange‑juice mixture and are prepared by grilling the vegetables until charred, then combining them with salt, garlic, cilantro, and optional hot peppers. The author cites Steve Raichlen’s *Barbecue Bible* as the source of inspiration and provides step‑by‑step instructions for chopping, grilling, and assembling the sides.

## 2. HISTORY  
The piece is a culinary how‑to and has not intersected with biotechnology, drug development, or any scientific enterprise. No subsequent scientific literature, patents, or commercial products trace back to this specific recipe. Consequently, there are no measurable real‑world impacts in the biotech sector, nor any policy or industry changes linked to it.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article contains no explicit predictions about scientific or technological developments, nor does it forecast market trends, regulatory shifts, or the future success of any biotech‑related concept.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **0/10**  
The content is entirely off‑topic for biotechnology analysis, offering no relevance to science, industry, or policy.
