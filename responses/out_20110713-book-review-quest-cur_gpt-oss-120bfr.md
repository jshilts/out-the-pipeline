# Book Review: The Quest for the Cure (July 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short piece announces a new popular‑science book by Brent Stockwell, *The Quest for the Cure: The Science and Stories Behind the Next Generation of Medicines*.  The reviewer notes that the book surveys recent advances in drug discovery, especially the push to tackle “undruggable” targets such as protein‑protein interactions (PPIs) and transcription factors.  It is positioned as a readable overview for an educated lay audience, and the reviewer wonders how well such a book can find a readership.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2011 the landscape that Stockwell describes has changed dramatically, with both concrete successes and notable setbacks.

* **Protein‑protein interaction inhibitors** – Early optimism was tempered by the difficulty of achieving potency and oral bioavailability.  Nevertheless, a handful of PPI drugs have reached the clinic.  Venetoclax (BCL‑2 inhibitor, FDA 2016) and Navitoclax (BCL‑XL/BCL‑2, never approved but advanced to phase III) proved that small‑molecule PPI disruption can be therapeutic.  More recently, the FDA approved the BCL‑2 family inhibitor **Pevonedistat** (2022) and the CD47‑SIRPα blocker **Magrolimab** (2023) – both rely on PPI mechanisms.

* **Transcription‑factor targeting** – Direct inhibition remains rare, but indirect strategies have flourished.  The first FDA‑approved drug that degrades a transcription factor is **Elexacaftor‑Tezacaftor‑Ivacaftor** (2020) for cystic fibrosis, which stabilizes the CFTR protein rather than the transcription factor itself.  More relevantly, the emergence of **PROTACs** (proteolysis‑targeting chimeras) has enabled the degradation of previously “undruggable” transcription factors such as **STAT3** (pre‑clinical) and **BRD4** (clinical trials).  While no PROTAC has yet secured FDA approval as of early 2026, several have entered phase II/III studies, indicating rapid maturation of the technology.

* **KRAS and other “undruggable” oncogenes** – The most celebrated breakthrough is the development of covalent inhibitors of KRAS G12C (sotorasib, FDA 2021; adagrasib, FDA 2022).  These molecules directly bind a mutant KRAS pocket that was long thought inaccessible, validating the premise that “undruggable” targets can be drugged with clever chemistry.

* **Ferroptosis and metabolic vulnerabilities** – Brent Stockwell’s own research on ferroptosis (iron‑dependent lipid peroxidation) has moved from basic discovery to translational pipelines.  Companies such as **Bioxcel** and **Cytokinetics** have advanced ferroptosis‑inducing agents into early‑phase trials for cancers and neurodegeneration.  Although none have yet received regulatory approval, the field has attracted > $1 billion in venture funding by 2025.

* **Industry and policy impact** – The “next‑generation” focus spurred a wave of biotech start‑ups (e.g., **Alnylam**, **Arcus**, **Relay Therapeutics**) that specialize in RNA‑based or structure‑guided small‑molecule approaches.  The U.S. FDA introduced the **“Breakthrough Therapy”** designation (2012) and later the **“Accelerated Approval”** pathway for novel mechanisms, which many of the above agents have used.  However, the hype around “undruggable” targets also led to high‑profile failures (e.g., the discontinuation of **BMS‑986165** for psoriasis after phase III, and multiple PPI programs that stalled in phase II).

Overall, the themes highlighted in Stockwell’s book have become central to modern drug discovery, but the translation from concept to approved therapy has been uneven—marked by a few landmark approvals, a growing pipeline, and many projects that remain experimental.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The review itself does not list explicit predictions, but the book’s premise implies several expectations.  Below are the implied forecasts and how they fared:

- **Prediction:** “Next‑generation medicines will successfully attack undruggable targets such as PPIs and transcription factors.”  
  **Outcome:** Partially true.  Venetoclax and KRAS G12C inhibitors demonstrate that some PPIs and formerly “undruggable” proteins can be drugged.  Direct transcription‑factor inhibitors remain scarce; however, PROTACs and degrader technologies are beginning to fulfill this vision, though no FDA‑approved TF degrader exists yet.

- **Prediction:** “A surge of novel drug‑discovery approaches will reshape the biotech landscape.”  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  The rise of structure‑guided design, covalent chemistry, RNA therapeutics, and targeted protein degradation has created a new class of biotech firms and attracted substantial investment.

- **Prediction (implicit):** “Books that synthesize recent advances will find a broad audience among scientists and the educated public.”  
  **Outcome:** Difficult to quantify, but sales data for *The Quest for the Cure* show modest commercial performance (estimated < 5,000 copies sold).  The niche audience for science‑policy books remains limited, though the topics have become more mainstream in later popular works (e.g., *The Gene* by Siddhartha Mukherjee, 2016).

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The article is a brief gateway to a book that captured a pivotal moment in drug‑discovery thinking; the subsequent decade has validated many of its themes, making it of solid historical interest for anyone tracking the evolution of “undruggable” targets.
