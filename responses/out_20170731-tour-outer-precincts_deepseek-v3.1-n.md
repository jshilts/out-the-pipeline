# A Tour of the Outer Precincts (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article expresses cautious optimism about drug discovery due to emerging tools in molecular biology and unconventional chemical modalities. The author notes that for years the field had acknowledged difficult targets like protein-protein interactions and transcription factors, but traditional small-molecule screening approaches had yielded limited progress, creating anxiety among medicinal chemists about the future. 

The article highlights a review paper in Angewandte Chemie titled "New Modalities for Challenging Targets in Drug Discovery," which systematically catalogs alternative compound classes being developed for difficult targets. These include stabilized peptides, macrocycles, protein-small molecule hybrids, oligonucleotide derivatives, bicyclic peptides, and nanobody-drug conjugates. The author views these as necessary weapons for attacking challenging binding surfaces that won't yield to conventional approaches, while cautioning that these modalities aren't universal solutions and could make things worse if misapplied.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2017 saw significant real-world validation of these "new modality" approaches:

**Approved Drugs and Clinical Success:**
- **Peptides and macrocycles:** Multiple peptide-based drugs gained FDA approval, including semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) for diabetes and obesity, tirzepatide (Mounjaro) for diabetes, and various cancer therapeutics. These demonstrated that stabilized peptides could achieve both efficacy and acceptable dosing.
- **Oligonucleotide therapies:** The antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) field expanded with approvals like inotersen (Tegsedi) and golodirsen (Vyondis) for rare neuromuscular diseases, validating oligonucleotide derivatives as viable drugs.
- **Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs):** Numerous ADCs received approval for cancer treatment, including fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu), demonstrating the success of protein-small molecule hybrid approaches.

**Clinical Failures and Limitations:**
- Many companies pursuing transcription factor inhibitors and direct PPI blockers continued to face challenges with toxicity and specificity, though some successes emerged with PROTAC technology (protein degraders).

**Industry Adoption:**
- Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly integrated peptide discovery, oligonucleotide platforms, and ADC programs into their pipelines
- Investment in these modalities increased substantially, with numerous biotech companies founded specifically around these approaches
- PROTAC technology emerged as a major new modality not mentioned in the 2017 article, proving successful for previously "undruggable" targets

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that traditional small molecules would struggle with protein-protein interactions and transcription factors:** **Largely accurate.** While some successes emerged (especially with allosteric sites and protein degraders), the fundamental challenge persisted. Most approved drugs targeting PPIs continued to use alternative modalities rather than traditional small molecules.

• **Prediction that "new modalities" would be necessary for harder targets:** **Accurate.** Stabilized peptides, oligonucleotides, and protein-small molecule hybrids became standard approaches for targets that resisted traditional drug discovery. The clinical and commercial success of drugs like semaglutide validated this approach.

• **Prediction that these modalities would not be panaceas and could make things worse if misapplied:** **Accurate.** The field experienced learning curves around delivery, manufacturing, and target selection. Some oligonucleotide approaches faced toxicity issues, and certain peptide programs struggled with poor pharmacokinetics.

• **Implicit prediction of expanding chemical space exploration:** **Accurate.** The subsequent years saw unprecedented exploration of these alternative modalities, with PROTACs emerging as an entirely new class that proved highly successful for previously undruggable targets.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment of methodological transition in drug discovery, correctly identifying the emerging importance of alternative modalities while maintaining appropriate skepticism. The assessment proved prescient in both the challenges and opportunities that unfolded.
