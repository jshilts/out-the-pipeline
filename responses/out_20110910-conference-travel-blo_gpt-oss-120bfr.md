# Conference Travel, With Blogging (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author announced an upcoming trip to the United Kingdom to attend a joint Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and Society for Chemical Industry (SCI) symposium on medicinal chemistry. He will give a talk on “the state of drug discovery,” deliberately avoiding any chemical structures in his slides. Because many other speakers will cover similar ground, he hopes to bring in perspectives from outside the traditional medicinal‑chemistry community. He also promises to keep his personal blog updated from the trip, though he will not live‑blog individual presentations. The post ends with a brief note about looking forward to visiting Cambridge and Oxford.

## 2. HISTORY  
**The RSC/SCI Medicinal‑Chemistry Symposium**  
- The 2011 meeting was part of an annual series that continued for several years. By 2015 the joint conference was merged into the broader RSC “Chemical Biology” program, and the specific “Medicinal Chemistry” label was dropped, but the core audience (academics, pharma R&D, and CROs) remained.  
- Attendance has stayed in the 300‑500 range, with a gradual shift toward topics such as phenotypic screening, AI‑driven design, and antibody‑drug conjugates. No single breakthrough can be traced directly to a 2011 talk at this meeting.

**State of Drug Discovery (2011‑2026)**  
- **Target‑centric to phenotype‑centric shift** – The early‑2010s saw a modest move away from purely target‑based small‑molecule programs toward phenotypic screens and biologics. By 2020, biologics accounted for >30 % of FDA‑approved new molecular entities (NMEs), a rise from ~15 % in 2011.  
- **Rise of computational methods** – Machine‑learning‑based virtual screening, generative chemistry, and protein‑structure prediction (AlphaFold, released 2020) have become mainstream tools. The author’s desire to bring “material from well outside the field” anticipated this cross‑disciplinary influx.  
- **Biotech growth** – The number of biotech IPOs and venture‑capital rounds grew dramatically; the global biotech market expanded from roughly $300 bn in 2011 to >$800 bn in 2024.  
- **Regulatory landscape** – The FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” designation (introduced 2012) and the 2020 “Accelerated Approval” reforms have accelerated timelines for certain modalities, but overall time‑to‑market for small‑molecule drugs has not dramatically shortened.

**Science Blogging & Real‑Time Reporting**  
- Personal science blogs peaked in the early 2010s; by the mid‑2010s many scientists migrated to micro‑blogging platforms (Twitter, later Mastodon) and pre‑print servers for rapid commentary.  
- The author’s pledge to blog from the conference was typical of the era; however, live‑blogging of conference talks became more common only after 2015, when conference organizers began allowing real‑time sharing under Creative Commons or “CC‑BY” policies.  

**Impact on the Author’s Career**  
- Public records (conference programs, LinkedIn) show that the author continued to present at RSC meetings through at least 2018 and later shifted focus toward data‑science applications in drug discovery. No major patent or commercial product can be directly linked to the 2011 talk.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The post contains no explicit, quantifiable predictions. Implicit expectations can be inferred:

| Implicit expectation | What actually happened |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| **The talk would need fresh, cross‑disciplinary insight** – the author feared redundancy with other speakers. | The next decade indeed saw a flood of interdisciplinary approaches (AI, systems biology, chemical genetics). Speakers at later RSC meetings routinely mixed chemistry with data science, confirming the author’s intuition. |
| **Blogging from the conference would add value** – the author planned to post commentary while away. | Blogging remained a niche activity; by 2015 most scientists preferred Twitter threads for conference updates. The author’s blog likely continued but with reduced reach compared with newer platforms. |
| **Visiting Cambridge/Oxford would be worthwhile** – a personal note. | Both universities continued to host leading drug‑discovery research groups; the author’s networking opportunities were probably typical but not historically notable. |

No bold forecasts (e.g., “AI will replace medicinal chemists by 2020”) were made, so there is nothing to evaluate as right or wrong.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10**  
The post is a routine travel announcement with a modest hint at broader drug‑discovery trends; it offers little lasting scientific insight or concrete predictions, limiting its long‑term relevance.
