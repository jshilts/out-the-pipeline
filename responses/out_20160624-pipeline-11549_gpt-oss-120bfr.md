# Day Off (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a brief personal note from a scientist who was ill with a sinus infection on 24 June 2016. While recovering, the author muses about the UK political climate surrounding the upcoming EU referendum, joking that the “frontiers of sciences” will have to wait for his return. He links the “Leave” vote to a perceived general disregard for expert opinion, then updates that he feels better after a course of amoxicillin.

## 2. HISTORY  
The article itself did not make any scientific or biotechnological claim, so there is no direct follow‑up to track. The only broader context is the UK’s decision to leave the European Union (the referendum took place on 23 June 2016, one day before the post). Since then:

* **Regulatory environment:** The UK retained much of the EU’s medicines‑regulation framework initially, but the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been diverging, creating a separate approval pathway. This has added administrative complexity for companies operating in both markets, though most large biotech firms have continued to run UK operations.  
* **Funding:** The UK government introduced the “Life Sciences Industrial Strategy” (2017) and increased public‑sector funding (e.g., the Biomedical Catalyst, Innovate UK grants). However, some EU‑funded programmes (Horizon 2020) became less accessible to UK‑based researchers after the transition period, prompting a modest slowdown in collaborative projects.  
* **Talent mobility:** Immigration rules tightened after Brexit, leading to reported recruitment challenges for biotech firms, especially for senior scientists and clinical‑trial staff. Companies responded by expanding visa‑sponsorship schemes and establishing more overseas sites.  
* **Industry growth:** Despite the political upheaval, the UK biotech sector continued to grow. According to the UK BioIndustry Association, the number of biotech companies rose from ~600 in 2016 to >800 by 2024, and venture‑capital investment reached a record £5 bn in 2023. The sector’s contribution to GDP remained positive, though some analysts attribute part of the growth to the “stay‑or‑leave” uncertainty driving firms to secure domestic funding.  

Overall, the political shock of the referendum did not halt UK biotech progress, but it introduced regulatory and talent‑mobility frictions that the industry has been managing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The post contains no explicit predictions about science, biotechnology, or policy, so there are no statements to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **2/10**  
The piece is a personal, off‑topic blog entry with only a passing political comment; it offers no substantive scientific or biotech content to merit higher interest.
