# Nivolumab Racks Up Another Success (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article highlights impressive clinical trial results for Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, in treating refractory squamous cell lung cancer. In this difficult-to-treat patient population, 41% of patients receiving nivolumab were alive at the one-year mark, compared to an expected survival rate of perhaps 15% at best. The author notes that the PD-1 therapeutic area appears poised to transform the oncology landscape, particularly through different drug approaches and combinations, with immunotherapy taking the lead over small molecule approaches for modulating immune pathways.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this October 2014 report, nivolumab's development progressed rapidly and successfully:

**Regulatory Approvals:** Nivolumab (brand name Opdivo) received its first FDA approval in December 2014 for advanced melanoma, just two months after this article. It went on to receive numerous subsequent approvals for various cancer types, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer (March 2015), renal cell carcinoma (November 2015), Hodgkin's lymphoma (May 2016), and many others.

**Clinical Impact:** The drug achieved widespread clinical adoption and became a standard of care across multiple oncology indications. By 2024, Opdivo had generated annual revenues exceeding $8 billion, demonstrating substantial patient uptake and healthcare system adoption.

**Combination Therapies:** The prediction about drug combinations proved accurate. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (another checkpoint inhibitor) received FDA approval for melanoma in 2015 and subsequently for other cancers, representing a major advancement in combination immunotherapy.

**Clinical Failures and Setbacks:** While generally successful, some trials did not meet endpoints. Notably, the CheckMate-026 trial in first-line non-small cell lung cancer failed to show superiority over chemotherapy in 2016, though this was later attributed to patient selection factors rather than fundamental issues with the mechanism.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions, both explicit and implicit:

• **PD-1 area will change the oncology landscape:** ✓ **Largely accurate**. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have become foundational in cancer treatment across numerous indications, with multiple approved drugs generating tens of billions in annual revenue.

• **Drug combinations will be important:** ✓ **Accurate**. Combination therapies, particularly nivolumab + ipilimumab, have become standard of care. The field has evolved to explore many combination strategies.

• **Small molecules won't be in the lead for immune pathway modulation:** ✓ **Accurate**. While some small molecule approaches have emerged, antibody-based immune checkpoint inhibitors have maintained dominance in clinical practice for immune pathway modulation in oncology.

• **Immunotherapy efforts extend beyond just PD-1:** ✓ **Accurate**. The field has expanded to include other checkpoint targets (CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3), CAR-T cells, cancer vaccines, and other modalities.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

The article correctly identified a transformative therapeutic class at a pivotal moment, with subsequent events largely validating both the immediate clinical promise and broader predictions about combination strategies and immunotherapy's central role in oncology.
