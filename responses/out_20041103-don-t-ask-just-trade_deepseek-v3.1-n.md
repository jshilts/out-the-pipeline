# Don't Ask; Just Trade (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2004 commentary article discusses the immediate market reaction to George W. Bush's re-election, specifically how it impacted pharmaceutical and stem cell company stocks. The author notes that while most pharma stocks rose after the election, three stem cell-focused companies (Geron, Stemcells Inc., and Aastrom) saw their stock prices decline significantly. The article points out the apparent irrationality of this market reaction, since the Bush administration's stem cell policy only restricted *public* (NIH) funding for embryonic stem cell research, while private sector research remained unrestricted. The author highlights a key market inefficiency: investors were treating all three companies as if they were focused on embryonic stem cells, when in fact Aastrom used only adult-derived stem cells (which faced no research restrictions).

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent two decades revealed significant developments in stem cell research and these specific companies:

**Geron Corporation** became the first company to receive FDA approval for a human embryonic stem cell clinical trial in 2009 (spinal cord injury). However, they discontinued this trial in 2011, shifted their focus to cancer drugs, and eventually ceased stem cell operations. In 2020-2021, Geron pivoted to focus on hematology-oncology therapeutics, specifically developing imetelstat for myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndromes.

**Aastrom Biosciences** (later renamed Vericel Corporation in 2014) successfully commercialized adult-derived cell therapies. They received FDA approval for MACI (autologous cultured chondrocytes on a porcine collagen membrane) in 2016 for knee cartilage repair and have built a sustainable commercial business with growing revenue.

**The broader stem cell field** evolved significantly: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were discovered in 2006-2007, providing an alternative to controversial embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cell therapies gained regulatory approval and market acceptance, while the 2009 Obama administration eased some federal funding restrictions before the Trump administration imposed new limitations.

**Market and policy reality**: Contrary to the article's concerns, federal funding restrictions didn't prevent commercial development of stem cell therapies, but the companies that succeeded (like Aastrom/Vericel) were those using adult stem cells rather than embryonic approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Taking academia partly out of the game increases the chance that a major discovery would be completely owned by a company"**: This proved partly accurate. Companies like Aastrom/Vericel succeeded commercially with adult-derived therapies, though the most groundbreaking discovery (iPSCs) came from academia (Shinya Yamanaka, 2007). Commercial ownership did increase in some areas.

• **"Restrictions on NIH funding hold back the whole field"**: Evaluation is complex. Adult stem cell therapies advanced and achieved approval despite restrictions. Embryonic stem cell research continued, though at a slower academic pace. iPSC research (academically driven) revolutionized the field within three years of this article.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
The article offers valuable insight into market perceptions of stem cell research at a critical political moment, and many of its observations about stem cell companies proved prescient over the following decades. The discussion of investment market inefficiencies and the distinction between adult and embryonic stem cell approaches remains relevant.
