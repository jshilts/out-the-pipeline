# A Dumb Proposal for the NSF (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article criticizes a draft bill circulated by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) that would fundamentally change how the National Science Foundation reviews grant applications. The proposed legislation would require the NSF to certify that all funded research: (1) advances U.S. national interests in health, prosperity, welfare or national defense; (2) is the "finest quality, groundbreaking" and addresses problems of "utmost importance to society"; and (3) is not duplicative of other federally-funded research. The author argues this approach fundamentally misunderstands how scientific research works—that much valuable research doesn't appear immediately useful, many investigations fail, and judging importance upfront is impossible. The author sees this as political grandstanding rather than a genuine solution, comparing it to Smith's previous involvement with the Stop Online Piracy Act, and suggests such overreach exemplifies why certain legislators shouldn't hold office.

## 2. HISTORY
**Congressional developments**: The proposed legislation evolved into what became known as the **HIGHER ed Act (High Quality Research Act)**, introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith as H.R. 1422 in April 2013. However, the bill **never became law**—it failed to advance through Congress despite significant attention and controversy.

**NSF grant review process**: The existing peer-review system remained largely intact. The NSF continued using merit review criteria established in 1997 (and later updated in 2018) that balance "intellectual merit" with "broader impacts," but maintained scientific community-driven peer review as the cornerstone of funding decisions.

**Political and scientific community response**: The proposal generated strong opposition from major scientific organizations including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the National Academy of Sciences, and numerous universities. The scientific community successfully argued that the bill would politicize science funding and undermine the peer-review process that had made U.S. science globally competitive.

**Representative Lamar Smith's tenure**: Smith continued as Chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee until 2019, during which he remained a controversial figure on science policy, regularly questioning climate science and supporting restrictions on federal science funding in various areas. He retired from Congress in 2019.

**Long-term impact**: While this specific bill failed, similar tensions between congressional oversight and scientific autonomy continued, with periodic political attempts to influence specific areas of research funding (particularly climate science and social sciences) throughout the 2010s. The existing NSF merit review system proved resilient, and no major legislative changes to the fundamental peer-review model were enacted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions about the proposal and its potential effects:

- **"What will happen is that people will rewrite their grant applications in order to make them look attractive under whatever rules apply"**
  - **Outcome**: This prediction became moot as the bill never passed. The NSF peer-review system remained fundamentally unchanged, so researchers didn't face this particular rewriting challenge in response to Smith's criteria.
  - **Broader context**: Researchers did continue adapting proposals to NSF's existing merit review criteria, but the specific politicized criteria proposed by Smith were never implemented.

- **"I'm not saying that Rep. Smith's proposal would Destroy Science in America. That would take a lot more work"**
  - **Outcome**: The prediction that the bill wouldn't destroy American science was correct—it failed to pass. However, the broader point that such proposals represent deeper threats was validated by continued political pressures on science funding throughout the decade.
  - **Broader context**: Similar political challenges to scientific funding autonomy persisted, particularly around climate science and social sciences, though the core peer-review system survived.

- **Implicit prediction that the proposal was flawed and wouldn't work as intended**
  - **Outcome**: This proved correct in two ways: (1) The bill failed to advance, suggesting insufficient political support, and (2) The scientific community's arguments about the impossibility of predicting research impact upfront were largely validated by the proposal's failure.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 5/10**

While the article addressed an important policy debate about science funding, the specific proposal it criticized never became law, making this more of historical interest about a political moment than a piece with sustained relevance to how science funding actually evolved. The broader questions about balancing accountability with scientific autonomy remain ongoing, but this particular legislative episode was ultimately a failed initiative.
