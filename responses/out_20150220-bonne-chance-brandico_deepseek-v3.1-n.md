# Bonne Chance, Brandicourt (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This February 2015 blog post comments on Sanofi's appointment of Olivier Brandicourt as its new CEO. Brandicourt came from Bayer, where he spent two years, but had a much longer history at Pfizer. The article highlights Brandicourt's involvement in overseeing the launch of Exubera, Pfizer's inhaled insulin product that failed spectacularly. The author characterizes Exubera as a major corporate debacle resulting from "wrongheaded groupthink" and suggests this history raises questions about Sanofi's concurrent partnership with Mannkind's own inhaled insulin product (Afrezza). The piece expresses skepticism about both Mannkind's approach and whether Brandicourt—or anyone—could succeed at Sanofi given potential board interference. The central tension is whether Brandicourt's problematic track record with inhaled insulin should concern stakeholders as he takes the helm amid Sanofi's ongoing inhaled insulin collaboration.

## 2. HISTORY

**Sanofi's inhaled insulin partnership**: Sanofi and MannKind entered a collaboration for Afrezza (MannKind's inhaled insulin) in August 2014, six months before this article. The partnership continued under Brandicourt, but failed commercially. Sanofi terminated the agreement in January 2016 (roughly ten months after Brandicourt's appointment), citing poor sales performance and returning all rights to MannKind. MannKind subsequently struggled financially, announcing layoffs in 2016 and restructuring in 2017. Afrezza remains on the market with modest sales, failing to achieve significant market penetration.

**Sanofi's broader performance under Brandicourt**: Brandicourt served as Sanofi's CEO from April 2015 to September 2019. During his tenure, Sanofi faced significant challenges. The company underwent major restructuring, including job cuts and R&D reorganization. Sanofi's stock underperformed relative to peers, and the company lost patent protection on key drugs like Lantus (insulin glargine), facing biosimilar competition. Brandicourt pursued acquisitions (notably purchasing Bioverativ for $11.6 billion in 2018 and Ablynx for $4.8 billion) to bolster the rare disease portfolio, but these moves received mixed reactions from investors. He stepped down in 2019, succeeded by Paul Hudson.

**Exubera's legacy**: Pfizer's Exubera, launched in 2006 (with Brandicourt involved), was withdrawn in 2007 after generating only $12 million in sales against billions in development costs. The failure became a case study in pharmaceutical market misjudgment, primarily due to device bulkiness, pricing issues, safety concerns, and poor physician/patient acceptance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Fun to watch" the MannKind partnership**: The author anticipated drama around Sanofi–MannKind collaboration given Brandicourt's Exubera history. This proved prescient—the partnership dissolved within a year amid poor Afrezza sales, consistent with the article's skeptical tone.
- **Whether Brandicourt could succeed and "whether Sanofi's board of directors will let anyone do the job"**: The implicit suggestion that leadership or governance constraints might limit success appeared validated. Brandicourt's tenure ended after 4.5 years with disappointing stock performance and multiple restructuring initiatives, suggesting ongoing organizational struggles.
- **MannKind's investors needing "to adjust the dosages of their non-insulin medications"**: This metaphorical critique of MannKind investors' judgment proved largely accurate. MannKind's stock declined dramatically post-2015, and despite Afrezza's continued availability, the company never achieved sustained profitability or significant market impact from its inhaled insulin.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article gains moderate historical interest because its pessimistic take on Brandicourt and inhaled insulin largely aligned with subsequent outcomes. However, it remains a brief commentary rather than deep analysis, offering limited broader insight beyond one executive appointment and a niche therapeutic approach.
