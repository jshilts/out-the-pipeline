# Building A House, Building a Cell (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a thought experiment that uses the analogy of building a house to illustrate the complexity and strangeness of cellular processes. The author describes a construction site where tools (representing proteins and enzymes) float around randomly. These tools can have multiple functions, change shape when interacting with each other, assemble into complexes, break apart, and sometimes transform into entirely different tools. There are "colored pencils" (signaling molecules) that mark targets for other tools to act upon, and the tools themselves can mark each other, triggering degradation or activation.

The "blueprint room" represents the nucleus with DNA being transcribed and copied. Templates emerge and interact with tool "foundries" that produce new hybrid tools, while quality control mechanisms tag and degrade worn or obsolete tools for recycling. Everything is interconnected: tools are made of smaller tools, materials assemble themselves, and there's constant dynamic remodeling even as the house (the cell/organism) continues to exist and function.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2017 article, several areas of cellular biology and drug discovery saw notable progress that both validated and complicated the picture of cellular complexity:

**CRISPR and Gene Editing Applications Expanded**: Between 2018-2024, CRISPR technology moved beyond proof-of-concept into clinical trials. The first CRISPR-based therapy (Casgevy for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) received regulatory approval in several countries (including the UK in 2023 and FDA approval in late 2023/early 2024). These approvals demonstrated that we could indeed intervene in the "blueprint room" and the "tool foundries," though the approach still faces challenges around delivery efficiency, off-target effects, and patient access.

**Protein Degradation Therapeutics**: The article's "grinding waste disposal machines" analogy became reality in approved medicines. BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapies and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) entered clinical development, with several reaching FDA approval (e.g., CAR-T therapies for multiple myeloma). These validate the mechanistic principle of tagging proteins for destruction, though PROTACs remain in clinical trials without market approval as of 2024.

**Conventional Drug Discovery Efficiency Improved Modestly**: AI-driven drug discovery platforms gained traction post-2017. Companies like DeepMind demonstrated breakthrough protein folding prediction capabilities by 2020 with AlphaFold2, which helps predict how tools fold and interact. Pharma companies increasingly integrated AI into target identification and hit-finding workflows. However, the fundamental complexity of cellular pathways still limits success rates; clinical trial failure rates remain high (around 90% overall), suggesting that understanding the house-building process didn't immediately translate to easy intervention.

**Precision Medicine Gained Traction in Some Areas**: Oncology saw expansion of biomarker-driven therapies with targeted agents approved for tumors with specific molecular markers. However, most diseases still lack actionable precision medicine approaches. The "dozens or hundreds" of marks the author mentions reflects the reality of complex biomarkers and tumor heterogeneity limiting broad success.

**Regulatory Adaptation**: Regulatory agencies began incorporating real-world evidence and adaptive trial designs more routinely, acknowledging that traditional parallel-group trials poorly fit the highly variable biological reality. Fast-track approvals increased, especially for unmet needs, but post-marketing requirement burdens also grew.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains only implicit predictions about the continued complexity of biological systems and the ongoing difficulty of intervention. By using the construction analogy to emphasize the strange, multi-layered nature of cellular processes, the author implies several directions that proved prescient and others where reality differed:

• **Prediction**: Cellular complexity would remain difficult to fully map or manipulate.

• **Reality**: This remained true. Despite advances in single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and systems biology, complete predictive models of cellular behavior remained elusive. However, in 2017 the author couldn't have anticipated AlphaFold solving protein folding for many structures by late 2020, dramatically accelerating structure-based drug design.

• **Prediction**: Tools that convert other tools or materials into different forms would continue to be important.

• **Reality**: Validated in 2020-2024 when mRNA vaccines were rapidly developed and deployed, essentially hijacking the "tool foundries" (ribosomes) to produce SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, demonstrating the potential of directly leveraging cellular machinery. This approach proved transformative for pandemic response.

• **Prediction**: Quality control "red ribbons" and recycling mechanisms would be targets for intervention.

• **Reality**: Clinical successes and trials of autophagy modulators and targeted protein degradation systems (PROTACs) bear this out, with multiple approved CAR-T therapies and PROTACs in development. These approaches play into exactly the degradation and tagging mechanisms described in the analogy.

• **Prediction**: The fundamental oddness would make drug development inherently hard and different from engineering.

• **Reality**: Despite AI advances, most drug programs still fail in clinical trials, often because of unexpected toxicity or lack of efficacy in complex human physiology. The analogy's emphasis on self-organizing, emergent properties rather than deterministic engineering remains relevant to drug discovery challenges.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article ranks in the upper percentiles because it captures the systemic complexity of cellular biology in a memorable, thought-provoking analogy that holds up years later, and it implicitly anticipated both the potential and limitations of emerging therapeutic modalities.
