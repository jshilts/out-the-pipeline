# Freedom of the Press: Science Reporting Division (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece recounts a heated 2011 debate about how much editorial control scientists should have over news stories that cover their work. It began with a blog post by David Kroll (aka “Abel Pharmboy”) questioning whether scientists who are quoted should also be allowed to proof‑read the final article. An editorial in *Nature* (Ananyo Bhattacharya) warned that giving authors that power threatens journalistic independence, while three Cardiff neuroscientists argued in *The Guardian* that accuracy should trump independence and that peer review already guarantees correctness. The author of the commentary sides with Kroll, claiming that a little “messiness” and mutual oversight keep both journalists and scientists honest, and dismisses peer review as an unreliable safety net.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 developments in science journalism and fact‑checking**

* **Guidelines and policies** – Major outlets (e.g., *The Guardian*, *The New York Times*, *BBC*) refined their science‑reporting handbooks in the 2010s, explicitly stating that authors may be asked to verify quotations but should not edit the story. *Nature* and *Science* introduced “press‑release review” steps where authors approve the press release but not the journalist’s copy.  

* **Institutional fact‑checking** – The UK’s **Science Media Centre (SMC)**, founded in 2009, expanded its “expert‑review” service; by the mid‑2010s most UK newspapers routinely sent drafts to SMC‑approved experts for quick factual checks, without granting them editorial veto. Similar services appeared in the US (e.g., **AAAS’s Science Communication** resources, **The Conversation** model).  

* **Retraction Watch growth** – The blog cited in the article continued to gain influence, documenting hundreds of high‑profile retractions and highlighting peer‑review failures. Its visibility helped cement the view that peer review alone cannot guarantee accuracy.  

* **Preprint explosion & COVID‑19** – The surge of bio‑Rxiv and med‑Rxiv preprints (especially during the 2020‑2021 COVID‑19 pandemic) forced journalists to develop rapid‑review pipelines. Many newsrooms instituted “author‑consultation” steps for preprints, but kept a hard line that authors could not dictate wording. The pandemic also prompted new industry‑wide guidelines (e.g., *Nature’s* “COVID‑19 coverage guidelines”) emphasizing independent verification over author‑provided edits.  

* **Press‑embargo reforms** – Journals tightened embargo policies: authors now receive embargoed press releases and are asked to confirm factual accuracy, but the embargo is lifted only after the newsroom’s final copy is ready. This compromise reflects the balance argued in the 2011 debate.  

* **Public trust research** – Surveys (e.g., Pew Research Center 2016, 2022) show a modest rise in public trust of science journalists when articles are transparent about source involvement. Conversely, high‑profile missteps (e.g., the 2018 *Lancet* retraction of the “hydroxychloroquine” paper) reinforced the need for independent editorial oversight.  

Overall, the industry moved toward a **structured, limited fact‑checking role for scientists** while preserving editorial independence—a middle ground that mirrors the “keep each other on our toes” sentiment of the original commentary.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Scientists will increasingly demand the right to edit or veto news stories about their work.** | Some scientists have indeed pushed for more involvement, especially during the COVID‑19 surge, but most major outlets have resisted granting veto power. Policies now allow *verification of quotes* but not *editorial control*. |
| **Peer review is insufficient to guarantee accuracy; reliance on it will be questioned.** | Confirmed. High‑profile retractions (e.g., the 2018 *Lancet* hydroxychloroquine paper, the 2020 *Surgisphere* data scandal) underscored peer‑review limits, leading to broader calls for post‑publication review and open data. |
| **Over‑reliance on scientist fact‑checking could erode journalistic independence and public trust.** | Partially borne out. Instances where authors heavily edited stories (e.g., a 2014 *Science* press‑release controversy) sparked criticism and prompted stricter newsroom policies. Public‑trust surveys suggest that perceived independence remains a key credibility factor. |
| **A “watch‑dog” system where everyone monitors everyone else will be the optimal model.** | The rise of fact‑checking services (SMC, Retraction Watch, *The Conversation*) and open‑science platforms (preprint servers with community comments) reflects this collaborative oversight model. It has become the de‑facto norm in many outlets. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the evolving relationship between scientists and journalists; its arguments foreshadow many later policy changes, making it a useful historical reference for anyone studying science communication.
