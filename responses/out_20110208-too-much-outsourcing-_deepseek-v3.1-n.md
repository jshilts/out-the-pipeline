# Too Much Outsourcing: Has the Line Been Crossed? (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines whether pharmaceutical companies were over-outsourcing critical R&D functions in pursuit of cost savings, drawing a comparison to Boeing's problematic 787 Dreamliner development where excessive outsourcing backfired and increased overall costs. The author notes that while outsourcing is driven by the pharmaceutical industry's immense drug development costs, there may be an "invisible line" where companies outsource too much core capability, potentially leading to Boeing-like problems where recovery costs exceed original savings.

The piece raises concerns about loss of key technologies and control, referencing Boeing's experience where the company had to compensate, support, or buy out outsourcing partners, ultimately bearing additional costs due to development delays. While acknowledging that "zero outsourcing" is probably impractical, the article questions whether some pharmaceutical organizations had crossed into dangerous territory by offshoring critical R&D capabilities, potentially jeopardizing future productivity and control over their own drug pipelines.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2011 article, the pharmaceutical outsourcing landscape evolved significantly, but largely validated the article's cautious stance:

**Moderate Rebalancing**: While outsourcing continued to grow—the global pharmaceutical outsourcing market expanded from approximately $48 billion in 2011 to over $140 billion by 2021—many large pharmaceutical companies became more strategic about what they outsourced. Companies increasingly kept core discovery research and early development in-house while outsourcing manufacturing, clinical trials, and specialized services.

**Boeing's Continued Struggles**: The 787 Dreamliner problems proved even worse than described in 2011. The aircraft faced extensive delays, grounding due to battery fires (2013), and production halts, with total program costs running tens of billions over budget—partly validating the outsourcing concerns raised in the article.

**Pharma Industry Response**: Major companies like Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis maintained significant internal R&D capabilities while using contract research organizations (CROs) for specific functions. The most successful approaches involved strategic partnerships rather than wholesale offloading of core competencies.

**COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic highlighted both benefits and risks of globalized pharmaceutical supply chains, with companies that maintained critical manufacturing and R&D capabilities domestically faring better during supply chain disruptions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained implicit predictions and concerns:

• **Implicit prediction: Companies over-outsourcing would face Boeing-like problems** ✓ Mixed accuracy. While no pharmaceutical company faced Boeing-scale disasters, companies that outsourced too aggressively did face quality control issues, regulatory problems, and sometimes higher costs. However, the industry largely avoided catastrophic failures by maintaining tighter oversight than Boeing initially did.

• **Concern: Loss of key technologies would prove costly** ✓ Partially validated. Companies that maintained core competencies in areas like drug discovery, formulation development, and regulatory strategy generally performed better. Those that outsourced critical expertise sometimes struggled with innovation gaps.

• **Implicit concern: Cost savings from outsourcing might be illusory** ✓ Validated in specific cases. Several companies discovered that hidden costs of oversight, quality problems, and timeline delays sometimes eroded projected savings, leading to more strategic, selective outsourcing approaches.

• **Concern: The industry might cross an invisible line** ✓ Mostly avoided. The pharmaceutical industry generally maintained better balance than Boeing's initial 787 approach, though some individual companies faced problems from over-outsourcing specific functions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article remains relevant for its early identification of strategic outsourcing risks, with Boeing's 787 saga providing a prescient cautionary tale. While pharmaceutical companies largely avoided Boeing-scale disasters, the core concerns about maintaining critical competencies proved valid and continue informing outsourcing strategy debates today.
