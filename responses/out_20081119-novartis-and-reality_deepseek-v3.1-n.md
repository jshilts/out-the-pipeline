# Novartis and Reality (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2008 commentary reflects on whether Novartis's Cambridge research site lived up to its early-2000s promises to "reinvent the way drugs are discovered." The article recalls that around 2002-2003, under research head Mark Fishman, Novartis had positioned its move into the renovated Necco candy building as creating a "research operation vastly different from traditional pharmaceutical research," with Gleevec as a paradigmatic model. Several years later, the author observes that while Novartis has been relatively successful as a company, the Cambridge site appears to operate "pretty much like any other large drug research operation" with "the usual talk and the usual complaints"—not obviously transformative. The piece raises questions about whether the original vision was abandoned, remained a work in progress, or was mostly PR talk to begin with.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2008 commentary, Novartis's Cambridge research site (the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, NIBR) did not fundamentally reinvent drug discovery, but it did become a major contributor to the company's pipeline and approvals.

**Research output and approvals:**
- **Gleevec (imatinib)** remained a landmark success from the targeted-therapy era, but it predated the Cambridge site's transformation and was not replicated as a universal model.
- NIBR played central roles in subsequent approvals including **Tasigna (nilotinib)** for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), **Jakavi (ruxolitinib)** for myelofibrosis, and **Kisqali (ribociclib)** for HR+/HER2− breast cancer.
- In autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, NIBR contributed to **Cosentyx (secukinumab)** for plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.
- Neuroscience efforts yielded **Mayzent (siponimod)** for multiple sclerosis. Notably, NIBR also drove early research on **Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel)**, the CAR-T therapy later partnered and developed, leading to FDA approval in 2017.

**Structural evolution and external validation:**
- The site consistently housed exploratory biology, genomics, and translational medicine teams, but many of its approaches (target-based screening, medicinal chemistry, clinical development) converged toward sector norms rather than a radical departure.
- Mark Fishman stepped down as NIBR president in 2014, succeeded by Jay Bradner (2016–2021), then by Fiona Marshall. Under Bradner, NIBR emphasized open innovation, epigenetic probes, and academic-style publication, but core R&D workflows did not radically diverge from peers.
- The biotech ecosystem around Kendall Square matured into a dense cluster; NIBR often collaborated with, spun out, or acquired nearby startups rather than internalizing disruptive models.

**Portfolio pivots and discontinuations:**
- Novartis exited antibacterial research, sharply narrowed neuroscience, and later (2022–2024) reorganized R&D into " therapeutic area–aligned" units with cost-saving measures—aligning the Cambridge site more closely with corporate-wide portfolio and productivity pressures.
- In practice, NIBR operated as an integrated, large-scale research engine that produced important medicines but did not redefine industry R&D paradigms.

**Corporate performance:**
- Novartis sustained strong commercial performance in key franchises (oncology, immunology, cardiovascular) and continued Cambridge hiring and investment through the 2010s, albeit punctuated by restructuring waves.
- The company navigated patent cliffs (e.g., Gleevec loss of exclusivity in 2016) via new launches and lifecycle management—outcomes consistent with solid R&D execution rather than paradigm reinvention.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: Novartis Cambridge would deliver a "research operation vastly different from traditional pharmaceutical research" and "reinvent the way drugs are discovered."
  - **Outcome**: While NIBR produced notable drugs, it largely converged toward conventional target-based discovery and clinical development workflows. Modifications (e.g., more open collaboration, publication culture, and use of patient-derived samples and genomics) were incremental rather than transformative. The site is respected but not considered a radical departure from peers.

- **Prediction**: Gleevec would serve as a model for future drug discovery within Novartis.
  - **Outcome**: The "Gleevec model" (translating precise molecular pathology into a selective kinase inhibitor) influenced oncology development (e.g., Tasigna, and industry-wide pursuit of oncogene addiction), but it did not generalize into a replicable, end-to-end discovery framework. Many subsequent candidates encountered complex biology, resistance mechanisms, and patient heterogeneity, limiting how broadly the paradigm applied.

- **Prediction** (implicit): Organizational design choices (e.g., deliberately cramped labs) and leadership would catalyze novel interaction patterns and scientific breakthroughs.
  - **Outcome**: No evidence shows that spatial layouts fundamentally changed research productivity or innovation trajectories. NIBR’s successes stemmed more from sustained investment in target validation, medicinal chemistry, and translational science than from architectural or organizational re-engineering.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This piece holds moderate analytical interest because it captures the gap between aspirational transformation and organizational reality in biopharma R&D. While the Cambridge site evolved into a productive research hub with important medicines to its name, it did not reinvent industry practices. The article usefully documents how abstract "change" rhetoric often fails to materialize, even in a high-performing organization.
