# Sigh (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The author (Derek Lowe, from his "In the Pipeline" blog) initially criticized the cover of a major Scandinavian chemistry publication for displaying what appeared to be chemically impossible structures—specifically aliphatic hydrogens attached to aromatic rings, two wedged bonds from the same carbon, and unrelated ammonium dichromate imagery. He compared this to trade magazines in other industries not making similarly nonsensical technical errors.

After a reader pointed out the diagram represented an alcohol dehydrogenase reaction with NAD+ as a substrate, the author retracted his criticism and acknowledged the drawing depicted enzyme-catalyzed biochemistry rather than standard organic chemistry, leaving the original post up as self-punishment. The ending notes he performed amide formation reactions in the lab to "feel like a real chemist again."

## 2. HISTORY
Alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes and the NAD+/NADH cofactor system have remained fundamental to biochemistry research and drug development. Alcohol dehydrogenases are critical targets for medications treating alcohol use disorder, with disulfiram (Antabuse) being a long-established FDA-approved drug that inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing unpleasant effects when alcohol is consumed. More recent research has explored selective inhibitors and modulators of different alcohol dehydrogenase isozymes.

The NAD+/NADH redox system continues to be a major focus in metabolic disease research, aging studies, and cancer therapeutics. Numerous clinical trials and approved drugs target metabolic pathways involving these cofactors, though no revolutionary new alcohol dehydrogenase-targeting therapies have achieved widespread patient uptake since 2015 that would represent a major shift from established treatments.

Publications and scientific communications have generally maintained current standards—technical illustrations in reputable journals typically maintain chemical accuracy, though occasional errors still occur and are often corrected through post-publication feedback mechanisms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **No explicit predictions** were made in the article regarding future scientific developments or industry trends. The post was primarily focused on immediate chemical accuracy concerns rather than forward-looking statements.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article represents a brief, self-contained commentary about chemical illustration accuracy that was corrected within the same post. While it highlights the collaborative nature of scientific discourse and the importance of domain expertise in proper interpretation, it doesn't address major biotechnology trends, clinical developments, or policy changes of lasting significance. The content is primarily of niche interest to chemists and science communicators rather than having broader implications for the biotechnology industry or public impact.
