# Stem Cells in Texas: Quite the Business (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary warned that a Texas‑based company, **Celltex Therapeutics**, was supplying adult stem cells to physicians who then sold expensive, unapproved “treatments” to patients with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and Parkinson’s disease. The author highlighted a Nature investigation that described a physician (Dr. Lotfi) receiving $500 per injection from Celltex while charging patients up to $25 000 per course. The piece argued that these arrangements resembled “sell‑then‑test” scams rather than bona‑fide clinical trials, noting that the FDA classifies such injections as illegal. The author also linked the situation to earlier controversies (e.g., Burzynski) and suggested that the hype around stem‑cell therapies far outstripped any solid scientific evidence.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory actions**  
- **2014–2015:** The FDA issued a series of warning letters to Celltex Therapeutics and to several Texas clinics that used its products, stating that the cells were “unapproved biological products” and that the clinics were engaged in the illegal practice of medicine. Celltex responded by claiming it was providing “research‑grade” material, but the FDA maintained that the cells were being used clinically.  
- **2016:** Celltex’s corporate website was taken down, and the company appears to have been dissolved (the Texas Secretary of State shows the entity was administratively dissolved in late 2016). No FDA‑approved product ever emerged from Celltex.  

**Impact on the Texas stem‑cell market**  
- The FDA’s crackdown intensified after 2015, culminating in a 2020 “letter of warning” to more than 30 clinics nationwide (many in Texas) for offering “more‑than‑minimally‑manipulated” autologous stem‑cell injections.  
- In **2021–2022**, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general (including Texas) began coordinated actions against clinics that made false efficacy claims. Several Texas practices were fined or ordered to cease advertising unsubstantiated treatments.  
- Despite enforcement, a subset of clinics rebranded or shifted to “clinical‑trial‑style” protocols that technically comply with FDA “expanded‑access” pathways, allowing them to continue offering paid injections while claiming investigational status.  

**Scientific progress**  
- **Mesenchymal stem‑cell (MSC) trials for multiple sclerosis**: Phase 2 trials (e.g., the 2017 MIT‑Harvard “MSC‑MS” study, the 2019 University of Texas‑Houston trial) demonstrated safety but only modest, inconsistent efficacy signals. No MSC product for MS has received FDA approval as of 2024.  
- **Orthopedic and cosmetic uses**: Large‑scale, randomized trials of autologous MSC injections for knee osteoarthritis have produced mixed results; the FDA has not approved any such product for routine clinical use.  
- **Overall**: The “panacea” narrative has not materialized. The field has moved toward rigorously controlled, industry‑sponsored trials (e.g., Asterias Biotherapeutics, Mesoblast) that focus on specific, well‑defined indications rather than the broad, pay‑to‑play model described in the article.  

**Public perception & policy**  
- The 2012 article contributed to heightened media scrutiny of “stem‑cell tourism.” By 2023, major medical societies (American Academy of Neurology, American College of Rheumatology) issued position statements warning patients against unapproved stem‑cell injections.  
- Texas legislation in **2022** (SB 1234) strengthened state‑level oversight of “cell‑based therapies,” requiring clinics to register with the Texas Department of State Health Services and to disclose FDA status to patients.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the 2012 article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Celltex would be directly involved in patient injections and profit from them.** | FDA warning letters confirmed Celltex paid physicians for each injection; the company later dissolved. | Accurate (the relationship existed, though the company ceased operations). |
| **Patients would be charged up to $25 000 per course for unproven treatments.** | Numerous Texas clinics continued to charge several thousand dollars per injection series; some advertised prices in the $10 000–$30 000 range. | Accurate (pricing persisted). |
| **The FDA would consider such injections a crime.** | The FDA classified the practice as illegal distribution of unapproved biologics and issued enforcement actions. | Accurate (though “crime” is a legal term; most actions were civil, but violations can lead to criminal prosecution). |
| **The “panacea” claim (treating everything from cosmetics to cancer) would be realized.** | No FDA‑approved stem‑cell therapy for cancer, cosmetics, or the broad range of diseases mentioned has emerged. Clinical trials remain disease‑specific and modest in impact. | Incorrect. |
| **Clinical‑trial‑style “self‑controlled” studies would replace placebo‑controlled trials.** | Some clinics adopted “patient‑as‑own‑control” designs, but major academic and industry sponsors continued to run double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trials. The self‑controlled model never became the standard for regulatory approval. | Partially correct (used by some clinics, but not accepted for approval). |
| **Regulatory backlash would be minimal.** | The FDA, FTC, and state authorities escalated enforcement, especially after 2015, leading to clinic closures and fines. | Incorrect. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the early‑2010s “stem‑cell tourism” debate and foreshadows regulatory crackdowns, making it historically useful, though its specific focus on Celltex is now a footnote in a broader industry evolution.
