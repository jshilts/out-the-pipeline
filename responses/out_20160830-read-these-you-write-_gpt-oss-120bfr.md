# Read These Before You Write That Op‑Ed (30 Aug 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a brief “reading list” for anyone planning to write an op‑ed on drug pricing. The author points readers to two longer pieces:  

* **Bruce Booth’s “Innovators vs. Exploiters: Drug Pricing & the Future of Pharma”** (LifeSciVC, Aug 2016) – a polemic that frames the pricing debate as a clash between genuine innovators who need to recoup R&D costs and “exploiters” who profit from existing products without adding value. Booth also sketches policy ideas such as price caps, “value‑based” contracts, and stronger incentives for truly novel therapies.  

* **A Slate Star Codex essay (Aug 29 2016) titled “Reverse Vox‑splaining: Drugs vs. Chairs.”** – a more technical look at the regulatory environment, especially the FDA’s accelerated‑approval pathways and how they affect pricing, market exclusivity, and the incentives for pharmaceutical firms.  

The author’s purpose is simply to make sure that any future commentary on drug pricing is grounded in these two analyses rather than relying on superficial arguments.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Policy landscape (2016‑2024)**  
- **U.S. legislative action:** The most concrete shift came with the **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022**, which for the first time gave Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for a limited set of high‑cost drugs (initially six, expanding to dozens by 2026). This directly addresses Booth’s call for “price‑setting mechanisms” and reflects the broader political appetite for curbing “exploitation.”  
- **Executive‑branch rules:** In 2022‑2023 the **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** issued the “**American Patients First**” rule, tightening biosimilar substitution requirements and encouraging competition—another policy echo of Booth’s emphasis on “value‑based” competition.  
- **State‑level initiatives:** Several states (e.g., Maryland, Colorado, New York) enacted **price‑transparency** or **price‑cap** laws for certain drug categories, mirroring the “price‑cap” ideas discussed in Booth’s piece.  

**Industry response**  
- **Pricing strategies:** Large pharma companies have increasingly turned to **outcome‑based contracts** and **indication‑specific pricing** to pre‑empt regulatory pressure, a trend that aligns with the “value‑based” mechanisms Booth advocated.  
- **R&D focus:** The debate over “innovation vs. exploitation” has not dramatically altered the overall R&D pipeline; the number of **first‑in‑class** approvals continued to rise (≈ 50‑60 per year in the U.S. from 2016‑2023), but a larger share of late‑stage assets are **me-too** or **incremental** products, a point still contested in the literature.  

**Public discourse**  
- Both Booth’s article and the Slate Star Codex essay were widely shared on social media and cited in subsequent op‑eds, policy briefs, and academic commentaries on drug pricing. They helped popularize the “innovation‑exploitation” framing that still appears in mainstream media coverage (e.g., NYT, WSJ pieces in 2022‑2024).  

**Regulatory environment**  
- The **FDA’s accelerated‑approval pathway** has remained a focal point of criticism. Since 2016, the FDA has tightened post‑marketing confirmatory trial requirements (e.g., the 2020 “Accelerated Approval Reform” guidance), partially addressing concerns raised in the Slate Star Codex post about “regulatory shortcuts” inflating prices without proven benefit.  

Overall, the ideas highlighted in the 2016 reading list have been reflected in a series of incremental policy changes rather than a single sweeping reform.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original post does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implicitly suggests that:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Policy recommendations (price caps, value‑based contracts) will gain traction** | Partial adoption: the IRA’s Medicare price‑negotiation, CMS “American Patients First” rule, and several state price‑cap laws implement elements of those recommendations. |
| **A more informed public debate will emerge if writers read the two suggested pieces** | The “innovation vs. exploitation” framing became a common shorthand in op‑eds and congressional hearings, indicating the recommendation succeeded in shaping discourse. |
| **Regulatory scrutiny of accelerated‑approval drugs will increase** | FDA issued new guidance (2020, 2022) tightening confirmatory‑trial expectations; however, the pathway remains active, so the prediction was only partially realized. |

No bold, specific timeline predictions were made, so the evaluation is limited to these inferred expectations.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10**  
The post is a short, peripheral recommendation rather than original analysis; its interest lies mainly in pointing to two influential pieces that helped shape the drug‑pricing conversation over the subsequent decade.
