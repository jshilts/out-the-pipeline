# Where Goes Organic Synthesis (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The blog post discusses Phillip Ball's Nature article examining the future of organic synthesis. The author begins by outlining the reasons chemists synthesize molecules, how those motivations have evolved over time, and where the field might be heading. A central question posed is whether handmade, intricate synthesis will become a boutique rarity, similar to handcrafted books in the digital age. The post addresses periodic debates about whether total synthesis is dying, arguing this is the wrong framing—instead, synthesis methods and motives are rapidly evolving, and the field should focus on how to adapt.

The author explores the aesthetic dimension of synthesis, arguing that beauty lies in short, economical routes with minimal manipulations and readily available starting materials—not in complex, multi-step syntheses using obscure precursors just to showcase remarkable reactions at step thirty-three. The post also examines automated and algorithmic synthetic design, drawing an analogy to chess: while chess has aesthetic elements and can still be played by humans, machines now surpass human ability. If the goal of organic synthesis is simply making molecules, then automation could achieve it directly, which raises anxiety about what remains for chemists. This parallels the medieval copyist's potential horror at Microsoft Word, with synthesis involving painstaking manual work like distilling fresh THF, drying glassware, and careful temperature control.

## 2. HISTORY
Post-2015 developments in organic synthesis largely validated the article's framing while accelerating the trends it identified:

**Automated synthesis platforms gained significant traction**. Companies like Emerald Cloud Lab, Strateos, and Transcriptic developed robotic platforms that automate chemical synthesis. By 2020-2024, these systems demonstrated capability to conduct multi-step syntheses with minimal human intervention, moving beyond simple reactions to complex transformations. Academic groups also built automated flow chemistry systems and closed-loop optimization platforms.

**Algorithmic retrosynthesis matured substantially**. AI-driven tools emerged as practical resources: DeepMatter's DigitalGlassware platform, ASKCOS (developed at MIT), and commercial offerings from Schrödinger and others demonstrated viable computer-aided synthesis planning. By 2022-2024, these systems could propose reasonable synthetic routes for complex targets, though human expertise remained valuable for final validation and execution.

**The "aesthetic economy" emphasis intensified**. Pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries increasingly prioritized efficient, scalable routes over showcases of synthetic virtuosity. Process chemistry groups focused on step-count reduction, atom economy, and cost-effective routes using commodity starting materials—the "shortest, most economical syntheses" championed in the article became standard industrial practice.

**Training and pedagogy evolved**. Academic programs reduced emphasis on manual technique demonstrations and increasingly incorporated automation literacy, computational tools, and data science. The question "what does the chemist do?" found answers in experimental design, optimization strategy, method development, and interpreting complex automated workflows.

However, bespoke synthesis did not disappear entirely—complex natural products and specialized materials still required expert synthetic chemists, fulfilling the prediction that both approaches would coexist rather than one becoming extinct.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article and blog post contained several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **"Bespoke, elaborate synthesis becoming a boutique rarity akin to handcrafted books"** — This partially materialized but overstated the decline. Complex custom synthesis persisted for specialized applications (pharmaceutical intermediates, research compounds, materials), but routine small-molecule synthesis increasingly automated. The boutique analogy was apt for high-end natural product synthesis.

• **The chess analogy suggesting synthesis programs would move beyond human ability** — This proved largely accurate, with AI retrosynthesis tools demonstrating superhuman speed and breadth in proposing synthetic routes by ~2020-2022, though human expertise remained crucial for practical execution and troubleshooting.

• **Synthesis focusing on shortest, most economical routes with fewest manipulations** — This prediction strongly materialized as industrial and academic priorities shifted decisively toward efficiency, sustainability (green chemistry metrics), and practical scalability.

• **Concerns about what role remains for chemists when automation handles execution** — This concern was partially resolved as new roles emerged: experimental design, computational chemistry, data analysis, method development, and managing automated platforms became core chemist activities rather than manual technique alone.

• **Implicit assumption that synthesis aesthetic priorities would shift toward practicality** — This trend intensified, with synthetic "beauty" increasingly defined by elegance through simplicity and efficiency rather than complexity for its own sake.

## 4. INTEREST
**7** This article demonstrated strong foresight about automation's impact on synthetic chemistry, accurately identifying key themes (automation, shifting aesthetics toward efficiency, evolving chemist roles) that defined the subsequent decade. The chess and medieval copyist analogies proved remarkably prescient frameworks for understanding technology transitions in a craft-based discipline, and the core tension identified—between artisanal expertise and algorithmic efficiency—remains central to chemistry's ongoing evolution.
