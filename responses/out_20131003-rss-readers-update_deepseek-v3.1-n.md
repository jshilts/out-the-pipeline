# RSS Readers: An Update (Oct 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 article evaluates RSS feed readers as tools for keeping up with scientific literature, particularly in the wake of Google Reader's discontinuation. The author tested multiple alternatives: The Old Reader (which faced capacity issues when flooded with former Google Reader users but later reversed its closure to new users), Feedly (which proved unsatisfactory due to poor handling of graphical abstracts and stability issues), and NewsBlur (which at the time of writing was performing well and meeting the author's needs for processing scientific publications). The article reflects the broader challenge scientists faced in 2013 when RSS readers—critical for managing the high volume of scientific literature—were undergoing significant platform transitions.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this article (2013-present), the RSS reader ecosystem underwent substantial evolution with important implications for scientific information management:

**The Old Reader**: Continued operations but struggled with the massive influx of users. The service was eventually acquired by a European company but continued to face infrastructure challenges, never achieving mainstream adoption among scientists.

**Feedly**: Became a dominant platform, capturing millions of former Google Reader users. While it successfully scaled and added features (including better PDF integration useful for academic papers), it progressively shifted toward a "magazine-style" layout that prioritized visual content over text-heavy scientific abstracts, limiting its utility for serious scientific literature tracking.

**NewsBlur**: Continued development as a smaller, developer-focused alternative. It maintained the traditional RSS reader interface valued by power users and added significant customization features conducive to processing scientific feeds, playing an important niche role for bibliographic work despite never achieving mass adoption (see, for example, NewsBlur's feature set circa 2015-2018).

**RSS Ecosystem Impact**: The post-2013 period saw a major platform diversification. In addition to these readers, Inoreader and others gained significant user bases. Crucially, many scientists and institutions gradually migrated toward specialized academic platforms, including Mendeley's feed features, F1000Workspace alerts, and publisher-curated alert services (Springer, Elsevier), creating a fragmented landscape. The enduring outcome for scientific literature tracking was that general-purpose RSS tools, despite their flexibility, proved suboptimal compared to purpose-built academic tools that offered citation export, note integration, and collaborative features.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article itself made no explicit predictions about future developments. It was purely evaluative, focusing on existing tools and their immediate performance for scientific literature monitoring. The absence of forward-looking statements reflects its practical, problem-solving orientation—characteristic of academic information-seeking behavior during platform transitions.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

While this article addressed a genuine need among scientists managing information overload, its relevance was highly time-bound to the immediate post-Google Reader period of 2013. The content has become largely historical and does not address broader biotechnology trends or scientific breakthroughs, limiting its long-term importance.
