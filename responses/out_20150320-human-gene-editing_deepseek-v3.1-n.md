# Human Gene Editing (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The March 2015 article discusses the emerging CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology and reports on calls by leading biologists for a worldwide moratorium on using this technique for editing heritable human DNA. The biologists expressed concern that CRISPR/Cas9 was so effective and easy to use that physicians might proceed before safety assessments could be completed. The article highlights the dual-use dilemma: the technique could cure genetic diseases but could also be used for enhancement of traits like beauty or intelligence. The author speculates that despite ethical concerns and calls for restraint, someone would likely proceed with human germ-line editing, potentially in other countries or without public transparency, forcing a societal debate sooner than anticipated. The piece also references earlier similar calls for restraint regarding zinc-finger editing techniques.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following the 2015 article, CRISPR technology progressed significantly both scientifically and in public awareness. In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced the birth of genome-edited twin girls, using CRISPR to modify the CCR5 gene in an attempt to provide HIV resistance. This disclosure triggered international condemnation and resulted in He Jiankui's imprisonment in China for illegal medical practice.

The scientific community responded with various international commissions and statements. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (U.S.) and similar bodies globally issued reports establishing frameworks for potential therapeutic applications while maintaining restrictions on reproductive editing. Multiple countries enacted or strengthened legislation regulating human genome editing.

Clinically, CRISPR-based therapies began entering human trials. In 2019, CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals initiated trials for CTX001 to treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia using ex vivo editing of patient blood cells. These therapies subsequently received regulatory approval in several countries including the U.K. (2023) and U.S. (2024), representing the first approved CRISPR-based treatments. Several other CRISPR therapies are currently in clinical development for various diseases including cancer and inherited blindness.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction about someone proceeding with human germ-line editing**: The author predicted that despite moratorium calls, someone would advance with human germ-line editing, possibly in other countries or secretly. **Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate when He Jiankui conducted the first known human germ-line editing in China in 2018, resulting in genetically modified children. However, this occurred openly rather than secretly and faced severe consequences.

• **Prediction about timing**: The author stated "We're going to end up having this debate sooner than we think." **Outcome**: The prediction was correct, as the international debate intensified dramatically within three years following He Jiankui's announcement, much sooner than many anticipated in 2015.

• **Prediction about technology power**: The article emphasized CRISPR's effectiveness and ease of use. **Outcome**: This assessment was accurate, as CRISPR's technical advantages enabled rapid adoption across research and therapeutic applications, leading to multiple clinical successes within 8-9 years.

• **Prediction about safety concerns**: The biologists cited feared premature clinical application before safety assessment. **Outcome**: Their concerns proved valid, as evidenced by the largely unauthorized and inadequately safety-assessed He Jiankui experiment, though subsequent clinical trials for non-heritable editing proceeded with proper safety evaluation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

The article demonstrates remarkable prescience regarding the timing and nature of CRISPR's societal impact, accurately forecasting both the technology's dual-use challenges and the premature human applications that would trigger global debate. Its focus on safety, ethics, and international variations in oversight captured essential themes that defined subsequent policy discussions. While it reflects an early stage of understanding CRISPR's technical capabilities and timeline, its central warning about premature clinical application proved tragically accurate.
