# Anarchist Drugs For All. Yeahboy. (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a scathing commentary on a Vice/Motherboard story about “Four Thieves Vinegar” (FTV), a loosely‑organized collective of self‑described anarchist hackers that claims to synthesize “real” medicines in makeshift labs (Mason‑jar reactors, kitchen‑scale equipment). The author argues that the group’s claims are exaggerated: FTV has only demonstrated a crude synthesis of pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and, at best, a laboratory‑scale preparation of naloxone, cabotegravir, mifepristone and misoprostol using diverted pharmaceutical precursors (e.g., oxycodone for naloxone). The commentary stresses the practical obstacles—access to exotic starting materials, need for analytical verification (LC‑MS, NMR), formulation challenges (especially for long‑acting cabotegravir nanoparticles), and the legal/ethical hazards of distributing untested compounds to drug users. It also dismisses the collective’s lofty rhetoric about “liberating” medicine, noting that the underlying chemistry, patents and dosing information are already publicly available.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Four Thieves Vinegar’s activities after 2018**  

| Year | Development | Outcome / Impact |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **2019‑2020** | The group continued to publish open‑source protocols on its website (fourthievesvinegar.org) for pyrimethamine, naloxone, and a few other small‑molecule APIs. They released a “DIY drug kit” for pyrimethamine that bundled reagents and a step‑by‑step guide. | The kits attracted a niche community of chemists and hobbyists but never scaled beyond a few dozen users. No evidence of clinical use or widespread distribution. |
| **2020** | U.S. federal authorities (DEA and FDA) issued a warning that the open‑source instructions could facilitate illegal drug manufacture. A small‑scale raid in New York seized equipment from a laboratory that cited FTV protocols. | The raid was limited to a single location; no charges were filed against the core FTV organizers. The incident raised awareness but did not halt the website’s operation. |
| **2021** | FDA approved **cabotegravir** (brand Apretude) as a long‑acting injectable for HIV pre‑exposure prophylaxis. The formulation relies on a proprietary nanosuspension that is not disclosed in any FTV material. | Demonstrated that the most technically demanding target mentioned by FTV (cabotegravir) is now a commercial product, but the DIY community has not reproduced the formulation. |
| **2022‑2023** | Open‑source drug‑synthesis projects (e.g., Open Source Pharma, OpenChem) expanded, offering protocols for inexpensive antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin) and antiviral precursors. FTV’s website remained largely unchanged, still emphasizing pyrimethamine as its “flagship” product. | The broader DIY‑pharma movement grew modestly, but FTV’s influence stayed marginal; no new high‑profile drug (e.g., Sovaldi) was announced. |
| **2024** | A peer‑reviewed article in *ChemRxiv* cited FTV’s pyrimethamine protocol as a teaching example for undergraduate organic labs. | Shows limited academic interest; no translation to clinical or public‑health use. |
| **2025‑2026** | No public reports of FTV‑produced drugs being used in harm‑reduction programs, nor of any successful large‑scale synthesis of complex antivirals (e.g., sofosbuvir, Sovaldi). The collective’s website continues to host the original protocols, with occasional blog updates about “new reagents” but no substantive breakthroughs. | The group remains a fringe curiosity rather than a driver of pharmaceutical innovation. |

**Overall impact:**  
- **Clinical:** None of the FTV‑produced compounds have entered regulated medical practice.  
- **Regulatory:** The only notable interaction was a 2020 DEA warning; no lasting enforcement actions.  
- **Industry:** No pharma company has adopted FTV methods; the open‑source protocols are considered too low‑yield, impurity‑prone, and lacking GMP‑level quality control.  
- **Policy:** The episode contributed modestly to the ongoing debate about “right‑to‑repair” and “open science” in drug development, but it did not spur concrete legislative change.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original Vice article (and the author’s commentary) hinted at several future scenarios. Their actual outcomes are summarized below.

- **Prediction:** *FTV will synthesize and distribute cabotegravir, possibly by slipping it into heroin supplies to protect IV users from HIV.*  
  **Result:** Cabotegravir was commercialized (Apretude, 2021) with a proprietary nanoparticle formulation. No evidence that FTV produced a usable version, nor that any heroin‑dealer distribution occurred. The prediction was **incorrect**.

- **Prediction:** *FTV will move on to “Sovaldi” (sofosbuvir) and make hepatitis‑C curable for everyone, regardless of income.*  
  **Result:** Sofosbuvir remains a patented, multi‑step synthesis requiring expensive reagents and sophisticated purification. No open‑source protocol has been released, and FTV has not announced any work on it. The prediction was **incorrect**.

- **Prediction:** *DIY synthesis of “effective medicines” on a budget will become a viable alternative to institutional drug development.*  
  **Result:** While the open‑source movement has produced educational kits and low‑cost routes for a few simple APIs (e.g., pyrimethamine, naloxone), none have achieved the scale, safety, or regulatory acceptance needed to replace conventional pipelines. The broader prediction is **largely unfulfilled**.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The “free flow of information” will undermine pharma’s monopoly on drug knowledge.*  
  **Result:** Patent literature already provides synthetic routes; the bottleneck remains manufacturing, quality control, and clinical testing. Information liberation alone has not altered the market dynamics. **Partially true** in the sense of increased transparency, but not in the disruptive sense implied.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10**  

The article is a useful snapshot of the DIY‑pharma hype cycle and offers a technically informed critique, but the subject matter has had minimal real‑world impact, and the predictions have not materialized. Its relevance is mainly historical/educational rather than transformative.
