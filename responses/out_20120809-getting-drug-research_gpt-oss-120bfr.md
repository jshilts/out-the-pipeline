# Getting Drug Research Really, Really Wrong (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author attacks a 2012 BMJ commentary by Joel Lexchin and Donald Light that argued the “innovation crisis” in pharmaceuticals is a myth. The piece dismisses Light’s oft‑cited $43 million estimate of the cost to bring a new drug to market as absurdly low, claims that most new medicines are merely “me‑too” variations with little clinical benefit, and blames the industry for inflating R&D costs to secure regulatory protection and higher prices. The article also attacks the idea that marketing budgets dwarf R&D spend, and it rejects Light and Lexchin’s policy prescription of public‑funded regulatory agencies and large cash‑prize incentives for breakthrough drugs. Throughout, the author mixes factual criticism (e.g., the prevalence of incremental oncology drugs) with sarcastic commentary and personal anecdotes from a career that began in 1989.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Drug‑development cost estimates  
- **2010s‑2020s:** Independent analyses (e.g., Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development) repeatedly raised the average out‑of‑pocket cost of a successful new molecular entity (NME) to **$2–$2.6 billion** (including capitalized risk). This is far above the $43 million figure the author ridicules.  
- **2022‑2024:** A few industry‑sponsored studies suggested “mid‑range” estimates of **$1–$1.5 billion**, but the consensus remains that the true societal cost is in the low‑billion‑dollar range.

### Rate of new drug approvals and therapeutic impact  
- **FDA approvals:** The number of NMEs approved per year rose from ~20 in the early 2000s to **≈50–60 per year** in the 2015‑2023 period, driven largely by biologics, gene‑therapy vectors, and novel modalities.  
- **Breakthroughs:**  
  - **Oncology:** Immune‑checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and CAR‑T cell therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta) have delivered durable remissions in cancers previously considered incurable.  
  - **Infectious disease:** The **mRNA vaccine platform** (Pfizer‑BioNTech, Moderna) proved rapid, high‑efficacy COVID‑19 vaccines and is now being applied to influenza, RSV, and oncology.  
  - **Genetic disease:** FDA approvals of **gene‑replacement therapies** (e.g., Zolgensma for SMA, Luxturna for inherited retinal disease) have demonstrated disease‑modifying effects, albeit at very high price points.  
- **Me‑too drugs:** They remain common, especially in chronic‑disease areas (e.g., antihypertensives, statins, PPIs). However, many have secured market share by offering improved safety, dosing convenience, or cost‑effectiveness (e.g., once‑daily antihypertensives, generic‑ready formulations).

### Clinical failures in high‑profile areas  
- **Alzheimer’s disease:** The major antibody programs cited in the article (bapineuzumab, solanezumab, γ‑secretase inhibitors) all failed to meet primary endpoints in Phase III trials. Subsequent attempts (e.g., aducanumab, lecanemab) have produced mixed results; aducanumab received accelerated approval in 2021 amid controversy, while lecanemab gained full approval in 2023 with modest slowing of cognitive decline and a high cost‑benefit debate.  
- **Oncology “incremental” agents:** Many kinase inhibitors approved after 2012 have shown limited survival benefit compared with existing standards, reinforcing the author’s point about modest incremental gains in some cases.

### Marketing vs. R&D spend  
- **Industry financial reports** (e.g., 2023 annual reports of the top 10 pharma companies) show **R&D budgets consistently larger than promotional/marketing expenses** on a consolidated basis (often 2–3× higher). The author’s claim that marketing dwarfs R&D is not supported by the data.  
- **Shift to value‑based contracts:** Since 2015, payers have increasingly tied reimbursement to real‑world outcomes, reducing the pure price‑inflation power of marketing.

### Policy proposals  
- **Prize‑based incentives:** The U.S. Senate’s “Innovation Prize” concept (Bill S.1137) never advanced beyond committee discussion. No large‑scale prize system for drugs has been implemented in the United States or Europe.  
- **Regulatory funding:** The European Medicines Agency (EMA) continues to rely on a mix of EU budget contributions and industry fees; no major shift to fully public funding has occurred.  
- **“Too many low‑value approvals”:** The FDA’s “Accelerated Approval” pathway and “Breakthrough Therapy” designation have been scrutinized, leading to tighter post‑marketing study requirements (e.g., the 2020 FDA Reauthorization Act).  

### Overall industry trajectory  
- **Revenue growth:** Global pharmaceutical sales grew from **≈$1.2 trillion (2012)** to **≈$1.5 trillion (2024)**, driven largely by biologics and specialty drugs.  
- **Consolidation:** M&A activity accelerated, with several megadeals (e.g., Pfizer’s acquisition of Wyeth, Bayer’s purchase of Monsanto) reshaping the landscape.  
- **Public perception:** Trust in pharma dipped during the COVID‑19 vaccine rollout (concerns about speed, safety, and pricing) but rebounded somewhat as real‑world effectiveness data accumulated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2012 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Most new drugs are “me‑too” with little clinical benefit.** | Partially true. A large share of approvals are incremental, especially in chronic‑disease classes. However, the period 2012‑2026 also saw several **first‑in‑class, high‑impact therapies** (immune‑checkpoint inhibitors, CAR‑T, mRNA vaccines, gene therapies). |
| **Drug‑development cost is only ~$43 M; industry inflates numbers to gain protection.** | False. Independent cost analyses have consistently placed the **societal cost in the low‑billion‑dollar range**. The $43 M figure is now widely regarded as a severe underestimate. |
| **Marketing budgets exceed R&D spend, driving drug prices.** | Incorrect. Public financial disclosures show **R&D budgets exceed marketing** for the major companies, though marketing remains a sizable expense. |
| **Regulatory capture via user‑fees is a major problem; public funding would solve it.** | No major policy shift has occurred. The EMA still uses industry fees; the FDA’s user‑fee model persists, though there are ongoing debates about conflict‑of‑interest safeguards. |
| **Large cash‑prize system (Bill S.1137) would replace patents and lower prices.** | The bill stalled; **no prize‑based system has been adopted**. Patents remain the primary incentive mechanism. |
| **Cancer drugs will continue to deliver only modest survival extensions.** | Largely accurate for many kinase inhibitors, but **immune‑checkpoint inhibitors and CAR‑T** have produced **significant, sometimes durable, survival benefits** in several cancers. |
| **Alzheimer’s therapies will continue to fail.** | Mostly true; **most antibody and secretase programs failed**. However, **lecanemab** (2023) achieved modest clinical benefit and received approval, indicating a tentative breakthrough. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a vivid, skeptical snapshot of the 2012 debate over drug‑development economics and remains relevant for understanding ongoing tensions (cost estimates, incremental versus breakthrough therapies, and policy proposals). Its polemical style limits scholarly value, but the issues it raises continue to shape industry‑policy discussions.
