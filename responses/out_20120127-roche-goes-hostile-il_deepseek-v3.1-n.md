# Roche Goes Hostile for Illumina (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Roche's unsolicited hostile takeover bid for Illumina, a San Diego-based gene-sequencing company that was a major player in the race to make whole-genome sequencing faster and cheaper. As both a large pharmaceutical and diagnostics company, Roche saw strategic value in acquiring sequencing capabilities. However, the piece highlights significant skepticism from industry observers, including Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher, who favored partnerships over acquisitions in this space.

The author raises concerns about the risks Roche would inherit: sequencing technology was evolving rapidly in a "can-you-top-this" competitive environment, creating the risk that purchased technology could become obsolete before generating returns. Additionally, there were questions about whether the sequencing market would grow as quickly as anticipated. These weren't just Roche's problems to solve—they were risks inherent to the entire sequencing field that any acquirer would absorb.

## 2. HISTORY

**Roche's Failed Takeover Attempt:**
Roche initiated a hostile tender offer in January 2012 at $44.50 per share (approximately $5.7 billion), which Illumina's board rejected as inadequate. Roche raised the offer to $51.00 per share in March 2012 ($6.8 billion), but Illumina continued to resist. In April 2012, Roche withdrew its bid after failing to secure sufficient shareholder support, with Illumina successfully arguing the offer undervalued the company's growth prospects.

**Illumina's Subsequent Trajectory:**
Illumina not only survived but thrived as an independent company. From 2012 to 2020, the company became the dominant player in DNA sequencing, with its technology used in the majority of sequencing worldwide. The company's market capitalization grew from roughly $6-7 billion during the takeover attempt to peaks of over $75 billion in 2021, representing more than a tenfold increase.

**Clinical and Commercial Impact:**
Whole-genome sequencing did achieve significant cost reductions from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars, but the immediate clinical market developed differently than pure sequencing volume might suggest. Major growth areas included non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), oncology diagnostics, rare disease diagnosis, and pharmacogenomics. The sequencing market evolved to emphasize targeted panels and clinical interpretation rather than just raw sequencing throughput.

**FDA and Regulatory Developments:**
The FDA began approving sequencing-based tests around 2013-2014, including Illumina's MiSeqDx platform. However, broad clinical adoption faced reimbursement challenges and the need for clinical utility evidence, which developed more slowly than the pure technological advances.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Sequencing technology evolution risk** - The article suggested Roche might buy technology that would be "superseded before it has time to pay off" in the rapidly evolving sequencing field.
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While sequencing technology continued advancing, Illumina maintained dominance through continuous innovation and platform upgrades. However, new competitors like Oxford Nanopore and PacBio emerged with different technological approaches, creating ongoing competitive pressure.

• **Prediction: Market growth uncertainty** - The article questioned whether "the market for sequencing doesn't get as large, as quickly, as you're hoping."
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. The sequencing market did grow substantially over the subsequent decade, but the timing and nature differed from early expectations. Clinical adoption was slower than technological capability, with complex factors like reimbursement, interpretation, and clinical utility governing pace.

• **Prediction: Acquisition risks** - Implicit suggestion that buying at $5.7-6.8 billion might be overpaying for unproven market potential.
  - **Outcome**: Inaccurate from a valuation perspective. Illumina's market value grew dramatically beyond the acquisition price, suggesting Roche's offer significantly undervalued the company. However, Illumina faced increased competition and margin pressure in later years.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment where a major pharma company correctly identified the strategic importance of sequencing technology but misjudged the valuation and execution approach. The failed takeover attempt highlights both the transformative potential of genomic sequencing and the difficulty of valuing rapidly evolving technology platforms. The case study illustrates broader themes about technology lifecycles, market timing, and the challenge large companies face when trying to acquire innovation.
