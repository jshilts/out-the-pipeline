# The Novartis Way (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2005 commentary analyzes a Wall Street Journal article about Novartis's research center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, led by director Mark Fishman. The article highlighted Fishman's genomic-based drug discovery strategy, which differed significantly from traditional pharmaceutical industry approaches. Fishman prioritized diseases based on genetic tractability rather than market size, drawing inspiration from the Gleevec success story. The approach included studying rare diseases like multiple sclerosis and conducting more targeted clinical trials with smaller patient subgroups identified through genetic markers. The author expressed cautious skepticism about both strategies, noting that genomic targets might lead to expensive niche drugs with limited markets, while the biomarker-driven trial design faced validation challenges that could be as costly as drug development itself. The commentary positioned Novartis as pioneering approaches that other companies were watching but not yet adopting.

## 2. HISTORY

In the two decades following this article, Novartis's genomic-focused strategy proved remarkably prescient and successful. The company became a leader in targeted therapies, particularly in oncology, where precision medicine became the standard of care. Multiple sclerosis treatments became a major therapeutic area for Novartis, with drugs like Gilenya (fingolimod), approved by the FDA in 2010, achieving blockbuster status and demonstrating that the company's focus on this relatively niche area could yield substantial commercial success.

Novartis's targeted approach to cancer treatment continued to build on concepts like Gleevec, with subsequent approvals including targeted therapies for specific genetic subtypes of cancer. The company's investment in genomics and personalized medicine positioned it well for the era of companion diagnostics and biomarker-driven drug development.

The broader pharmaceutical industry largely followed the path Fishman pioneered, with precision medicine and biomarker-stratified clinical trials becoming standard practice by the 2020s. However, the validation challenges the author noted proved accurate—developing robust biomarkers and companion diagnostics did require substantial investment, and many companies struggled with the regulatory complexity of co-developing drugs with diagnostic tests. Patient stratification eventually became feasible for many diseases as genomic sequencing costs plummeted and biomarkers were validated for various conditions including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and some cardiovascular conditions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Genomic strategy being "either a big winner or big loser"**: The genomic strategy proved to be a clear winner. Novartis successfully translated genetic insights into multiple approved therapies, particularly in oncology and immunology, validating the approach that initially seemed risky in 2005.

• **Concern that deciphering genomic targets would lead to drugs for very few people with high price tags**: This prediction proved partially accurate but commercially viable. While targeted therapies do serve smaller patient populations and carry high prices, the orphan drug market expanded dramatically. Rather than being a limitation, the focus on genetic diseases led to premium pricing models and regulatory incentives that made these drugs highly profitable. However, the high price concern became a major social and policy issue in subsequent years.

• **Prediction that smaller, genetically-stratified trials would face biomarker validation challenges and cost as much as drug development**: This concern was well-founded. While biomarker-driven trials did become standard, the validation of genetic markers remained expensive and complex until advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics made genetic profiling more routine. The challenge of incorrectly stratifying patients also persisted, highlighting the ongoing importance of robust biomarker validation.

• **Implicit prediction that other companies would let Novartis pioneer these approaches first**: Other companies did follow, but more slowly. Novartis's early investment gave it a competitive advantage in precision medicine, though by the 2010s most major pharmaceutical companies had adopted similar strategies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable foresight in identifying both the promise and challenges of genomics-driven drug development, accurately predicting many of the tensions that would define pharmaceutical R&D for the next two decades while correctly identifying a winning strategy despite initial industry skepticism.
