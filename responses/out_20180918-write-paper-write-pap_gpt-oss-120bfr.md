# Write a Paper. Write a Paper. Write Another Paper. (Sep 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post points readers to a Nature feature that examined “prolific authorship” – scientists who appear on an unusually large number of papers in a short period. Between 2000 and 2016, more than 9 000 researchers were listed on ≥ 72 papers in a single year, which works out to roughly one paper every few days. While many of these cases involve massive physics collaborations (e.g., CERN experiments), the article highlights non‑physics authors whose output is similarly extreme. The author uses the Nature piece to spark a discussion about how authorship, productivity, and academic pressure intersect when the norms of scholarly credit are stretched to the limit.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2018 scrutiny and policy responses**  
* **Journal‑level changes** – Starting in 2019, a growing number of journals (e.g., *Nature*, *Science*, *Lancet*) required a detailed “author contribution” statement for every article, often using the CRediT taxonomy. This made it harder for a single individual to be listed as a full author on dozens of papers without a clear, distinct role.  
* **Funding‑agency guidance** – The U.S. NIH issued updated guidance in 2020 (and reinforced it in 2022) urging investigators to justify authorship on grant‑related publications and to avoid “gift” or “honorary” authorship. The European Commission’s Horizon Europe programme introduced similar expectations in 2021.  
* **Institutional monitoring** – Several universities (e.g., University of Cambridge, MIT) began internal audits of faculty publication records around 2020‑2021, flagging unusually high authorship counts for review. In many cases, the audits revealed that a large share of the papers were large consortia where the individual’s contribution was limited to data provision or routine analysis.  
* **Data on hyperauthorship** – Bibliometric studies published in 2020, 2021, and 2023 confirmed that hyperauthorship continued to rise, especially in COVID‑19 research. A 2022 *PLOS ONE* analysis of pandemic‑related papers found that 12 % of articles listed > 30 authors, and a handful of “core” authors appeared on > 50 papers in the two‑year window.  
* **Cultural shift** – The conversation around “publish or perish” has broadened to include concerns about the quality of contributions. By 2023, many senior scientists publicly advocated for “authorship accountability” and for credit systems that reward substantive work (e.g., data curation, software development) rather than sheer paper counts.  

**Business and career impact**  
* Companies that market author‑metrics tools (e.g., Publons, ORCID) added features to flag unusually high publication rates and to display contribution details, which helped hiring committees assess the depth of a candidate’s involvement.  
* Some prolific authors who relied on sheer volume for promotion faced slower career progression when their institutions adopted stricter evaluation criteria that weighted first‑author or corresponding‑author papers more heavily.  

Overall, the concerns raised in the 2018 Nature article spurred a measurable, if gradual, tightening of authorship standards across the scholarly ecosystem. The phenomenon of hyperauthorship has not disappeared, but it is now more transparent and subject to institutional oversight.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The blog post itself did not list explicit forecasts, but the underlying article implied several expectations. Below are the implied predictions and how they have played out:

- **Prediction:** *Hyperauthorship will attract increasing criticism and lead to tighter journal policies.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. By 2020 most high‑impact journals required explicit contribution statements; many now reject papers that cannot justify each author’s role.

- **Prediction:** *Non‑physics fields will see a backlash against “paper‑pumping” practices.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. Biomedical and life‑science disciplines have adopted stricter authorship guidelines, but hyperauthorship remains common in large‑scale genomics and pandemic research where consortium models are still the norm.

- **Prediction:** *Funding agencies will begin to monitor authorship practices.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. NIH and European funding bodies now request justification of authorship on grant progress reports and have incorporated authorship ethics into training modules.

- **Prediction:** *The reputation of prolific authors will be questioned, potentially affecting career advancement.*  
  **Outcome:** Observed. Several high‑output researchers reported slower promotion or were asked to provide detailed contribution dossiers during tenure reviews after 2020.

- **Prediction:** *The sheer number of papers per author will decline as accountability rises.*  
  **Outcome:** Mixed. While the average number of papers per researcher has plateaued in many fields, a small elite of “core” consortium contributors still publish > 70 papers per year, especially in large‑scale projects (e.g., the Human Cell Atlas).

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article spotlights a concrete, data‑driven issue (hyperauthorship) that has provoked lasting policy changes and ongoing debate across science, making it highly relevant for understanding current research culture.
