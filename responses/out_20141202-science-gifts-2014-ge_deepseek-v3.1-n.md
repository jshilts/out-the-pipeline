# Science Gifts 2014: General Books (and More) on Chemistry (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a holiday gift guide for science and chemistry-themed books published by Science magazine's blog. The author recommends Theodore Gray's popular chemistry books, including *The Elements* and the newly released *Molecules*, along with various companion products like puzzles, cards, calendars, and apps. The guide also includes other notable chemistry and science books such as *The Disappearing Spoon*, *Periodic Tales*, *Napoleon's Buttons*, poison-themed books like *The Poisoner's Handbook*, and memoirs including Oliver Sacks' *Uncle Tungsten* and Primo Levi's *The Periodic Table*. The article notes that Amazon affiliate links are included.

## 2. HISTORY
Theodore Gray's chemistry book series continued beyond the 2014 recommendations. His third book in the planned trilogy, *Reactions: An Illustrated Exploration of Elements, Molecules, and Change in the Universe*, was published in 2017, completing the trilogy that began with *The Elements* (2009) and *Molecules* (2014). Gray's interactive iPad and iPhone apps accompanying his books maintained popularity in educational contexts. The other books mentioned in the article generally maintained their status in the popular chemistry literature. Sam Kean's *The Disappearing Spoon* (2010) and Deborah Blum's *The Poisoner's Handbook* (2010) continued to be widely read and referenced in popular science education. Primitive accumulation of wealth for the author through Amazon affiliate links has proven modest. The biology-based recommendations filled a clear market demand for accessible scientific literacy materials, as these titles helped make chemistry more approachable for general audiences during the subsequent years.
