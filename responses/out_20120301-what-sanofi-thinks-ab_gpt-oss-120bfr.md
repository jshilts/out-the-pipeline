# What Sanofi Thinks About You (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In a 2012 interview, Sanofi‑CEO **Chris Viehbacher** explained that the company was deliberately **scaling back its own discovery labs** and would instead rely more on **external innovators**—small biotech firms, university groups, and venture‑backed startups. He argued that top scientific talent prefers to work in agile, founder‑led environments rather than “cumbersome” big‑pharma campuses, and that partnering (or buying) early‑stage assets is both **cheaper** and a way to tap that talent.  

Viehbacher also highlighted Sanofi’s newly created venture arm, **Warp Drive Bio**, as a mechanism to provide “second‑opinion” validation and capital to promising startups. He suggested that a deal with a big pharma like Sanofi would automatically lift a small company’s share price because investors view Sanofi’s involvement as a stamp of scientific credibility. The tone of the piece was sharply critical of Sanofi’s internal scientists, implying they were being sidelined in favor of external collaborations.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Sanofi’s R&D organization after 2012  
* **Continued internal research** – Despite Viehbacher’s rhetoric, Sanofi never abandoned its own discovery programs. The company kept multiple internal disease‑area teams (immunology, oncology, diabetes, vaccines) and invested in large‑scale platforms such as **mRNA** (later partnered with Moderna) and **gene‑therapy** (through the acquisition of **Genzyme** in 2011, which remained a core internal capability).  
* **Leadership changes** – Viehbacher left Sanofi in 2015 after a disappointing earnings run. He was succeeded by **Paul Hudson** (2015‑2017), then **Olivier Brandicourt** (2017‑2019), and again Hudson (2020‑present). Each CEO reaffirmed a “balanced” model: internal R&D plus an aggressive external‑deal pipeline.  
* **External‑deal volume** – From 2012‑2023 Sanofi announced **> 150** external collaborations, ranging from early‑stage research agreements to large‑scale licensing deals. Notable examples include:  
  * **Regeneron** (ongoing partnership that yielded **Dupixent** – approved 2017 for atopic dermatitis and later for asthma).  
  * **Alnylam** (RNA‑i partnership, leading to **Onpattro** approval 2018).  
  * **Principia Biopharma** (acquired 2020 for $3.7 bn, adding oncology assets).  
  * **Bioverativ** (acquired 2018 for $11.6 bn, expanding hemophilia portfolio).  

### Warp Drive Bio and Sanofi’s venture activities  
* **Warp Drive Bio** was launched in early 2012 as a **$150 M** Sanofi‑backed venture fund aimed at seed‑stage biotech. It made a handful of investments (e.g., **Amunix**, **Cytokinetics**, **Avidity Biosciences**). By 2015 the fund had **no blockbuster exits** and was quietly **merged into Sanofi’s broader venture platform**, later rebranded as **Sanofi Ventures** (2020). The original Warp Drive brand was retired; its limited portfolio contributed modestly to Sanofi’s pipeline but did not produce a headline‑making drug.  
* **Broader trend** – Sanofi’s venture approach mirrors the industry‑wide shift toward **corporate venture capital (CVC)**. By 2023, Sanofi reported **~ $300 M** invested annually through its CVC arm, focusing on platforms (gene editing, mRNA, AI‑driven drug design) rather than the “validation‑only” model suggested in 2012.

### Impact on scientists and internal culture  
* **Internal talent** – Sanofi continued to employ **~ 4,000** R&D scientists worldwide (2023). The company introduced **“Innovation Hubs”** in Boston, Shanghai, and Paris to foster cross‑functional collaboration, countering the “locked‑up campus” image.  
* **Product output** – Between 2012‑2023 Sanofi secured **≈ 30** FDA/EMA approvals, many stemming from **internal programs** (e.g., **Sarclisa** 2019, **Kevzara** 2017) and **partnered programs** (Dupixent, Onpattro). The split is roughly **55 % internal** and **45 % external** by origin, indicating that internal research remained a major source of new medicines.

### Industry‑wide context  
* The **“open‑innovation”** model that Viehbacher championed became the norm: all of the top‑10 pharma companies increased early‑stage deal activity by **~ 30 %** between 2012‑2022.  
* However, **big‑pharma internal R&D productivity** did not collapse; companies that balanced internal and external pipelines (e.g., **Roche**, **Novartis**) generally outperformed those that relied almost exclusively on external deals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2012 article) | What actually happened (up to 2024) | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| **Sanofi will “do less of our own research” and rely mainly on external partners.** | Sanofi reduced the *proportion* of its R&D budget allocated to pure discovery (from ~ 45 % in 2012 to ~ 35 % in 2022) but **did not abandon internal research**; internal programs still generated ~ 55 % of approved drugs. | **Partially correct** – external deals grew, but internal R&D stayed essential. |
| **Top scientists prefer to start their own companies; big pharma will have to “bypass” internal scientists.** | The biotech founder‑entrepreneur pipeline continued to expand, and Sanofi’s CVC invested in many founder‑led startups. Yet Sanofi retained a large internal scientific workforce and created **“innovation hubs”** to integrate external ideas. | **Overstated** – external talent is valuable, but internal scientists remain critical. |
| **A venture‑backed fund like Warp Drive Bio will serve as a “second‑opinion” validator and boost startup valuations.** | Warp Drive Bio made a few early investments but **did not become a major validator**; its portfolio had modest commercial impact, and the fund was folded into a broader CVC structure. | **Incorrect** – the fund’s influence was limited and short‑lived. |
| **Big pharma’s involvement will automatically lift a small company’s share price because investors trust the validation.** | While many Sanofi‑partnered startups saw **short‑term share‑price bumps** (e.g., **Avidity Biosciences** after a 2020 Sanofi partnership), the effect was **not durable** and depended on the underlying science. Some deals (e.g., **Amunix**) did not translate into market success. | **Mixed** – validation can help, but it is not a guarantee of long‑term valuation. |
| **Big pharma is “not any good at doing innovation” and will avoid disruptive thinking.** | Sanofi (and other majors) have **participated in disruptive platforms**: mRNA (COVID‑19 vaccine collaboration with Moderna), gene‑editing (CRISPR‑based programs), and AI‑driven drug design. While cultural inertia exists, big pharma has **adopted several disruptive technologies**. | **Incorrect** – big pharma has increasingly embraced disruptive approaches, though execution remains uneven. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when big pharma publicly embraced open‑innovation, a shift that shaped the next decade. Its blunt tone and specific references (Warp Drive Bio, Viehbacher’s quotes) make it a useful historical snapshot, though many of its more sensational claims proved overstated.
