# Not Looking So Good At Eli Lilly (or AstraZeneca) (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary warned that the “patent cliff” would hit Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca hardest of the major pharma firms.  A Bernstein analysis cited by the author suggested that, after adjusting for 2010‑level “base” revenues, Lilly could lose up to **50 % of its sales** as its top drugs (e.g., Cymbalta, Zyprexa) went off‑patent, while AstraZeneca faced a similar erosion of revenue from its own blockbusters.  The piece argued that neither company had enough late‑stage pipeline to offset the loss, and that the only realistic way out would be **acquisition**—either buying another company or being bought themselves.  By contrast, the author noted that Pfizer’s CEO was contemplating a “core‑only” divestiture, but that even this strategy looked risky.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Eli Lilly**  
- **Revenue rebound:** After the 2011 cliff, Lilly’s sales fell modestly (≈ 5 % YoY in 2012) but recovered quickly thanks to new launches.  The GLP‑1 agonist **Trulicity** (dulaglutide) received FDA approval in 2014 and grew to > $5 bn annual sales by 2020.  Other late‑stage products—**Verzenio** (ribociclib, 2017) for breast cancer, **Olumiant** (baricitinib, 2018) for rheumatoid arthritis, and **Emgality** (galcanezumab, 2018) for migraine—added sizable revenue streams.  
- **Strategic acquisitions:** Rather than being bought, Lilly pursued its own acquisitions: **Loxo Oncology** (2019, $8 bn) added the KRAS‑G12C inhibitor sotorasib (Lumakras, 2021); **Prevail Therapeutics** (2020) and **AstraZeneca’s oncology assets** (2020‑2021) expanded its pipeline.  
- **Current position:** As of 2024, Lilly reports > $28 bn in annual revenue, with a diversified portfolio spanning diabetes, oncology, immunology, and neuroscience.  The feared 50 % collapse never materialised.

**AstraZeneca**  
- **Pivot to oncology & immunology:** AstraZeneca’s legacy blockbusters (e.g., Seroquel, Crestor) did lose patent protection, but the company deliberately shifted focus.  **Tagrisso** (osimertinib, 2015) and **Lynparza** (olaparib, 2014) became best‑in‑class cancer drugs, together generating > $10 bn in sales by 2022.  **Imfinzi** (durvalumab, 2017) and **Fasenra** (benralizumab, 2017) added immuno‑oncology and respiratory strength.  
- **Major acquisitions:** AstraZeneca bought **MedImmune** (2007) and later **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** (2020, $39 bn), the latter providing the complement inhibitor **Soliris** and a pipeline of rare‑disease assets.  These moves reinforced the oncology‑centric strategy rather than a desperate “sell‑off.”  
- **Financial outcome:** Revenue grew from ≈ $30 bn in 2011 to > $44 bn in 2023, with oncology accounting for > 50 % of sales.  The company was never acquired.

**Pfizer (contextual note)**  
- Pfizer eventually **spun off** its legacy “up‑john” drug business in 2020 (forming Viatris) and sold its consumer‑health division to GSK in 2019, aligning with the “core‑only” idea mentioned in the article.  The divestitures were completed, but the company also pursued blockbuster biotech deals (e.g., **Seagen** acquisition, 2023) to offset the loss of older patents.

Overall, the dire predictions for Lilly and AstraZeneca proved inaccurate; both firms survived the patent cliff, re‑engineered their pipelines, and avoided acquisition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the 2011 article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Lilly would need to acquire or be acquired** to survive the loss of up to 50 % of sales. | Lilly **was not acquired**; instead it **acquired** several biotech firms (Loxo, Prevail) and launched new blockbusters that restored growth. | **Incorrect** – the company remained independent and grew. |
| **AstraZeneca faced a similar fate and would likely need to be bought or buy another company**. | AstraZeneca **was not bought**; it **acquired** Alexion (2020) and other assets, becoming a leading oncology player. | **Incorrect** – the firm stayed autonomous and expanded via acquisitions. |
| **Pfizer’s “core‑only” divestiture would make its situation look even worse**. | Pfizer did **divest** its legacy drug and consumer‑health units (2020, 2019) and later **added** high‑growth biotech assets (e.g., Seagen, 2023). The net effect was mixed but the company remained one of the world’s largest pharma firms. | **Partially correct** – the divestiture reduced legacy revenue, but subsequent biotech deals mitigated the impact. |
| **The “patent cliff” would be a decisive, near‑term threat to the two companies’ survival**. | Both companies weathered the cliff by **re‑orienting pipelines** and **launching new high‑margin drugs**; no existential crisis occurred. | **Incorrect** – the threat was real but not fatal. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment (the early‑2010s patent cliff) and raises questions that remain relevant, but its predictions were off‑the‑mark and the piece lacks lasting analytical depth.
