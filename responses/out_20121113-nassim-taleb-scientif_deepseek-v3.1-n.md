# Nassim Taleb on Scientific Discovery (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The blog post discusses Nassim Taleb's paper "Understanding is a Poor Substitute for Convexity (Antifragility)," applying his concepts to pharmaceutical research. The article frames Taleb's distinction between two narratives of scientific progress: planned, goal-directed discovery versus serendipitous, luck-based breakthroughs.

Taleb argues that in complex, nonlinear fields like drug discovery, most advances come from "optionality" and convexity bias rather than teleological planning. Convexity means having asymmetric payoffs where successful experiments yield large gains while failures cost relatively little. This allows researchers to "harvest randomness" through broad experimentation. Taleb proposes seven principles for research design: (1) focus on improving payoff ratios over gathering knowledge; (2) maximize the number of trials; (3) maintain flexibility with short-term options; (4) invest in people with adaptability rather than compelling narratives; (5) prioritize tinkering and practice over theory; (6) avoid complexity bias; (7) value negative results as information. The author connects this to pharmaceutical R&D's fundamental structure of embracing risk and frequent failure to achieve occasional transformative successes.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2012 blog post appeared when Taleb's *Antifragile* was newly published, and pharmaceutical R&D productivity was under scrutiny. Since then, several relevant developments have occurred:

**Clinical Success Rates**: Drug development success rates have remained broadly consistent with Taleb's framework. Published analyses show ~10% overall success rates from Phase I to approval through the 2010s. Notably, oncology drugs had lower success rates (~3-5%), while rare disease drugs showed higher rates (~17-25%), consistent with optionality principles operating in specialized domains.

**Portfolio Strategy Impact**: Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly adopted portfolio approaches resembling Taleb's recommendations. Pfizer, Novartis, and Roche have publicly described strategies emphasizing breadth in early-stage research, managing risk through diversification rather than prediction. Novartis's "venture fund" approach to internal projects illustrates optionality principles.

**Clinical Trial Costs**: The asymmetry Taleb identified has worsened. By 2021, average Phase III trial costs exceeded $20-50 million, while discovery costs remained relatively stable. This increased convexity should theoretically favor broad early-stage experimentation, though industry consolidation has constrained this effect.

**Academia-Industry Dynamics**: The rise of academic drug discovery centers and biotech startups since 2012 reflects Taleb's emphasis on distributed experimentation. Stanford's SPARK program and similar initiatives explicitly embrace "failure-tolerant" tinkering. However, NIH funding has increasingly favored hypothesis-driven research over exploratory screening, partially contradicting Taleb's principles.

**Technological Enablers**: High-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry have expanded the "number of trials" Taleb recommended. CRISPR-based functional genomics, developed after 2012, allows massively parallel tinkering. These technologies enable lowering cost-per-experiment, directly implementing Taleb's rule 1.

**Regulatory Evolution**: FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation (2012) and adaptive trial designs acknowledge the value of optionality by allowing course corrections without restarting trials. Real-world evidence integration similarly preserves flexibility. These changes align with Taleb's emphasis on maintaining optionality over time.

**Biotech Investment Patterns**: Venture capital in biotech has shifted toward platform companies with broad optionality rather than single-asset narratives. Companies like Moderna (pre-pandemic) and Editas Medicine exemplified investing in adaptable platforms over specific products. The mRNA vaccine breakthrough represented the kind of asymmetric payoff Taleb described, emerging from decades of broad exploration rather than targeted COVID-specific R&D.

**Critiques and Limits**: The precision medicine movement partly contradicts Taleb's anti-narrative stance, emphasizing biomarker-guided selection. Immunotherapy successes (CAR-T, checkpoint inhibitors) combined targeted biological understanding with serendipitous clinical observations, suggesting a synthesis of approaches rather than pure optionality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Taleb's/Author's Predictions**:

• **Prediction**: "Research payoffs are very nonlinear... we need to make our nets as wide as possible" 
  - *Outcome*: Confirmed. The rise of platform companies (CRISPR therapeutics, antibody-drug conjugates) and portfolio approaches reflects this. However, industry consolidation limited pure breadth, favoring depth in specific therapeutic areas.

• **Prediction**: Lower cost-per-experiment improves payoff ratios better than predictive knowledge
  - *Outcome*: Mixed. While screening technologies have dramatically lowered costs (e.g., DNA synthesis: $3.60/base in 2012 → $0.10/base in 2020), precision medicine has demonstrated that predictive biomarkers can massively improve success rates, suggesting knowledge and cost reduction are complementary.

• **Prediction**: M&A activity "has been harmful to the intellectual ecosystem" by reducing experimental diversity
  - *Outcome*: Partially confirmed. Biotech startup creation remained robust (funding increased from ~$5B in 2012 to $28B in 2020), but post-acquisition innovation patterns show integration often eliminated competing approaches, reducing the overall experimental portfolio.

• **Prediction**: "Theory comes out of practice, rather than practice coming out of theory"
  - *Outcome*: Confirmed in key examples. mRNA vaccines (developed empirically) succeeded where theoretical understanding was incomplete. CRISPR applications emerged from basic mechanistic understanding combined with extensive tinkering. However, rational drug design has succeeded in kinase inhibitors and antibody engineering, showing convergence of approaches.

• **Prediction**: Adaptive, short-term options are "vastly more valuable than a single five-year option"
  - *Outcome*: Confirmed by industry practice. FDA adaptive trial guidance (2019) and platform trial designs (e.g., I-SPY2) institutionalize this. Pharma pipeline management has shifted toward stage-gate models with frequent kill decisions.

• **Prediction**: Negative results have unrecognized value
  - *Outcome*: Slowly developing. Publication bias remains strong, but initiatives like ClinicalTrials.gov results database (expanded 2016) and company-level transparency (Pfizer's data access portal 2013+) acknowledge this value. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly leverage internal failure databases.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

The article occupies the 70-79th percentile of interest for its prescient framing of pharmaceutical R&D strategy and its influence on subsequent thinking in drug discovery. While originally a commentary on Taleb's specific paper, it articulated principles that became increasingly relevant as the industry grappled with productivity challenges and embraced platform technologies. The synthesis of financial/convexity concepts with laboratory practice proved conceptually innovative and predictive of strategic shifts in both industrial R&D organization and regulatory philosophy.
