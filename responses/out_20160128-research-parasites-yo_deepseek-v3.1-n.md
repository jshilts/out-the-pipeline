# Research Parasites, You're OK By Me (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article responds to backlash over a controversial editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that coined the term "research parasites" — apparently referring to researchers who re-analyze data generated by others. Jeffrey Drazen, NEJM's editor-in-chief, published a follow-up clarifying the journal's position. 

Drazen's clarification affirmed NEJM's commitment to data sharing, particularly for clinical trials, stating there's a "moral obligation to the people who volunteer to participate in these trials to ensure that their data are widely and responsibly used." The journal announced it would require authors to share underlying data within 6 months of publication when appropriate systems exist. Drazen explicitly acknowledged that "researchers who analyze data collected by others can substantially improve human health."

## 2. HISTORY

The "research parasites" controversy became a watershed moment for data sharing in medicine and science. In the years following 2016, several major developments occurred:

**Immediate Aftermath (2016-2017):**
The controversy catalyzed broader discussions, and Drazen's clarification aligned with the ICMJE policy requiring data sharing statements for clinical trials submitted after July 1, 2018.

**Policy Changes:**
- NIH strengthened data sharing requirements, mandating Data Management and Sharing Plans for most funded research (effective January 2023)
- Many journals adopted stricter data availability policies
- Clinical trial registries expanded, and requirements for results reporting became more stringent

**Institutional Evolution:**
- Academic institutions developed data repositories and sharing infrastructure
- Platforms like ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com (industry-sponsored) and dbGaP (NIH) grew significantly
- The FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) gained widespread adoption across biomedical research

**Real-world Impact:**
By 2020-2024, data sharing became increasingly normalized in biomedical research, though implementation varies by field, funder, and journal. Clinical trials data sharing faced initial resistance due to patient privacy concerns, but platforms emerged to facilitate controlled access. Secondary analyses have contributed to meta-analyses, validation studies, and occasionally revealed issues requiring trial corrections.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself didn't make explicit predictions, but the controversy highlighted underlying tensions about data sharing norms in medicine. Drazen's clarification suggested that:
- Data sharing would become standard practice, which largely materialized for clinical trials data
- Secondary analyses would improve human health, which meta-analyses and pooled datasets have indeed advanced
- The controversy would prompt policy implementation, which occurred through ICMJE and expanded institutional requirements

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when a major medical journal clumsily coined a derogatory term then had to walk it back, highlighting broader cultural shifts toward open science. The incident accelerated momentum for data sharing policies, but the topic is somewhat specialized.
