# GE Healthcare's Idiotic Libel Suit (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses GE Healthcare filing a libel lawsuit against Danish physician Henrik Thomsen for a conference presentation he gave in Oxford two years prior, in which he presented findings suggesting an association between GE's gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent Omniscan and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a serious kidney condition. Despite regulatory authorities in the UK and Europe having already issued warnings about Omniscan's use in patients with kidney problems, and an FDA advisory panel in the US recommending special warnings for Omniscan and related gadolinium complexes, GE persisted with the lawsuit seeking damages for defamation.

The author contextualizes this case within England's controversial libel laws, which heavily favor plaintiffs, and compares it to another prominent case where author Simon Singh was being sued by the British Chiropractic Association for calling their treatment claims "bogus." The article criticizes both GE's corporate strategy of using litigation against scientific critics and the broader issue of England's libel laws being used to suppress scientific debate. The author expresses hope that Thomsen would win his case and that efforts to reform British libel laws would succeed.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Thomsen Case:** GE Healthcare eventually dropped the libel lawsuit against Dr. Henrik Thomsen. The case became a prominent example of what critics called "libel tourism" and contributed to significant public discussion about scientific freedom and corporate intimidation tactics.

**Omniscan Safety Issues:** Subsequent developments strongly validated Thomsen's concerns. The FDA did implement stricter warnings and contraindications for gadolinium-based contrast agents, particularly Omniscan and other linear agents, restricting their use in patients with kidney impairment. Omniscan faced significant market restrictions and declining use, while other gadolinium agents with better safety profiles gained market share. The medical community widely accepted the association between certain gadolinium-based contrast agents and NSF.

**Regulatory Actions:** Both European and US regulators mandated black box warnings and usage restrictions for gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with renal impairment. These regulatory changes had substantial impact on clinical practice and led to changes in imaging protocols to minimize NSF risk.

**British Libel Law Reform:** The cases mentioned in the article, along with others, contributed to significant legal reform. The UK Parliament passed the Defamation Act 2013, which came into force in 2014. This legislation made several important changes to English libel law, including requiring claimants to show substantial harm, establishing a public interest defense, and making it harder to bring frivolous libel claims. The reforms were widely seen as addressing the issues raised in this article about using libel laws to suppress legitimate scientific debate.

**GE Healthcare's Approach:** The lawsuit against Thomsen proved to be a public relations liability for GE Healthcare and may have influenced the company's subsequent approach to handling scientific criticism of its products.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **That Thomsen should win his case:** ✓ **Largely correct** - While GE dropped the case rather than proceeding to a formal verdict, this outcome represented a practical victory for Thomsen and validated his position.

• **Regulatory warnings would continue/strengthen:** ✓ **Correct** - Both FDA and European regulators implemented stronger warnings and usage restrictions for gadolinium-based contrast agents, particularly Omniscan.

• **British libel laws needed reform:** ✓ **Correct** - The Defamation Act 2013 was passed, implementing significant reforms that addressed many of the concerns raised in the article about scientific speech and libel tourism.

• **Libel lawsuits are inappropriate venues for scientific disputes:** ✓ **Historical perspective supports this** - The eventual dropping of the case and subsequent legal reforms suggest this assessment was prescient.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addressed significant issues at the intersection of science, corporate responsibility, and legal reform that had lasting impact. The case contributed to international discussions about scientific freedom and led to concrete changes in both regulatory policy and legal frameworks, giving it enduring importance beyond the specific product concerns.
