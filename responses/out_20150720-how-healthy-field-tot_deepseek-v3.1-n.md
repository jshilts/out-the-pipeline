# How Healthy is the Field of Total Synthesis? (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The July 2015 article examines conflicting data about the health of total synthesis as a field within chemistry. The author notes that while papers with "total synthesis" in their titles show a steady increase across the entire scientific literature—reaching about 500 articles per year by 2011—there's a contrasting decline visible in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) starting around 2000. 

The article explores several explanations for this discrepancy: potential editorial policy changes at JACS; indexing variations in databases like PubMed; the need to normalize for the overall growth in scientific publishing volume; and the question of whether total synthesis papers are migrating from high-tier to lower-tier journals. The author expresses skepticism about total synthesis being "healthy," suggesting the apparent increase might be an artifact of publishing volume growth rather than genuine field vitality, and calls for more nuanced analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2015 article, several developments reshaped the landscape of chemical synthesis, though total synthesis's role continued evolving rather than disappearing:

**Methodology Evolution**: The field increasingly integrated new technologies, particularly machine learning and automation in synthesis planning. Computational approaches to retrosynthetic analysis became more sophisticated. The emergence of AI-driven platforms for reaction prediction and optimization changed how complex molecules were approached, though human expertise remained crucial for the most challenging targets.

**Alternative Approaches to Complex Molecules**: Engineered biosynthesis and metabolic pathway engineering gained traction as complements to purely synthetic approaches, particularly for complex natural products. Chemoenzymatic synthesis and biocatalysis became more prominent tools, sometimes offering more efficient routes than traditional total synthesis for certain molecular classes.

**Funding and Publication Trends**: High-profile total synthesis projects continued appearing in top-tier journals, though perhaps with different emphasis—more focus on efficiency, scalability, and biological evaluation rather than purely synthetic achievement. Grant funding in organic synthesis increasingly emphasized methodology development, sustainable chemistry, and practical applications over purely structure-based targets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article's main implicit predictions:**
• **Prediction**: Total synthesis publication trends likely reflected database artifacts and overall publishing growth rather than genuine field expansion.
**Evaluation**: Subsequent years showed that total synthesis adapted rather than declined. While the raw volume of traditional total synthesis papers may have declined proportionally, the field evolved toward more efficient, practical, and integrated approaches.

• **Prediction**: Papers might be moving "downmarket" from premier journals like JACS to lower-tier publications.
**Evaluation**: High-quality total synthesis work continued appearing in top-tier journals, though the criteria for publication evolved. The focus shifted somewhat toward synthesis with broader impact—biological targets, scalable methods, or innovative strategic approaches.

• **Prediction**: The field might not be as "healthy" as the raw publication numbers suggested.
**Evaluation**: The field demonstrated resilience by integrating new technologies and broadening its scope. Rather than declining, it transformed—becoming more interdisciplinary with computational chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article's interest lies in highlighting a methodological issue in assessing scientific field health through bibliometrics, rather than the specific fate of total synthesis itself. The broader relevance is how database artifacts and analysis choices can obscure genuine sector health, a caution relevant across many scientific fields. However, the article's scope is relatively narrow, focused on methodology over substantive developments in synthesis science.

This rating reflects that the article addresses an important meta-scientific issue (how we measure field vitality) but doesn't deeply explore the underlying reasons, broader implications, or policy relevance of the observed patterns.
