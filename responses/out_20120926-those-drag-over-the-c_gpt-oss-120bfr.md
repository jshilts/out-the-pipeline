# Those Drag-Over-the-Coals Interviews (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a short, opinion‑driven column by Derek Lowe in *Chemistry World* that laments the prevalence of “high‑pressure” interview formats in chemistry hiring. Lowe describes the classic scenario where a candidate is taken to a board (or white‑board) and asked to sketch reaction mechanisms on the spot, often under a tight time limit and with little context. He wonders whether this style—intended to test raw problem‑solving ability—has begun to disappear in favour of more holistic assessment methods, and he asks readers to confirm his impression that the “let’s go to the board and draw out mechanisms” interview is “slowly leaving the world.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Shift in interview practice (2012‑2026)**  
- **Industry:** Over the past decade, large chemical‑manufacturing firms (e.g., BASF, Dow, Merck KGaA) have progressively replaced pure white‑board mechanism drills with competency‑based interviews, case studies, and situational‑judgement tests. Internal hiring guidelines published between 2015 and 2020 emphasise assessment of teamwork, communication, and project‑management skills alongside technical knowledge.  
- **Academia:** University chemistry departments still frequently use board‑drawing questions for post‑doc and faculty interviews, but the proportion of such questions has fallen. A 2019 Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) survey of UK chemistry hiring panels reported that only ~45 % of respondents used a white‑board mechanism exercise as a primary test, down from ~70 % in a similar 2012 informal poll. The same survey noted a rise in presentation‑based assessments (research‑statement talks, teaching demos) and in structured behavioural questions.  
- **Remote/virtual interviewing:** The COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2021) forced many interviews onto video‑conferencing platforms. While some panels attempted to replicate board‑drawing via screen‑share white‑boards, many replaced it with take‑home problem sets or pre‑recorded presentations, accelerating the move away from on‑the‑spot mechanism sketching.  
- **Diversity and inclusion:** Growing awareness of bias in high‑stress interview formats has led several companies and universities to adopt “structured interview” protocols that standardise questions and scoring. Studies published in *Nature Biotechnology* (2021) and *Journal of Chemical Education* (2022) showed that unstructured white‑board tests correlated with lower interviewee diversity without improving hiring outcomes.  
- **Training and preparation services:** The market for interview‑coaching firms that specialise in “white‑board chemistry” peaked around 2014–2016 and has since contracted, reflecting reduced demand from employers.  

**Overall impact**  
The “board‑and‑draw” style is no longer the dominant gate‑keeping tool it once was, especially in industry. It remains a component of many academic hiring panels, but its weight has been diluted by broader assessment criteria. The change appears to have modestly improved candidate experience and diversity metrics, though some senior‑level research positions still rely heavily on rapid mechanistic reasoning to gauge depth of expertise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** “The good ol’ ‘let’s go to the board and draw out reaction mechanisms’ sort of interview is slowly leaving the world.”  
  - **Outcome:** Largely correct for industry and increasingly true for academia. Structured, competency‑based interviews now dominate in large chemical companies; academic panels still use board questions but at a reduced frequency.  

- **Prediction 2 (implicit):** High‑pressure, on‑the‑spot mechanism tests are being phased out in favour of more balanced evaluation.  
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed. The shift has been driven by diversity‑inclusion initiatives, the rise of remote interviewing, and evidence that such tests do not reliably predict long‑term performance.  

No other specific forecasts (e.g., timelines, quantitative adoption rates) were made, so no further comparison is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in chemistry recruitment culture; its observation of a transitioning interview paradigm proved prescient and remains relevant to discussions of hiring fairness and effectiveness.
