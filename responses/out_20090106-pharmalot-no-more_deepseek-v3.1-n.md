# Pharmalot Is No More (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief commentary mourning the end of Ed Silverman's Pharmalot blog, which had been covering pharmaceutical industry news. The author notes that Silverman did excellent reporting, primarily focusing on industry troubles and company difficulties, which the author considers appropriate since "things going fine" isn't much of a story. The piece mentions that Silverman appears to be moving to FDC Reports, and the author expresses relief that a good reporter found stable employment during a period when the newspaper industry was in worse condition than the pharmaceutical industry. The underlying sentiment is that while people will always need pharmaceuticals, the same certainty doesn't exist for newspapers, making it encouraging when skilled journalists can transition successfully.

## 2. HISTORY

After the January 2009 discontinuation of Pharmalot, Ed Silverman did indeed join FDC Reports, where he continued pharmaceutical industry coverage. However, this transition was relatively short-lived. In September 2009, just eight months after the original blog ended, Silverman relaunched Pharmalot as part of the CBS Interactive network, bringing his popular industry coverage back under the original brand. The blog remained active and influential for several more years, continuing Silverman's signature style of aggressive reporting on pharmaceutical industry developments, regulatory issues, and company troubles.

In October 2015, the blog underwent another transformation when Silverman moved Pharmalot to the STAT news platform, a new health and medicine publication launched by Boston Globe Media. There it continued as a prominent pharmaceutical industry watchdog, maintaining its reputation for breaking industry news and critical analysis. Silverman's coverage has consistently focused on regulatory challenges, pipeline setbacks, pricing controversies, and corporate missteps that characterize much of pharmaceutical journalism's important watchdog role.

The pharmaceutical industry itself continued to evolve through multiple boom and bust cycles, with significant consolidation, ongoing patent cliffs, and the rise of specialty drugs and biologics reshaping the landscape that Silverman covered throughout this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction that Silverman would contribute to FDC Reports**: This proved partially accurate but short-lived. Silverman did join FDC Reports, but only for eight months before relaunching Pharmalot under CBS Interactive in September 2009.

• **Implicit prediction that the newspaper industry was in worse shape than pharma**: This was directionally correct. The newspaper industry continued its severe decline throughout the late 2000s and 2010s, with massive layoffs, bankruptcies, and consolidation. The pharmaceutical industry, while facing its own challenges (patent cliffs, pipeline gaps, regulatory pressures), remained fundamentally economically viable as people continued to need medications.

• **Implicit prediction about people needing pharmaceuticals ensuring industry stability**: This proved accurate over the long term. While individual companies faced challenges, the fundamental demand for pharmaceutical products remained robust, driven by aging populations, chronic disease management, and continued innovation in areas like biologics and personalized medicine.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This brief blog post about a pharmaceutical journalism blog ending is of minimal long-term interest, as it was essentially industry insider commentary about media coverage rather than substantive developments in biotechnology or pharmaceuticals. While it documents a moment in the evolution of pharmaceutical journalism and correctly identified the challenges facing traditional media, it lacks broader scientific or policy significance that would make it relevant to biotechnology industry developments. The post's value is primarily historical as documentation of how specialized industry journalism evolved during the digital media transition period.
