# Scientific Journals: Who Pays What? (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a PNAS study that used Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover the secret pricing deals between large scientific publishers and university libraries for bundled journal packages. The study revealed that universities paid vastly different prices for the same bundles, with publishers requiring nondisclosure agreements that prevented libraries from knowing market rates. Elsevier emerged as the highest-priced publisher in absolute dollar terms, though it was more cost-effective on a per-citation basis than Sage and Taylor & Francis. The analysis showed that Elsevier's "Freedom Collection" bundle (about 2,200 journals) cost research universities roughly $1.2 million on average (40% of à la carte pricing), but that libraries could theoretically obtain 79% of citations for the same price by selecting only cost-effective journals individually, making the true citation-scaled discount only about 21%. Some wealthy institutions like Harvard, MIT, and Caltech still opted out of full Elsevier bundles, while ACS packages showed higher adoption rates (nearly 60% of libraries took the full bundle).

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the 2014 article, the scientific publishing landscape has undergone significant transformation driven by this increased transparency around pricing. Notably, major funders including the European Union (through Plan S, announced 2018) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation began mandating that research they fund be published open access. Several European countries (Germany, Sweden, Netherlands) initiated high-profile negotiations with Elsevier, resulting in some cancellations of "Big Deal" packages and moves toward transformative agreements.

The transparency movement gained momentum with initiatives like the MIT Framework for Publisher Contracts (2019) and the University of California system's highly publicized 2019-2020 negotiation with Elsevier, which temporarily resulted in loss of access before reaching a transformative open access agreement. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated preprint server adoption (bioRxiv, medRxiv) and highlighted the value of immediate open access to research.

Concurrently, predatory publishing concerns grew, with the FTC suing predatory publishers OMICS in 2016. The market also saw diversification with megajournals (PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports) and platform-based publishing models gaining traction. However, Elsevier's market position remained strong; by 2020, they maintained contracts with most major institutions, though often restructured toward hybrid open access models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific long-term predictions to evaluate against later outcomes. The analysis focused on documenting existing pricing disparities and market inefficiencies rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article addressed a critical but under-examined aspect of scientific publishing economics. While not revolutionary, it shed light on opaque pricing practices that would later fuel major policy changes and institutional negotiations, making it more significant in retrospect than it may have appeared at publication.
