# Google Versus Aging (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Google's newly announced venture into aging research through a company called Calico (California Life Company), backed by Google and led by Arthur Levinson (chairman of Apple and Genentech). At the time of publication, details about Calico's specific mission were scant, but the venture represented a long-term, patient-capital approach to addressing human aging and lifespan extension.

The author expresses cautious optimism about this development, noting that significant breakthroughs in lifespan extension will require substantial time due to several challenges: the complexity of underlying biochemistry with many competing hypotheses to test, the need for therapies safe enough for lifelong use, and major regulatory hurdles. The FDA has no framework for approving therapies that make people "better than normal," requiring researchers to pursue disease-specific endpoints (like diabetes or cardiovascular conditions) as surrogates for broader anti-aging effects. The article references GSK's acquisition of Sirtris and their strategic avoidance of lifespan claims, instead focusing on defined therapeutic indications with established regulatory pathways.

The author is skeptical that meaningful anti-aging interventions will be available within Larry Page's stated 10-20 year timeline, suggesting that even with today's discoveries, 15+ years would be needed before clinical deployment. The piece closes with a Latin motto suggesting that no simple herb grows against death - implying that effective anti-aging interventions will likely be complex rather than simple solutions.

## 2. HISTORY

Calico Labs did indeed launch and has operated as a research-focused company pursuing aging biology, though with a notably secretive approach. The company established major academic collaborations, most significantly a $1.5 billion partnership with AbbVie formed in 2014 and expanded in 2018, focused on age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. This partnership resulted in several drug candidates entering clinical development, though specific programs remain largely undisclosed publicly.

**Scientific Progress**: Calico built significant research infrastructure, recruiting prominent scientists and establishing collaborations with institutions like the Broad Institute and University of Texas Southwestern. They have published research in areas including cellular senescence, proteostasis, and mitochondrial function. They filed numerous patents and advanced several candidates to clinical trials, primarily through the AbbVie partnership, though detailed public results remain limited.

**Regulatory Pathway**: The author's prediction about regulatory challenges proved prescient. No anti-aging therapy has achieved FDA approval for lifespan extension. Instead, companies pursued disease-specific indications. This remained the dominant strategy - targeting age-related diseases (osteoporosis, neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders) rather than aging itself.

**Industry Evolution**: The 2013-2024 period saw significant growth in longevity research, with numerous companies entering the space: Unity Biotechnology (senolytics), BioAge Labs (aging biomarkers), Life Biosciences, and others. Investment increased substantially, with the longevity biotech sector raising billions in venture funding. However, no breakthrough anti-aging intervention reached widespread clinical use. The most visible success came from rapamycin/rapalogs in specific contexts, but broad lifespan extension in humans remained elusive.

**Notable Developments**: 
- Metformin gained attention for potential lifespan benefits, leading to the TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) clinical trial design, though it remained unfunded
- Senolytics (drugs clearing senescent cells) showed promise in preclinical models but remained in early clinical development
- Epigenetic reprogramming (Yamanaka factors) emerged as a powerful approach in animal models but with substantial safety concerns
- No FDA-approved therapy specifically targets aging as an indication

**Calico's Trajectory**: Calico remained operational but maintained its secretive approach, with limited public disclosure of specific programs or clinical outcomes. The company continued to invest in basic research partnerships while advancing select candidates through the AbbVie collaboration.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Google/Page's 10-20 year timeline for breakthrough aging interventions**: **Incorrect**. Eleven years later (2024), no breakthrough anti-aging therapy has reached clinical practice. The field has made scientific progress, but interventions remain in early-to-mid stage clinical development at best. The timeline proved overly optimistic.

• **Author's skepticism about rapid translation**: **Correct**. The author's assessment that meaningful interventions wouldn't arrive quickly proved accurate. No therapy approved for aging or lifespan extension exists today, and even compelling candidates remain years from potential approval.

• **The regulatory challenge framework prediction**: **Correct**. The FDA still lacks a framework for approving "better than normal" therapies. Companies continue pursuing disease-specific indications (neurodegeneration, metabolic disease, cancer) rather than aging itself as a treatable condition.

• **Preference for targeting specific age-related diseases as surrogates**: **Correct**. The strategy the author outlined became the dominant industry approach. Companies target conditions like osteoarthritis, neurodegeneration, or vision loss while researching underlying aging mechanisms.

• **GSK/Sirtris diabetes focus strategy**: **Partially validated but questionable outcome**. Sirtris compounds focused on metabolic disease rather than lifespan claims, aligning with the regulatory pathway concern. However, GSK ultimately discontinued most Sirtris programs after failing to replicate early promises, writing down much of the $720 million acquisition value. While SIRT1 activation remains an area of research interest, it hasn't delivered the breakthrough initially hoped for.

• **Complexity of effective interventions**: **Correct**. No "simple herb" solution emerged. The most promising approaches involve sophisticated biological mechanisms: senolytics, mTOR inhibition, epigenetic reprogramming, mitochondrial interventions - all requiring complex pharmaceutical development.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article proved remarkably prescient about the challenges facing anti-aging research and the long timelines required, while capturing a pivotal moment when major tech investment entered the longevity space. The regulatory and scientific obstacles identified in 2013 remain central barriers today, making this analysis both historically significant and still relevant.
