# Live Long and Prosper (and Be Bright Yellow at the Same Time) (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary highlighted a **Nature** paper reporting that the amyloid‑binding dye **Thioflavin T (ThT)** dramatically extended both median and maximal lifespan of *Caenorhabditis elegans* (≈ 60 % increase).  The authors showed that ThT reduced protein‑aggregate burden in several mutant worm strains that model proteostasis failure, and that the effect required the heat‑shock transcription factor **HSF‑1** and the stress‑responsive factor **SKN‑1** (the worm ortholog of mammalian Nrf2).  The piece speculated that similar experiments in mice—especially in strains with compromised protein‑handling or altered HSF‑1 levels—would be underway, and even mused that perhaps we should be adding more food dyes to the diet given the FDA’s tentative interest in dye‑related hyperactivity.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Follow‑up in worms** – Subsequent work confirmed that ThT can modestly increase *C. elegans* lifespan, but later studies showed the effect is highly dose‑dependent and can be reproduced with several structurally unrelated “fluorescent” dyes (e.g., curcumin, Congo red).  The consensus is that the lifespan benefit is likely **indirect**, possibly via mild proteostatic stress (a hormetic response) rather than specific clearance of amyloid.

**Mice and higher organisms** –  
- **No robust replication** of the ThT lifespan extension has been reported in mice.  Small‑scale studies (e.g., 2013‑2015) that administered ThT to wild‑type or proteostasis‑deficient mouse models observed **no significant survival benefit** and, at higher doses, **toxicity** (hepatic and renal).  
- The **blood‑brain barrier** limits ThT brain penetration, and pharmacokinetic data indicate rapid clearance, making chronic systemic exposure difficult.  
- Because of these limitations, **no pre‑clinical or clinical trials** of ThT as an anti‑aging or neurodegenerative therapy have been launched.

**Impact on the field** – The paper helped cement the idea that **enhancing proteostasis** could be a viable anti‑aging strategy, spurring research into:
- Small‑molecule activators of **HSF‑1** (e.g., celastrol, arimoclomol) – some entered early‑phase trials for protein‑misfolding diseases but not for aging per se.  
- **Nrf2/SKN‑1** activators (e.g., dimethyl fumarate) – approved for multiple sclerosis, with ongoing investigation of geroprotective effects.  
- **Senolytics**, **mTOR inhibitors**, and **metformin**, which have received far more translational attention than amyloid‑binding dyes.

**Regulatory landscape** – The FDA’s 2011 discussion of food‑colorant‑related hyperactivity resulted in **no new mandatory labeling**; the agency continues to require safety data for new dyes but has not promoted increased dye consumption.  No policy shift has linked ThT or similar dyes to health benefits.

**Business outcomes** – Companies that marketed ThT strictly as a research reagent (e.g., Sigma‑Aldrich, Thermo Fisher) continued normal sales; there was **no commercial push** to develop ThT as a therapeutic.  The broader “protein‑aggregation‑targeting” market grew around **immunotherapies for Alzheimer’s** (e.g., aducanumab) rather than small‑molecule dyes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“Similar experiments are underway in other species… I’d go straight to mice.”*  
  **Outcome:** Small pilot mouse studies were performed, but **no reproducible lifespan extension** was observed; the prediction was **incorrect**.

- **Prediction:** *“We may need to put more dyes in our food.”*  
  **Outcome:** No scientific or regulatory movement supported increased dietary dye intake; the prediction was **unsupported**.

- **Implicit prediction:** *“Binding to protein aggregates can be a therapeutic route to longevity.”*  
  **Outcome:** While proteostasis remains a key target, **direct aggregate‑binding dyes have not become viable therapeutics**; the broader concept is partially validated (proteostasis modulation works), but the specific chemical class (ThT‑type dyes) has **not** delivered on that promise.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a noteworthy snapshot of early‑stage geroscience enthusiasm and correctly identified proteostasis as a longevity lever, but its specific therapeutic optimism about ThT has not materialized, limiting long‑term impact.
