# Thanks, But No Thanks (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article recounts chemistry career anecdotes about researchers wisely declining dangerous or unappealing research projects. Dietmar Seyferth recalled abandoning fluorine chemistry after learning it required building and operating an electrolytic fluorine cell—a highly hazardous undertaking. The piece also references Matt Meselson's story of avoiding a tellurium project proposed by Linus Pauling, noting both elements pose significant risks (fluorine being explosively reactive, tellurium toxic). The article celebrates researchers using good judgment to steer clear of projects where personal safety or practical feasibility made the research ill-advised.

## 2. HISTORY
This 2015 article was a commentary piece reflecting on historical chemistry anecdotes rather than announcing new biotechnology developments. No specific drug development pipelines, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, or commercial biotech outcomes stemmed directly from this article. The safety considerations highlighted—regarding fluorine and tellurium handling—were already well-established practices by 2015 and remain standard laboratory safety protocols today. Public policy did not change because of this piece. If anything, the article served to reinforce existing norms about researchers exercising discretion in project selection.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made no explicit predictions about future scientific, medical, or biotechnological developments. It was retrospective commentary about past decisions. There are no predictions to evaluate against subsequent outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
The article is a light commentary piece reflecting on historical anecdotes in chemistry, not a substantive biotechnology analysis or forward-looking piece with measurable downstream impact.
