# More From Blog Syn (Feb 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post highlighted two new entries on Blog Syn, a site dedicated to independently reproducing published organic chemistry reactions. The first entry examined a palladium-catalyzed alkenylation of pyridines (a CH activation approach similar to Heck reactions), finding that while the reaction worked, crucial variables for success were under-reported in the original paper. The second entry re-evaluated an older Nicolau lab paper (co-authored by Phil Baran) on IBX (2-iodoxybenzoic acid) oxidation of arylmethanes to aldehydes/ketones. The post noted that despite 179 citations of the original paper from 2002-2013, only 4 uses of the reported conditions appeared in citing articles—all from a single 2006 paper—with Blog Syn's attempt finding the reaction largely failed to deliver the claimed products. Both cases underscored the reproducibility crisis in synthetic chemistry literature.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2013 Blog Syn post was part of a broader movement addressing reproducibility in chemistry. The reproducibility crisis in synthetic organic chemistry gained significant attention in subsequent years:

- **Blog Syn's trajectory**: The site continued operating for several more years, building a reputation for rigorous independent verification. However, organic synthesis blogging gradually declined as academic social media shifted toward Twitter and other platforms. Many chemistry blogs became less active by the late 2010s.

- **Reproducibility initiatives**: Following heightened awareness of irreproducible results, major chemistry journals implemented stricter requirements for experimental details. The *Journal of the American Chemical Society* and *Organic Letters* strengthened supporting information requirements, and some journals introduced mandatory reproducibility checks for certain high-profile papers.

- **CH activation chemistry**: Palladium-catalyzed CH functionalization became a major growth area in organic synthesis throughout the 2010s, but the initial overoptimistic reporting gave way to more nuanced understanding of directing group effects, catalyst systems, and substrate scope limitations—exactly the kind of practical details Blog Syn sought to uncover.

- **IBX chemistry**: While IBX oxidation remains a useful tool, the broader community recognized that many early reports overclaimed robustness and scope. Subsequent research developed better understanding of IBX's limitations and safety considerations (explosion risks under certain conditions).

- **Phil Baran's career**: Notably, Baran continued his highly successful career at Scripps, becoming one of the most influential synthetic chemists of his generation. The IBX reproducibility issue did not significantly impact his trajectory, and his group went on to develop numerous innovative synthetic methods with better-documented reproducibility.

- **Impact on pharmaceutical R&D**: The reproducibility crisis in academic synthetic chemistry contributed to pharmaceutical companies increasingly relying on their own internal validation rather than immediately trusting published methods, adding costs and delays to drug discovery workflows.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article contained no explicit predictions about future developments. It was retrospective commentary on existing literature problems rather than a forward-looking piece.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important moment in addressing chemistry's reproducibility crisis, documenting real efforts to separate reliable methods from overclaimed results in influential synthetic literature. While blog-based replication efforts were somewhat superseded by institutional initiatives, the core issue remained highly relevant to drug discovery and chemical R&D.
