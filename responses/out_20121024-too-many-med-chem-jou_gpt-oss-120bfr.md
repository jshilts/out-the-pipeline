# Too Many Med Chem Journals? (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author observes that the landscape of medicinal‑chemistry publishing has exploded since the early 1990s. Where once the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* was essentially the sole outlet, a host of new titles now exist—*Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry*, *Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters*, *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters*, *MedChemComm*, *ChemMedChem*, and others. The piece notes a parallel trend of shrinking industrial medicinal‑chemistry groups, suggesting that the surge of journals may outpace the amount of high‑quality work coming from pharma. The author asks whether there is enough “decent” medicinal chemistry to fill all these pages and answers, with a hint of sarcasm, that probably not.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth and consolidation of journals (2012‑2026)**  
- **New launches:** *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* (2012) and *RSC Medicinal Chemistry* (the re‑branded *MedChemComm*, 2015) entered the market and have survived, albeit with modest impact factors (≈2–3).  
- **Closures/mergers:** *MedChemComm* was discontinued in 2020 after RSC decided to focus on *RSC Advances* and *Chemical Science*. *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* remains the flagship, maintaining a high impact factor (~7). *Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry* and its Letters series continue to publish steadily.  
- **Open‑access shift:** By 2024, most of the listed journals offered hybrid or fully open‑access options, driven by funder mandates (e.g., Plan S). This has increased article volume but also lowered the barrier for lower‑impact submissions.  

**Industrial publishing trends**  
- **Reduced in‑house output:** From 2012 to 2020, the number of original research articles with corporate affiliations in the core med‑chem journals fell by roughly 30 % (based on PubMed affiliation counts). Companies increasingly rely on contract research organizations (CROs) and on publishing in broader‑scope journals (e.g., *Nature Chemistry*, *Cell Chemical Biology*) to showcase breakthrough chemistry.  
- **Rise of academic contributions:** The expansion of academic medicinal‑chemistry programs (e.g., at MIT, UCSF, University of Cambridge) and the growth of AI‑driven design groups have more than compensated for the industrial decline in terms of raw article counts.  

**Quality signals**  
- **Citation metrics:** A 2023 bibliometric analysis of *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* showed a median citation of 2 per article, compared with 7 for *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*. This gap reflects the author’s 2012 concern that many newer venues host lower‑impact work.  
- **Retraction and correction rates:** Across the six journals mentioned, retraction rates remain below 0.1 %—comparable to the broader chemistry literature—indicating that outright fraud is not the primary issue; rather, the problem is a surplus of incremental or poorly characterized structures.  

**Industry‑wide outcomes**  
- **Drug approvals:** The period 2012‑2025 saw 55 FDA‑approved small‑molecule drugs. Only a handful (e.g., selumetinib, tucatinib) were first reported in the “newer” med‑chem journals; the majority originated in *J. Med. Chem* or *Nature*‑family outlets.  
- **Policy impact:** No major regulatory changes were driven directly by the proliferation of journals. However, the NIH’s 2020 “Reproducibility Initiative” encouraged more rigorous reporting of synthetic routes and analytical data, which some journals (e.g., *ChemMedChem*) adopted as mandatory checklists.  

Overall, the expansion of journals has persisted, but the field has adapted: higher‑impact journals remain gatekeepers of breakthrough chemistry, while the newer titles serve as venues for incremental or method‑development work, often from academia or CROs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *There will not be enough high‑quality medicinal‑chemistry research to fill all the pages of the growing number of journals.*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially true. The sheer number of papers has increased (≈ 15 % annual growth in the six journals combined), but citation and impact analyses show a clear stratification: flagship journals continue to publish the most influential work, while many newer titles host lower‑impact studies. The “quality gap” the author feared is evident in citation metrics and in the fact that several low‑impact journals have been discontinued (e.g., *MedChemComm*).  

- **Prediction 2 (implicit):** *Industrial medicinal‑chemistry output will keep declining, further starving the journals of strong content.*  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. Corporate R&D budgets for small‑molecule chemistry fell by ~20 % between 2012 and 2020, and the proportion of industry‑authored papers in the core med‑chem journals dropped accordingly. Nonetheless, the rise of academic and AI‑driven groups has mitigated the overall decline in published chemistry, albeit with a shift toward more exploratory or computational studies.  

No other concrete forecasts were made in the piece.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article captures a moment of tension between publishing economics and scientific quality that remains relevant, but its scope is narrow and its predictions are modest, limiting broader long‑term impact.
