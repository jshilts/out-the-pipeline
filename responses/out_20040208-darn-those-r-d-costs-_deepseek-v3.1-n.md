# Darn Those R&D Costs, Anyway (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article defends the pharmaceutical industry's high R&D costs and drug pricing against populist political attacks during the 2004 presidential campaign. The author cites Alex Tabarrok's analysis supporting the DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski study published in the Journal of Health Economics (2003), which estimated the average cost of developing a new drug at approximately $805 million. The piece rebuts claims from organizations like Public Citizen that pharmaceutical R&D costs are overstated or mythical. It also references Holman Jenkins' Wall Street Journal column criticizing Democratic candidates' populist rhetoric about drug pricing. The central argument is that drug pricing reflects the economic reality of pharmaceutical R&D—the "pipeline" metaphor where large upfront investments must be recouped by successful products years later.

## 2. HISTORY

The $802 million figure from the DiMasi study (2003, often cited as $800-802M in subsequent years, and noted as $805M in the original article) became a lightning rod. Over the subsequent two decades, several major developments occurred:

- **Escalating costs and updated estimates**: In 2016, DiMasi and colleagues updated their estimate to approximately $2.6 billion per approved drug, factoring in post-approval costs and higher failure rates. Other studies (notably by Memorial Sloan Kettering researchers in health policy) and analyses by industry groups suggested figures ranging from $1.3 billion to over $2.8 billion when risk-adjusted. These figures were frequently challenged by critics, with advocacy groups like Public Citizen continuing to argue that true R&D costs were lower and that these widespread figures included opportunity costs and exaggerated expenses.

- **Growing R&D investment amid productivity challenges**: Actual industry R&D spending rose substantially from the mid-2000s onward, but with a declining number of new molecular entities approved annually. Pharmaceutical companies, including many major firms, faced significant patent cliffs and intense pressure to maintain pipelines, leading to massive M&A activity and greater focus on biologics, rare diseases, and oncology, where pricing could support the economics.

- **Policy shifts and pricing scrutiny**: Political attention to prescription drug costs intensified steadily. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit (2006) generated widespread debate over government negotiation of drug prices. The Affordable Care Act (2010) and subsequent policy proposals increasingly targeted drug costs. By the mid-2010s, public outrage over price spikes for drugs like Daraprim, insulin, and certain orphan drugs led to congressional hearings and proposals for price controls. The Inflation Reduction Act eventually granted Medicare limited authority to negotiate prices for certain drugs starting in 2026.

- **Actual drug development outcomes against the cost backdrop**: The sector saw mixed results for major initiatives. While breakthrough therapies achieved blockbuster status (e.g., cancer immunotherapies, CAR-T, gene therapies), many promising areas faced setbacks, and overall R&D productivity remained contentious. The proportion of potential drugs failing at various clinical phases did not dramatically improve; many compounds failed in Phase II and III, reinforcing the risk-adjusted cost arguments. The genomics revolution and targeted therapies produced both successes and expensive failures, supporting the high-risk nature of the enterprise described in 2004.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's core assertions and implicit predictions about industry economics versus populist rhetoric can be evaluated:

- **Prediction**: Pharmaceutical R&D costs are real bottlenecks, and populist critiques about artificial inflation of these costs will persist but not undermine the economic realities.
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated. Political debate about drug costs and R&D spending remained highly contentious. However, growing political pressure (including calls for price controls, government negotiation, and transparency mandates) did lead to policy changes that began reshaping pricing dynamics by the 2020s, most notably with Medicare price negotiation provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.

- **Prediction**: The pipeline metaphor—companies needing to price successful drugs to cover the costs of the many failures—is the correct framework to understand pricing.
  - **Outcome**: Validated as an accurate description of the industry's economic model. This pricing logic continued to drive decisions across major pharmaceutical companies. However, it increasingly faced challenge from payers and policymakers who questioned inter-product cross-subsidization and demanded greater value-linked pricing, particularly for high-cost specialty drugs.

- **Prediction**: Industry critics would continue citing lower R&D estimates.
  - **Outcome**: Validated. Organizations like Public Citizen, some academic researchers, and advocacy groups continued to publish analyses suggesting lower true R&D costs. The "cost of developing a drug" remained a polarizing figure for decades, with estimates varying by methodology and stakeholder perspective.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses a durable and important policy debate with continued relevance, but it primarily covers industry economics rather than specific biomedical innovations or clinical developments, limiting its technical interest.
