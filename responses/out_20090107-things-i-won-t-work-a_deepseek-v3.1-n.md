# Things I Won't Work With: Azidotetrazolate Salts (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article humorously reviews a chemistry paper by Klapoetke and Stierstorfer about azidotetrazolate salts—high-nitrogen compounds with extreme explosive properties. The author describes how these salts range from "relatively stable" lithium derivatives to compounds like the rubidium salt that detonated spontaneously while standing undisturbed in the dark. Several attempts to characterize these materials resulted in destroyed equipment, with compounds exploding during testing or even during crystal preparation. The article notes the authors' rationale about "green" explosives and concludes with admiration for researchers brave enough to work with such dangerously unstable materials.

## 2. HISTORY

Klapoetke's research on high-nitrogen compounds like azidotetrazolates continued and expanded after this 2009 work. The field of energetic materials research has maintained steady interest in high-nitrogen compounds as potential "green" explosives, though practical applications remain limited by sensitivity and production challenges. Other researchers have explored similar nitrogen-rich frameworks, but industrial adoption of such highly sensitive materials has been cautious. Training protocols and infrastructure investment for handling such primary explosives have likely improved, but this research remains highly specialized.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not advance formal predictions or timelines, focusing instead on immediate hazard commentary and professional admiration for the researchers' survival of the work.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

While entertaining and technically accurate in describing the compounds' alarming behavior, the article is primarily a humorous review rather than an analytical biotech commentary, offering limited actionable insight for biotechnology industry analysis.
