# Poor Put-Upon Intelligent Design (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a response to a NPR commentary by Joe Loconte of the Heritage Foundation, which lamented the Dover decision that removed Intelligent Design from Pennsylvania school curricula. Loconte's argument drew an analogy between Intelligent Design's contemporary rejection and the historical resistance to the Big Bang theory, claiming that both were initially dismissed due to perceived religious overtones. The author sharply criticized this analogy, pointing out that the Big Bang theory ultimately gained acceptance because it produced empirical evidence and testable predictions—qualities that Intelligent Design notably lacks. The article emphasizes that scientific legitimacy is earned through evidence-based inquiry and predictive power, not through claiming victimhood or superficial resemblance to scientific theories.

## 2. HISTORY

The Dover decision (Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, December 2005) marked a watershed moment in the evolution-creation debates. Federal Judge John E. Jones III ruled that Intelligent Design is not science but rather a religious concept, rendering its inclusion in public school science curricula unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause. This precedent significantly weakened organized efforts to introduce Intelligent Design into public education.

In subsequent years, similar legal challenges consistently reached the same conclusion—that Intelligent Design lacks scientific validity. No peer-reviewed research has since established testable predictions or empirical evidence supporting Intelligent Design as a scientific theory. The scientific community's consensus remains overwhelmingly that evolution by natural selection adequately explains biological complexity, supported by increasingly robust genomic evidence unavailable in 2005.

Ironically, the Dover decision highlighted the scientific method's strength—the very point the original article emphasized. Rather than suppressing inquiry, the ruling demanded that any competing theory meet basic scientific standards of testability and evidence, standards that have only grown more rigorous with advances in molecular biology and genomics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

While the article itself did not make explicit predictions, it rejected Loconte's implicit prediction that Intelligent Design might achieve scientific legitimacy analogous to the Big Bang theory's trajectory. The article's assessment proved accurate:
- Intelligent Design has not produced testable predictions or empirical evidence within the scientific framework
- No new substantive research has advanced Intelligent Design as a scientific theory
- Legal and educational consensus has continued rejecting Intelligent Design as scientifically valid
- The analogy to Big Bang cosmology remains flawed—the former succeeded through evidence; the latter has failed through lack of evidence

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides an accurate and prescient analysis of why Intelligent Design fails as science, offering a clear defense of scientific standards. However, its significance is limited to a specific historical debate rather than broader scientific or biotechnological advancement.
