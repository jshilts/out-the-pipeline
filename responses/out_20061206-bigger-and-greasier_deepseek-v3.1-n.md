# Bigger And Greasier (December 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the relationship between molecular properties and drug behavior, sparked by speculation about Pfizer's cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor torcetrapib. The author, a medicinal chemist, explains why the pharmaceutical industry is suspicious of large and greasy (hydrophobic) molecules. The body has multiple defense mechanisms against such compounds: poor absorption through the gut wall, extensive first-pass metabolism by liver enzymes, and inappropriate tissue distribution due to water's dominance as the body's primary solvent. While acknowledging that torcetrapib's developers had likely addressed the absorption and metabolism issues, the author suggests the unpredictable distribution and binding behavior of such hydrophobic molecules could have contributed to the drug's failure. The article notes the challenge specific to CETP inhibition—this target handles lipid transport, so effective inhibitors may need to be hydrophobic despite the associated risks.

## 2. HISTORY

Torcetrapib's development trajectory exemplifies the CETP inhibitor class's troubled history. Pfizer terminated the phase III trial in December 2006, just days after this article was published, due to increased mortality and cardiovascular events, despite the drug demonstrating positive effects on HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. The failure cost Pfizer approximately $800 million and represented one of the most expensive drug development failures of that era.

Following torcetrapib's failure, subsequent CETP inhibitors faced similar challenges, though some achieved more positive outcomes. Dalcetrapib (Roche) showed neutral effects but was discontinued in 2012 after failing to demonstrate cardiovascular benefit. Evacetrapib (Eli Lilly) was terminated in 2015 despite raising HDL by 130% and lowering LDL by 40%. Anacetrapib (Merck) completed phase III trials showing modest cardiovascular benefit, but Merck chose not to pursue FDA approval due to concerns about accumulation in adipose tissue—precisely the "greasy molecule" distribution problem anticipated in this article.

The fundamental CETP target has proven problematic for drug development, with multiple mechanisms contributing to failures beyond just molecular properties, including off-target effects on blood pressure, aldosterone production, and other pathways. By 2015, most pharmaceutical companies had deprioritized CETP inhibitors despite significant investment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction about torcetrapib's molecular properties being problematic**: The article correctly anticipated that the drug's hydrophobic nature could cause distribution issues, specifically lipid-like accumulation in fatty tissues. This was validated when Merck cited concerns about anacetrapib accumulating in adipose tissue as a key reason for not pursuing approval, even after positive clinical trial results. ✓

• **Implicit prediction about CETP inhibitors requiring greasy molecules**: The author noted that CETP targets lipid transport and might necessitate hydrophobic inhibitors. This proved accurate—all CETP inhibitors developed subsequently shared these molecular characteristics, likely necessitated by target binding requirements. ✓

• **Prediction about the broader validation challenge for CETP inhibition**: While not explicitly stated, the reasoning suggested that CETP inhibitors would face validation challenges beyond molecular properties. This proved prescient—the entire drug class struggled with clinical validation despite positive biomarker effects on HDL/LDL, with most programs failing to demonstrate meaningful cardiovascular benefit. ✓

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional scientific insight by identifying key issues with CETP inhibitor development before torcetrapib's widely reported failure, anticipating the molecular challenges that would plague the entire drug class for over a decade. The author's understanding of drug disposition principles proved remarkably predictive of real-world clinical outcomes.
