# Pfizer: Making the Case for a Breakup (March 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary argued that the era of mega‑pharma mergers was ending and that the next wave would be “de‑volution” – large companies being split into smaller, more focused units. Citing Goldman Sachs’s suggestion that Pfizer should consider a breakup, the author predicted that Pfizer (the industry’s most acquisitive firm over the prior two decades) would soon spin off non‑core businesses to unlock shareholder value. The piece pointed to Abbott’s announced spinoff of its pharmaceutical arm (later named AbbVie) as the “starter pistol” for a broader trend of breakups across the sector.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened to Pfizer after 2012**

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **2013** | **Zoetis spinoff** – Pfizer separated its animal‑health division into the independent company Zoetis. | First major breakup; Zoetis became a leading animal‑health firm and has grown steadily (market cap > $80 bn by 2026). |
| **2015** | **Acquisition of Hospira** for ≈ $17 bn. | Expanded Pfizer’s sterile‑injectable and biosimilar portfolio; no breakup, but continued M&A activity. |
| **2016‑2019** | Series of acquisitions (e.g., Medivation, Anacor, Array BioPharma) and divestitures (e.g., sale of consumer‑health OTC brands to GlaxoSmithKline, forming a joint venture). | Strengthened oncology and rare‑disease pipelines; the OTC joint venture (GSK & Pfizer Consumer Healthcare) was dissolved in 2020, with Pfizer exiting the consumer market. |
| **2020** | **COVID‑19 vaccine success** – BNT162b2 (co‑developed with BioNTech) generated > $30 bn in 2021 revenue. | Reinforced Pfizer’s core pharmaceutical focus; no structural split was pursued. |
| **2022‑2023** | **Acquisition of Seagen** (announced 2023, closed 2023) for ≈ $43 bn; **Arena Pharmaceuticals** (2022) for $6.7 bn. | Further bolstered oncology pipeline; continued the pattern of large‑scale buying rather than breaking up. |
| **2024‑2025** | Ongoing portfolio reshaping: divestiture of non‑core assets (e.g., certain legacy generics) and internal re‑organization, but **Pfizer remains a single, integrated public company**. | No formal split of the core pharma business; the company’s market cap remains among the top‑5 globally. |

**Industry‑wide trend**  
AbbVie’s 2013 spinoff indeed materialised and has become a major biopharma (e.g., Humira, later biosimilar competition). Other large firms pursued selective spin‑offs (e.g., Johnson & Johnson’s 2023 spinoff of its consumer health unit, Kenvue). However, the wholesale breakup of the biggest integrated pharma houses (Pfizer, Merck, Novartis) never occurred. Instead, the sector combined targeted divestitures with continued strategic acquisitions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several forecasts. Their outcomes are listed below.

- **Prediction:** *Pfizer will split into smaller, “leaner” units within the next few years.*  
  **Outcome:** *Not realized.* Pfizer performed one partial split (Zoetis, 2013) and later exited consumer health, but the core pharma business stayed intact.

- **Prediction:** *A wave of breakups will follow Abbott’s AbbVie spinoff, reshaping the industry.*  
  **Outcome:** *Partially true.* AbbVie’s creation was successful, and a few peers (e.g., J&J’s consumer‑health spinoff in 2023) followed, but the wave was limited to non‑core segments rather than full‑scale corporate breakups.

- **Implicit prediction:** *M&A activity will decline as “massive fees” disappear.*  
  **Outcome:** *Incorrect.* Pfizer and other majors continued aggressive M&A (Hospira, Seagen, etc.) well into the 2020s, with total global pharma M&A volume remaining high.

- **Implicit prediction:** *Breaking up will unlock shareholder value.*  
  **Outcome:** *Mixed.* Zoetis’s spin‑off created a valuable standalone company, but Pfizer’s overall market value grew more from its COVID‑19 vaccine and subsequent acquisitions than from any breakup.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment of strategic debate in pharma and correctly anticipated the rise of selective spin‑offs (e.g., AbbVie, Zoetis). Its broader forecast of a full breakup of Pfizer proved wrong, but the piece remains a useful snapshot of industry thinking just before the COVID‑19 era reshaped priorities.
