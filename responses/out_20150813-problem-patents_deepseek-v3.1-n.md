# The Problem With Patents
**13 Aug 2015**

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary responds to a 2015 Economist article that challenged the value of the patent system, particularly questioning whether it truly promotes innovation as intended. The Economist argued that patents on balance may harm progress despite the conventional belief that they incentivize invention. The article singled out the pharmaceutical industry as "the exception always touted"—the one sector where patents are widely seen as vital given the exceptional costs and timelines of drug development.

The author presents a pushback: unlike software or business methods, drug patents are generally higher quality, with clearer prior art and enablement, and they address a genuinely cumulative innovation path. The Economist countered with historical examples—notably Germany's pre-1967 manufacturing-process-only patents and Italy's pre-1978 lack of drug patents—claiming innovation thrived in those systems.

The Economist also cited a 2005 estimate that U.S. spending on drugs could have been  $160 billion lower absent patents—a figure the author disputes. The author notes the estimate confuses generic prices, which skip discovery costs borne under the patent system, with prices under a hypothetical no-patent regime. The piece argues that basic research and applied drug discovery are distinct categories, rejecting the scenario where government-funded basic research could fully replace private R&D.

Finally, the article considers prize systems as a radical alternative to patents, calling it worth considering but politically uphill, concluding that innovators at the time faced frictions around weak or unfair patent regimes, especially outside biopharma.

## 2. HISTORY
After this commentary, the debate and the sector evolved significantly, but key facts do not support the more radical claims made in the Economist's 2015 article. The most consistent finding since 2015 is that the biopharmaceutical sector remains uniquely patent-dependent, with no major economy abandoning product patents for drugs.

The suggested historical counterexamples have not held up as generalizable models. In Germany, much innovation before 1967 occurred under regulatory secrecy and cumulative process improvements, not in the modern environment of expensive trials; post-1967, R&D spending grew as firms hedged risk and captured returns. Italy likewise saw consolidation and internationalization after patent reform, but lost much of its domestic R&D capability in the decades that followed—a development interpretable as an adverse shift rather than a success of the previous no-patent regime. Of note, 2015–2023 brought no industrialized country reverting to a no-product-patent or process-only model; instead, patent protections broadly strengthened via trade agreements.

No jurisdiction has implemented prize systems at scale for small-molecule drugs. For rare diseases, some soft "prize-like" mechanisms exist via extended exclusivity and priority review vouchers, and government-funded advance purchase commitments occasionally back vaccines and antivirals. However, these do not replace the patent system and tend to complement rather than supplant it. Programmable therapeutics and certain advanced platforms increasingly compete through data exclusivity, trade secrets, and manufacturing complexity—sometimes relaxing classical small-molecule patent reliance—but biologics and small molecules continue to rely on robust patent and regulatory exclusivity incentives.

The pricing argument cited in 2005—which suggested payers could have saved  $160B—has not proven predictive. U.S. prescription drug spending grew substantially from 2015 onward, though with shifts toward generics and biosimilars. Despite high launch prices and public anger, the mix today includes a high share of generics, which did not collapse innovation, but also did not cause R&D spending to disappear; industry R&D remains correlated with expected returns, which rely on exclusivity. Policy retrenchment in major markets remains incremental (e.g., Medicare negotiation, reference pricing) rather than revolutionary.

Evidence quality for biopharma patents remains higher on average than in software or business methods. Patent challenges via inter partes review and U.S. Supreme Court rulings post-2015 tightened enablement and patent-eligibility in other sectors, while diagnostics and biomarkers saw new restrictions. Biologics and small-molecule medicinal chemistry stayed relatively protected, and I am confident that as of 2025 there has been no broad collapse of pharmaceutical patents, nor a move toward a prize-only regime.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Counterexamples would inspire reform**: The article suggested that historical cases might be re-examined and that debate would continue. The prediction that society might converge toward questioning pharmaceutical patents did not materialize. What actually happened was limited reform and continued dependence on patent incentives for biopharma.
- **Prize systems as a radical but plausible alternative**: The article discussed prizes as a realistic though politically difficult alternative. Post-2015, prize systems did not displace patents. There were niche uses in advance market commitments (COVID vaccines) and priority review vouchers, but no broad transition; patents remain the primary engine for incentivizing late-stage clinical development and drug launches.
- **The  $160 billion savings calculation would spur public policy action**: The asserted 2005 figure about savings without patents did not lead to major non-patent policy shifts. Instead, policymakers focused on targeted reforms (e.g., Medicare negotiation, out-of-pocket caps, biosimilars pathways) while retaining patents, underlining their continued perceived necessity.
- **Academic and industry R&D substitution would become more viable**: The author disputed facile conflation of basic and applied research, implying that substitution of government-funded for private R&D would fail. I am confident that later evidence shows no successful large-scale decoupling of the two; translational science remains hard, and private drug development continues to depend on both public investment in basic science and patent-based incentives for clinical and commercialization follow-through.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**
The article raises a durable debate but largely rehearses long-standing arguments without advancing empirical evidence that changed mainstream policy or industry practice in the 2015–2025 decade.
