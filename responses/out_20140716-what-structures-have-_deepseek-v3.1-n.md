# What Structures Have Turned on You? (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses the subjective and inconsistent nature of medicinal chemists' structural preferences when evaluating compound libraries. The author notes that while all medicinal chemists will reject certain molecular structures from screening hits or compound collections, there's surprisingly little agreement between chemists on which structures to eliminate. This inconsistency stems from each chemist developing personal "blackball" lists based on negative past experiences with certain scaffolds or functional groups that have "burned" them before.

The article specifically mentions several structural classes the author personally avoids: NH pyrroles, compounds with naphthalene substituents (despite exceptions like naproxen), and Mannich products. The piece cites earlier blog posts showing how chemists' compound-judging rules lack the overlap one might expect, and asks readers to share their own rejected structural classes. While acknowledging that some structures like rhodanines are widely blacklisted, the article suggests most blackballing decisions are highly individualized "fool me once" judgments based on personal laboratory failures rather than systematic structural alerts.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2014 article saw significant evolution in how medicinal chemists approach structural liability and "bad actors" in drug discovery. Several key developments emerged:

**PAINS and Filter Evolution**: The concept of Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) gained prominence, with computational filters being developed and refined to systematically identify problematic scaffolds. However, research in subsequent years showed that these filters suffered from high false-positive rates and often flagged legitimate drug candidates unnecessarily. By 2016-2018, the scientific community began moving toward more nuanced approaches, recognizing that context and assay conditions heavily influence compound behavior.

**Data-Driven Cheminformatics**: The pharmaceutical industry increasingly adopted data-driven approaches using larger datasets to identify problematic substructures. Machine learning models began supplementing medicinal chemists' intuition with statistical evidence of structural liabilities.

**Specific Structural Classes**: The rhodanines mentioned in the article continued generating controversy, with subsequent research validating concerns about their promiscuity while also revealing some legitimate bioactive examples. The pyrrole and naphthalene concerns proved somewhat justified but nuanced - drugs containing these motifs did advance, though often requiring careful optimization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no explicit quantitative predictions about future outcomes. The implicit assumptions were:

• **That medicinal chemists' intuitive blackballing would remain largely subjective**: This has largely held true, although it's been supplemented by data-driven tools
• **That structural classes like rhodanines, naphthalenes, and Mannich products would continue causing problems**: This proved moderately accurate - these classes remain challenging but haven't been completely abandoned

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

This article was a routine blog post discussing common medicinal chemistry frustrations, offering limited broader scientific or commercial importance beyond insider conversations about compound selection.
