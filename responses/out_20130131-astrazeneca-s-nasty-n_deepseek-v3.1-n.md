# AstraZeneca's Nasty Numbers (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This January 2013 commentary describes AstraZeneca's significant business challenges, characterized by declining sales, major drug development failures, and the impact of patent expirations. The article reports that the company faced a "mid- to high-single digit percentage" sales decline forecast for 2013, along with a fourth consecutive quarter of falling earnings. Key drug development programs had been terminated since June 2012, including selumetinib for solid tumors, AZD4017 for glaucoma, and AZD9773 for severe sepsis, along with the failure of fostamatinib for rheumatoid arthritis in mid-stage trials against AbbVie's Humira. The article suggests these setbacks created an opportunistic situation where smaller companies with viable drug assets might find AstraZeneca to be a motivated buyer.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2013 article, AstraZeneca underwent a significant transformation period. In the near term (2013-2016), the company continued to struggle with patent cliffs, particularly losing protection on blockbuster drugs like Crestor (rosuvastatin), which faced generic competition starting in 2016. The company implemented major cost-cutting measures and restructuring programs during this period.

However, AstraZeneca's strategic turnaround accelerated notably in subsequent years. The company made significant investments in oncology, cardiovascular/metabolic diseases, and respiratory therapies. Key developments included:

**Drug Development Successes:**
- Tagrisso (osimertinib) for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, approved by FDA in 2015, became a multibillion-dollar blockbuster
- Lynparza (olaparib), the first PARP inhibitor, developed in partnership, received multiple approvals for ovarian, breast, and other cancers
- Imfinzi (durvalumab), a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor approved in 2017 for bladder cancer and later for lung cancer
- Calquence (acalabrutinib) for blood cancers, approved 2017
- Farxiga (dapagliflozin) expanded from diabetes to heart failure treatment, becoming a major revenue driver

**Pipeline Development and Acquisitions:** AstraZeneca rebuilt its pipeline through both internal R&D and strategic acquisitions, including the $15.6 billion acquisition of Alexion Pharmaceuticals in 2021 to strengthen its rare disease portfolio. The company also expanded its presence in biologics and invested heavily in emerging therapeutic areas.

**Revenue Recovery:** By the late 2010s, AstraZeneca returned to growth trajectory, with oncology becoming its largest therapeutic area. The company's approach to external partnerships and acquisitions proved prescient, and by 2024, AstraZeneca had established itself as a leading global pharmaceutical company with a robust oncology portfolio and growing presence in rare diseases.

Regarding specific drugs mentioned in the article: fostamatinib (mentioned as failed in 2013) was later approved in 2018 by FDA for chronic immune thrombocytopenia under the name Tavalisse, developed by Rigel Pharmaceuticals - though not by AstraZeneca.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained one clear prediction:
- **If you're a small company with an asset to sell, you're going to want to give AZ a call. I think that they'll be ready to deal.**

**Outcome:** This prediction proved accurate. AstraZeneca became an active acquirer and partner in the years following 2013, though not necessarily in the desperate manner that might have been suggested. The company made strategic acquisitions including MedImmune (already owned but expanded), and later Alexion in 2021, demonstrating continued willingness to engage in major transactions. However, rather than acting from desperation, these moves appeared strategic as part of their oncology and rare disease focus. The general prediction about increased deal-making activity was correct, though the tone might have underestimated the company's eventual strategic transformation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures an important inflection point in big pharma strategy during the patent cliff era. While offering relatively standard analysis of pharma business cycles, it documented a critical moment before major industry transformation. The interest level is elevated because AstraZeneca's subsequent recovery and strategic pivot became a notable case study in pharmaceutical turnaround strategies.
