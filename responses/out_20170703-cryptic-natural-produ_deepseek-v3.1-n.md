# Cryptic Natural Products Appearing (July 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the concept of "cryptic natural products"—potentially valuable compounds produced by microorganisms through biosynthetic gene clusters that remain silenced under normal laboratory conditions. The author references Warp Drive Bio, a company built around this idea, and describes how these hidden pathways might represent unexplored chemical diversity that could yield new drug leads.

The piece highlights a Princeton research paper that successfully demonstrated this concept in practice. Researchers working with *Streptomyces* bacteria used GFP markers to monitor "quiet" biosynthetic gene clusters and found that exposing the organisms to stressors like etoposide and avermectin activated some of these silent pathways. This led to the discovery of several new compounds, including one with antifungal properties and others exhibiting cysteine protease inhibition. Additionally, the Princeton team identified a translational repressor protein that normally keeps these pathways silent, suggesting potential strategies for more systematically activating cryptic natural product biosynthesis in the future.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2017, the field of cryptic natural product discovery has seen significant advancement, though the timeline shows realistic scientific progress rather than overnight transformation.

The **Princeton approach** of using GFP reporters and stress induction has been adopted and refined by multiple research groups. Between 2018-2024, numerous publications expanded on this methodology, with various labs reporting success in activating silent gene clusters through different stress conditions, nutrient limitations, and coculture experiments.

**Technical advances** have emerged: more sophisticated genetic engineering tools (including CRISPR-based approaches) made it easier to manipulate regulatory elements in biosynthetic gene clusters. Work continued on understanding the repressor mechanisms mentioned in the original article, with research identifying additional regulatory proteins and small-molecule inducers that can toggle cluster expression.

**Warp Drive Bio's trajectory** evolved significantly. The company continued its natural product discovery platform but also expanded its focus. In 2018, Warp Drive Bio was acquired by Revolution Medicines, with the combined entity advancing both natural product-derived compounds and synthetic drug candidates. Several programs from Warp Drive's cryptic natural product platform progressed into development, though the timeline from discovery to clinical validation remained long.

**Drug discovery outcomes** have been mixed, reflecting the reality of pharmaceutical development. While no blockbuster drugs directly traced to this specific 2017 methodology have reached widespread clinical use, the broader principle of mining silent biosynthetic pathways has contributed to drug discovery pipelines. Several companies and academic groups have reported promising preclinical candidates, particularly in the antibiotic and antifungal space where natural products have historically been most successful.

The field has seen **increased academic and commercial investment**. The period 2018-2024 witnessed continued publications validating the concept, with reported discoveries including novel antibiotics, anticancer agents, and anti-infectives. However, the "low hanging fruit" problem the author mentioned persisted—finding truly novel scaffolds that offer advantages over existing drugs remained challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: Many cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters could be activatable under the right conditions**

**Outcome: Partially validated with important caveats**
Subsequent research confirmed that stress induction, nutrient manipulation, and genetic approaches can indeed activate silent gene clusters. However, not all clusters proved activatable—some appear to be non-functional evolutionary remnants as originally speculated. The success rate varied greatly by organism and cluster type, with no universal activation method emerging.

**• Prediction: Specific translational repressors could provide a systematic way to turn on more cryptic pathways**

**Outcome: Progress made but not transformative**
Researchers did identify additional regulatory proteins controlling gene cluster silencing, and some common regulatory mechanisms were discovered. However, the complexity proved greater than anticipated—different clusters often use distinct regulatory systems, making universal control approaches difficult. Work continues in this area, but it hasn't yet unlocked systematic access to cryptic natural products at scale.

**• Prediction: Medicinally useful compounds would emerge from these newly discovered cryptic pathways**

**Outcome: Slow but tangible progress**
Some cryptically produced compounds progressed to preclinical development, particularly in antimicrobial applications. However, the timeline from discovery to approved drugs proved long (typically 10+ years), so major therapeutic breakthroughs directly traceable to the 2017 methodology haven't yet reached widespread clinical use. The broader field of natural product drug discovery has seen success, but the specific "cryptic" angle remains a niche approach rather than a dominant discovery paradigm.

**• Implicit prediction: Warp Drive Bio's platform approach would yield valuable discoveries**

**Outcome: Validated but evolved**
The company did advance drug candidates from its natural product platform, and the acquisition by Revolution Medicines validated the scientific approach. However, the business model evolved to encompass broader drug discovery strategies rather than relying solely on cryptic natural products.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article describes an interesting scientific approach with practical applications, but the subject matter is quite specialized and the immediate broader impact is limited. The concept of cryptic natural products represents genuine scientific innovation in natural product drug discovery, and the Princeton work it highlights demonstrated concrete proof-of-concept. However, the field remains relatively niche, with longer-term implications still emerging rather than fully realized.
