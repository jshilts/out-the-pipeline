# Is The FDA the Problem?

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critically examines a perspective presented by Juan Enriquez at an investment symposium that blamed FDA regulations as the primary obstacle preventing cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's despite massive technological advances in drug discovery. Enriquez argued that dramatic improvements—including 100,000-fold cost reductions in protein mapping, 300-fold increases in disease protein databases, and 800-fold increases in available drug-like chemicals per researcher—should have yielded more therapies, but FDA's "bloated" and "hostile-to-innovation" approval process was stifling progress. The author challenges this view, arguing that such advances haven't automatically translated into therapeutic breakthroughs because biological complexity remains far greater than anticipated. The article acknowledges that while the FDA does slow drug development (by design, for safety reasons), the "FDA-as-sole-problem" thesis oversimplifies deeper scientific challenges and may fuel misplaced anger at regulators while raising unrealistic expectations about near-term industry capabilities.

## 2. HISTORY

From 2013 to the present, the biopharmaceutical landscape has evolved significantly while largely confirming the article's nuanced position. Here are the key developments:

**Drug Development Reality:** Despite continued massive investment in genomics, proteomics, and computational methods, major disease areas (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, most cancers) have not seen breakthrough cures. Instead, the industry has pursued more targeted, personalized medicine approaches. The 2010s saw major advances in cancer immunotherapy and targeted therapies, but these typically extend life rather than cure. Alzheimer's drug development suffered repeated high-profile failures (multiple amyloid-targeting antibodies failed) until Aduhelm's controversial accelerated approval in 2021, which remains contentious with limited patient uptake.

**FDA Reform and Flexibility:** The FDA has actually become more flexible since 2013, not more restrictive. Fast-track designations, breakthrough therapy status, accelerated approval pathways, and expanded access programs were increasingly utilized. Immunotherapies like CAR-T cell therapy and checkpoint inhibitors received rapid approvals. By 2020, the FDA approved COVID vaccines in record time through Emergency Use Authorizations.

**Industry Consolidation Confirmed:** Enriquez's observation about companies prioritizing marketing and M&A over R&D proved remarkably prescient. Major pharmaceutical companies continued consolidating through mega-mergers (Bristol Myers-Celgene, AbbVie-Allergan, etc.). R&D productivity per dollar invested remained challenging, though innovative approaches like RNA-based therapeutics, CRISPR gene editing, and antibody-drug conjugates did advance toward clinical use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Enriquez's Implicit Predictions & Reality:**
• **Prediction:** Reduced FDA barriers would unleash a "flood of new therapies" from existing technological advances
  - **Outcome:** **Mostly incorrect** – Even with increased FDA flexibility, no flood materialized. Disease biology complexity remained the limiting factor.

• **Prediction:** Industry focus on marketing/M&A would harm therapeutic innovation if FDA climate didn't improve
  - **Outcome:** **Partially correct** – Consolidation continued, but innovation adapted by focusing on different approaches (immunotherapy, cell therapy, precision medicine) rather than stopping.

• **Prediction:** Alzheimer's and Parkinson's cures should be achievable with available technology if not for regulatory barriers
  - **Outcome:** **Incorrect** – Despite increased FDA flexibility and extensive research investment, effective disease-modifying treatments remain elusive. The 2010s saw numerous failed trials of promising mechanisms.

**Author's Counter-Predictions & Reality:**
• **Prediction:** Biological reality is fundamentally harder than expected; FDA isn't the main bottleneck
  - **Outcome:** **Mostly correct** – The decade confirmed that understanding disease mechanisms, target validation, and bridging preclinical to clinical translation remain huge challenges independent of regulatory speed.

• **Prediction:** Oversimplifying FDA as "the problem" would create unrealistic expectations and misplaced anger
  - **Outcome:** **Correct** – Some constituencies have continued blaming regulators for failures of basic science, but the evidence increasingly shows that most promising new mechanisms fail because the underlying biology and clinical execution remain challenging more than due to regulatory opposition.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article is unusually prescient in articulating a nuanced perspective that has held up over time, correctly diagnosing industry challenges as primarily scientific rather than regulatory while the biopharmaceutical landscape evolved largely as described.
