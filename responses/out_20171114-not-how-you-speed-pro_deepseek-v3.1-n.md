# Not How You Speed the Process Up, Exactly (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes a highly irregular 2016–2017 clinical trial conducted by Dr. William Halford through his company Rational Vaccines. Halford invited 20 herpes patients to St. Kitts to test a putative herpes vaccine, explicitly bypassing FDA oversight, with no institutional review board (IRB), no listed trial on clinicaltrials.gov, unknown manufacturing details, and incomplete records. Some participants reported side effects. A journal peer-review of Halford's manuscript identified severe deficiencies: inadequate IRB oversight, self-reported efficacy data, and questionable statistics.

After the offshore trial concluded, Peter Thiel’s fund invested $7 million in Rational Vaccines, but mandated that all future work comply with FDA standards. The author contends that Halford’s shortcut approach ultimately slowed progress by producing data unlikely to satisfy regulators.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent developments validate the article’s caution. In **2019**, a patient from the St. Kitts trial filed a lawsuit against Rational Vaccines and Halford’s estate, alleging negligence and battery, eventually leading to a **$7.6 million jury award in 2022**. This emphasized the trial’s problematic nature and exposed participants to tangible harms without clear benefits.

Scientifically and clinically, the *theragen*® platform (Rational Vaccines’ lead candidate derived from Halford’s work) has not advanced to late-stage trials or regulatory approval. The firm has not clearly demonstrated robust efficacy in properly controlled studies, and herpes vaccine development overall has remained challenging, with limited new approvals. The unregulated St. Kitts trial produced no credible or transferable data accepted by regulators or the scientific community and instead created legal and reputational setbacks.

Peter Thiel’s investment did not save the flawed program, and Rational Vaccines struggled to deliver FDA-compliant progress. By **2023**, Rational Vaccines filed for **Chapter 11 bankruptcy**, revealing liabilities, including the litigation costs and judgments, that overshadowed its research assets. The firm’s post-Halford pivot to proper regulation proved insufficient, underscoring that regulatory shortcuts rarely accelerate outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: The author suggested the offshore “cowboy” approach would slow rather than speed progress and that only proper, controlled trials could establish whether the vaccine candidate actually works.
  - **Outcome**: Largely **validated**. The shortcut trial produced legally and scientifically unusable data, led to costly litigation, and the candidate under proper oversight has not advanced to approval. Rational Vaccines ultimately went bankrupt, showing the shortcut stalled rather than accelerated a viable herpes vaccine.
- **Prediction**: Comments implied that a herpes vaccine remains worthwhile but challenging to develop.
  - **Outcome**: **On-target**. Herpes vaccines have seen limited breakthroughs; no major new prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine has achieved widespread approval since this article, highlighting persistent scientific and regulatory hurdles.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
The article correctly foresaw that circumventing regulatory standards would backfire, and subsequent lawsuits, scientific failure, and bankruptcy confirm its analysis. It serves as an enduring cautionary case about shortcuts in life-sciences translation.
