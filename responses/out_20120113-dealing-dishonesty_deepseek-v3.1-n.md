# Dealing With Dishonesty (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary discusses small-scale dishonesty within academic labs, such as researchers whose experiments won't reproduce, colleagues who "borrow" reagents without permission, and those who can't produce key procedures when scrutinized. The article's main focus is promoting a specific approach: linking to a University of Nebraska professor's blog post about his technique for dealing with such dishonest lab members, and framing it as "used for good instead of evil." The piece explicitly references laboratory sabotage incidents as context and asks readers to consider whether such methods—when used "carefully and in extreme cases"—are justified. It functions primarily as a discussion prompt rather than a comprehensive analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

The referenced blog post and this commentary appeared in 2011–2012 during a period of growing awareness of research misconduct in biomedicine. Subsequent developments show significant evolution in institutional responses:

- **Increased Institutionalization**: Research institutions and journals have adopted more formalized systems for misconduct reporting, investigation, and resolution.
- **Funding Agency Policies**: Agencies like NIH and NSF strengthened requirements for misconduct training and reporting, with mandatory education for trainees.
- **Technology Changes**: Digital lab notebooks, electronic data capture, and improved record-keeping systems made reagent sharing tracking more transparent.
- **Whistleblower Protection**: Enhanced legal and institutional protections for those reporting misconduct.
- **Formal Channels Emphasis**: The "do-it-yourself justice" approach highlighted in the original article contrasts with modern emphasis on formal HR, ethics committees, and institutional compliance pathways.

No specific treatments or drugs emerged from this discussion, but it contributed to broader cultural changes in how academic labs handle internal disputes and misconduct.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions about future trends in research misconduct handling, but rather posed a philosophical question about the justification of informal methods.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **4/10**

This brief blog commentary touches on an important issue but offers minimal analytical depth or factual content. It serves mainly as a conversation starter about informal approaches to research misconduct, making it moderately interesting in retrospect but limited in scope or impact.
