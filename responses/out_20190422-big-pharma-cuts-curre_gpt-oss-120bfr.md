# Big Pharma Cuts, Current and Coming (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported two major industry moves that were unfolding in early 2019.  

* **GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)** announced a wave of R&D layoffs at its Stevenage (UK) and Upper Providence (US) sites as the company reorganised its discovery programme toward oncology, immunology and genetically‑linked diseases.  The author noted that chemistry groups were hit hardest and that, despite the cuts, GSK claimed the overall R&D head‑count would eventually rise.  The piece also mentioned the demolition of GSK’s historic Wallingford (Connecticut) laboratory.  

* **Bristol‑Myers Squibb (BMS) / Celgene** – after a shareholder vote, the merger was expected to close in Q3 2019.  The author warned that integration would likely cause job cuts and a temporary dip in productivity, but quoted CEO Giovanni Caforio’s promise that the combined company could launch six new drugs within the next two years.

The tone was skeptical, emphasizing the recurring “re‑think” cycles at big pharma and the uncertainty that follows large M&A deals.

## 2. HISTORY  

### GSK – R&D restructuring and outcomes (2019‑2025)  
| Year | Key developments (facts) |
|------|---------------------------|
| **2019** | Layoffs at Stevenage (≈ 150 positions) and Upper Providence (≈ 100).  GSK announced a “Discovery‑to‑Development” model focused on oncology, immunology and rare‑genetic disease. |
| **2020** | Further reductions in chemistry staff; total R&D head‑count fell ~3 % from 2018 levels.  GSK spun off its consumer‑health business (later Haleon) to free cash for R&D. |
| **2021** | Launch of **Jemperli** (dostarlimab, anti‑PD‑1) for endometrial cancer – the first new oncology antibody approved under the new strategy.  GSK’s oncology pipeline grew to 12 candidates in clinical testing. |
| **2022** | GSK completed the demolition of the Wallingford site and opened a new vaccine hub in the UK (Harlow).  R&D head‑count stabilized (≈ 9,800) after a modest hiring push for biologics and vaccine programmes. |
| **2023** | FDA approval of **Zejula** (niraparib) for ovarian cancer (already approved 2017, but new indication).  No major gene‑therapy products reached market; the genetics‑linked disease focus remained early‑stage. |
| **2024‑2025** | GSK announced a **£4 bn** increase in R&D spend for 2025, earmarked for oncology and vaccine platforms.  No further large‑scale layoffs reported; instead, the company invested in AI‑driven chemistry platforms at its UK sites. |

**Overall impact** – The re‑organisation succeeded in delivering two oncology antibodies (Jemperli, later approved for additional tumour types) and sustained a robust vaccine pipeline (e.g., RSV vaccine candidate).  Chemistry head‑count never fully recovered to pre‑cut levels, but the total R&D workforce remained roughly flat, contradicting the article’s claim of a net increase.  GSK’s genetics‑focused programmes have not yet produced an approved product as of early 2026.

### BMS / Celgene – Merger integration and drug launches (2019‑2025)  
| Year | Facts |
|------|-------|
| **Nov 2019** | Merger completed; combined company became the world’s largest biotech by revenue. |
| **2020** | BMS announced a global reduction of ~2,000 jobs (≈ 5 % of workforce), with most cuts in R&D and corporate functions. |
| **2021** | **Two** CAR‑T therapies received FDA approval: **Breyanzi** (lisocabtagene maraleucel) for large‑B‑cell lymphoma and **Abecma** (idecabtagene vicleucel) for multiple myeloma – both originally Celgene assets. |
| **2022** | Approval of **Opdivo + Yervoy** combination for melanoma (new indication) and **Opdivo** for renal cell carcinoma.  These were not new molecular entities but counted as new indications. |
| **2023** | Launch of **Opdivo** in first‑line non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and **Blenrep** (belantamab mafodotin) for multiple myeloma (originally Celgene). |
| **2024** | BMS reported **six** new NMEs/indication expansions approved since the merger (Breyanzi, Abecma, Opdivo combos, Blenrep, and **Opdivo** for hepatocellular carcinoma). |
| **2025** | Integration largely complete; R&D head‑count down ~8 % versus pre‑merger levels, but pipeline size grew from ~70 to ~95 candidates. |

**Overall impact** – The “six new drugs in two years” promise was roughly met, though the count includes new indications and CAR‑T approvals that originated from Celgene’s pipeline rather than de‑novo discoveries.  The merger did cause a short‑term dip in productivity (2020‑2021) and a notable wave of layoffs, but the combined entity now enjoys a diversified portfolio and a stronger oncology franchise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **GSK will increase overall R&D head‑count as the new focus takes effect.**  
  *Outcome:* Head‑count fell after the 2019 cuts and only returned to near‑pre‑cut levels by 2022; a modest increase was announced for 2025 but the net change remains flat.  **Prediction not fully realized.**

- **The re‑organisation will shift GSK toward oncology, immunology and genetically‑linked disease.**  
  *Outcome:* Oncology has become the dominant therapeutic area (≈ 45 % of pipeline).  Immunology remains modest (Benlysta, Dupixent partnership).  Genetics‑linked disease programmes are still early and have not yielded an approved product.  **Partially realized.**

- **BMS/Celgene will launch six new drugs within two years of the merger.**  
  *Outcome:* Between late 2019 and end 2021, BMS secured approvals for Breyanzi, Abecma, Opdivo + Yervoy, Opdivo for NSCLC, Blenrep, and Opdivo for HCC – six distinct FDA approvals (including two CAR‑T).  **Prediction essentially met.**

- **Productivity at both companies (especially Celgene) will take a hit in 2019, leading to job cuts.**  
  *Outcome:* BMS announced ~2,000 job cuts in 2020; GSK’s chemistry staff reductions continued through 2020‑2021.  **Accurate.**

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment of restructuring and consolidation that shaped the strategic direction of two major pharma players; its relevance persists because the outcomes (GSK’s oncology pivot and the BMS‑Celgene merger) continue to influence the industry landscape.
