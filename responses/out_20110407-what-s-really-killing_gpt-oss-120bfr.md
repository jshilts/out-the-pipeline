# What's Really Killing Pharma (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post (originally by Anthony Nicholls on the OpenEye site and highlighted by Derek Lowe) argues that the pharmaceutical industry’s decline in innovative output is rooted in a cultural shift: ever‑larger portions of the budget are being diverted to advertising and direct‑to‑consumer (DTC) marketing rather than to basic research.  According to the author, career advancement in big pharma now rewards “Madison‑Avenue” skills more than bench science.  A second, more provocative claim is that big pharma’s recent attempt to emulate biotech—by touting “lean” structures and “getting things done”—is misguided because the real difference is simply that biotech firms have far fewer senior managers.  The author suggests that if pharma truly wanted biotech‑style productivity, the upper‑management layer should be dramatically reduced, even to the point of resignation.

## 2. HISTORY  
**R&D vs. marketing spend** – From 2011 to the present, the proportion of total pharmaceutical revenue devoted to R&D has remained roughly 15‑20 % in the United States, while marketing (including DTC) has hovered around 10‑12 % of revenue.  The absolute dollar amounts have risen because sales have grown, but the relative split has not dramatically shifted toward marketing as the article feared.  In many large companies, especially after the 2015 “Sunshine Act” transparency rules, the emphasis on physician‑targeted promotion has softened, and some firms have cut marketing staff to re‑allocate resources to precision‑medicine programs.

**Biotech profitability** – Contrary to the claim that biotech “has mostly lost money,” the sector’s financial picture has improved markedly.  Between 2015 and 2023, the number of biotech companies reporting net profits more than doubled (e.g., Gilead Sciences, Amgen, Biogen, Regeneron).  The rise of high‑margin biologics, gene‑therapy platforms, and mRNA technology has turned many previously loss‑making firms into cash‑generating enterprises.  The biotech IPO market also exploded, with over 150 listings between 2015‑2022, indicating investor confidence.

**M&A and “biotech‑style” restructuring** – Large pharma has indeed pursued a “biotech‑like” model by acquiring innovative biotech assets rather than building them internally.  Notable deals include Pfizer’s purchase of Wyeth (2009, pre‑article), Roche’s acquisition of Genentech (2009) and later Spark Therapeutics (2019), and Merck’s purchase of Moderna’s mRNA platform (2020).  However, the management layers in these companies have not been eliminated; instead, they have been integrated into existing corporate hierarchies.  The “lean‑management” ideal has been only partially realized, with most big‑pharma CEOs still overseeing 1,000‑plus employees.

**Innovation outcomes** – The period after 2011 saw several breakthrough approvals that contradict the notion of a stagnant pipeline:  
* 2014 – Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and Nivolumab (Opdivo), first PD‑1 checkpoint inhibitors, became blockbuster immunotherapies.  
* 2017 – Two CAR‑T cell therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta) received FDA approval, representing a new modality largely driven by biotech start‑ups.  
* 2020 – The first mRNA vaccines (Pfizer‑BioNTech, Moderna) were authorized for COVID‑19, a technology that originated in small biotech labs and was rapidly scaled by large pharma partners.  

These products generated billions in sales and spurred a wave of investment in immuno‑oncology, cell therapy, and nucleic‑acid platforms.

**Policy and market shifts** – Value‑based pricing and outcomes‑based contracts have become more common, especially in the United States and Europe, pressuring companies to demonstrate real‑world effectiveness.  This has led to greater reliance on real‑world evidence teams rather than pure marketing.  Nonetheless, DTC advertising remains legal only in the U.S. and New Zealand; spend on TV and print ads has modestly declined since 2015, while digital outreach has grown.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “The path to the top in pharma ceased to be via the lab bench and instead was by way of Madison Avenue.”  
  **Outcome:** Partially true.  While many senior executives now have backgrounds in business development, regulatory affairs, or finance, a substantial number of CEOs (e.g., Albert Bourla at Pfizer, Emma Walmsley at GSK) still have scientific training.  The industry still values scientific credibility, especially for high‑risk modalities.

- **Prediction:** “Biotech ‘gets things done’ and is more productive; big pharma should simply resign its upper‑management to emulate biotech.”  
  **Outcome:** Not realized.  Biotech firms are indeed agile, but the majority of large pharma retain extensive senior‑management structures.  Some companies (e.g., Novartis under Vas Narasimhan) have flattened certain layers, but they have not eliminated upper management en masse.  The suggestion that resignations would “do wonders for innovation” remains speculative and untested.

- **Prediction (implicit):** Shifting budgets toward advertising would cripple drug discovery pipelines.  
  **Outcome:** The pipeline has continued to produce several first‑in‑class therapies, though the overall success rate of Phase III trials has remained low (~10 %).  The industry’s R&D spend has grown in absolute terms, and many breakthrough products have emerged, indicating that advertising has not wholly eclipsed research investment.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a vivid, time‑specific critique of pharma culture that sparked discussion and remains relevant to ongoing debates about R&D efficiency, but its more extreme managerial prescriptions have not materialized, limiting its long‑term prescience.
