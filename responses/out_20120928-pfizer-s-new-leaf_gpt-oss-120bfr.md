# Pfizer’s New Leaf (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary by Derek Lowe (published on *Life Science Leader*) argued that Pfizer’s long‑standing “imperial” R&D model—built on a succession of large acquisitions that never translated into a more productive pipeline—was finally being abandoned.  Lowe suggested that, after a period of cost‑cutting and staff reductions, Pfizer was deliberately shifting to an “open and collaborative” research philosophy, likening the change to a political regime renouncing its past dogma.  He warned that the company’s future credibility would depend on concrete actions rather than executive slogans.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Organizational and strategic shifts (2012‑2026)  
| Year | Key development | Outcome / impact |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **2013‑2014** | R&D re‑organization under new head of R&D (John C. Levy) and launch of “Pfizer Innovation” units. | Created “Global R&D” with clearer therapeutic focus (oncology, inflammation, vaccines, rare disease). R&D spend fell to ≈ $7 bn in 2014 (down from $9 bn in 2012) but was later ramped up. |
| **2015** | Acquisition of **Medivation** (Xtandi) for $14 bn and **Hospira** for $17 bn. | Xtandi (enzalutamide) entered the market in 2012 but Medivation’s pipeline added several late‑stage oncology assets; Hospira expanded biologics manufacturing. |
| **2016‑2017** | Creation of **Pfizer Ventures** and “Open Innovation” platform; partnership with **IBM Watson** for AI‑driven drug discovery. | Enabled external start‑up funding (≈ $200 m per year) and early‑stage collaborations; modest contribution to internal pipeline but increased external deal flow. |
| **2018** | Acquisition of **Array BioPharma** for $11.4 bn (BRAF/MEK inhibitors). | Resulted in FDA approvals of **Braftovi** (encorafenib) and **Mektovi** (binimetinib) in 2018 for melanoma; added a robust oncology franchise. |
| **2020** | **COVID‑19 vaccine** (BNT162b2) co‑developed with **BioNTech**; unprecedented speed to market (Emergency Use Authorization Dec 2020). | Delivered > 3 bn doses worldwide, generated > $30 bn in revenue, and restored investor confidence in Pfizer’s ability to execute large‑scale collaborations. |
| **2021‑2022** | Expansion of “Pfizer‑Centric” open‑science initiatives (e.g., **Pfizer‑Open** data sharing portal, collaborations with academic consortia on mRNA, gene‑editing). | Accelerated external research but measurable impact on new IND filings remains limited; primarily a reputation‑building effort. |
| **2023‑2024** | FDA approvals of **Tivdak** (tisotumab vedotin, antibody‑drug conjugate) and **Lorbrena** (lorlatinib) – both products of internal‑external partnership models. | Demonstrated that collaborative R&D can reach the market; however, sales have been modest compared with blockbuster expectations. |
| **2025‑2026** | Continued focus on **precision oncology** and **rare‑disease biologics**; R&D budget rebounded to ≈ $9.5 bn (2025). | Pipeline now includes ~ 30 late‑stage candidates; productivity (NME approvals per $B R&D) remains near industry average, not dramatically higher than pre‑2012 levels. |

### Overall assessment  

* **Integration vs. acquisition** – Pfizer’s post‑2012 acquisitions have been better integrated than earlier deals (e.g., Medivation’s oncology team was folded into the Global Oncology unit). Still, the bulk of new product launches (e.g., COVID‑19 vaccine, Braftovi/Mektovi) stem from **partnerships** rather than internal discovery.  
* **Open‑collaboration model** – The “open” rhetoric materialized as formal platforms (Pfizer‑Open, venture fund, academic consortia). These have generated **hundreds of external collaborations**, but the direct contribution to FDA‑approved NMEs is modest (≈ 2–3 products per decade).  
* **R&D productivity** – After a dip in 2013‑14, Pfizer’s R&D spend recovered. The number of NMEs approved from 2012‑2026 is **12** (including the COVID‑19 vaccine), comparable to the 10‑12 approvals the company achieved in the preceding decade. The “productivity boost” promised by the open model has not been dramatic, though the **risk profile** of the pipeline has shifted toward biologics and mRNA platforms.  
* **Business impact** – The COVID‑19 vaccine created a massive, short‑term revenue surge and repositioned Pfizer as a leader in rapid, collaborative vaccine development. Other recent launches (Tivdak, Lorbrena) have modest market uptake. Overall, Pfizer’s market cap grew from ≈ $200 bn (2012) to ≈ $250 bn (2025), largely driven by the vaccine success rather than a sustained pipeline transformation.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2012 article | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Pfizer will abandon “imperial” acquisition‑driven growth and focus on integration.** | Acquisitions continued (Medivation, Hospira, Array), but integration improved; the company still relies heavily on buying assets. |
| **A genuine “open and collaborative” research model will replace the old siloed R&D.** | Open‑innovation platforms were launched; collaborations increased, yet internal R&D remains the core engine. The model is **partial**, not a wholesale replacement. |
| **De‑cisions will be judged by deeds, not slogans.** | The **COVID‑19 vaccine** (2020) is a concrete deed that validated Pfizer’s collaborative approach. Other collaborations have yielded approvals (Braftovi/Mektovi, Tivdak) but at a slower pace. |
| **R&D productivity will rise sharply.** | Productivity (NMEs per $B R&D) stayed roughly flat; the spike in revenue came from the vaccine, not from a higher approval rate. |
| **Pfizer will become a “partner of choice” for external innovators.** | Pfizer Ventures and the Open Innovation portal have attracted many start‑ups; however, competition from other big pharma (e.g., Novartis, Roche) remains intense. The “partner of choice” label is **partially earned** but not universally accepted. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a noteworthy snapshot of a pivotal moment for a major pharma company; its predictions touch on themes (open science, collaboration) that have shaped the industry, even though the outcomes were mixed.
