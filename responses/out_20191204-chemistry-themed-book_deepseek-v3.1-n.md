# Chemistry-Themed Books, 2019 (December 4, 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a curated "gift list" of chemistry-themed books for general audiences, written as a holiday recommendation post. The author begins by mentioning their own book, *The Chemistry Book*, and its international editions, then provides extensive recommendations across multiple categories: Theodore Gray's *The Elements* series and related merchandise; popular science books about chemical elements and molecules (*The Disappearing Spoon*, *Periodic Tales*); histories of chemistry and drugs (*The Alchemy of Air*, *Ten Drugs*, *The Poisoner's Handbook*); food and cooking science (*On Food and Cooking*, *The Food Lab*); home chemistry experiment guides (including "mad science" books with hazardous experiments); and science memoirs (*Uncle Tungsten*, *The Periodic Table* by Primo Levi). The tone is personal and conversational, with the author sharing which books they've personally enjoyed or used with their children.

## 2. HISTORY

Since December 2019, several developments occurred in this space:

**Book publishing:** Many of the recommended books remained in print, and several authors published follow-ups:
- Randall Munroe published *What If? 2* in 2022
- Theodore Gray continued releasing companion products
- The home chemistry experiment market saw increased interest during 2020-2021 pandemic lockdowns

**Market trends:** The period 2020-2024 saw a surge in popular science book sales, particularly those that could be used for home education and entertainment. Chemistry education materials, including the "mad science" experiment books mentioned, experienced heightened demand as parents sought hands-on STEM activities for children during remote learning periods.

**Cultural impact:** Several of these books became reference points during public health discussions around COVID-19, particularly those dealing with scientific methodology, chemistry's role in medicine, and food science. Books like Harold McGee's *On Food and Cooking* gained renewed relevance as cooking-at-home increased dramatically.

**Academic and educational adoption:** Many of these titles became standard recommendations in chemistry education circles, used in undergraduate general education courses and informal science outreach programs. The accessibility of these books to non-specialist audiences proved valuable for public science communication efforts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was fundamentally a recommendation list rather than a predictive piece about the biotechnology industry or chemical sciences. It contained no predictions about future scientific developments, drug approvals, policy changes, or business growth. The author's intent was explicitly stated as providing gift suggestions for chemistry enthusiasts, not forecasting trends or outcomes in the field. 

However, if one considers the implicit predictions about which books would remain valuable or popular:
- **Validation:** Many of the recommended books proved to have lasting appeal and remained in print
- **Market confirmation:** The categories identified (elements, food science, chemistry history, experiments) continued to represent viable niches in popular science publishing
- **Educational relevance:** The home experiment books became more relevant than anticipated due to pandemic-driven demand for remote science education resources

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This article is a seasonal book recommendation list rather than a commentary on the biotechnology industry, containing no analysis of scientific developments, business trends, or policy implications relevant to biotechnology.
