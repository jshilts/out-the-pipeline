# Better Drinking Through Chemistry (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a company developing accelerated spirits aging technology. The context is the craft spirits boom, where many small brands actually source their products from large distilleries rather than producing everything themselves. The piece focuses on Bryan Davis's "Model 1 reactor" which aims to replicate the chemical signatures of aged spirits through forced chemical processes rather than traditional barrel aging. The reactor works in three stages: converting short-chain fatty acids into fruity esters, extracting compounds from oak wood by breaking down polymers, and forcing additional esterification to create longer-chain esters typically found in mature spirits. Davis uses mass spectrometry to compare his products' chemical profiles against traditionally aged spirits. The approach is transparent about not being traditionally aged but claims to achieve similar taste profiles, potentially disrupting the spirits market and sparking debates similar to those around processed foods versus molecular gastronomy.

## 2. HISTORY
Lost Spirits Technology, led by Bryan Davis, did in fact commercialize this accelerated aging technology. The company has operated for nearly a decade since this 2014/2015 timeframe. Davis and his company have been transparent about their chemical engineering approach, consistent with the article's description. Key companies have pursued similar technologies, including Cleveland Whiskey and TerraPURE, and the category is sometimes called "precision-aged" spirits. The model has mostly targeted craft distillers and smaller producers rather than replacing the traditional premium aged spirits market. Many spirits produced through these methods have been commercially released. However, the chemistry used is complex industrial engineering involving chemical extraction and esterification reactions that replicate wood aging profiles, rather than the traditional barrel aging process. The technology has remained a niche approach compared to traditional methods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several predictions, explicit and implicit, about developments in the spirits industry:
- **Market disruption prediction**: Suggested accelerated aging could capture part of the traditional distillers' market share.
  - *Outcome*: Traditional aged spirits still dominate the premium market. Time-aged spirits continue to command higher prices and status. The accelerated method has remained a niche approach.
- **Debate over "processed" vs. "artisanal" production**: Predicted similar arguments to processed foods vs. molecular gastronomy.
  - *Outcome*: A contentious debate has indeed emerged, spanning industry, consumers, and regulators similar to the natural wine discussion. Aging method transparency has become a key point of differentiation.
- **Blind taste test challenge**: Implied that chemically similar profiles might be indistinguishable in blind tests.
  - *Outcome*: Complex chemical methods can replicate some aspects of traditional aging, but the broader connotation of aging still affects consumer perception and value.
- **Business model success**: Suggested it could be successful at the right price point.
  - *Outcome*: The technology is still being used in commercial production years later, indicating a successful business exists within a specific market segment.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article was prescient about emerging food technology debates and accurately described a real chemical engineering approach that has had commercial impact in the spirits industry, even if the disruption was more limited than suggested.
