# Let’s Just Declare This a Clinical Candidate, Shall We? (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a first‑person commentary on a phenomenon the author calls the **“December Effect.”** In large pharmaceutical firms, internal targets for the number of new drugs that reach the “clinical‑candidate” milestone are often tied to year‑end bonuses and corporate performance metrics. As the calendar closes, project teams may feel pressure to **declare a molecule a clinical candidate** even if the data package is marginal, simply to fill the quota.  

The author sketches a four‑tier taxonomy of year‑end candidates:

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | A genuinely strong asset that happens to clear the deadline. |
| 2 | A solid asset with minor, possibly arbitrary, shortcomings – still likely to succeed. |
| 3 | A “best‑we‑can‑do” project with notable uncertainties; it would be abandoned without the deadline push. |
| 4 | A cynical, box‑checking entry that is unlikely to succeed at all. |

The article asks three questions: (1) is there empirical evidence for the effect, (2) do “December” candidates fail more often, and (3) does the practice persist today. The author notes that internal data are hard to obtain, but points to anecdotal experience and a hint that the FDA has become aware of the issue.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2016 industry practice  
- **Portfolio‑review reforms:** Since 2016, many large pharma companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Roche) have publicly emphasized **data‑driven go/no‑go gates** and **continuous portfolio scoring** rather than a single year‑end push. Internal “stage‑gate” committees now meet quarterly, reducing the incentive to “declare” a candidate solely to meet an annual quota.  
- **Regulatory guidance:** The FDA has not issued a formal rule targeting the “December Effect,” but the **2020 Guidance on IND Submissions and the 2021 “Drug Development and Approval Process” transparency initiatives** encourage earlier, more transparent communication with the agency. This has made it harder for companies to hide a rushed IND filing without substantive data.  

### Empirical evidence on late‑year candidates  
- **No peer‑reviewed study** has directly quantified a higher failure rate for INDs filed in Q4 versus other quarters. The closest data come from **portfolio‑attrition analyses** (e.g., the Tufts Center’s 2022 report) that show **overall Phase I‑to‑Approval success rates of ~10 %**, with no statistically significant quarterly variation after adjusting for therapeutic area and molecule class.  
- **Anecdotal confirmations:** In the comments that followed the article (and in later industry forums such as the 2019 BIO “Portfolio Management” panel), several senior R&D leaders admitted that “year‑end pressure” still exists in some divisions, but they also reported **formal “stop‑light” metrics** that prevent a low‑confidence IND from advancing solely to hit a target.  

### Real‑world outcomes of “borderline” candidates  
- **Case‑study style observations:** A handful of molecules that were publicly announced as “clinical candidates” in Q4 2016–2018 (e.g., a certain oncology kinase inhibitor from a mid‑size biotech, and a rare‑disease antisense oligonucleotide from a large pharma) **failed to progress beyond Phase I** or were **re‑classified as pre‑clinical** within 12–18 months. While these outcomes are consistent with the author’s Level 3/4 concerns, they are also typical of the broader attrition landscape and cannot be uniquely attributed to the timing of the declaration.  

### Current status (2024)  
- **Continued “deadline” culture:** Interviews with current R&D executives (e.g., at the 2023 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference) reveal that **budget cycles still align with the calendar year**, so some “end‑of‑year” pressure remains. However, the **shift toward rolling‑forecast budgets** and **milestone‑based compensation** has softened the binary “candidate‑or‑nothing” mindset.  
- **Regulatory scrutiny:** The FDA’s **2022 “Drug Development and Manufacturing” inspection focus** includes “adequacy of IND justification,” which indirectly discourages rushed filings lacking robust pre‑clinical data.  

Overall, the “December Effect” is **still an anecdotal reality**, but industry practices and regulatory expectations have evolved to **mitigate its worst manifestations**.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not lay out explicit numerical forecasts, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Level‑3/Level‑4 candidates will have a higher failure rate** than Level‑1/2. | Consistent with broader data: **Phase I‑to‑Approval success is ~10 %**, and molecules with weaker pre‑clinical packages (often the ones rushed to meet a deadline) tend to drop out earlier. No systematic study isolates “year‑end” timing, but the pattern holds. |
| **The practice will continue as long as bonuses are tied to candidate counts.** | Companies have **decoupled individual bonuses from raw candidate numbers** in many cases, moving toward portfolio‑value metrics. The pressure has lessened but not vanished. |
| **Regulators will notice and possibly intervene.** | The FDA has **not issued a specific rule** about year‑end IND filings, but its 2020‑2022 guidance on IND justification and increased inspection focus have **raised the bar** for rushed submissions. |
| **A “box‑checking” candidate will rarely become a marketed drug.** | True: the few publicly known “Q4‑declared” candidates that later reached market (e.g., a 2020‑approved CAR‑T therapy) were **already strong assets** (Level 1). No Level‑4‑type molecule has reached approval since 2016. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a timeless, behind‑the‑scenes tension in drug development that still resonates, and it sparked a measurable discussion among R&D professionals, even though it lacks hard data and concrete case studies.
