# Changes in Papers (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from Science Magazine's blog highlights an analysis by François-Xavier Coudert examining how papers in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) evolved over five decades. The post references Coudert's blog findings that showed clear trends: a significant increase in the number of authors per paper, with single-author papers becoming nearly extinct. Additionally, reference lists had grown substantially longer. The author notes these changes likely reflect both the expansion of scientific literature and the technological shift from manual bibliography management (bound volumes and index cards) to digital tools that make citing references easier. The post is framed as a preview, with the expectation that Coudert would publish additional charts and analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in this 2014 article have continued and intensified over the subsequent decade. **Authorship patterns** have evolved further toward team science: by the mid-to-late 2010s, multi-author and multi-institutional papers became the dominant form in chemistry and across most scientific fields, with single-author papers now exceptionally rare outside theoretical or computational work. The rise of massive international collaborations (often with hundreds or even thousands of co-authors) became more common, particularly in interdisciplinary areas like materials science and chemical biology.

**Reference lists** continued to expand due to several factors: the growth of scientific literature (with tens of thousands of new papers published daily), the increased pressure to cite comprehensively, and improved digital tools (reference managers like Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote became standard). Open-access mandates and the availability of full-text archives made it easier to find and cite papers, further inflating bibliographies.

**Technological changes** that accelerated these trends included: widespread adoption of collaborative writing platforms (Google Docs, Overleaf for LaTeX), preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv, chemRxiv launched in 2017), and institutional repositories. The shift to digital-first publishing eliminated physical page limits, allowing longer papers with more extensive references. Post-publication peer review and commenting platforms (like PubPeer) also emerged, adding new layers to scholarly communication that weren't captured in traditional co-authorship metrics.

**Policy responses** began addressing authorship concerns: journals and funding agencies increasingly required explicit author contribution statements, and some institutions implemented ORCID identifiers to properly attribute work. However, concerns about "guest authorship" and inappropriate citation practices persisted, with occasional scandals involving paper mills and citation manipulation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

While this short blog post did not make explicit predictions, it implicitly suggested that the trends identified would likely continue:

- **Implicit prediction: Single-author papers would remain rare or disappear entirely**
  - **Accuracy**: ✓ **Largely correct** - Single-author papers in chemistry and most experimental sciences have indeed become extremely rare, limited primarily to theoretical studies, methodology papers, or invited commentaries.

- **Implicit prediction: Reference lists would continue growing longer**
  - **Accuracy**: ✓ **Correct** - Average reference counts increased substantially across JACS and other top chemistry journals throughout the 2010s, often exceeding 100 references per paper in review articles.

- **Implicit suggestion: More detailed analysis was forthcoming from Coudert**
  - **Accuracy**: ✓ **Partially fulfilled** - Coudert and other researchers did publish additional quantitative analyses of scholarly publishing trends in subsequent years, though the specific blog series referenced may not have continued in the originally envisioned format.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **3/10**

This brief post captures trends that were already well-documented by 2014 and lacks the depth or predictive insight that would make it highly relevant today. While the underlying phenomenon of increasing collaboration in science remains significant, the post itself provides minimal original analysis and functions more as a short commentary on existing data.
