# Epigenetics Is Not What You Would Call a Settled Field (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article examines the state of epigenetics research in 2017, focusing on the challenges and uncertainties surrounding noncanonical nucleobases as epigenetic markers. The piece highlights DNA methylation, particularly 5-methylcytidine derivatives (m5dC, 5-hydroxymethyl, 5-formyl, and 5-carboxyl), as important epigenetic regulators that modify transcription and translation.

The article reports on a controversial finding from the Carrell group in Munich published in Angewandte Chemie, which used sensitive LC/MS assays to investigate unusual nucleobases in mice. While confirming the presence of four previously known noncanonical bases, the Munich researchers were unable to detect two newly reported bases - N 6-methyldeoxyadenosine (m6dA) and N 4-methyldeoxycytidine (m4dC) - in mouse brain tissue, liver, or stem cells. This contradicted earlier reports claiming these bases existed in higher organisms, suggesting the field was experiencing reproducibility issues and scientific controversy.

The author notes that the drug industry's initial excitement about epigenetics had "died down some" by 2017 due to unexpected difficulties, with histone deacetylases being among the first epigenetic targets pursued, though progress had been "highly varied."

## 2. HISTORY
**Methodological Advances and Validation:**
In the years following 2017, the epigenetics field saw significant methodological improvements. Ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry and sequencing techniques became more widespread, helping resolve some of the controversies around detecting low-abundance modified bases. The debate around m6dA (N6-methyladenine) in mammalian systems was largely settled - while present at very low levels, these modifications proved to be more prominent in bacteria than mammals, though they do play roles in specific mammalian contexts.

**Clinical and Drug Development Outcomes:**
The epigenetic drug landscape evolved significantly post-2017. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which the article mentions as early targets, saw continued use and development:
- Vorinostat (mentioned in the article) remained FDA-approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
- Additional HDAC inhibitors gained approval: belinostat (2014), panobinostat (2015), and tazemetostat (2020, an EZH2 inhibitor targeting histone methylation)
- These drugs found their main applications in hematological cancers, with more limited success in solid tumors

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine, decitabine) continued as standard-of-care for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.

**Emerging Targets and Technologies:**
The field expanded beyond the modifications discussed in the article. m6A RNA methylation emerged as a major research area (different from the DNA modifications mentioned), with significant implications for gene regulation. CRISPR-based epigenome editing technologies developed rapidly, allowing targeted manipulation of epigenetic marks.

**Commercial and Research Landscape:**
While the article noted that industry excitement had "died down some," the field actually experienced sustained investment. Companies like Epizyme (focused on histone methyltransferase inhibitors), Constellation Pharmaceuticals (later acquired), and others continued developing epigenetic therapies. The challenge remained that epigenetic targets often affect multiple genes simultaneously, making drug development complex.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit and explicit predictions about epigenetics development:

- **"Those working on the possible applications of all this to human disease would be well advised to wait for the dust to settle!"**
  - **Outcome:** Partially accurate. The field did see significant clarification of the controversial base modifications within 2-3 years, with better detection methods settling debates. However, drug development continued aggressively rather than waiting.

- **Implicit prediction that m6dA and m4dC in mammals would prove controversial:**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. Research confirmed these modifications exist at very low levels in mammals but lacked the widespread biological significance initially claimed. The controversy helped drive methodological improvements.

- **Implicit prediction that histone modification drugs would continue expanding:**
  - **Outcome:** Partially accurate. While HDAC inhibitors maintained their niche in hematological cancers, the hoped-for breakthrough into solid tumors largely failed to materialize. New targets like EZH2 did emerge as viable.

- **Implicit prediction that nucleobase modification mechanisms would remain "frontier areas":**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. Research continued expanding into RNA modifications (m6A, m5C, etc.) post-2017, revealing extensive epigenetic-like regulation at the RNA level that wasn't fully appreciated in 2017.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article captures an important moment of scientific self-correction in epigenetics, highlighting how the field wrestled with reproducibility questions that would become increasingly important across biomedical research. While focused on a specific methodological controversy, it presciently noted the field's broader challenges that would continue impacting drug development.
