# Just How Worthless Are the Standard Alzheimer's Models? (Sep 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary argued that the transgenic mouse lines that over‑express human amyloid‑precursor protein (APP) or presenilin have become a “dead‑end” for Alzheimer’s research. Those models, the author claimed, generate amyloid pathology only because the proteins are forced to high, non‑physiological levels, which in turn cause membrane disruption and a spurious rise in the p25 fragment that activates CDK5.  

A Japanese consortium had recently introduced knock‑in mice in which the endogenous mouse App gene is edited to carry the same point mutations found in early‑onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., the APP^NL‑G‑F line). These mice produce amyloid at near‑physiological expression levels, develop plaques, but do **not** show the p25 elevation seen in the over‑expression strains. The article suggested that the knock‑in mice might finally provide a faithful platform for phenotypic screens, while simultaneously casting doubt on the relevance of the thousands of papers that relied on the older over‑expression models.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Adoption of knock‑in models** – Since 2014 the APP^NL‑F and APP^NL‑G‑F knock‑in lines (Saido lab, RIKEN) have been distributed worldwide. By 2020 they were routinely used in pre‑clinical testing of amyloid‑targeting antibodies (e.g., aducanumab, lecanemab) and small‑molecule BACE inhibitors. Their main advantage—physiological APP expression—has been confirmed: plaque burden, soluble Aβ oligomers, and neuroinflammation resemble human pathology more closely than over‑expression lines, while overt neuronal loss remains modest.

**Continued reliance on over‑expression mice** – Despite the criticism, the older Tg2576, APP/PS1, and 5xFAD lines remain heavily used because they develop robust plaque and tau phenotypes faster, facilitating short‑term studies. The field now treats them as “high‑throughput” models, acknowledging their limitations rather than discarding them outright.

**Clinical translation** – The period after 2016 saw a wave of amyloid‑directed therapeutics entering late‑stage trials. Aducanumab received accelerated FDA approval in 2021; lecanemab followed in 2023. Both were tested pre‑clinically in knock‑in mice as well as in over‑expression models, but the modest clinical benefit (≈ 0.3–0.5 points on the ADAS‑Cog) underscored that even the more “physiological” knock‑in mice do not fully predict human outcomes.

**p25/CDK5** – The p25‑CDK5 axis has not become a major therapeutic focus. Subsequent studies (e.g., 2018‑2022) showed that p25 elevation is variable across human cohorts and that genetic or pharmacologic CDK5 inhibition yields mixed results in mouse models, including knock‑ins. The field has shifted toward broader neuroinflammatory and tau‑centric pathways.

**Broader methodological shift** – By the early 2020s, many groups supplemented mouse work with human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‑derived neurons, brain organoids, and single‑cell transcriptomics. These approaches aim to capture human‑specific aspects (e.g., APOE4 effects) that mouse genetics cannot model.

**Business and funding impact** – Companies that built pipelines around over‑expression mouse data (e.g., several BACE‑inhibitor programs) suffered high‑profile failures (e.g., verubecestat, atabecestat) between 2017‑2020, prompting investors to demand more translationally relevant models. Funding agencies (NIH, EU Horizon) began to prioritize projects that incorporate knock‑in mice or human‑based systems, but the overall investment in Alzheimer’s therapeutics continued to rise, reaching > $15 billion annually by 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“The over‑expression models are largely artifacts; the new knock‑in mice will become the gold standard and invalidate much prior work.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. Knock‑in mice are now a preferred mechanistic platform, but over‑expression lines are still widely used for rapid screening. Prior literature has not been “invalidated” en masse; rather, results are re‑interpreted with the models’ limitations in mind.

- **Prediction:** *“p25 elevation is a spurious read‑out of membrane disruption and will disappear as a focus.”*  
  **Outcome:** Largely accurate. The p25/CDK5 signal is now considered a secondary phenomenon, and few new drug programs target it directly.

- **Prediction:** *“The knock‑in mice will quickly lead to successful phenotypic screens and new therapies.”*  
  **Outcome:** The knock‑in models have contributed to pre‑clinical validation of amyloid antibodies, but no therapy can be directly traced to a phenotypic screen performed exclusively in those mice. Clinical success has been modest, indicating that the models alone were insufficient.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“The field will need to rethink reliance on mouse models altogether.”*  
  **Outcome:** The field has indeed diversified: mouse knock‑ins, human iPSC/ organoid systems, and computational models now coexist. The critique helped accelerate this diversification.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article correctly highlighted a fundamental flaw in a dominant pre‑clinical system and anticipated a shift toward more physiological mouse models—a view that has shaped research practice. Its impact is notable, though the ultimate clinical breakthroughs have been limited, tempering the long‑term significance.
