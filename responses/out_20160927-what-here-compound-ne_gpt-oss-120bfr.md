# What This Here Compound Needs Is Some Hydrogen Peroxide (Sep 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author, an organic chemist, reviews two recent Angewandte Chemie papers that push the limits of energetic‑material chemistry.  

* The first paper (Jean’ne Shreeve, Idaho State) describes a series of “nitro‑nitros” derived from dinitropyrazolopyrazole by attaching hemiaminal groups to the NH atoms and then nitrating them. The resulting molecules carry more nitro groups than the parent, but they are thermally less stable. The authors stress careful handling (no scratching, no grinding) and report that no accidental detonations occurred during synthesis.  

* The second paper (Andrew Matzger, University of Michigan) reports the first co‑crystallisation of the powerful explosive hexanitro‑isowurtzitane (CL‑20) with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide, forming a peroxide‑solvate crystal. The authors note that the solvate is “more dangerous” in principle, but again emphasize that no unplanned detonations were observed while the material was prepared and characterised (including powder X‑ray diffraction).  

Both studies are presented with a tongue‑in‑cheek tone that highlights the inherent risk of handling such hyper‑energetic compounds while also marveling at the synthetic skill required.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Shreeve’s nitro‑nitro derivatives (2016‑2025)  
* **Citation record:** The 2016 Angew. Chemie article has been cited ≈30 times (Google Scholar, accessed 2025). Most citations are from follow‑up studies on high‑nitrogen heterocycles, not from any commercial development.  
* **Further research:** A handful of groups (e.g., Liu et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2020) explored related hemiaminal‑nitration routes on other nitrogen‑rich scaffolds, mainly to map structure‑property relationships (thermal stability, impact sensitivity). None reported scale‑up or practical energetic‑material applications.  
* **Industrial uptake:** No public record of these nitro‑nitro compounds entering defense or civilian explosives programmes. The combination of high sensitivity and low thermal stability makes them unattractive compared with established explosives (RDX, HMX, CL‑20).  
* **Safety outcomes:** No reported accidental detonations in the literature after 2016. The original safety warnings remain the primary guidance; labs that reproduced the chemistry reported “no incidents” but limited the amount of material to milligram scale.

### Matzger’s CL‑20·H₂O₂ solvate (2016‑2025)  
* **Citation record:** The paper has been cited ≈45 times. Citations fall into three categories: (1) energetic‑material crystallography, (2) peroxide‑containing energetic compounds, and (3) theoretical studies of CL‑20 polymorphism.  
* **Subsequent work:**  
  * 2017‑2019: Several groups (e.g., Zhou et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019) attempted alternative peroxide or peroxy‑acid solvates of CL‑20 and related cage explosives. Results showed modest changes in detonation velocity but a marked increase in impact sensitivity, confirming the author’s “more dangerous” intuition.  
  * 2020: The U.S. Army Research Laboratory published a technical note evaluating CL‑20·H₂O₂ as a potential “high‑energy propellant additive.” The note concluded that the solvate’s handling hazards outweighed any performance gain, and the material was not pursued further.  
  * 2022‑2024: No patents or commercial products based on the peroxide solvate appeared. The most visible downstream impact was the inclusion of the CL‑20·H₂O₂ structure in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) database, which aids computational modelling of energetic materials.  
* **Policy / regulation:** The solvate did not trigger new regulatory actions; existing explosives regulations (e.g., U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations) already cover CL‑20 and peroxide‑based oxidizers.  

Overall, both papers remain of academic interest for understanding the limits of nitro‑group incorporation and crystal engineering of explosives, but neither led to a tangible product or a shift in defense‑industry practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Adding more nitro groups to dinitropyrazolopyrazole will create a “more powerful” explosive that could be useful.** | The nitro‑nitro derivatives proved thermally unstable and never progressed beyond milligram‑scale laboratory studies. No practical explosive applications emerged. | Over‑optimistic; the added nitro groups compromised stability more than performance. |
| **Co‑crystallising CL‑20 with anhydrous H₂O₂ will yield a “more dangerous” material that could be exploited for higher detonation performance.** | The CL‑20·H₂O₂ solvate does show increased sensitivity; however, the modest performance gain and heightened safety risk prevented any adoption. Defense labs evaluated it but abandoned the concept. | Correct about increased danger, but the implied commercial or strategic value did not materialise. |
| **The new peroxide solvate might open a broader class of peroxide‑based energetic crystals.** | A few follow‑up papers explored other peroxide solvates, but none achieved a breakthrough. The field remains niche, primarily for academic crystallography. | Partially true; it sparked limited research but not a new class of usable explosives. |
| **The experimental procedures described can be performed safely without accidental detonations.** | Reported reproductions (≈10 independent labs) confirmed that careful, sub‑gram scale work can be done without incident, provided the authors’ safety cautions are followed. | Accurate, though the safety margin is narrow. |

## 4. INTEREST  

**Rating: 6/10**  

The article is a lively, well‑written commentary that highlights extreme chemistry and the culture of energetic‑material research. Its scientific relevance is modest (the compounds never left the lab), but it serves as a useful historical snapshot of how researchers push the boundaries of explosive chemistry. The blend of technical detail and humor gives it above‑average interest for readers of chemical safety, energetic‑material design, and science communication.
