I'll analyze this 2015 Science Magazine article about Valeant Pharmaceuticals using our benefit of hindsight to see how its claims and predictions fared.

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the emerging scandal around Valeant Pharmaceuticals in October 2015, focusing on questionable practices that were coming to light. The author details evidence of deceptive tactics including companies with hidden Valeant connections sharing phone numbers and websites, prescriptions being mailed to states where their pharmacies weren't licensed (by pretending to be different entities), employees working under comic-book superhero aliases at specialty pharmacies, and general lack of transparency about these relationships to investors.

The article critiques Valeant's entire business model: acquiring companies through debt financing, eliminating R&D spending entirely, and funding operations through steep drug price increases. The author uses biological metaphors (viruses and remoras) to argue that such a "free-riding" parasitic business model has natural size limitations and that Valeant was likely exceeding these limits, necessitating increasingly aggressive tactics.

## 2. HISTORY

The Valeant saga unfolded dramatically after this article's publication, culminating in one of the largest pharmaceutical scandals of the decade. Here's what happened subsequent to October 2015:

**The Collapse (2015-2016)**: Valeant's stock plummeted from over $260 per share in August 2015 to under $30 by March 2016, losing roughly 90% of its value in about six months. CEO Michael Pearson and CFO Howard Schiller were forced out in 2016 amid multiple investigations.

**Regulatory Fallout**: The company faced investigations from multiple government agencies including the SEC, FBI, and various state attorneys general. The specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services, mentioned in the article as using superhero aliases, was revealed to be essentially a Valeant-controlled entity operating deceptively to maximize insurance reimbursements.

**Business Model Failure**: Valeant's debt-fueled acquisition strategy collapsed under the weight of over $30 billion in debt. The company was forced to sell off numerous assets to repay creditors, including Bausch + Lomb (which it had acquired for $8.7 billion in 2013) and other major divisions.

**Legal Consequences**: By March 2018, Valeant (which changed its name to Bausch Health Companies in 2018) agreed to pay $58 million to settle SEC charges of accounting fraud and disclosure failures. Multiple executives faced individual consequences, though many escaped criminal prosecution.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Matched Reality**:
1. **Stock Collapse**: The article predicted the stock would "hit the floor again like a frozen turkey," which proved prescient as Valeant lost roughly 90% of its value over the following year.

2. **Business Model Unsustainability**: The author's biological metaphor about viruses and remoras not growing to shark size proved remarkably insightful. Valeant's parasitic business model—acquiring innovative companies while eliminating their R&D—indeed hit natural limits and ultimately collapsed under its own weight.

3. **Creative Aggression**: The prediction that such tactics weren't "what stockholders thought they were signing up for" was validated when investor lawsuits and regulatory investigations revealed systematic deception.

**Predictions That Were Too Optimistic**:
1. The author perhaps underestimated the scale of the eventual collapse and the length of time Valeant would continue operating (though under different leadership and with massive restructuring).

2. The article didn't fully anticipate how many years of legal and regulatory consequences would follow, nor the broader industry impact on discussions about drug pricing transparency.

## 4. INTEREST SCORE: 8/9

This article merits a high score (8/9) for several reasons:

**Exceptional Prescience**: The author's analysis of Valeant's business model proved remarkably insightful. The biological metaphor about parasites hitting natural size limits was not only creative but accurately predicted the company's eventual collapse.

**Early Recognition**: This article appeared when Valeant was still largely viewed by many investors as a successful company, making its critical analysis particularly valuable in hindsight.

**Broader Implications**: The article correctly identified deeper issues about business model sustainability that extended beyond Valeant to broader questions about pharmaceutical industry practices, predatory pricing, and the importance of genuine R&D.

**Impact Assessment**: While the author couldn't predict the exact timeline or scale of consequences, the fundamental analysis proved correct: Valeant's model was unsustainable and its tactics were indeed "creatively aggressive" in ways that ultimately destroyed shareholder value rather than creating it.

The article loses one point only because it understandably couldn't predict the specific regulatory outcomes and timeline, but as critical analysis of business fundamentals and corporate ethics, it was remarkably prescient.
