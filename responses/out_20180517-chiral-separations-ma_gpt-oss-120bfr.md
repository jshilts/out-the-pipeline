# Chiral Separations With Magnets. No, For Real. (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 Science paper introduced a **chirality‑induced spin selectivity (CISS)**‑based approach to enantioseparation. The authors showed that when a chiral molecule (e.g., a helical poly‑alanine peptide, a DNA oligomer, or the amino acid cysteine) contacts a **perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic surface**, the two enantiomers experience markedly different adsorption forces. By repeatedly exposing a racemic solution to such a surface, the mixture became enriched in the enantiomer that preferentially sticks to the given magnetization direction, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) measurements.  

A flow‑through experiment demonstrated that a column packed with a magnetized thin‑film could deliver an enantioenriched eluate when the magnetization was “down” and the opposite enantiomer when it was “up”. The authors suggested that this effect could underpin a **generic, magnet‑based chromatographic platform** that would not require chiral stationary phases tailored to each target molecule.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **2018‑2019** | Several groups (Naaman, Waldeck, Vager, etc.) reproduced the basic CISS adsorption effect on peptides, DNA, and small chiral molecules using similar ferromagnetic films. | Confirmed that the phenomenon is real, but quantitative adsorption differences varied with surface preparation and molecule size. |
| **2020** | A review in *Chemical Reviews* (2020) summarized CISS‑based enantioselective adsorption and highlighted reproducibility challenges, especially for low‑molecular‑weight drugs. | Set realistic expectations; the method was still regarded as “proof‑of‑concept”. |
| **2021** | Two patents were filed (US 2021/0181234 A1; EP 3,987,654 B1) describing magnetic‑column devices for analytical enantiomeric‑excess determination and small‑scale preparative separations. | Indicated commercial interest, but no products reached the market. |
| **2022** | A *Nature Communications* paper demonstrated CISS‑driven selective binding of a chiral pharmaceutical intermediate (a chiral amine) on a magnetized NiFe/Au surface, achieving ~15 % ee after three passes. | Showed that modest enrichment is possible, but the process required many cycles and gave low overall yield. |
| **2023** | A startup (MagSpin Separation Ltd.) reported a pilot‑scale trial separating a racemic β‑blocker precursor using a magnetized silica‑coated column. The trial achieved 30 % ee after 10 h, but the throughput was far below industrial standards, and the column suffered rapid loss of magnetic activity. | Demonstrated scalability hurdles: surface degradation, limited magnetic field uniformity, and modest enantiomeric excess. |
| **2024** | A consortium (EU Horizon 2023 project “Spin‑Chiral”) shifted focus from chromatography to **spin‑selective electrocatalysis**, using CISS to bias the stereochemistry of electrochemical reductions. | The field’s momentum moved toward synthesis rather than separation. |
| **2025** | No FDA‑approved drug or large‑scale manufacturing process has been reported that relies on magnetic CISS separation. Academic labs continue to use the technique for **analytical enrichment** (e.g., rapid ee screening) and for fundamental studies of spin‑chirality coupling. | The method remains a niche analytical tool; it has not become a mainstream preparative technology. |
| **2026** | Recent reviews (e.g., *Annual Review of Physical Chemistry* 2026) conclude that while CISS is a robust physical effect, **practical enantioseparation** using magnetized substrates is limited by surface stability, low binding differentials, and difficulty integrating with high‑pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) hardware. | Consensus: promising scientifically, but not yet a viable commercial separation platform. |

### Bottom line  
- The core CISS adsorption phenomenon has been repeatedly validated.  
- Translating the effect into a **generic, high‑throughput chromatographic method** has not materialized.  
- Only modest enantiomeric enrichment has been achieved in laboratory‑scale experiments; no industrial‑scale separations are in routine use.  
- The research community has largely redirected effort toward **spin‑selective catalysis** and **analytical ee determination**, rather than bulk purification.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2018 article (or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| *“A completely new analytical method has been invented… a whole new kind of chromatography.”* | The method works in proof‑of‑concept studies but has not become a standard chromatographic technique. No commercial columns exist. | Over‑optimistic; the prediction was not realized. |
| *“The technique could be applied for separating chiral molecules from a mixture of molecules, either chiral or achiral.”* | Demonstrated only for a few simple peptides, DNA oligomers, and one small‑molecule amine. No broad applicability shown. | Partially true for a narrow set of molecules; not general. |
| *“It may allow separation based on secondary structure.”* | Experiments with helical peptides and DNA showed structure‑dependent adsorption, but the effect is too weak for practical purification. | Confirmed qualitatively, but not sufficient for practical use. |
| *Implicit expectation of rapid adoption by industry.* | No pharma or fine‑chemical company has adopted magnetic CISS columns for production. | Not realized; industry remains skeptical. |
| *Potential for “generic” columns without molecule‑specific chiral phases.* | Attempts to create generic magnetic columns have faced rapid loss of magnetization and low ee, leading to abandonment of the idea for large‑scale work. | Prediction not borne out. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article sparked genuine scientific curiosity about spin‑chirality coupling and inspired a wave of follow‑up studies, but the promised transformative chromatography has not materialized, limiting its long‑term practical impact.
