# Element Shortages, Really Light and Really Heavy (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses two contrasting element shortages occurring in 2013. At the light end, a helium shortage was causing prices to triple due to the impending shutdown of the U.S. strategic helium reserve. The author argued this was primarily an infrastructure and pricing gap problem rather than a fundamental supply issue, noting that natural gas production could provide more helium with proper investment, and pointing to Air Liquide's new Qatar liquefaction plant as evidence that supply would meet demand "at a price."

At the heavy end, the article described a genuine shortage of plutonium-238, critical for deep space missions where it powers radiothermal generators due to its ideal decay properties (87.7 year half-life, high energy, alpha emission). With Russia having halted sales to the U.S. and existing stockpiles dwindling, proposed missions like a Europa orbiter requiring 22 kg faced uncertainty. Restarting production was described as extremely challenging, requiring expensive processing of neptunium-237 from spent nuclear fuel with projected output of only 1.5 kg annually.

## 2. HISTORY
The helium situation evolved largely as predicted. The U.S. Strategic Helium Reserve did not shut down as quickly as anticipated in 2013—Congress passed legislation in 2013 delaying the closure, and the reserve continued operating well beyond initial projections. The last of the helium auctions from the reserve occurred in 2019, with full privatization delayed until 2021. Air Liquide's Qatar facility did come online and contributed to global supply, but price volatility continued. Major scientific facilities dependent on helium (particularly NMR instruments and MRI machines) faced ongoing cost pressures throughout the 2010s. The key insight—that this was an infrastructure/pricing problem rather than absolute scarcity—proved accurate; helium prices saw multiple cycles of spikes and stabilization as industrial capacity adjusted.

For plutonium-238, concrete developments occurred that reflected the article's urgency. The DOE significantly stepped up Pu-238 production efforts at Oak Ridge National Laboratory starting around 2015. The restart faced delays typical of nuclear infrastructure projects but achieved important milestones. By 2015-2016, NASA and DOE signed agreements to accelerate production. In December 2015, Oak Ridge produced its first new Pu-238 in nearly 30 years, a crucial proof of capability. Production gradually ramped up over subsequent years, reaching roughly 400-500 grams annually by 2019-2020—below the 1.5 kg/year target but demonstrating progress. This renewed supply directly enabled NASA's next major planetary missions, particularly the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and the planned Europa Clipper mission, both requiring Pu-238 powered RTGs. These missions proceeded, avoiding the scenario where lack of Pu-238 would cancel deep space exploration.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several specific predictions:

• **Helium shortage as temporary pricing/infrastructure issue**: **Mostly accurate**. Prices did fluctuate and infrastructure investments (including Qatar) helped stabilize supply, though timeline extended longer than implied.

• **Air Liquide's Qatar plant solving capacity**: **Partially accurate**. The plant contributed to global supply but didn't immediately resolve shortages; helium markets remained volatile through the late 2010s.

• **"Cheap helium will be in short supply for a few years"**: **Accurate in substance, underestimated duration**. The adjustment period lasted longer than "a few years," with significant price impacts continuing through 2018-2019.

• **Plutonium-238 production restart would proceed but only at ~1.5 kg/year**: **Directionally accurate, overestimated initial capacity**. Production did restart at Oak Ridge but at lower initial rates (~0.4-0.5 kg/year versus 1.5 kg/year), though this still enabled critical missions.

• **Deep space missions depending on Pu-238 availability**: **Accurate**. Europa Clipper and Mars 2020 missions proceeded with revitalized Pu-238 supply, validating that production restart was essential to continued planetary exploration.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article addresses two important but niche commodity issues with different underlying dynamics (infrastructure/economics versus genuine scarcity), and correctly diagnoses that one represents a solvable supply chain problem while the other requires restarting nuclear production. The predictions proved generally directionally sound, though some timelines were overly optimistic. While both topics remained relevant, they affect specialized industrial and space sectors rather than broad public impact.
