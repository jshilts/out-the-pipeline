# The Past Twenty Years of Drug Development, Via the Literature (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a PLOS ONE paper that analyzed 20 years (1991-2010) of pharmaceutical patents and journal publications to track drug development trends. The study used a large database containing approximately one million compounds from journal articles and three million from patents, mapping compounds to their biological targets.

The research revealed several key patterns: small-molecule compound output peaked around 2005 and then declined, corroborated by a plateau in pharmaceutical patents that continued through 2013. In contrast, target mentions in journal publications showed a notable increase starting in the early 2000s, likely driven by the post-genomics boom, though these peaked around 2008 and then plateaued or declined. The authors noted important caveats about their data, including that many entries were large molecules (antibodies, proteins) rather than small drug-like compounds, and that patent-to-publication lag times varied significantly.

The article explores potential explanations for the decline in output, with merger and acquisition activity among pharmaceutical companies being a primary hypothesized cause, leading to portfolio consolidation and reduced competition. Other factors included job losses in the industry, rising patent costs, and shifts toward biologics over small molecules.

## 2. HISTORY
The trends identified in this 2013 analysis largely continued and in some cases accelerated in the subsequent decade:

**Compounds and Targets**: The pharmaceutical innovation output remained challenging. While drug approvals showed some recovery after 2013, R&D productivity continued facing significant headwinds. The plateau in pharmaceutical patents noted in the article persisted, with patent applications showing relatively flat growth through the 2010s.

**Industry Consolidation**: The M&A trend accelerated dramatically after 2013. Major deals included Pfizer's attempted acquisition of AstraZeneca (2014), the Pfizer-Hospira merger ($17 billion, 2015), Shire's acquisition of Baxalta ($32 billion, 2016), the failed Pfizer-Allergan merger (would have been $160 billion, 2016), and numerous others. This consolidation did reduce the number of competing large pharmaceutical units as predicted, though it's debated whether this improved or worsened innovation output.

**Job Market**: The pharmaceutical job losses continued, albeit at a slower pace than the 300,000 jobs lost between 2000-2012. The industry saw continued restructuring, though some regions showed recovery in biotech and specialized areas.

**Shift to Biologics**: The trend toward biological therapeutics accelerated significantly. By 2021, biologics represented approximately 25-30% of new drug approvals, up from around 15-20% in the early 2010s. This shift was driven by both scientific advances and patent considerations, as many small-molecule blockbuster drugs faced patent cliffs.

**Clinical Development Patterns**: The genomics-driven target identification boom of the early 2000s translated into actual drug development, but with mixed results. While personalized medicine and targeted therapies grew significantly, many promising genomic targets failed in clinical trials, leading to a more cautious approach to novel target validation.

**R&D Productivity**: Despite these challenges, FDA drug approvals showed improvement in the late 2010s, with 2018 marking a record year for new drug approvals. However, the fundamental issues of high R&D costs and uncertain returns persisted, with the average cost to develop a new drug continuing to rise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this article, as it was primarily a retrospective analysis examining past trends rather than forecasting future developments. The authors and blog post author focused on explaining historical patterns rather than making testable predictions about future outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
**Decile Score: 6**

The article provides valuable empirical analysis of pharmaceutical innovation patterns and accurately identifies key structural trends affecting drug development, though its content is more descriptive retrospective than forward-looking, limiting broader impact.
