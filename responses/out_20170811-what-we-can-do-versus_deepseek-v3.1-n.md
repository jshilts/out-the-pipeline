# What We Can Do, Versus What We Could (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the impact of "click chemistry"—specifically Sharpless's concept of rapid, selective, bio-orthogonal reactions—nearly two decades after its introduction. The article highlights click chemistry's central role in chemical biology, particularly its power to tag biomolecules with minimal perturbation and then attach diverse reporters at will. As a concrete example, the piece focuses on a 2017 study that used clickable bromodomain inhibitors (IBET-151 and JQ-1) to map BRD4 localization across the genome in living cells. Those experiments revealed that BRD4 engages different genes via distinct mechanisms: some sites depend on bromodomain-histone interactions and are ligand-accessible, while others rely on bromodomain-independent protein-protein interactions that make the acetyl-lysine pockets inaccessible. The technique also allowed the authors to quantify drug distribution in vivo, helping to explain why bromodomain inhibitors showed poor efficacy in bone marrow versus spleen in acute myeloid leukemia models. Overall, the article presents bio-orthogonal click chemistry as an enabling toolkit that—coupled with advances in microscopy and proteomics—offers unprecedented resolution for tracking drug localization and mechanism inside cells and tissues.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this August 2017 article, both click chemistry and bromodomain inhibitor programs saw substantial real-world evolution. 

**Click Chemistry and Bio-orthogonal Reactions:** The field celebrated a major milestone when K. Barry Sharpless, Morten Meldal, and Carolyn Bertozzi were awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. Bertozzi's work on copper-free click reactions in living systems and the clinical translation of her Staudinger ligation illustrate the technology's maturation from an academic tool to a foundation for therapeutics and diagnostics. In drug discovery, bio-orthogonal chemistry has become standard practice for late-stage functionalization, activity-based protein profiling, and in vivo target engagement studies. While detailed clinical data using click chemistry for diagnostics are proprietary, the widespread adoption in preclinical research has become routine. 

**Bromodomain Inhibitors – Clinical Outcomes:** The article's spotlight on bromodomain inhibitors aligns with a mixed but instructive clinical trajectory. Several BET inhibitors entered oncology clinical trials; for example, compounds such as **OTX015/mivebresib (BET inhibitor)** and **I-BET762 (Molibresib)** progressed to Phase I/II studies in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. These studies demonstrated modest anti-tumor activity and significant toxicity (thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal effects), contributing to dose-limiting toxicities and slowing further development. Concurrently, bromodomain inhibitors also became valuable tool compounds for basic epigenetic research and target validation. Despite limited clinical success as monotherapies, BET inhibition has not been abandoned; it continues in trials exploring combination regimens, particularly with immunomodulatory or other epigenetic agents, reflecting a refinement in strategy rather than outright failure.

**BRD4 Biology and Drug Resistance:** Post-2017 research underscored the mechanistic complexity hinted at in the 2017 article. BRD4's context-dependent role—as both a transcriptional co-activator and a regulator tied to super-enhancers—became clearer, with evidence suggesting adaptive resistance (e.g., compensatory feedback loops and shifts to bromodomain-independent mechanisms) can limit monotherapy efficacy. While there are no widely approved BET inhibitor drugs achieving broad patient uptake, their targets remain of high interest, and the mechanistic insight has informed ongoing efforts to refine isoform-selective inhibitors and rational combinations.

**Quantitative Imaging and Tissue Distribution:** The article's emphasis on using click chemistry and fluorescence microscopy to quantify tissue distribution anticipated the rise of advanced imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS), multi-omics spatial biology platforms, and more sophisticated PK/PD modeling that map drug and metabolite distribution at single-cell resolution. These tools are now integrated into many discovery programs, transforming how researchers address efficacy-toxicity windows and tissue-penetration challenges like the AML bone marrow effect noted in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not offer explicit, testable predictions but framed several forward-looking themes. Below are the implied expectations and their subsequent outcomes:

- **That click chemistry would continue to expand as an enabling technology in chemical biology and drug discovery.**
  - ✓ **Validated:** The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for click and bio-orthogonal chemistry affirmed the approach's foundational importance. The toolbox now includes multiple bio-orthogonal pairs optimized for speed and biocompatibility, and these methods have become standard for in vivo imaging, drug delivery, late-stage diversification, and target engagement studies in industry and academia. Wider adoption has occurred as anticipated, though broad clinical diagnostic or therapeutic usage remains more specialized than routine.

- **That the bromodomain inhibitor field would benefit from finer mechanistic insight and possibly yield clinical therapeutics.**
  - ⚠ **Partially accurate on mechanistic insight, but clinical impact has been modest:** Mechanistic studies did expand significantly, clarifying BRD4's roles in transcriptional elongation, enhancer regulation, and context-dependent resistance. However, the BET inhibitor drug candidates that progressed to trials (e.g., OTX015, I-BET762) encountered significant toxicity and limited efficacy as monotherapies, preventing broad patient uptake. The field pivoted toward combination regimens rather than standalone therapies—a more nuanced outcome than initial optimism suggested.

- **That cell-type- and tissue-specific drug distribution data (e.g., spleen vs. bone marrow in AML models) would inform improved drug design and delivery.**
  - ✓ **Broadly validated:** Advances in quantitative tissue imaging, microdosing studies, and spatial omics have made PK/PD understanding in specific niches (tumor, bone marrow, CNS) a cornerstone of modern oncology and rare disease programs. While click-enabled fluorescence studies remain valuable tools, enterprise-scale platforms (e.g., imaging mass spectrometry, high-plex spatial profiling) are now often used to address these questions in industry.

- **That integrated technologies (genomics, proteomics, click-enabled tagging) would yield experiments previously considered implausible.**
  - ✓ **Accurate:** Multi-omics, single-cell biology, and spatial profiling have become standard in many research areas and biotech/pharma workflows. The ability to resolve drug-target engagement, pathway activity, and cell states at high resolution is now feasible in the way the article anticipated—though industry adoption often involves converged platforms beyond pure click chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

The article effectively synthesizes an important chemical technology (click chemistry) with a timely therapeutic target space (bromodomains) and captures the moment before both fields reached inflection points—a Nobel Prize for click chemistry and challenging clinical trials for BET inhibitors. Its value rests on clear mechanistic explanation and realistic excitement about what the tools enable, which remains relevant today.
