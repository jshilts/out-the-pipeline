# More Binding Site Weirdness (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a surprising finding from a 2009 medicinal chemistry study on enzyme inhibitors. Researchers investigating inhibitors of a biosynthetic enzyme from Burkholderia discovered an unusual phenomenon: both enantiomers (mirror-image compounds) of a racemic mixture were binding simultaneously in the same active site, each occupying different regions of the binding pocket. 

Typically, proteins show different binding affinities for enantiomers due to their chiral nature, with only one enantiomer appearing in crystal structures. However, this case showed both enantiomers binding at once. When the pure enantiomers were studied individually, the S enantiomer bound more tightly but adopted a different orientation than it did when both were present simultaneously, indicating complex binding dynamics. The author speculates this phenomenon may occur in other proteins with large binding sites like P450 enzymes and PPAR proteins, and questions how often this behavior has been missed in drug discovery programs that test racemic mixtures.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2009 article highlighted what was then a novel observation in protein-ligand binding, but this phenomenon of simultaneous enantiomer binding has remained relatively rare in the literature. Over the subsequent 15 years, drug discovery has largely moved away from racemic mixtures in development. The FDA's 1992 policy requiring characterization of individual enantiomers was well-established by 2009, and this trend continued to evolve.

Burkholderia research did advance significantly after 2009, with several biosynthetic pathways becoming better characterized, but the specific enzyme mentioned did not become a major drug target. The broader question about testing racemic mixtures became somewhat moot as enantiopure drug development became standard practice in pharmaceutical companies. Crystal structure databases expanded enormously (PDB grew from ~50,000 structures in 2009 to ~200,000 by 2024), but documented cases of simultaneous enantiomer binding in the same active site remain uncommon.

The more significant development in protein binding complexity that emerged post-2009 was the recognition of allosteric sites and cryptic binding pockets, which demonstrated that protein binding sites are far more dynamic than previously appreciated. Techniques like cryo-EM and advanced NMR methods revealed greater conformational heterogeneity than X-ray crystallography alone could show.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained no explicit predictions about future developments, though it raised implicit questions about the prevalence and implications of simultaneous enantiomer binding.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the phenomenon described was genuinely unusual for its time, it represented more of a chemical curiosity than a transformative insight that reshaped drug discovery practice. The observation was scientifically valid but had limited broader impact on how medicinal chemistry is practiced, as the industry had already largely transitioned away from racemic drug development.
