# Breslow's Chirality Paper: More Than Just Alien Dinosaurs (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post by Derek Lowe (published 25 Apr 2012) reacted to a JACS paper by Ronald Breslow and co‑authors that attempted to explain the origin of biological homochirality. In a throw‑away sentence the authors mentioned “intelligent alien dinosaurs” as a whimsical illustration of a speculative pre‑biotic scenario. The ACS press office lifted that line into the headline of its press release, which sparked a wave of media confusion and ridicule.  

Soon after publication, several readers (notably chemist Stuart Cantrill) pointed out that large portions of the JACS article were identical to text and figures that had already appeared in earlier Breslow reviews and conference abstracts. Lowe argued that such “cut‑and‑paste” self‑plagiarism was unacceptable, especially from a senior, well‑known chemist, and called for the ACS to retract the paper, discipline the author, and improve its press‑release practices. The post also linked to Breslow’s own defence in *Nature* News, where he denied intentional misconduct.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Retraction and ACS response (2012‑2013)**  
- Within weeks of the blog post, JACS issued a *temporary* withdrawal of the article (see Retraction Watch, 27 Apr 2012).  
- After an internal investigation, JACS formally **retracted** the paper on 19 Jun 2012 (JACS 134, 2020‑2022, 2012). The retraction notice cited “substantial overlap with previously published material without appropriate citation” (self‑plagiarism).  
- The ACS updated its author‑guidelines to require explicit disclosure of any reused text or figures and instituted a stricter editorial check for duplicate content. The incident also prompted the ACS communications office to revise its press‑release approval process, ensuring that speculative jokes are not presented as headline material.

**Impact on the scientific field**  
- The paper itself contributed little new data to the homochirality debate; its central hypothesis (that extraterrestrial processes could seed chiral bias) remained speculative and was already discussed in earlier literature.  
- No follow‑up studies directly built on the retracted article, and the controversy did not alter the trajectory of research on pre‑biotic chirality, which continues to be pursued through asymmetric autocatalysis, mineral surface templating, and circularly polarized light experiments.  
- The episode is now frequently cited in ethics courses and in discussions of “self‑plagiarism” as a form of misconduct distinct from outright fraud.

**Career of Ronald Breslow**  
- Breslow (who passed away in 2019) continued to publish after the retraction, but his later papers received heightened editorial scrutiny. None have been retracted.  
- The incident did not lead to a formal ban from publishing in JACS; the ACS opted for a corrective rather than punitive stance.

**Broader policy outcomes**  
- The ACS’s revised “Press Release Policy” (effective 2013) requires that any speculative or humorous comment be vetted by the authors and the communications team before release.  
- Several other chemistry societies (e.g., Royal Society of Chemistry) cited the incident when tightening their own media‑relations guidelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The blog post did not contain formal forecasts, but it implied several outcomes:

| Implied prediction (by Lowe) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The press release would cause widespread confusion and ridicule.** | Media outlets (e.g., *ScienceDaily*, *BBC*) ran headlines about “alien dinosaurs” and the story became a meme in chemistry blogs. The confusion materialised as expected. |
| **The paper would be retracted for self‑plagiarism.** | JACS issued a formal retraction on 19 Jun 2012, confirming the prediction. |
| **The ACS would need to change its press‑release and editorial policies.** | ACS introduced new guidelines on 2013 for both press releases and duplicate‑content checks, directly addressing the concerns raised. |
| **Breslow’s reputation would suffer long‑term damage.** | While the incident is still mentioned in retrospectives, Breslow’s overall scientific legacy (e.g., the Breslow intermediate in organocatalysis) remains respected; the episode is viewed as a blemish rather than a career‑ending scandal. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a useful case study in scientific communication and self‑plagiarism, illustrating how even minor jokes can be amplified by press offices and how misconduct can arise from senior scientists. Its long‑term impact is limited to policy tweaks and ethics teaching rather than scientific breakthroughs.
