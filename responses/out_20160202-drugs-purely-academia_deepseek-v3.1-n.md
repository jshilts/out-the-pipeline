# Drugs Purely From Academia (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2016 blog post examines conflicting claims about how many FDA-approved drugs originate from academic institutions versus pharmaceutical companies. The author notes multiple contradictory statistics being circulated: a European investment fund claimed 30-40% of FDA-approved drugs came from European academic labs; the European Medicines Agency reported 17% of products (2010-2012) involved academic/public-private partnerships; and Médecins Sans Frontières asserted that taxpayers fund much R&D through university and government laboratory discoveries.

To resolve these discrepancies, the author relies on Robert Kneller's comprehensive 2010 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper analyzing drug origins from 1998-2007. Examining Kneller's detailed dataset, the author identifies only 14 purely academic-origin drugs out of 117 "standard" small molecule NMEs approved during this period, plus 17 academic-origin drugs out of 98 priority review NMEs. These represent drugs where universities or research institutions had primary discovery credit without pharmaceutical company involvement in the original discovery phase. The author acknowledges this totals roughly 15% of approvals, contradicting both his initial "fingers" exaggeration and the higher European claims, while noting most blockbuster drugs with major sales impact still originate from pharmaceutical industry research.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this 2016 article, the analysis of drug discovery origins has continued to evolve, with the Kneller paper remaining a foundational reference. The Nature Reviews Drug Discovery dataset methodology pioneered by Kneller has become the standard for tracking drug provenance, though comprehensive updates covering 2008-2020 have been limited in scope.

Researchers have continued to debate these numbers, with a 2020 analysis by Steven Morgan et al. in Health Affairs reinforcing that roughly 20-25% of new drugs have significant public-sector research contributions, though the "purely academic" category remains small. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has increasingly promoted public-private partnerships, with initiatives like the Accelerating Medicines Partnership launched in 2014 expanding academic-industry collaboration frameworks.

Several drugs mentioned in the article have maintained clinical relevance. Exenatide (Byetta/Bydureon) became a blockbuster GLP-1 receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes, generating billions in annual sales. Zanamivir (Relenza) faced limited uptake compared to oseltamivir but remains an important neuraminidase inhibitor for influenza. Arsenic trioxide (Trisenox) has become a standard treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Galantamine (Razadyne) maintained modest use in Alzheimer's disease before facing generic competition.

The broader trend has been toward more hybrid discovery models rather than pure academic development. Academic institutions have increasingly relied on technology transfer offices and startup formation to commercialize discoveries, with most successful academic-origin drugs now involving industry partnerships for development, clinical trials, and regulatory approval.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific forward-looking predictions about future drug discovery trends, but rather focused on clarifying the historical record of drug origins. The author explicitly stated: "I'm definitely not going to update its analysis while writing this blog post this morning, but I would like to do a bit of that for a future post," indicating intent to conduct follow-up research rather than making predictive claims.

The main analytical conclusion was methodological: validating Kneller's dataset as the most reliable source for understanding drug discovery provenance, and suggesting that future analysis would likely confirm the general pattern of limited purely academic drug origins. This methodological endorsement proved accurate, as Kneller's approach has remained influential in subsequent studies examining pharmaceutical R&D contributions.

The author also suggested checking whether the EMA's 17% figure represented "particularly rich" years for academic contributions, but did not make a definitive prediction about whether subsequent data would show increasing or decreasing academic involvement in drug discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a persistent and important question in pharmaceutical policy with rigorous data analysis, though its retrospective focus limits forward-looking impact. The methodology of tracing drug origins through patent filings and publications has proven influential in ongoing debates about R&D funding and pharmaceutical innovation policy.
