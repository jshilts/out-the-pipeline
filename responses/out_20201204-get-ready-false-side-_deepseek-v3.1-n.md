# Get Ready for False Side Effects (December 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses the impending mass vaccination rollout for COVID-19, noting that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines showed promising data while acknowledging public hesitancy. The central argument warns that when vaccinating very large populations (tens of millions), the baseline rates of natural health events—heart attacks, strokes, cancer diagnoses, and deaths—will inevitably coincide temporally with vaccination. The author references epidemiologic data suggesting that among 10 million people over two months, approximately 4,000 heart attacks, 4,000 strokes, 9,000 cancer diagnoses, and 14,000 deaths would occur normally. The concern is that these coincidental events may be falsely attributed to vaccination through post hoc reasoning, potentially generating alarming headlines and undermining public confidence, even though no actual safety signals had appeared for the authorized vaccines at that time.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's warning proved prescient as false side effect claims became a significant challenge during global COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. In the months and years following December 2020:

- **False attribution incidents occurred widely**: Multiple highly publicized cases emerged where deaths or serious health events following vaccination were initially blamed on vaccines before investigation revealed coincidental timing. These included high-profile cases that generated substantial media attention and social media amplification.

- **Statistical reality manifested**: With billions of doses administered globally, the predicted coincidental health events materialized. Public health agencies (CDC, EMA, WHO) consistently tracked and investigated these events, with the vast majority determined to be unrelated to vaccination through epidemiological analysis and controlled studies.

- **Monitoring systems functioned**: The existing vaccine safety monitoring systems (VAERS in the US, EudraVigilance in Europe) successfully identified genuine safety signals (such as rare blood clotting events with adenovirus vaccines and myocarditis with mRNA vaccines) while distinguishing them from background noise, demonstrating the systems' capability to detect actual safety concerns.

- **Public confidence challenges**: The prediction about public perception difficulties proved accurate, with false attribution contributing to vaccine hesitancy and requiring extensive public health communication efforts to maintain vaccination uptake.

- **Excess death reduction**: The predicted positive effect on mortality materialized as mass vaccination campaigns progressed, with COVID-19 mortality and excess deaths declining significantly in vaccinated populations compared to unvaccinated groups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **That coincidental health events would be falsely attributed to vaccines**: ✓ **CORRECT** - This occurred extensively, with numerous high-profile cases and widespread social media amplification of temporal associations without causal evidence.

- **Difficulty convincing friends/relatives of lack of connection**: ✓ **CORRECT** - Despite extensive public health messaging and scientific evidence, public skepticism about coincidental timing persisted throughout vaccination campaigns.

- **Screaming headlines about people falling over after shots**: ✓ **CORRECT** - Multiple media outlets ran dramatic stories about deaths and serious events following vaccination, often before thorough investigation.

- **No actual safety signals for mRNA vaccines at time of writing**: ✓ **PARTIALLY CORRECT** - Initially true, though later monitoring did identify rare but real safety signals (myocarditis/pericarditis) at rates significantly below coincidental background rates.

- **Vaccination reducing excess deaths**: ✓ **CORRECT** - Epidemiological data consistently showed substantial reductions in excess mortality in vaccinated populations as campaigns progressed through 2021-2022.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated unusually prescient understanding of the statistical realities and communication challenges that would define the mass vaccination era. The argument was grounded in solid epidemiological principles that accurately predicted major challenges in public health communication, making it valuable both as public health commentary and for understanding evidence-based risk communication.
