# Drew University Visit (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author writes a brief, informal note from Logan Airport on the morning of 6 June 2012, announcing that they are traveling to New Jersey to give a keynote talk at the medicinal‑chemistry program of Drew University. The author recalls having taken the same course in 1990 and observes that many of their former classmates have since left the biotech/pharma industry, though they appear to have done well personally. The post is essentially a personal “on‑the‑road” update meant to let readers know about the upcoming talk and to reminisce about the Drew course and the New Jersey biotech scene of the early 1990s.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Drew University’s medicinal‑chemistry offering** – The program, housed within the Department of Chemistry, continued to operate after 2012 as a small‑scale, undergraduate‑focused curriculum. It has not expanded into a large graduate‑level or research‑intensive hub, and there is no public record of a dedicated medicinal‑chemistry research center being launched at Drew since that time.  
- **New Jersey biotech landscape** – The state’s life‑science sector has grown steadily since 2012, driven by the expansion of large pharmaceutical firms (e.g., Johnson & Johnson, Merck) and a surge of biotech startups in the Newark‑New York corridor. However, this growth has been largely centered around larger corporate R&D sites and incubators such as the New Jersey Innovation Institute, rather than directly tied to Drew University’s program.  
- **Alumni outcomes** – Publicly available alumni data for the 1990‑era Drew medicinal‑chemistry cohort is sparse. The author’s observation that many former classmates have left the industry aligns with broader trends: a sizable portion of chemistry graduates from the early‑1990s transitioned into related fields (materials, finance, consulting) as the biotech hiring market contracted in the early 2000s.  
- **Speaker’s subsequent activities** – The post does not identify the speaker by name, so no concrete follow‑up on their career can be verified. No major publications, patents, or high‑profile industry moves have been linked to a “Drew University medicinal‑chemistry keynote 2012” in searchable sources.  

Overall, the article did not spark any notable policy changes, drug approvals, or industry shifts; it remains a personal anecdote.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The note contains no explicit forecasts about the future of medicinal chemistry, the Drew program, or the New Jersey biotech sector. Consequently, there are no predictions to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10**  
The piece is a brief, personal travel update with limited broader relevance; it offers little substantive insight into scientific or industry developments.
