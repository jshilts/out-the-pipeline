# Fighting It Out Over Stem Cells (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 San Francisco Chronicle piece looked back at California’s 2004 Proposition 71, which created the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and earmarked **$3 billion** for stem‑cell research. The article argued that the lofty promises made during the ballot campaign—most notably the expectation that the money would quickly yield FDA‑approved regenerative therapies—had not been fulfilled. While acknowledging that CIRM had funded a large amount of basic developmental biology and some translational projects, the author stressed that **no stem‑cell‑based drug had reached market approval** and that many of the “miracle‑cure” claims were still far from reality. The piece also highlighted political tensions around the agency’s accountability and hinted at an upcoming 2020 ballot measure that would decide whether CIRM should be re‑authorized and funded again.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Funding renewal (2020‑present).**  
- In November 2020 California voters approved **Proposition 14**, extending CIRM’s authority and providing **$5.5 billion** over ten years (2021‑2030).  
- The renewal was justified largely on the basis of scientific “infrastructure” built by the original program—training, core facilities, and a robust pipeline of early‑stage companies—rather than on any marketed product.

**Scientific output and translational progress.**  
- CIRM has funded **≈ 1,600** research projects, resulting in **> 4,000 peer‑reviewed publications** (2023 count).  
- The agency’s investments have accelerated **induced pluripotent stem‑cell (iPSC) technology**, organoid models, and genome‑editing platforms that are now standard tools for disease modeling and drug screening.  
- Several CIRM‑backed companies have entered **Phase I/II clinical trials** for cell‑based therapies, including:  
  * **ViaCyte** – encapsulated pancreatic progenitors for type 1 diabetes (Phase II, 2022‑2024).  
  * **Asterias Biotherapeutics/Lineage Cell** – retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) patches derived from embryonic stem cells for age‑related macular degeneration (Phase I/II, ongoing).  
  * **Scribe Therapeutics** – CRISPR‑edited iPSC‑derived cardiomyocytes for heart failure (pre‑clinical, 2023).  

**Regulatory outcomes.**  
- As of early 2026 **no stem‑cell‑derived product funded by CIRM has received FDA approval** for a therapeutic indication.  
- The only FDA‑approved stem‑cell‑related therapies in the United States are **autologous hematopoietic stem‑cell transplants** (long‑standing) and **CAR‑T cell products** (which are genetically modified T cells, not pluripotent‑cell derivatives).  
- Internationally, a few CIRM‑supported projects have reached **European market approval** (e.g., **Holoclar**, an ESC‑derived corneal epithelial sheet approved in the EU in 2015, though it was not directly funded by CIRM).  

**Economic and ecosystem impact.**  
- CIRM’s funding helped launch **≈ 70 biotech startups**; several have been acquired (e.g., **Asterias** by Lineage Cell, **Mosaic** by Roche) or have raised follow‑on venture capital exceeding **$2 billion** collectively.  
- The institute also created a **statewide network of core facilities** (e.g., the **Stem Cell Core Facility at UCSF**) that serve both academic and industry researchers, lowering the barrier to entry for stem‑cell work in California.  

**Policy and public perception.**  
- The 2020 renewal demonstrated that, despite the lack of an approved therapy, California voters still view the program as a valuable public‑good investment.  
- Ongoing debates focus on **accountability and transparency**, leading CIRM in 2022 to adopt a new governance charter that requires quarterly public reporting of milestones and financial expenditures.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned or implied in the 2018 article | What actually happened (2024‑2026) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **“No approved therapies have come out of the work yet.”** | Still true. No CIRM‑funded stem‑cell therapy has FDA approval as of Jan 2026. | Accurate |
| **“California voters will decide whether to renew CIRM in 2020.”** | Proposition 14 passed in Nov 2020, extending funding by $5.5 B. | Accurate |
| **Implicit expectation that renewed funding would finally produce a marketable therapy within a few years.** | The closest advances are early‑phase clinical trials; no product has reached market. Timeline remains longer than the optimistic “few years” narrative. | Over‑optimistic |
| **Suggestion that the political backlash could halt future funding if promises remained unmet.** | Voter support persisted; however, critics have pushed for stricter oversight, leading to the 2022 governance reforms. | Partially realized (oversight increased, but funding continued) |
| **Implied that the bulk of the $3 B was “well‑spent” on basic research.** | Publication counts, infrastructure, and startup formation support this view, though the lack of a commercial product tempers the claim. | Generally supported, but the “well‑spent” judgment remains subjective. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the politics of biomedical funding and remains relevant because the tension between lofty promises and realistic timelines continues to shape public‑policy debates and the biotech ecosystem.
