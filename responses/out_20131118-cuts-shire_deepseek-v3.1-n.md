# Cuts at Shire (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on organizational restructuring and job cuts underway at Shire's UK R&D operations in Basingstoke. The piece references local press reports indicating up to 180 jobs could be at risk, with the author characterizing the UK medicinal chemistry employment situation as "the worst it's been in living memory." The context suggests broader challenges facing pharmaceutical R&D in the UK during this period.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2013 restructuring, Shire underwent significant transformation. In 2014, the company faced a hostile takeover attempt by AbbVie, which was ultimately abandoned due to new U.S. tax inversion rules. Shire then shifted strategy toward becoming a rare disease specialist, acquiring companies like ViroPharma ($4.2B, 2014) and Dyax ($5.9B, 2015). 

In 2016, Shire acquired Baxalta for $32 billion, significantly expanding its rare disease portfolio with treatments like Advate (hemophilia A) and HyQvia (immunodeficiency). However, this massive deal also brought substantial debt. The Basingstoke site was ultimately closed as Shire consolidated operations. 

By 2018, facing shareholder pressure and integration challenges from the Baxalta acquisition, Shire was acquired by Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical for $62 billion, one of the largest pharmaceutical acquisitions in history. This deal marked the end of Shire as an independent company and substantially reshaped the rare disease treatment landscape.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• The article did not contain specific long-term predictions about Shire's future or the broader industry. It primarily reported on immediate restructuring events.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5/10**
The article represents a snapshot of pharmaceutical industry consolidation pressures in the early 2010s, made moderately interesting by Shire's subsequent mega-merger with Takeda, though the post itself is brief and primarily reports ephemeral news.
