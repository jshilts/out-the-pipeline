# All Right, Then (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post by Derek Lowe was written the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, expressing the author's dismay at Donald Trump's victory. The author, who identifies as a "Never-Trump former Republican," analyzed why the election turned out the way it did, suggesting that Democratic voters either stayed home or switched to Trump due to disappointment with the Obama years, rather than solely attributing the result to Trump's base. 

Regarding the drug industry specifically, Lowe predicted that biopharma stocks would rally because Clinton's defeat and the failure of a California price control measure removed concerns about potential drug price regulations. However, he made clear he would rather have lost money than see Trump elected.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article's publication, several key developments shaped the pharmaceutical industry under the Trump administration (2017-2021):

**Drug Pricing:** Despite initial industry relief at Clinton's defeat, the Trump administration did pursue drug pricing policies. Former HHS Secretary Alex Azar made drug prices a priority, though concrete legislative achievements were limited. The administration issued executive orders and proposed rules, but major systemic reforms did not materialize.

**Biopharma Market Performance:** Pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks generally performed well during the Trump years, with the XBI biotechnology ETF approximately doubling from late 2016 through early 2021. However, this reflected broader market trends and sector-specific dynamics rather than deregulation alone.

**FDA Developments:** The FDA continued drug approvals at a brisk pace under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (2017-2019) and later leadership. The agency approved record numbers of generic drugs and maintained robust new drug approval rates, continuing trends from the Obama years.

**COVID-19 Impact:** The pandemic fundamentally shifted the industry landscape, with Operation Warp Speed accelerating vaccine development and changing public perception of pharmaceutical companies.

**Healthcare Policy:** The Trump administration's attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, preserving the existing framework, though some regulatory changes were implemented.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Biopharma stocks would rise due to Clinton's defeat and failed California price controls**: **Mostly accurate** ✓ The industry did experience relief rallies, though subsequent performance reflected broader market and sector dynamics rather than policy changes alone.

- **Trump would disappoint his supporters by being unable to deliver on promises**: **Mixed accuracy** ⊗ While Trump did face constraints from Congress and the system of divided government, substantial tax reform passed in 2017, and he made significant regulatory changes, though many supporters did express disappointment about unfulfilled promises.

- **The system of divided government would constrain Trump's agenda**: **Accurate** ✓ Checks and balances did limit many initiatives, though significant policy changes still occurred through executive actions and the 2017 tax bill.

- **Trump would find he hates being president**: **Incorrect** ⊗ Despite controversies and conflicts, Trump remained actively engaged in campaigning for re-election and continued political activities post-presidency, suggesting he did not come to hate the role.

- **The election would break the "Because I'm a Bush/Clinton" rationale**: **Incorrect** ⊗ Dynastic political families remain influential in American politics, and Biden's 2020 victory demonstrated establishment candidates can still succeed.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While offering keen immediate political analysis and accurate drug industry predictions, the article's broader speculations about Trump's presidency proved mixed, and its connection to biotechnology was relatively limited compared to typical science policy commentary.
