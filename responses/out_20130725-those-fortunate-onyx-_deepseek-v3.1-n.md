# Those Fortunate Onyx Option Traders (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article discusses two individuals from Dubai, Dhia Jafar and Omar Nabulsi, who came forward to defend their highly profitable options trades in Onyx Pharmaceuticals. The trades occurred just before Amgen announced a $10 billion acquisition bid for the smaller biotechnology company, generating $2.53 million in profits for the traders. The timing attracted significant regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, which filed civil insider trading charges and froze the profits. The traders claimed they had no material non-public information about the impending acquisition and argued their trades were based on lawful analysis. The article notes the unusual nature of their public defense and the general skepticism surrounding such perfectly timed, highly profitable trades.

## 2. HISTORY

**The Onyx-Amgen Acquisition:**
- Amgen acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in October 2013 for approximately $10.4 billion ($125 per share), representing a 50% premium over Onyx's closing price before the acquisition announcement.
- The acquisition gave Amgen access to Kyprolis (carfilzomib), Onyx's multiple myeloma drug that had received FDA approval in 2012.

**Outcome of the Legal Case:**
- In December 2013, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that the SEC had failed to demonstrate that Jafar and Nabulsi possessed material non-public information when they purchased the options.
- The judge ordered the release of the frozen $2.53 million in profits to the traders, stating the SEC had not met its burden of proof for insider trading allegations.
- The case highlighted the challenges regulators face in proving insider trading, particularly with foreign nationals and complex trading patterns.

**Broader Implications:**
- The SEC continued pursuing other individuals allegedly involved in the insider trading scheme around the Onyx acquisition, indicating broader enforcement efforts beyond these two traders.
- The case illustrated the lucrative nature of advance knowledge about pharmaceutical acquisitions, where clinical data and regulatory approvals can dramatically impact company valuations.

**Post-Acquisition Developments:**
- Kyprolis became an important revenue driver for Amgen in the multiple myeloma market, with global sales reaching hundreds of millions annually in subsequent years.
- The acquisition represented one of several major consolidation moves in the oncology space during this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction in Article:** The author suggested that "I'll bet that not everyone who did that trade will be persuasive about their reasons" (referring to other traders who might face SEC scrutiny).

**Actual Outcome:**
- **Partially accurate for these defendants:** The two Dubai traders proved persuasive enough to secure the release of their frozen profits, effectively winning their legal challenge against the SEC.
- **Broader accuracy:** The SEC continued investigating and pursuing other individuals allegedly involved in insider trading related to the Onyx acquisition, suggesting that not all traders were able to successfully defend their positions or chose not to contest the charges.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article covers insider trading around a biotech acquisition rather than the actual science or drug development aspects of biotechnology. While acquisition activity is relevant to the industry, the focus is primarily on financial markets and regulatory enforcement rather than biomedical innovation or clinical outcomes.
