# The 2019 Medicine Nobel (Oct 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article celebrates the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to William Kaelin Jr., Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg Semenza for uncovering how cells sense and respond to oxygen.  Semenza identified the hypoxia‑inducible factor (HIF) transcription complex; Ratcliffe and Kaelin showed that under normal oxygen HIF‑α subunits are hydroxylated by prolyl‑4‑hydroxylases (PHDs), recognized by the von Hippel‑Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase, and degraded.  Low oxygen blocks PHD activity, stabilizing HIF‑α, allowing it to drive genes such as erythropoietin (EPO).  The piece highlights the broader relevance of this pathway to cancer, immunity, wound healing and drug discovery, noting that VHL‑based targeted protein degradation is an emerging field.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Therapeutics that reached the clinic**  

| Year | Agent | Mechanism | Indication | Outcome |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 2020 | **Roxadustat** (FG‑4592) | PHD inhibitor → HIF stabilization → endogenous EPO | Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) | Approved in China (2020) and Japan (2021); FDA approval in 2023 (Evrenzo). Post‑approval data show effective hemoglobin rise with a safety profile comparable to ESAs, though long‑term cardiovascular risk remains under surveillance. |
| 2021 | **Belzutifan** (Welireg) | HIF‑2α antagonist (binds HIF‑2α PAS‑B domain) | VHL‑disease‑associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and later sporadic RCC | FDA approval (2021) for VHL‑related RCC; 2023 expanded indication to sporadic RCC. Clinical trials demonstrated objective response rates ~50 % with manageable toxicity, confirming that direct HIF‑2α inhibition can be a viable anti‑cancer strategy. |
| 2022 | **Daprodustat** (DP) | PHD inhibitor | CKD‑related anemia | FDA approval in 2023 (Duvyzat). Similar efficacy to roxadustat; safety data continue to accumulate. |
| 2022‑2024 | **Vadadustat**, **Molidustat**, **Enarodustat** | PHD inhibitors | CKD anemia (mostly in Asia/Europe) | Approved in Japan (vadadustat, 2020) and South Korea; not yet FDA‑approved. |
| 2023‑2024 | **ARV‑110**, **ARV‑471** (VHL‑recruiting PROTACs) | VHL‑based proteolysis‑targeting chimeras that degrade androgen‑receptor or estrogen‑receptor proteins | Prostate and breast cancers (clinical trials) | Early‑phase trials show target degradation and disease‑modifying activity, confirming VHL’s utility as a recruitment element in targeted protein degradation (TPD). |

**Key scientific advances**  

* **Structural biology** – Cryo‑EM and X‑ray structures of the VHL‑Cul2‑EloBC complex (2019‑2022) clarified how hydroxylated HIF‑α is recognized, enabling rational design of VHL ligands for PROTACs.  
* **HIF‑2α‑specific drugs** – Small‑molecule antagonists (e.g., PT2385, PT2977/belzutifan) proved that selective inhibition of HIF‑2α, not HIF‑1α, can be therapeutically beneficial, especially in VHL‑deficient tumors.  
* **Immunology** – Studies (2020‑2023) linked HIF‑1α to macrophage polarization and T‑cell metabolism, influencing checkpoint‑inhibitor efficacy; however, no HIF‑targeted immunotherapies have reached approval yet.  
* **Gene‑editing** – CRISPR‑based correction of VHL mutations is being explored in pre‑clinical models of VHL disease, but no clinical trial has started as of mid‑2024.  

**Industry and policy impact**  

* The Nobel spotlight accelerated investment in HIF‑modulating drugs; biotech firms such as FibroGen, Akebia, and AstraZeneca expanded pipelines around PHD inhibitors and HIF‑2α antagonists.  
* FDA guidance (2022) on anemia drugs highlighted the need for cardiovascular safety monitoring for HIF‑PHIs, reflecting concerns raised after early trial signals.  
* The VHL‑PROTAC platform has become a core technology for many pharma companies, spawning dozens of clinical candidates across oncology and neurodegeneration.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several future directions. Below each is paired with the actual outcome observed up to mid‑2024.

- **Prediction:** *Pharmaceutical inhibition of the HIF pathway will yield new anemia treatments.*  
  **Reality:** Realized. Multiple PHD inhibitors (roxadustat, daprodustat, vadadustat, etc.) have been approved in several jurisdictions and are now standard alternatives to erythropoiesis‑stimulating agents (ESAs).

- **Prediction:** *Targeting HIF (or its regulators) will provide novel anti‑cancer therapies, especially in VHL‑mutant tumors.*  
  **Reality:** Partially realized. HIF‑2α antagonists (belzutifan) are approved for VHL‑associated RCC and have shown activity in sporadic RCC. Broad HIF‑1α inhibitors have not succeeded clinically, likely due to toxicity and pathway redundancy.

- **Prediction:** *The VHL ubiquitin‑ligase complex will become a platform for targeted protein degradation.*  
  **Reality:** Fully realized. VHL‑recruiting PROTACs are now a major modality in drug discovery, with several candidates in Phase I/II trials (e.g., ARV‑110, ARV‑471). The field has expanded beyond oncology to inflammatory and neurodegenerative targets.

- **Prediction:** *Understanding oxygen sensing will translate into therapies for immune and inflammatory diseases.*  
  **Reality:** Not yet realized. While mechanistic links between HIF and immune cell function are well documented, no HIF‑modulating drugs have been approved for autoimmune or inflammatory indications as of 2024.

- **Prediction:** *The Nobel award would spur a surge of basic research on oxygen‑sensing pathways.*  
  **Reality:** Confirmed. Publication rates on HIF, PHDs, and VHL have remained high; NIH funding for “hypoxia biology” increased by ~15 % between 2019‑2023.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article ties a landmark Nobel discovery to concrete therapeutic avenues (anemia drugs, cancer agents, PROTAC technology) that have materialized in the years since, making it highly relevant for both scientific and translational audiences.
