# Prices Rising - Every Year, Every Drug? (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This January 2014 commentary by Derek Lowe addresses concerning drug pricing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry. The article references a chart showing annualized price increases of 10% or more across multiple therapeutic areas, with the author expressing unease about this trajectory. 

Lowe acknowledges two key factors driving these price increases: the reality that insurance coverage enables such pricing, and the legitimate need for pharmaceutical companies to recoup investments given the high costs and uncertainties of drug discovery. He explicitly states his opposition to government price review boards that would determine "right" prices, defending companies' right to charge what the market will bear.

However, the author introduces a significant caveat: he worries that the industry risks inviting regulatory backlash and public backlash if drug pricing is not perceived as delivering good value for money. The article positions itself as part of ongoing discussions about drug pricing on the site, referencing several previous pieces Lowe had written on cancer drug costs and value propositions.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this 2014 article saw dramatic developments in drug pricing that largely validated and exceeded Lowe's concerns, leading to significant policy and market changes:

**Pricing Escalation Continued**: Between 2014-2024, drug prices continued climbing, with many specialty drugs (particularly cancer treatments, autoimmune therapies, and orphan drugs) reaching unprecedented price points. Major oncology drugs routinely exceeded $100,000-$200,000 per year of treatment.

**Market and Regulatory Response Intensified**: 
- **Policy Interventions**: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 granted Medicare unprecedented authority to negotiate drug prices, directly addressing the "hammer" Lowe worried about. This fundamentally altered the U.S. pharmaceutical market dynamics.
- **State-Level Actions**: Multiple states implemented drug price transparency laws and importation programs.
- **Patient Cost-Sharing**: Rising deductibles and copays made affordability crises more visible to patients, increasing public pressure.

**Industry Adaptation**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly shifted R&D focus toward high-priced specialty drugs and orphan indications where premium pricing remained sustainable. The traditional primary care blockbuster model declined in favor of targeted, high-cost therapies.

**Public and Political Backlash Materialized**: The very regulatory interventions Lowe warned about became reality by the early 2020s. Public sentiment turned increasingly critical of pharmaceutical pricing practices, particularly after high-profile cases like Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals and Mylan's EpiPen pricing controversy.

**Value Frameworks Emerged**: Various value assessment frameworks (like ICER in the U.S.) gained influence in pricing discussions, partially validating Lowe's concern about the "good value for money" standard.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions that largely materialized:

- **Predicted**: The industry would face regulatory backlash if pricing wasn't seen as providing good value for money.
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The Inflation Reduction Act's drug pricing provisions directly represent the "hammer coming down" that Lowe anticipated.

- **Predicted**: Continued tension between market-based pricing and public/political pressure.
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The 2014-2024 period saw intensifying political debate, numerous Congressional hearings, and eventual legislative action.

- **Predicted**: Insurance coverage enables price increases but creates sustainability risks.
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The payer marketplace became increasingly aggressive in negotiating discounts, implementing utilization management, and demanding outcomes data.

- **Implied Concern**: Ordinary market mechanisms might not self-correct pharmaceutical pricing.
  - **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. Rather than market forces constraining prices, continued escalation led to non-market interventions.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about the political economy of drug pricing, capturing tensions that would dominate biopharmaceutical policy for the subsequent decade and correctly anticipating regulatory interventions that materialized eight years later.
