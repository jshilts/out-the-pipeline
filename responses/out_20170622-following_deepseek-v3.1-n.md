# Following Up (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines the strategic question of how pharmaceutical companies should balance their drug discovery portfolios between entirely new projects and follow-up compounds to existing programs. The author notes that different organizations have varying philosophies on this issue, with no clear industry-wide consensus.

The key dilemma centers on whether companies that pioneer a first-in-class drug should also develop second-generation compounds in the same therapeutic area. While organizations presumably possess deep knowledge of the target area, various practical constraints work against systematic follow-up programs. Smaller companies typically lack resources beyond getting their first drug to market, while even larger companies face challenges maintaining discovery teams once a program advances to clinical trials.

The article identifies several systematic barriers: discovery resources naturally wind down as programs move toward the clinic; patent-protection chemistry often takes priority over backup compounds; and shifting business priorities, management changes, and staff turnover make it difficult to maintain institutional knowledge for future follow-up efforts.

## 2. HISTORY

The strategic questions raised in this 2017 article have remained highly relevant, with the biopharmaceutical industry continuing to grapple with portfolio optimization between pioneering programs and follow-on opportunities.

Since 2017, several notable examples illustrate both the value and challenges of follow-up strategies:

**Successful follow-up programs** have demonstrated substantial value. In immunology, AbbVie's follow-up to Humira (adalimumab) with Skyrizi (risankizumab) and Rinvoq (upadacitinib) captured significant market share, though Humira's biosimilar competition beginning in 2023 represented a different competitive dynamic than the article's "second entry" scenario.

**CAR-T therapies** showed a different pattern, where multiple companies entered relatively simultaneously rather than distinct first/second generation dynamics.

**GLP-1 agonists** exemplified the challenges the article described. Novo Nordisk's semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) followed liraglutide, but the later tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) from Eli Lilly represented competitive innovation from outside the original company, exactly the scenario the author warned about.

**Resource allocation challenges** identified in the article have persisted. The biotech downturn beginning in 2021-2022 intensified pressure on companies to focus resources, likely reducing systematic follow-up programs in favor of prioritizing lead candidates.

**Institutional knowledge challenges** have become even more acute with increased industry consolidation and executive mobility, making the reconstruction of original program knowledge described in the article more difficult.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't offer explicit predictions, but rather identified structural industry dynamics and their likely consequences:

- **Claim**: Smaller companies don't have resources for follow-ups while larger companies vary in follow-up commitment
  - **Outcome**: This dynamic has largely persisted, with small biotechs continuing to focus resources on single lead programs while larger companies maintain varying strategic approaches

- **Claim**: When a later compound dominates a therapeutic area, the original company will regret not pursuing follow-ups
  - **Outcome**: This pattern has continued, with companies like Novo Nordisk needing to defend GLP-1 market share against Eli Lilly's innovations, though actual regret and strategic implications are difficult to verify

- **Claim**: The "wind-down of discovery resources" problem will persist due to resource allocation pressures
  - **Outcome**: This challenge remains endemic in the industry, with portfolio management continuing to face the tension between advancing existing programs and exploring new opportunities

- **Claim**: The follow-up field will remain "a pretty ad hoc business" due to compound variations, therapeutic area differences, and uncertain market outcomes
  - **Outcome**: Systematic follow-up programs have remained relatively rare, with portfolio decisions continuing to be driven by individual company circumstances rather than industry-wide best practices

The broader dynamics the author identified have proven prescient in describing ongoing industry challenges around portfolio strategy and resource allocation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses enduring strategic challenges in pharmaceutical R&D portfolio management, offering insights that remain relevant about structural barriers to systematic follow-up drug development. While it didn't generate specific predictions or break new ground, it captured important industry dynamics around resource allocation that continue to influence drug development strategy and competitive outcomes.
