# Nobel Season Begins! (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short blog entry, posted on 10 September 2012, surveys two popular “Nobel‑odds” blogs (Chembark and Wavefunction) and notes that many of the candidates being discussed for the 2012 Chemistry prize are rooted in biology.  The author lists a grab‑bag of topics that appear in the betting pools – nuclear‑hormone signaling, molecular chaperones, oncogenes, Western/Southern blotting techniques, and assorted bio‑inorganic discoveries – and promises a follow‑up post with his own predictions and a “what‑not‑to‑see” list.  No specific candidates are named; the piece is essentially a meta‑commentary on the hype surrounding the upcoming Nobel announcements.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened:** On 10 October 2012 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to **Robert J. Lefkowitz** and **Brian K. Kobilka** “for studies of G‑protein‑coupled receptors.”  Their work elucidated the structure and signaling mechanisms of GPCRs, a large family of membrane proteins that translate extracellular signals into intracellular responses.  

**Impact on the field:**  
* **Drug development:** GPCRs are now recognized as targets for roughly 30‑40 % of all FDA‑approved small‑molecule drugs.  Since 2012, dozens of new GPCR‑directed therapeutics have reached the market (e.g., the β‑arrestin‑biased opioid oliceridine, the GLP‑1 agonist semaglutide for diabetes/obesity, and the melatonin‑receptor agonist ramelteon).  The structural insights from Lefkowitz/Kobilka’s work accelerated structure‑based drug design, especially after the first high‑resolution GPCR crystal structures (β2‑adrenergic receptor, 2007) were complemented by cryo‑EM structures of more complex GPCR–G‑protein assemblies (e.g., 2017–2020).  

* **Scientific adoption:** The GPCR field exploded; the number of GPCR‑related publications more than doubled between 2012 and 2022, and large‑scale screening platforms (e.g., the NIH Molecular Libraries Program) incorporated GPCR assays as a core component.  

* **Business outcomes:** Companies that had built pipelines around GPCR biology (e.g., Amgen, Eli Lilly, and newer biotech firms such as Sage Therapeutics) saw substantial valuation gains.  Conversely, firms that bet heavily on other “hot” biology topics mentioned in the blog (e.g., chaperone‑targeting drugs) experienced mixed results; several chaperone‑inhibitor programs entered clinical trials but none have yet produced an approved product as of early 2026.  

**What the blog’s highlighted topics achieved:**  
* **Nuclear‑hormone signaling** (e.g., steroid receptors) remains a major therapeutic area, but no Nobel was awarded for it in 2012.  
* **Molecular chaperones** (Hsp90, Hsp70) have yielded several clinical candidates; none have secured approval, and the field is still considered high‑risk.  
* **Oncogenes** continued to dominate cancer research, yet the Nobel prize that year went to a signaling‑receptor story rather than a classic oncogene.  
* **Western/Southern blotting** and other “technique” mentions are now largely historical; newer proteomics and sequencing methods have supplanted them in high‑impact research.  
* **Bio‑inorganic discoveries** (e.g., metal‑based enzymes) have produced niche drugs (e.g., platinum chemotherapy) but did not influence the 2012 prize.

Overall, the 2012 Chemistry Nobel highlighted a single, well‑defined mechanistic breakthrough (GPCR structure‑function) rather than the broader, more diffuse biological themes the blog emphasized.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit predictions, but it references the betting pools that favored the “biology side” of chemistry.  Implicitly, the blog suggested that one of the listed biological topics might win.  The reality can be evaluated as follows:

- **Prediction (implicit):** A Nobel would be awarded for work on nuclear‑hormone signaling, chaperone proteins, oncogenes, blotting techniques, or bio‑inorganic chemistry.  
  - **Outcome:** None of these areas received the 2012 Chemistry prize.  The award went to GPCR research, which, while biologically important, was not among the specific topics highlighted.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** The prize would recognize a “biology‑heavy” chemistry discovery.  
  - **Outcome:** Partially correct – GPCRs are membrane proteins and the work sits at the interface of chemistry (structural biology, ligand design) and biology (cell signaling).  However, the specific sub‑fields mentioned were not the winners.

No other concrete forecasts appear in the post, so no further bullet‑point evaluation is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10**  
The piece is a fleeting snapshot of Nobel‑season speculation; it offers little substantive analysis and its predictions turned out to be off‑target, limiting its lasting relevance.  It is mildly interesting as a cultural artifact of scientific hype but not of enduring scientific importance.
