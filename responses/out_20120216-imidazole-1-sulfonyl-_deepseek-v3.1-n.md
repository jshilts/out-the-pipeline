# Imidazole-1-Sulfonyl Azide HCl: Look Out (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses safety concerns about imidazole-1-sulfonyl azide hydrochloride, a reagent used by chemists to form azides. The author notes that this reagent was promoted in a 2007 Organic Letters paper as a "safe-to-handle shelf-stable azide transfer reagent" and had become popular among synthetic chemists. However, a 2012 collaborative study by researchers from the University of Western Australia, University of British Columbia, and the Klapötke group at Munich revealed that the hydrochloride salt was actually impact-sensitive and decomposed upon storage, generating toxic hydrazoic acid. The author discovered his own stored reagent had turned "dark and gooey" and had to dispose of it with safety precautions. The new research suggested the hydrogensulfate and fluoroborate salts were safer, more stable alternatives, while noting the perchlorate salt should only be prepared by explosives experts.

The author also criticized the scientific literature process, questioning why the original 2007 paper promoting this reagent lacked any safety updates or links to subsequent hazard information.

## 2. HISTORY

### Reagent Usage and Safety Evolution:
- **Original development and adoption**: Imidazole-1-sulfonyl azide hydrochloride was introduced by researchers including Robert Stick at the University of Western Australia, and gained popularity in 2007-2011 as a seemingly safe azide transfer reagent.

- **Safety revelations**: The 2012 Klapötke study confirmed the hydrochloride salt was impact-sensitive and decomposed during storage. This created a disposal hazard for laboratories worldwide that had adopted the reagent based on initial safety claims.

- **Alternative safer reagents**: Following these findings, chemists increasingly adopted the more stable hydrogensulfate and fluoroborate salt versions, though these were slower to gain widespread use.

### Ongoing Impact:
- **Laboratory safety practices**: This incident contributed to broader awareness about verifying long-term stability data for chemical reagents and highlighted the risks of adopting new reagents before sufficient safety characterization.

- **Scientific communication**: The episode underscored problems with post-publication safety communication in scientific literature, though systematic solutions for retroactive hazard notifications have remained limited.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses important laboratory safety concerns and highlights systemic issues in scientific communication, though its impact was primarily within the specialized field of synthetic chemistry rather than biotechnology or broader scientific domains.
