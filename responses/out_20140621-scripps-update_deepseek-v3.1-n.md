# Scripps Update (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports that faculty at the Scripps Research Institute were objecting to a proposed deal with USC in June 2014. As a result of this opposition, UC-San Diego was reportedly ready to explore its own merger deal with Scripps. The author notes that geographically, UC-San Diego (located down North Torrey Pines Road from Scripps) would be logistically easier than USC in Los Angeles, but that other considerations beyond logistics were involved. The piece suggests the merger discussions could extend for some time.

## 2. HISTORY

The Scripps Research Institute merger discussions did indeed "go on for a while" and ultimately followed a different path than what was being considered in 2014:

**Deal with USC (2014-2015):** The proposed USC affiliation that faculty had objected to was formally terminated in December 2015 after failing to gain sufficient support.

**Alternative partnerships emerged:** Rather than merging with UC-San Diego as speculated in the article, Scripps Research Institute eventually partnered with a different California institution - in 2016, Scripps announced a strategic agreement with California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr).

**Continued independence:** Scripps Research Institute remained independent rather than merging with any university, continuing its status as one of the world's leading independent nonprofit biomedical research organizations.

**Ongoing collaborations:** While no full merger occurred with either USC or UC-San Diego, Scripps maintained research collaborations with various institutions including those in the San Diego area.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained one implicit prediction:

• **"This could go on for a while!"** - This proved accurate. The merger discussions did continue for an extended period, with the USC deal not officially terminated until December 2015, eighteen months after this article, and alternative partnership discussions continuing beyond that timeframe.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This article documents an interesting moment in the ongoing organizational dynamics of a major research institution, but the merger speculation ultimately didn't materialize as described, making it primarily of historical interest for institutional development rather than having broader scientific or biotech industry impact.
