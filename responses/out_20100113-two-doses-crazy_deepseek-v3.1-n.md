# Two Doses of Crazy (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary article critiques two conspiracy theories related to the pharmaceutical industry. First, it addresses Joe Collier's claim that "Big Pharma" would suppress research showing that cell phone electromagnetic emissions could have beneficial effects in Alzheimer's rodent models. The author argues this ignores competitive dynamics within the industry where companies actively pursue new treatments to gain market advantage. Second, it dismisses Wolfgang Wodarg's assertion that the H1N1 flu pandemic was a "fake" manufactured by drug companies to sell vaccines, pointing out that such coordination would require controlling dozens of global health agencies simultaneously.

## 2. HISTORY

**Cell Phone/Alzheimer's Research:**
The 2010 South Florida study by Arendash et al. on electromagnetic exposure and Alzheimer's in mice was indeed followed up, but with mixed results. Subsequent research showed inconsistent replication across different labs and models. No electromagnetic-based Alzheimer's therapy has reached clinical practice or FDA approval. Pharmaceutical companies continued pursuing traditional drug development approaches for Alzheimer's, with efforts by companies like Biogen, Eli Lilly, and Roche continuing despite numerous high-profile failures. The sector has struggled tremendously; between 2010-2020, over 99% of Alzheimer's drug candidates failed clinical trials. The electromagnetic approach never became commercially viable or a serious competitive threat to traditional pharmaceutical approaches.

**H1N1 Pandemic Response:**
The WHO was investigated by the Council of Europe in 2010 regarding its pandemic response. The official inquiry found no evidence of industry manipulation, but did identify improvements needed in transparency around expert conflicts of interest. H1N1 vaccines proved safe and effective, with post-pandemic studies confirming appropriate public health responses. Post-crisis analyses showed the pandemic was genuine, though less severe than initially feared. This experience led to reforms in pandemic preparedness planning but no evidence supported claims of industry-engineered pandemics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Collier's prediction:** "Big Pharma will quash electromagnetic treatment theory" - **FALSE**. The research was followed up independently by multiple academic institutions and industry showed little interest, neither promoting nor suppressing it.
• **Author's counterprediction:** "The study would be followed up and someone would try to commercialize it if viable" - **PARTIALLY TRUE**. Research continued through 2010s but never attracted significant commercial investment or reached clinical viability.
• **Industry response expectation:** No coordinated suppression effort emerged - **TRUE**. The pharmaceutical industry's response was largely indifference rather than coordinated opposition.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
This article addresses specific conspiracy theories that were already fringe when published, with most claims disproven within the subsequent 1-2 years. The H1N1 discussion had more lasting relevance for transparency in public health policymaking.
