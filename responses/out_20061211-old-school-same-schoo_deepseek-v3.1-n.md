# Old School? Same School! (December 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
The author reflects on finding old photos from their graduate school lab in the mid-1980s. He notes that his bench was less cluttered than he remembered, attributing this to limited funding that forced careful use of equipment like round-bottom flasks and pipets. The more striking observation is that most of the basic lab equipment—flasks, Erlenmeyer flasks, rotary evaporators, separatory funnels, and TLC plates—remained essentially unchanged and could still be used for his current work in 2006. While he'd want modern chromatography systems (Biotage or Isco) that didn't exist in the 1980s, the core tools of synthetic chemistry had remarkable continuity over two decades, making him wonder whether this stability was reassuring or concerning for the field's dynamism.

## 2. HISTORY
The fundamental observation about chemistry lab equipment continuity proved remarkably prescient. Between 2006 and the present, synthetic organic chemistry has maintained its core tools while seeing dramatic improvements in automation and analysis. Much like how pipettes and flasks persisted from the 1980s to 2006, these same basic tools remain standard in 2024.

However, significant changes did occur:
- **Automation and high-throughput systems** became widespread in pharmaceutical and industrial labs, though academic labs maintained more traditional approaches
- **Analytical instrumentation** improved dramatically—NMR, mass spectrometry, and chromatography systems became faster, more sensitive, and more automated
- **Flow chemistry** gained adoption in industrial settings for scalable synthesis
- **Computer-aided drug design** and computational chemistry became integrated into routine workflows
- **Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS)** became standard for data management

The paradox noted by the author persisted: core synthetic techniques remained remarkably stable while the surrounding infrastructure evolved considerably.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contains implicit predictions embedded in its observations:

• **Equipment continuity would continue**: **CORRECT** - Basic glassware and core equipment (round-bottom flasks, Erlenmeyer flasks, separatory funnels, rotary evaporators, TLC plates) remain standard in 2024. These tools have proven timeless for fundamental chemical manipulations.

• **Field might not be dynamic enough**: **PARTIALLY CORRECT** - While core synthetic techniques remained stable, the field did evolve dynamically through automation, computational methods, and analytical advances. The author's concern about stagnation was somewhat misplaced—stability of core tools proved efficient rather than limiting.

• **Modern chromatography systems were desirable but not essential**: **CORRECT** - Automated flash chromatography systems like Biotage and Isco became standard but didn't replace the fundamental separatory techniques they automated and enhanced.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
This brief personal reflection captures an interesting paradox about scientific tool longevity, but it's a narrow observation rather than substantive industry analysis with broad implications.
