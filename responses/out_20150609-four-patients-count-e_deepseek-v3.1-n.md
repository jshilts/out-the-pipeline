# Four Patients. Count 'Em, Four. (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 Pipeline commentary criticized the market's reaction to Sage Therapeutics' announcement of a four-patient open-label study in postpartum depression using SAGE-547, a GABA-A allosteric modulator being developed for severe epilepsy indications. The author acknowledged that Sage's strategy of targeting severe, underserved CNS conditions was legitimate and innovative, but strongly cautioned that a four-patient study without placebo controls was being inappropriately celebrated, especially given high placebo response rates typical in antidepressant trials. The article expressed concern about biopharma market froth, noting how Sage's stock was jumping dramatically in premarket trading, and mentioned that another GABA-based epilepsy company, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, was experiencing similar market excitement despite the preliminary nature of their data.

## 2. HISTORY
Sage Therapeutics continued development of their GABA-A modulators after this 2015 study:

**Postpartum Depression Success**: Sage's approach eventually led to real clinical success, with brexanolone (SAGE-547) receiving FDA approval in March 2019 under the brand name Zulresso. Zulresso became the first FDA-approved treatment specifically for postpartum depression, demonstrating rapid antidepressant effects within 24-48 hours when administered as a continuous IV infusion over 60 hours. The market uptake, however, faced challenges due to the lengthy IV administration requirement and the REMS program requirement for administration in certified healthcare facilities.

**Epilepsy Indication**: For super-refractory status epilepticus, there is not sufficient evidence to support this indication beyond preliminary studies.

**Additional Success**: Sage developed zuranolone (SAGE-217), an oral GABA-A positive allosteric modulator also targeting postpartum depression, which showed promise in subsequent trials and eventually received FDA approval, aiming to address the administration challenges of IV brexanolone.

As of 2024, Sage Therapeutics remains an active biopharmaceutical company trading on NASDAQ, having successfully translated their GABA-A modulator platform into the first FDA-approved therapies for postpartum depression. Their pipeline continued as they aimed to expand into other neuropsychiatric conditions beyond their initial focus areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Market Froth vs. Clinical Reality**: The article predicted that the biopharma market was overreacting to preliminary data, which was accurate in the short term. However, over the longer term, the scientific and clinical potential that investors were sensing proved more substantial than the author anticipated, leading to eventual FDA approvals.

- **Recommendation for Larger Placebo-Controlled Trials**: This prediction was fulfilled—Sage conducted larger placebo-controlled trials that ultimately supported regulatory approval.

- **Placebo Response Concerns**: The article's concern about high placebo responses in the antidepressant field was well-founded. The eventual FDA approval and clinical data suggested that the rapid onset and magnitude of response differentiated the drug from placebo effects, though this remained a consideration throughout development.

- **Long Development Path Needed**: The author's implicit prediction that significant further development would be required proved correct—it took nearly four years from this 2015 study to FDA approval in 2019.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article showcases early-stage biopharma market dynamics and provides a classic example of how preliminary scientific data can be simultaneously exciting and premature, with the long-term trajectory ultimately validating some of the initial scientific promise while confirming concerns about premature market enthusiasm.
