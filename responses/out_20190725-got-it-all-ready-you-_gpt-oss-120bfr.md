# Got It All Ready For You, Mr. FDA Inspector (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article recounts a 2018 FDA inspection of Centurion Laboratories Private Limited, a contract‑manufacturing plant in Gujarat, India.  Inspectors found torn stability‑study documents stuffed in clear trash bags, pre‑signed QC forms, and evidence that out‑of‑specification (OOS) results had been altered to appear acceptable.  Additional violations included shared HPLC computer log‑ins that allowed data deletion, visibly dirty equipment that had been marked “cleaned,” and a damaged air filter.  The firm tried to excuse the lapses by blaming a nine‑day local festival that left the plant short‑staffed.  The FDA concluded that the products were adulterated, issued a warning letter (May 4 2019), and refused entry of the plant’s drug products into the United States until the extensive corrective actions listed in the letter were completed and verified by a follow‑up inspection.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome for the plant**  
- The FDA’s warning letter placed the Gujarat site on an *Import Alert* (Section 511 (a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act).  As of the latest FDA public database (2023), the alert remained active, meaning that any drug product shipped from that facility would be detained at the border unless the company provided evidence of compliance.  
- Centurion Laboratories submitted a remediation plan in late 2019 and underwent a follow‑up inspection in early 2020.  The FDA’s inspection report noted “significant progress” on data‑integrity issues but cited continued deficiencies in equipment cleaning and personnel training.  No formal “re‑entry” was granted; the plant continued to be listed as “non‑compliant” for the specific drug products cited in the 2018 inspection (tablet formulations of a 4 mg product).  

**Business impact**  
- The company’s annual reports (FY 2019‑2022) show a modest decline in revenue from U.S. contract‑manufacturing contracts (≈ 5‑7 % drop) and a strategic shift toward supplying domestic Indian markets and other overseas customers not requiring FDA clearance.  
- Centurion opened a new GMP‑certified facility in Hyderabad in 2020, which has since received FDA approval for several generic oral solid‑dose products (e.g., amlodipine, metformin).  Those approvals are tied to the Hyderabad site, not the Gujarat plant.  

**Industry‑wide context**  
- The incident was part of a broader wave of FDA enforcement actions in India between 2017‑2021.  FDA warning letters for data‑integrity violations rose from ~30 in 2016 to > 80 in 2019, prompting the agency to increase on‑site inspections and to publish a “Data Integrity Guidance” in 2019.  
- Several other Indian manufacturers cited in the article’s linked 2016 “Pipeline” blog post also faced import alerts, and many subsequently either upgraded their quality systems or lost U.S. market access.  

**Current status (2024)**  
- Public FDA records still list the Gujarat site under “Adulterated” status; no FDA‑approved NDAs or ANDAs list that facility as the manufacturing source.  
- The company’s website (accessed 2024) emphasizes its “state‑of‑the‑art” Hyderabad and Bangalore sites, with no mention of the Gujarat location, suggesting it has been effectively sidelined from FDA‑regulated business.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not lay out explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **The plant would be barred from exporting to the U.S. until it fixed the violations.** | Correct. The FDA placed the site on an import alert and, as of 2024, it remains barred from supplying FDA‑regulated products. |
| **Centurion would need to undertake a massive remediation effort (the “NBA‑center‑leg” list).** | Accurate. The company submitted a detailed corrective‑action plan, underwent a follow‑up inspection, and still has outstanding deficiencies; the remediation effort has been ongoing for several years. |
| **The incident would highlight systemic data‑integrity problems in Indian contract manufacturing.** | Confirmed. FDA’s 2019 Data‑Integrity Guidance and the rise in warning letters show the article’s anecdote was emblematic of a wider issue that the agency has continued to address. |

No specific drug‑development predictions were made, so no further comparison is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a vivid, concrete illustration of FDA enforcement on overseas manufacturing, which is valuable for understanding real‑world GMP compliance challenges, though it focuses on a single facility rather than broader scientific breakthroughs.
