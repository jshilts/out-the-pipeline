# Update on Bexarotene for Alzheimer's (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary describes the emerging controversy surrounding bexarotene as a potential Alzheimer's treatment. The article follows up on earlier excitement from February 2012, when the Landreth lab at Case Western reported that the cancer drug bexarotene could rapidly clear amyloid plaques, reduce soluble amyloid, and improve memory in Alzheimer's mouse models. By May 2013, four independent studies published in *Science* had failed to replicate the dramatic plaque clearance results, though some did observe reductions in soluble amyloid and occasional memory improvements. Landreth acknowledged the replication failures while suggesting methodological differences might explain the discrepancies, and notably shifted focus away from plaque clearance toward soluble amyloid reduction as potentially more relevant. The author expresses skepticism about this apparent goalpost-moving and characterizes Alzheimer's drug development as perpetually challenging and slow.

## 2. HISTORY

The bexarotene story evolved into a cautionary tale about replication in neuroscience and the amyloid hypothesis. **Clinical trials ensued but ultimately failed**: Early-phase human studies showed bexarotene did not replicate the promising mouse results. A 2014 study in JAMA Neurology found that while bexarotene increased APOE levels (the proposed mechanism), it did not reduce amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's patients as measured by PET imaging. Subsequent trials through 2015-2017 consistently failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy in humans.

**The research community's understanding matured**: The bexarotene episode contributed to growing awareness that mouse models of Alzheimer's may not adequately predict human responses, particularly regarding amyloid clearance. This added to accumulating evidence questioning whether amyloid plaques themselves are the right therapeutic target, a debate that intensified after multiple anti-amyloid drugs failed clinical trials despite clearing plaques.

**Impact on bexarotene's status**: Bexarotene remains FDA-approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma but never gained approval or widespread off-label use for Alzheimer's. The drug's side effects (including hypertriglyceridemia and thyroid dysfunction) also limited its viability as a chronic therapy for elderly patients. Pharmaceutical interest in repurposing bexarotene for Alzheimer's largely dissipated by 2015-2016.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"Chasing it down is going to be a long-term effort"** - **CORRECT**. Bexarotene research continued for several years but never produced an effective Alzheimer's treatment. The prediction accurately captured the slow, difficult nature of Alzheimer's drug development.

• **"We're in for a long haul. With Alzheimer's, we're always in for a long haul"** - **CORRECT**. This broader prediction proved prescient. Between 2013-2023, numerous high-profile Alzheimer's drug candidates failed in clinical trials, including several targeting amyloid pathways. Success remained elusive throughout the decade.

• **Implicit prediction that the mechanism might have merit despite replication issues** - **MOSTLY INCORRECT**. While soluble amyloid reduction showed some replication in mice, this did not translate to clinical benefit in humans. The molecular mechanism (RXR activation leading to APOE upregulation) failed to demonstrate meaningful therapeutic impact.

• **Implicit suggestion that bexarotene's existing safety profile would accelerate development** - **PARTIALLY CORRECT BUT ULTIMATELY IRRELEVANT**. While prior FDA approval did enable faster initiation of trials, the drug's side-effect profile actually proved problematic for elderly patients, and more fundamentally, lack of efficacy made safety advantages moot.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captures an important moment in Alzheimer's research history—the transition from initial excitement to replication crisis—making it moderately interesting. However, the bexarotene story, while instructive, was just one of many failed amyloid-targeting approaches, limiting its broader significance compared to foundational discoveries or successful therapeutic breakthroughs.
