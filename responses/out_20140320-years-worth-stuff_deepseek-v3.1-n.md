# Years Worth of the Stuff (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article by Derek Lowe critiques the proliferation of poor-quality chemical compounds being sold and used as "selective inhibitors" in biomedical research. The author focuses on a specific bis-chalcone compound marketed as a selective inhibitor of two deubiquitinase enzymes, highlighting its problematic chemical structure. Lowe traces this compound class back through publications from 2001-2006, noting the lack of proper structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies or selectivity testing.

The central argument is that many commercially available "tool compounds" are actually promiscuous, reactive molecules that hit multiple targets, making them unreliable for biological investigation. The author emphasizes that good tool compounds require extensive medicinal chemistry validation, with higher standards than typical drug candidates. Lowe expresses concern that IBM's Watson initiative on glioblastoma genomics might founder because it's being fed pathway data from scientific literature that contains substantial amounts of unreliable information generated using such problematic compounds.

## 2. HISTORY
Several concrete developments occurred after this article's publication:

**Quality Control Initiatives**: The scientific community increasingly recognized the problem of poorly characterized research compounds. This led to initiatives like the Structural Genomics Consortium's chemical probe efforts, which established higher standards for validating tool compounds before distribution to the research community.

**Impact on Research Reproducibility**: The issues highlighted contributed to growing awareness of the reproducibility crisis in biomedical research. Studies showed that many published findings couldn't be replicated, partly due to insufficient compound characterization and off-target effects.

**Educational Response**: Major scientific organizations and journals began implementing more stringent requirements for chemical characterization in publications. The need for proper controls, counter-screens, and orthogonal validation became more widely recognized and enforced.

**IBM Watson in Healthcare**: IBM's Watson for Oncology program, launched around 2012-2013, faced significant real-world challenges. While initially promising, the program struggled with clinical implementation and was eventually sold off in 2022 as IBM shifted away from healthcare AI applications. The difficulties Lowe anticipated—especially around data quality and pathway reliability—proved prescient.

**Compound Vendors**: Increased scrutiny led to some vendors improving compound characterization, though the market for poorly validated tool compounds continued for several years, with researchers becoming more aware of vendor quality differences.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"Tool compound" quality will remain problematic**: This prediction proved accurate. Despite improved awareness, many commercially available compounds continued lacking proper validation, contributing to research reproducibility issues throughout the 2010s.
• **Watson's glioblastoma project would be humbling**: This was prescient. IBM's broader Watson healthcare initiatives encountered substantial difficulties in clinical settings and ultimately did not revolutionize cancer treatment as initially hoped, with IBM divesting from Watson Health by 2022.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 8/10**
This article scores high for its accurate anticipation of major challenges in research reproducibility and AI applications in medicine, covering fundamental quality control issues that remained relevant for years.
