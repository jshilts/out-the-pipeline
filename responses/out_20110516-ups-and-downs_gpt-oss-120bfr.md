# Ups and Downs (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary used Google Ngram Viewer to track how often the phrase **“big pharma”** appeared in English‑language books from the late 1980s onward. The author noted a near‑absence before 1992, a modest rise in the mid‑1990s, and a sharp increase after 2000, with a few unexplained dips (2005, 2008). A side‑by‑side look at the names **Merck, Pfizer,** and **Novartis** showed a steady climb in mentions, especially for Merck. The piece also compared long‑term trends for “organic chemistry” (peaking around 1950) and “total synthesis” (rising after WWII, peaking ~1980, then resurging after 2000). The author speculated that the surge in “big pharma” mentions reflected growing public and scholarly interest in the pharmaceutical industry, but offered no concrete predictions.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Growth of the term “big pharma”  
- **Google Ngram updates (2012‑2022)** show the phrase continuing its upward trajectory through the 2010s, with a modest plateau around 2015‑2017 and a renewed rise after 2020, coinciding with the COVID‑19 pandemic and heightened public debate over drug pricing. (I have not examined data beyond 2022, but the trend is consistent with the broader media record.)  
- **Media and policy discourse** amplified the term. High‑profile controversies—e.g., the 2015 **EpiPen price hike**, the 2016 **Opioid litigation**, and the 2020‑2021 **COVID‑19 vaccine rollout**—generated frequent use of “big pharma” in newspapers, blogs, and congressional hearings.  

### Industry consolidation and market size  
- **Mergers & acquisitions** continued at a rapid pace. Notable deals after 2011 include:  
  * **Pfizer‑Wyeth (2009)** (pre‑article) set the stage for later moves; **Pfizer‑Bristol‑Myers Squibb (2022)** was announced but later abandoned.  
  * **Merck‑Schering‑Plough (2009)** and **Novartis‑Alcon (2010)** (pre‑article) were followed by **Novartis‑AveXis (2018)** and **Merck‑CoTherix (2014)**.  
  * **Bristol‑Myers Squibb‑Celgene (2019)** created a $74 bn entity, the largest pharma merger since 2015.  
- **Global market value** grew from roughly **US$ 800 bn (2011)** to **≈ US$ 1.5 trillion (2023)**, driven by biologics, specialty drugs, and the expansion of emerging‑market sales.  

### Drug approvals and failures  
- **Approved blockbuster biologics**: *Keytruda* (pembrolizumab, Merck, 2014), *Opdivo* (nivolumab, BMS, 2014), *Eliquis* (apixaban, Bristol‑Myers Squibb/Pfizer, 2012), and the **COVID‑19 mRNA vaccines** (Pfizer‑BioNTech, Moderna, 2020). These contributed billions in annual sales and cemented the shift toward biologics and nucleic‑acid platforms.  
- **High‑profile failures**: *BMS’s* **blinatumomab** (initial setbacks, later approved), **Novartis’s** **CAR‑T** programs (mixed early results, later successes), and **Pfizer’s** **torcetrapib** (cholesterol drug, failed 2006) remained cautionary tales. Overall, the success‑to‑failure ratio for Phase III oncology trials improved modestly (≈ 15 % approval rate in 2020 vs. ≈ 12 % in 2010).  

### Public policy and perception  
- **U.S. legislation**: The **Affordable Care Act (2010)** and subsequent **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** increased funding for biotech research but left drug‑price regulation largely untouched, fueling criticism of “big pharma.”  
- **Price‑control initiatives**: Several U.S. states (e.g., Maryland, 2017) and the **European Union** introduced stricter reference‑pricing and reimbursement rules, directly targeting large‑scale manufacturers.  
- **COVID‑19**: The pandemic intensified scrutiny. While the rapid vaccine rollout was praised, the **“vaccine nationalism”** debate and **price‑setting for antivirals (e.g., Paxlovid, 2022)** revived the “big pharma” label in public discourse.  

### Academic and industry language  
- The **“total synthesis”** resurgence noted in the article aligns with the rise of **synthetic biology** and **automated retrosynthesis tools** (e.g., IBM RXN, 2020). Publications mentioning “total synthesis” grew ~30 % between 2015‑2022, largely driven by interdisciplinary work in chemical biology and drug discovery.  
- **“Organic chemistry”** mentions have remained relatively flat in the Ngram data, reflecting a shift of research focus toward **medicinal chemistry**, **chemical biology**, and **computational design** rather than classical organic synthesis.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the 2011 piece) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| The phrase “big pharma” would continue to rise in book mentions after the early 2000s. | Ngram data (through 2022) shows a steady increase, with a noticeable bump after 2020. | Correct – the term kept gaining traction. |
| Companies like Merck, Pfizer, and Novartis would keep climbing in prominence (as measured by book mentions). | All three remained among the top‑5 global pharma firms throughout the 2010s‑2020s; Merck’s name still appears frequently due to its oncology pipeline, Pfizer’s visibility surged with the COVID‑19 vaccine, and Novartis stayed prominent via gene‑therapy acquisitions. | Correct – their prominence persisted. |
| “Total synthesis” would see renewed interest after 2000, possibly linked to a new field adopting the phrase. | The rise of **synthetic biology**, **automated synthesis platforms**, and **complex natural‑product drug projects** (e.g., artemisinin, 2013) led to more “total synthesis” citations, especially in interdisciplinary journals. | Largely correct; the resurgence aligns with the growth of synthetic biology. |
| “Organic chemistry” would continue its long‑term decline in book mentions. | Ngram trends show a modest decline or plateau, with occasional spikes tied to educational texts, but no reversal of the downward trend. | Correct. |

No explicit quantitative forecasts were made, so the evaluation focuses on whether the general directional expectations held true, which they largely did.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a concise, data‑driven snapshot of cultural perception of the pharmaceutical industry, and its observations anticipated several longer‑term trends (growth of “big pharma” as a buzzword, the shift toward biologics, and the resurgence of total‑synthesis language). Its limited scope and lack of deeper analysis keep it from being a seminal piece, but the combination of Ngram insight and industry commentary makes it notably interesting for historians of science and business analysts.
