# Multitasking (18 Nov 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog-style post from November 2002 captures a working medicinal chemist's end-of-day reflections while juggling multiple lab projects and writing responsibilities. The author contemplates where to submit a finished paper, considering the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry but weighing the additional experimental requirements that journal demands. Specifically, he mentions that J. Med. Chem. requires combustion analysis (% carbon, hydrogen, oxygen determined by burning compounds) for key compounds, as well as optical rotations—both of which he considers "more trouble than they're worth," though acknowledging they can be useful for determining salt forms or stable hydrates. The tone is candid and somewhat weary, reflecting the practical day-to-day trade-offs between publication venue prestige and experimental burden.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2002 post, the landscape of medicinal chemistry publication practices did not fundamentally change overnight, but several trends gradually reshaped experimental reporting requirements. Combustion analysis (elemental analysis) remained a quality standard for many high-impact medicinal chemistry journals for the next decade, though NMR and HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry) increasingly provided alternative or complementary purity and identity verification. The practical inconvenience the author noted—compounds migrating to distant parts of the lab—reflected real logistical friction in pre-digital compound management systems. By the mid-2010s, many laboratories adopted better compound tracking and inventory systems, though combustion analysis still persisted where absolute purity confirmation was critical. The broader challenge of balancing publication standards with practical workflow efficiency continued, with some journals later introducing tiered requirements or accepting modern characterization methods as alternatives.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No substantive predictions were made in this article. The piece is purely descriptive of the author's immediate work situation and personal preferences regarding analytical chemistry requirements. There are no forward-looking statements about industry trends, drug development trajectories, or scientific methodology that could be evaluated against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This post documents procedural and logistical concerns specific to laboratory workflow and publication requirements in medicinal chemistry. It offers little insight into biotechnology industry trends, drug development outcomes, or policy evolution, and has minimal long-term importance beyond illustrating routine academic publication practices of the era.
