# Another New Med-Chem Journal (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2010 blog post noted the launch of *MedChemComm* by the Royal Society of Chemistry, alongside an existing new ACS medicinal chemistry journal. The author observed that the number of industry-employed medicinal chemists had been declining for several years with no end in sight, creating a seeming contradiction: more publication venues opening while the pool of potential industry authors was shrinking.

The article speculated about potential consequences: short-term, researchers might rush to publish everything possible to bolster patent and publication records; long-term, the field might see either fewer papers overall or a relative increase in publications from academic labs as industry contributions diminished. The post framed this as a "minor worry" for the publishing world specifically.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent decade-plus revealed a complex reality that partially aligned with and partially contradicted these observations:

**Publishing Landscape Evolution**: Both *MedChemComm* (RSC) and *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* became established journals, but the broader trend was consolidation in scientific publishing through mergers (Wiley-Blackwell, Springer-Nature) and the rise of mega-journals (PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports) that accept work based on technical soundness rather than perceived impact. The "publish or perish" pressure intensified across academia.

**Industry Employment Patterns**: The decline in pharmaceutical medicinal chemistry positions proved real and prolonged. Major companies continued outsourcing and restructuring throughout the 2010s. However, this was partially offset by growth in:
- Biotechnology companies (especially post-2012 as drug discovery became more capital-efficient)
- CROs (contract research organizations) expanded significantly
- Academic drug discovery centers and non-profit research institutes

**Research Output Patterns**: The total volume of medicinal chemistry publications continued rising through the 2010s, driven heavily by academic labs and international research groups (particularly from China and India). Industry publications did become relatively scarcer, with many companies adopting stricter IP protection policies. The predicted rush to publish everything did occur, but it was more pronounced in academia than industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Short-term surge in publications**: ✓ Accurate - There was indeed increased publication pressure throughout the 2010s, though this was more driven by academic career pressures and global research expansion than patent/IP concerns alone.

- **Long-term decline in paper quantity OR shift to academic dominance**: ✓ Partially Accurate - Total papers continued growing (no absolute decline), but there was indeed a relative shift toward academic labs as primary publishers in medicinal chemistry journals.

- **Implicit concern about journal viability**: ✓ Accurate - While the major society journals survived, many smaller/newer journals struggled with sustainability, and the 2010s saw numerous discussions about journal consolidation, open access economics, and the "reproducibility crisis" affecting perceived value of incremental medicinal chemistry publications.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

While perceptive about employment trends, the article's narrow focus on the publishing implications of a single new journal launch limits its broader significance. The underlying observation about industry decline was prescient, but the analysis remained at surface level without exploring deeper structural changes in pharmaceutical R&D that would become evident in subsequent years.
