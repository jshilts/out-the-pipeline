# One Time Only. Or Maybe Just a Few. (February 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This personal reflection article by a medicinal chemist discusses chemical reactions that the author has only performed once or briefly during their career, categorizing them into reactions that could potentially be used again versus those they believe are permanently retired from their practice. The author reflects on reactions like the Arbuzov reaction, Claisen rearrangement, Ferrier rearrangements, hydrogenations, and various other named organic transformations from their graduate school and postdoctoral work. 

The narrative distinguishes between reactions that remain "perfectly reasonable" but haven't been needed recently, and reactions that are unlikely to be revisited due to better alternatives (like PCC oxidations being superseded) or personal safety concerns (such as working with hydrofluoric acid, phosgene, or explosive Dess-Martin periodinane intermediates). The article captures the practical, evolving nature of a working chemist's repertoire over decades of drug discovery work.

## 2. HISTORY

This particular article represents a personal blog post from "In the Pipeline," Derek Lowe's widely-read medicinal chemistry blog that has run since the early 2000s. The piece reflects the ongoing evolution of synthetic chemistry practice in pharmaceutical research rather than predicting specific biotechnological developments.

Following this 2008 article, several trends in pharmaceutical chemistry have unfolded:
- **Continuous process improvement**: Many of the hazardous or cumbersome reactions mentioned (phosgene chemistry, large-scale Dess-Martin preparations) have indeed become less common as commercial suppliers provide safer alternatives and synthetic routes are redesigned for efficiency and safety.
- **High-throughput experimentation**: The article's mention of "what comes out of the next high-throughput screen" anticipated the increasing automation and miniaturization of reaction screening that became widespread in the 2010s.
- **Flow chemistry adoption**: Many hazardous batch reactions (including those involving unstable intermediates or high-pressure conditions) have increasingly moved to continuous flow systems, improving safety and reproducibility.
- **Older reactions see renewed use**: Ironically, some "classic" reactions mentioned (Claisen, Henry, various cycloadditions) have experienced renewed interest as new synthetic challenges emerge and as automated literature mining helps chemists discover forgotten transformations suitable for complex targets.

The author continued blogging about medicinal chemistry for years after this post, maintaining a focus on practical aspects of drug discovery rather than making specific predictive claims about biotechnology industry directions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contains minimal explicit predictions about biotechnology or pharmaceutical outcomes. It is primarily descriptive of existing chemistry practice circa 2008. However, some implicit directional statements appear:

- **Implicit prediction about safer chemistry adoption**: The author's personal avoidance of hazardous reactions (phosgene, HF, explosive intermediates) aligns with a broader industry trend toward safer, more sustainable chemistry that accelerated after 2008.
- **Implicit prediction about commercial availability**: The mention that Dess-Martin periodinane "wasn't commercially available" in the early 1990s but had become available by 2008 reflects the ongoing trend of specialized reagents becoming commercially accessible, which has continued.

The article makes no specific predictions about drug approvals, clinical outcomes, or biotech business developments—it is a chemistry methodology reflection rather than an industry forecasting piece.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article is a personal chemistry blog post with limited broader biotechnology industry significance. While it provides an authentic glimpse into medicinal chemistry practice and contains vaguely directional statements about safer chemistry and commercially available reagents, it lacks the predictive content, policy implications, or drug development outcomes that would make it highly interesting for biotech industry analysis. The content is primarily nostalgic rather than forward-looking.
