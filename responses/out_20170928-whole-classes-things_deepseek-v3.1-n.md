# Whole Classes of Things (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines three approaches to drug discovery: (1) target-based discovery, where researchers select a specific protein target and seek molecules to modulate it; (2) phenotypic screening, where compounds are tested for desired effects in model systems without knowing the mechanism; and (3) target class discovery, an intermediate strategy where drug hunters focus on entire classes of related proteins (e.g., kinases, nuclear receptors, epigenetic enzymes) and develop ligands across the class, then look for disease applications.

The author evaluates target class discovery by comparing historical outcomes. Kinase inhibitors represent the success story—the conserved ATP-binding "hinge region" enabled systematic drug development, producing many approved drugs. Nuclear receptors proved disappointing despite massive investment; while PPAR-gamma drugs (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) emerged from phenotypic screens, most nuclear receptor programs failed. The article raises caution about epigenetics as another target class effort, noting the field is "not what you would call a settled field" with complex biology and diverse enzyme classes.

Success factors identified include: having a tailored chemical library for the target class, robust assay platforms, long-term investment, and management patience. The "virtuous circle of comprehension" takes time to establish. The article's central tension is whether broad target class approaches can systematically reproduce the kinase success story or if they risk repeating the nuclear receptor disappointments.

## 2. HISTORY

**Kinase Inhibitors (Sustained Success):** The kinase inhibitor field continued expanding significantly after 2017. By 2020, the FDA had approved over 70 kinase inhibitors, with dozens more in development. Drugs like osimertinib (EGFR), palbociclib (CDK4/6), ibrutinib (BTK), and venetoclax combinations have become standard-of-care in oncology. However, challenges persisted—resistance mechanisms emerged, limiting duration of response, and toxicity profiles varied. The massive patent landscape mentioned in the article remained intensely competitive. The "hinge-binding motif" strategy continued bearing fruit, validating target class approaches in this specific domain.

**Nuclear Receptors (Continued Failures):** The grim assessment of nuclear receptor programs proved prescient. Rosiglitazone faced major safety issues and was severely restricted or withdrawn in many markets following 2007-2010 cardiovascular risk reports. Pioglitazone remained available but with warnings and limited utilization due to heart failure, bone fractures, and bladder cancer concerns. Dual- and pan-PPAR agonists continued failing in clinical trials for diabetes, NASH, and cardiovascular disease. Efforts targeting LXR, FXR, and RXR produced no major marketed drugs by 2024. The nuclear receptor class largely failed to deliver new therapies beyond the early PPAR-gamma discoveries from phenotypic screens.

**Epigenetics (Mixed Results):** Epigenetic drug development followed the "broadly defined" concern. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors—vorinostat, romidepsin, panobinostat, belinostat—gained FDA approval for various lymphomas but with limited solid tumor efficacy and significant toxicity. EZH2 inhibitors like tazemetostat achieved approval for epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma. However, other epigenetic targets like BET bromodomain inhibitors largely failed in clinical trials due to toxicity and lack of efficacy. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine, decitabine) found use in myelodysplastic syndromes but remained niche. The field remained fragmented by 2024—some successes but no revolution, with biology complexity proving even greater than anticipated.

**Phenotypic Screening (Renewed Interest):** The article's favorable view of phenotypic approaches gained validation. The 2022 approval of bexicaserin for Dravet syndrome (discovered via phenotypic zebrafish screen) and continued interest in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models drove renewed appreciation for mechanism-agnostic discovery. Target identification remained challenging but benefited from improved CRISPR, proteomics, and chemical biology tools. Many companies maintained phenotypic platforms alongside targeted approaches.

**Overall Business Impact:** Companies heavily invested in target class approaches faced mixed fates. The "long-term investment" requirement proved challenging amid quarterly earnings pressures. Some smaller epigenetic companies were acquired for promising preclinical assets, but many target class programs were deprioritized or terminated. The kinase success template proved difficult to replicate for other target classes, validating the author's caution about over-generalizing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Epigenetics Field Assessment ("it may be unfair, because we're not that far out of the initial hype zone")**: The prediction that epigenetics programs required more time proved partially correct. While HDAC and EZH2 inhibitors did achieve approvals between 2017-2024, the field overall delivered far less than early hype suggested. Most programs failed, and the "wildly complex biological back office" indeed limited progress. Rating: **Largely accurate**—epigenetics showed glimmers rather than transformation.

• **Nuclear Receptor Forecast ("if you gave someone in 2001 a look at the field in 2017, they'd wonder where all the drugs were")**: This pessimistic projection proved entirely accurate for the 2017-2024 period. No major new nuclear receptor drugs emerged post-2017, and existing PPAR drugs faced declining usage. The "mixed reviews" verdict became increasingly negative. Rating: **Accurate**—the field remained stagnant.

• **Assay Platform Emphasis ("You're going to need a really solid assay platform")**: This prediction proved consistently important. Companies with robust screening technologies performed better than those with "severe assay bottlenecks." The "heaps of reliable data" requirement became even more critical as target complexity grew. Rating: **Accurate**—assay quality remained a key success factor.

• **Long-Term Investment Requirement ("this sort of thing takes a long-term investment and a long-term mindset")**: This forecast proved challenging for the industry. 2017-2024 saw continued pressures on R&D timelines, with management patience in short supply. Companies that maintained long-range commitments to target classes generally outperformed those chasing quarterly milestones. Rating: **Accurate but difficult**—the principle was sound but industry structure made implementation hard.

• **Phenotypic Screening Value Proposition**: While not directly a forward prediction, the article's implied endorsement of mechanistic agnosticism gained validation. The rise of sophisticated organoid and iPSC platforms post-2017 provided new validation for phenotypic approaches. Rating: **Validated**—phenotypic screening enjoyed resurgence.

• **The "Virtuous Circle of Comprehension"**: The concept that target class work accelerates over time proved true for companies that stayed the course with kinases, but less evident for other classes. Most target class efforts failed to achieve the promised virtuous cycle. Rating: **Partially accurate**—works for proven classes, eludes most others.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article ranks highly for its accurate diagnosis of drug discovery's central strategic dilemma and prescient assessments about target class limitations. The 2017 predictions about epigenetics proved remarkably foresighted, and the analysis captures enduring challenges in pharmaceutical R&D strategy.
