# Article Title (Month Year)
Forecast: Rain, Eventually (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary critiques a Business Week article claiming European drugmakers were surpassing American-based ones in profitability. The author argues this comparison is largely an artifact of timing—US companies like Merck and Pfizer faced patent expirations and bad news in 2005, reversing a previous trend where American companies had big sellers years earlier. 

The commentary questions whether geographic headquarters is a meaningful way to categorize pharmaceutical companies, noting that companies like GlaxoSmithKline (British) share similar culture with American firms, and Novartis would have more in common with Merck than with smaller European companies. The author also批评 the Business Week article for selectively excluding European drug recalls (like Bayer's statin recall) while highlighting American ones, and notes that merger complexities (Sanofi-Aventis merger, Pfizer's acquisitions) complicate direct comparisons.

The overall critique is that the Business Week article fails to draw meaningful larger conclusions about structural differences between European and American pharmaceutical approaches, instead providing what amounts to a superficial weather report of cyclic trends without deeper analysis.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2006 commentary, the pharmaceutical industry landscape evolved significantly over the subsequent decade, though many of the author's points proved prescient:

**Patent Cliff Impact (2006-2015):** Major drugs like Lipitor (Pfizer, 2011), Plavix (Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi, 2012), and others lost patent protection, generating billions in lost revenue. However, companies adapted through various strategies.

**Continued Industry Consolidation:** The trend noted in the article continued. Pfizer acquired Wyeth (2009), Merck merged with Schering-Plough (2009), and Roche acquired Genentech (2009), making geographic distinctions increasingly blurred.

**Rimonabant (Acomplia) Outcome:** The drug mentioned prominently in the article as Sanofi-Aventis's hopeful prospect was rejected by the FDA in 2007 due to psychiatric side effects (depression, suicidal ideation), never reached the US market, and was withdrawn from European markets by 2008. This validates the author's implicit skepticism about banking on single pipeline drugs.

**Industry Performance:** By the 2010s, both American and European companies faced similar challenges, with geographic distinctions becoming less relevant due to global operations, partnerships, and cross-border mergers. Innovation increasingly came from biotech companies (many American) that were later acquired by large pharma.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The commentary didn't make explicit predictions but expressed skepticism about certain trends and comparisons:

- **Implicit skepticism about Business Week's geographic comparisons:** The trend of European companies "overtaking" American ones didn't persist as a clear pattern. Instead, the industry continued a pattern of cyclical performance based on patent cycles, pipeline success, and acquisition strategies rather than geographic advantages.

- **Doubt about Acomplia's prospects:** This proved correct. The drug failed to gain FDA approval and was eventually withdrawn due to safety concerns.

- **Skepticism about meaningful structural differences:** Pharmaceutical companies worldwide increasingly adopted similar business models, with both American and European companies pursuing similar strategies around patent lifecycles, acquisitions, and R&D approaches.

- **Merger complexity impacts:** This continued to be true. Mergers and acquisitions throughout the late 2000s and 2010s made direct company-to-company comparisons increasingly difficult and dependent on how recently mergers had occurred.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article's analysis was sound and demonstrated clear understanding of pharmaceutical industry cycles, but the piece addresses a relatively narrow industry trade publication debate that's now nearly two decades old.
