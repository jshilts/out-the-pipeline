# Ban Intelligent Design? (Feb 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2006 commentary, published on the science blog Pharyngula by PZ Myers, criticizes a Wisconsin state bill seeking an outright legal ban on teaching Intelligent Design in science classrooms. Myers' core argument is that such a legislative ban is counterproductive. Intelligent Design advocates already portray themselves as "brave dissenters" (likening themselves to Galileo) being suppressed by "dogmatic Darwinists," and a ban would hand them a publicity gift. Myers believes the proper way to challenge Intelligent Design is through open debate and rigorous examination of evidence, as exemplified by the federal court case in Dover, Pennsylvania (Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, 2005), where detailed testimony and cross-examination led a judge to rule that ID is not science and is unconstitutional to teach in public school science classes. For Myers, scientists should defeat ID on the merits in open forums, not seek legislative shortcuts.

## 2. HISTORY

**Legal Status of Intelligent Design in Schools:** There have been no successful state-level laws or board-of-education policies mandating or explicitly protecting the teaching of Intelligent Design in U.S. public school science classes since 2006. In 2008, Louisiana passed the "Louisiana Science Education Act," which permits teachers to use "supplemental materials" when teaching "controversial" topics like evolution and climate change. Critics argued it was a backdoor for creationism and ID, but no widespread adoption of ID curricula followed. In 2012, a bill in Tennessee modeled on Louisiana's passed. These "academic freedom" bills did not explicitly name Intelligent Design, largely to avoid the constitutional issues highlighted in *Kitzmiller*. The *Kitzmiller v. Dover* (M.D. Pa. 2005) precedent remained the primary legal barrier; it established that teaching ID in public school science classes violates the Establishment Clause because ID is a form of creationism lacking scientific merit. Federal court rulings after 2006 generally reinforced this stance. No state successfully passed a law banning the teaching of ID, following Myers' recommendation, nor were any passed creating a protected right to teach it. The legal strategy of ID proponents shifted toward these broader "academic freedom" or "critical analysis" bills rather than direct mandates for ID.

**Scientific and Educational Consensus:** There was no change in the scientific consensus that evolution is a robust, well-supported scientific theory, or that Intelligent Design lacks scientific validity. Major scientific and educational organizations (e.g., National Academy of Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Science Teachers Association) continued to strongly oppose teaching Intelligent Design as science, and it never gained traction as a research program within mainstream biology. Public debate did continue in some local school districts over curricula, but efforts to incorporate ID into science standards were consistently defeated.

**Cultural and Political Activity:** The Discovery Institute, a leading proponent of Intelligent Design, continued its activities, promoting "academic freedom" legislation and public outreach, including screenings of the ID-promoting film *Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed* (2008). However, no major new legal challenges to evolution education at the federal or state supreme court level succeeded. The issue became less prominent in national headlines than it was in the 2005-2006 period, although it remained a persistent undercurrent in certain political and educational circles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

*   **"We can handle this on our own. I want to see it given the drubbing it deserves in open debate, over and over again, until it goes away."**
    *   **Outcome:** This prediction proved largely correct in its long-term impact on institutional and legal outcomes for ID, but less so regarding the cessation of public debate. The strategy of defeating ID through evidence-based challenges (*Kitzmiller* being the prime example) remained the primary successful countermeasure. No state successfully legislated ID into science classrooms. However, ID did not simply "go away." The movement shifted its tactics, promoting "academic freedom" bills and continuing public relations campaigns. While ID's influence in formal science education was effectively blocked, it retained a foothold in public discourse and certain political circles.

*   **"This will just hand them a wonderful party favor."**
    *   **Outcome:** This prediction was robust. When similar "academic freedom" bills were proposed or passed, ID proponents consistently used them to bolster claims of being censored or persecuted, reinforcing their "Galileo" narrative. Legislative attempts to restrict ID directly would almost certainly have become a central exhibit in this persecution narrative. The decision *not* to pass a direct ban avoided providing this specific "party favor."

*   **"Careful, rigorous examination of everything they had to say. And it'll work every time."**
    *   **Outcome:** The *Kitzmiller* decision demonstrated the power of this approach, as the judge's lengthy opinion meticulously dismantled the scientific and legal claims of ID. In subsequent court cases or state school board hearings where evolution or science standards were challenged, similar strategies of presenting robust scientific evidence and expert testimony were employed by the scientific community, and these challenges were consistently defeated. This established a reliable playbook for defending the integrity of science education against ID-related incursions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article is a useful historical marker and presents a well-reasoned, strategically sound argument that largely proved correct about the most effective way to counter the Intelligent Design movement's attempts to influence science education. However, the topic itself—legislative battles over teaching ID in public schools—has diminished in mainstream societal and scientific urgency since 2006. The key legal and scientific precedents were already set, and subsequent developments were mostly variations on existing themes.
