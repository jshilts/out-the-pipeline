# Retrospective Analysis: "How to Run a Drug Project: Are There Any Rules at All?" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's 2014 article addresses the fundamental challenge in pharmaceutical R&D: knowing when to terminate a drug development project versus when to persevere through obstacles. The piece contrasts two organizational approaches—the small, focused company where execution and decision-making reside with the same team versus larger organizations that separate project execution from management oversight. Lowe argues that both models can succeed or fail depending on context and personnel.

The core tension identified is that nearly all successful drugs faced near-death experiences during development, requiring determined teams to fight for their survival. However, this same determination can lead teams to pursue doomed projects far beyond the point where objective evaluation would have called for termination. The article highlights the difficulty of balancing persistence against the reality that some projects are fundamentally flawed—whether due to incorrect biological hypotheses or insurmountable technical barriers.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this article's publication saw significant evolution in how pharmaceutical companies approach project portfolio management, though many core challenges persist. Several notable developments occurred:

**Increased Use of Data-Driven Decision Making**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted portfolio management approaches using quantitative frameworks to evaluate project viability. Companies like Novartis and Pfizer implemented more systematic stage-gate processes, though debates continue about their effectiveness in predicting success.

**The Rise of Precision Medicine**: The genomics revolution and targeted therapies changed risk assessment paradigms. Drugs like Keytruda (pembrolizumab) exemplified how breakthrough therapies could emerge from initially uncertain programs, while many high-profile failures (such as Alzheimer's programs at Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and others) demonstrated the continued difficulty of terminating projects before expensive Phase III trials.

**Increased External Innovation**: Large pharma companies became more aggressive in acquiring promising programs from smaller biotechs, allowing them to de-risk early-stage research while maintaining option value. This created a different kind of portfolio balance—letting small companies take early risks, then acquiring proven concepts.

**Notable Successes Despite Near-Termination**: Several blockbuster drugs experienced the phenomenon Lowe described. CAR-T therapies faced multiple near-death experiences before breakthrough successes. Similarly, mRNA vaccine technology, which ultimately delivered COVID-19 vaccines, was nearly abandoned multiple times despite decades of research.

**Continued High Failure Rates**: Industry data through 2024 confirms that pharmaceutical R&D failure rates remain stubbornly high, with approximately 90% of drugs that enter clinical trials ultimately failing to gain approval—a figure largely unchanged since 2014.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Matched Reality**:
- **Continued difficulty in project termination**: Pharma companies still struggle with when to kill projects. High-profile cases like Biogen's Aduhelm (aducanumab) for Alzheimer's demonstrated how controversial decisions to pursue marginal candidates can be.
- **Small company advantages in early-stage development**: The biotech sector's explosion, particularly in hubs like Boston and San Francisco, confirmed Lowe's preference for focused, determined teams in early discovery.
- **Management distance causing problems**: The "Dog-And-Pony-itis" phenomenon Lowe described remained relevant, evidenced by long-delayed revelations about problematic internal data in various programs.

**Predictions That Were Partially Wrong**:
- **Convergence toward optimal models**: Hope for clearer frameworks to emerge proved optimistic. No universally accepted model for drug project management has emerged, and the field remains characterized by the same fundamental tensions Lowe identified.
- **Increased clarity from genomics**: While genomics provided new tools for target validation, it didn't eliminate the core uncertainty Lowe described. Many genetically-validated targets still produced disappointing clinical results.

**Unforeseen Developments**:
- **COVID-19's impact**: The pandemic created unprecedented urgency and public-private partnerships that temporarily altered project management norms, showing that external pressure could force rapid prioritization decisions.
- **AI and machine learning applications**: While still emerging, AI tools began offering new approaches to predict drug failure earlier, though their impact on overall industry productivity remains debated.
- **Regulatory evolution**: FDA's innovative trial designs, real-world evidence acceptance, and accelerated approval pathways created new decision points but also new uncertainties about project viability.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article merits a high interest score because it addresses fundamental tensions in pharmaceutical innovation that remain unresolved despite a decade of technological advancement. Lowe's insights transcend their specific time period, capturing enduring truths about the balance between persistence and pragmatism in high-stakes R&D.

The piece is particularly valuable because it anticipated ongoing debates in the industry without falling into the common trap of techno-optimism. The core challenge Lowe identified—that successful innovation requires accepting both Type I errors (killing promising projects) and Type II errors (continuing doomed ones)—remains central to pharmaceutical productivity discussions today.

While not revolutionary, the article's wisdom lies in its recognition that organizational design and decision-making processes matter as much as scientific excellence in determining R&D outcomes. This insight became only more relevant as the industry grappled with continued productivity challenges and the need to allocate resources across increasingly diverse therapeutic modalities and technologies.
