# A Diazirine That Will Knock You Out (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted a novel photolabeling probe built on the barbiturate mephobarbital. The molecule incorporates a trifluoromethyl‑diazirine group that, upon UV illumination, ejects nitrogen to generate a highly reactive carbene that covalently attaches to nearby protein residues. When the two enantiomers of the probe were tested on human GABA\(_A\) receptors, the (R)‑enantiomer proved roughly ten‑fold more potent than its counterpart and comparable in potency to the best known barbiturate ligands. The author noted that the probe successfully labeled specific sites on the GABA receptor, offering a tool to map barbiturate‑binding pockets. He also mentioned that mephobarbital itself was being withdrawn from the U.S. market because it never underwent a modern NDA, and he expressed skepticism that the probe would be pursued as a therapeutic anesthetic.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Photolabeling chemistry:** Since 2012, diazirine‑based photoaffinity labels have become a standard component of chemical‑biology toolkits. The trifluoromethyl‑diazirine motif introduced in the article proved chemically robust and is now featured in many commercial photolabel kits (e.g., from Thermo Fisher, Sigma‑Aldrich). The specific mephobarbital‑derived probe has been cited in a handful of follow‑up studies that used it to map the binding site of barbiturates on recombinant GABA\(_A\) subunits, confirming the original labeling pattern but never progressing beyond mechanistic investigations.

**Barbiturate therapeutics:** No new barbiturate anesthetic or hypnotic based on this probe entered clinical development. The broader class of barbiturates has continued to decline in clinical use, supplanted by benzodiazepines, non‑benzodiazepine hypnotics, and modern intravenous anesthetics. The FDA’s decision to discontinue mephobarbital (Mebaral) in the United States remained in effect; the drug has not been re‑approved or replaced by a new NDA as of early 2026.

**Impact on drug discovery:** The probe’s success in pinpointing GABA\(_A\) binding residues contributed to structural‑biology efforts that later leveraged cryo‑EM to resolve high‑resolution GABA\(_A\) receptor structures (2018‑2021). Those structures, however, were derived primarily from recombinant expression and ligand‑binding studies rather than from the photolabel itself. Consequently, the probe’s practical impact has been limited to niche mechanistic studies rather than to large‑scale drug‑pipeline advances.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *The probe could become a general anesthetic on its own.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. No clinical trials or FDA filings have been reported for the diazirine‑barbiturate probe as a therapeutic agent.

- **Prediction:** *The compound will provide “interesting information about barbiturate binding.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. Subsequent biochemical and structural studies used the probe (or closely related diazirine barbiturates) to map ligand‑contact residues on GABA\(_A\) receptors, corroborating the original labeling data.

- **Prediction:** *Mephobarbital will disappear from the market because the manufacturer will not pursue a new NDA.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Mephobarbital (Mebaral) remains unavailable in the U.S.; Lundbeck never filed a new NDA, and the drug is absent from the market as of 2026.

- **Implicit prediction:** *Diazirine photolabels will see broader adoption.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The trifluoromethyl‑diazirine scaffold introduced in the article is now a widely used photo‑crosslinker in proteomics, target deconvolution, and membrane‑protein studies.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is moderately interesting: it introduced a useful chemical‑biology tool and correctly anticipated the market fate of mephobarbital, but it did not lead to any major therapeutic breakthrough.
