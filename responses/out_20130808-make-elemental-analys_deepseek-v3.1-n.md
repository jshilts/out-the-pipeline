# Make Up the Elemental Analysis: An Update (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

In August 2013, the chemistry community discovered a troubling instruction in the Supporting Information of a paper published in *Organometallics* that appeared to direct a co-author to "make up" elemental analysis data for inclusion in the manuscript. The scandal was first picked up by chemistry blogs (ChemBark and Chemistry Blog) and involved a paper whose supporting materials contained what looked like explicit fabrication instructions.

John Gladysz, the editor of *Organometallics*, responded publicly, explaining that the manuscript had been pulled from the print publication queue once Chemical Abstracts alerted them to the problematic statement. The author, Reto Dorta, claimed the note referred to a compound that had been "downgraded" from an isolated compound to a proposed intermediate. The editor decided to keep the ASAP manuscript on the web temporarily for transparency, while requiring original microanalysis data before allowing the paper back into the print queue.

## 2. HISTORY

This incident occurred in 2013 during a period of increasing scrutiny of scientific integrity, particularly in chemistry publications where elemental analysis serves as important verification data. The editor's response reflected the limited institutional powers of journal editors—they could implement precautionary measures for future submissions but couldn't pursue broader "retribution."

Subsequent developments in scientific publishing show this case was part of a broader pattern that led to several important changes: (1) increased scrutiny of supporting information by editors and reviewers, (2) enhanced data integrity expectations from major publishers like ACS, (3) continued growth of post-publication peer review through blogs and social media, and (4) gradual adoption of more rigorous data verification requirements.

The chemical community's reliance on elemental analysis for compound verification has remained important, though other techniques (NMR, mass spectrometry) have become increasingly sophisticated. However, data integrity scandals have continued to emerge across scientific fields, leading to retractions and institutional investigations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article included limited explicit predictions, but contained implicit expectations about how the situation might unfold:

- **Editor's limited powers**: The editor acknowledged that journal editors have "limited" powers restricted to precautionary measures for future submissions. This has largely remained true—journals can reject papers and flag problematic authors but cannot sanction researchers institutionally.

- **Community accountability**: The decision to keep the manuscript online temporarily was framed as transparency toward the chemical community, implying that community scrutiny would play a role in accountability. Post-publication peer review has indeed grown in importance since 2013.

- **Confidentiality of sanctions**: The editor noted that details of precautionary measures would remain confidential. This practice has continued, though it faces criticism for lacking transparency.

The broader prediction that stakeholders might contemplate a "fuller range of responses" has partially materialized—institutional investigations, funding agency oversight, and public shaming through retraction databases have all expanded since 2013.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

This incident, while illustrative of data integrity challenges in scientific publishing, represents a relatively routine case of academic misconduct that generated brief attention but had limited broader impact. More significant integrity scandals and systemic reforms have since emerged.
