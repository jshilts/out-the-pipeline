# One and Done
16 Apr 2014

## 1. SUMMARY

This article comments on a Forbes piece by Matthew Herper about Robert Duggan and Pharmacyclics. The author highlights a striking statistic: between 1950 and 2011, 56% of drug companies that received FDA approval only managed to do so once. The central question raised is whether Pharmacyclics under Duggan's leadership can overcome this "one and done" trend in biotechnology. The author expresses skepticism about Duggan's prospects, partly by noting Duggan's affiliation with the Church of Scientology and suggesting this might indicate questionable decision-making capacity. The piece frames the overarching challenge facing biotech companies in achieving sustained success beyond a single drug approval, using Pharmacyclics as the primary case study.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's 2014 publication, significant developments occurred with Pharmacyclics and Robert Duggan. In March 2015 - less than a year after this article - AbbVie announced it would acquire Pharmacyclics for approximately $21 billion, one of the largest biotech acquisitions at the time. This acquisition centered on Imbruvica (ibrutinib), the company's blockbuster cancer drug, which had received FDA approval for various blood cancers starting in 2013.

Robert Duggan personally profited enormously from this sale, realizing billions of dollars from his equity stake. Following the acquisition, he invested significantly in various ventures and philanthropic activities. Notably, Duggan also became involved in other biotech companies post-acquisition, and Imbruvica itself continued to expand with additional FDA approvals for new indications in subsequent years.

The "one and done" challenge highlighted in the article reflects a persistent structural issue in the biotech industry where small-to-mid-size companies often struggle to build sustainable pipelines beyond their initial successful drug.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article's author was skeptical that Robert Duggan could break the "one and done" trend and achieve long-term biotech success with Pharmacyclics.

• **Outcome**: While Pharmacyclics never developed a second major drug to follow Imbruvica independently, the company achieved enormous financial success through the $21 billion AbbVie acquisition in 2015. In this respect, the concerns about creating a sustainable pipeline were resolved through acquisition rather than internal R&D success.

• **Prediction context**: The "56% one and done" statistic reflected real industry challenges with drug development sustainability.

• **Outcome validity**: This remains an accurate representation of biotech industry dynamics, where high R&D costs, long development timelines, and clinical trial risks make portfolio building extremely challenging for smaller companies.

• **Ultimate result**: Although not the organic growth path some might have envisioned, Pharmacyclics delivered extraordinary returns to investors and shareholders before being acquired, even if it didn't solve the pipeline diversification challenge independently.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captures a fundamental tension in biotech investing - the difficulty of turning single-product success into sustainable company growth. Its relevance extends beyond the specific companies discussed to touch on core questions about innovation strategy and industry structure.
