# Retrospective Analysis: "A New Look At Clinical Attrition" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine article reported on a landmark Nature Biotechnology study that provided the most comprehensive analysis of drug development success rates to date. The research examined 835 drug developers and over 7,300 drug development paths from 2003-2011, offering the first major benchmarking study that included small biotech companies alongside large pharmaceutical firms.

The findings painted a sobering picture: only 10% of drugs entering Phase I ultimately gained FDA approval. Small molecules faced particularly brutal attrition at 92% failure rates, while oncology drugs showed the worst therapeutic area performance with 93% failure rates. The study revealed that Phase II was the primary bottleneck where most failures occurred, with oncology drugs still experiencing over 50% failure even in Phase III. The authors attributed these depressing statistics to inclusion of riskier biotech ventures, increased regulatory complexity, and improved standards of care that raised the bar for new drug approvals.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 study became a foundational reference that shaped industry understanding and practices. Subsequent research has largely validated and extended these findings:

**Follow-up Research**: BIO (Biotechnology Innovation Organization) partnered with researchers to update this analysis, publishing follow-up studies in 2016 and 2018. The 2018 study covering 2006-2015 found that overall Phase I-to-approval success rates remained relatively stable around 9.6%, with oncology even worse at 5.1% success rates.

**Industry Response**: These stark numbers catalyzed several industry transformations:
- **Portfolio Strategy Evolution**: Companies increasingly adopted portfolio approaches, building pipelines designed around expected attrition rates
- **Biomarker and Precision Medicine Push**: The particularly poor oncology results accelerated investment in biomarkers and patient stratification to improve success rates
- **Biotech Investment Pattern Changes**: Venture capital began demanding more rigorous go/no-go decision frameworks based on these benchmarks
- **Regulatory Science Initiatives**: FDA and EMA launched programs like breakthrough therapy designations (2012) and adaptive licensing to improve success rates

**Continued Challenges**: The decade following the article saw no dramatic improvement in overall success rates. The biotech boom of 2014-2021 led to more companies pursuing riskier targets, potentially maintaining or even worsening attrition despite scientific advances.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions That Matched Reality**:
- **Sustained High Attrition**: The article's grim statistics proved remarkably durable. Subsequent studies confirmed that ~90% failure rates remained the industry baseline
- **Oncology Remaining Challenging**: The prediction that oncology would continue having the "roughest row to hoe" proved accurate, with later studies showing oncology success rates actually worsened slightly
- **Small Molecules Facing Brutal Attrition**: This prediction held true, though it's worth noting that small molecules remain the largest drug class by number of approvals
- **Phase II as Bottleneck**: The insight that "Phase II is where the different diseases really separate out" proved prescient, as this phase remained the primary failure point

**Predictions That Were Wrong or Incomplete**:
- **Business Sustainability Concerns**: The article questioned "how sustainable is a business with these kinds of failure rates?" Yet the 2014-2021 period saw unprecedented biotech investment and M&A activity, suggesting the business model proved more sustainable than expected—at least until interest rates rose in 2022-2023
- **Feasibility of Accommodating Pricing Strategies**: Contrary to concerns about pricing strategies accommodating high failure rates, drug prices increased dramatically post-2014, particularly for oncology drugs
- **Underestimation of Platform Technologies**: The article didn't anticipate the rise of platform technologies (mRNA, gene therapy, cell therapy) that might eventually change these statistics

**Factors Not Fully Anticipated**:
- **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic demonstrated that unprecedented collaboration and regulatory flexibility could dramatically accelerate timelines, though this didn't fundamentally change underlying attrition rates
- **AI/ML in Drug Discovery**: The article predated the AI drug discovery boom, whose impact on clinical success rates remains hotly debated
- **Biomarker Revolution**: While mentioned in general terms, the extent to which biomarkers would become central to clinical development strategy exceeded 2014 expectations

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 7/9**

This article earns a high interest score (70-79th percentile) for several reasons:

**Long-term Industry Benchmark**: The study became the gold standard reference for drug development success rates, cited in countless business plans, investor presentations, and strategic decisions over the subsequent decade.

**Timely and Comprehensive**: It arrived when the biotech industry was experiencing rapid growth but lacked reliable benchmarks for smaller companies. By including biotech alongside pharma, it provided the first realistic picture of the broader industry.

**Prescient Questions**: The article's concluding questions about business model sustainability and pricing strategies proved remarkably forward-looking, anticipating debates that would dominate industry discussions for years.

**Catalyst for Change**: The stark numbers influenced regulatory policy, investment decisions, and R&D strategies across the industry, making it more than just an academic exercise.

The article falls short of the highest interest tier (8-9) because it primarily confirmed rather than radically transformed industry understanding, and the fundamental problem it highlighted remains largely unsolved a decade later. However, for providing data-driven grounding to industry discussions and strategic planning, it represents one of the more impactful scientific business analyses of its era.
