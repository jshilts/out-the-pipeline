# Water and Proteins Inside Cells: Sloshing Around, Or Not? (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a commentary by Derek Lowe reflecting on new evidence challenging his earlier view that intracellular water does not behave like bulk water. In September 2009, he had asserted that cellular water is mostly "stuck to and sliding around with enzymes, structural proteins, carbohydrates, and the like" rather than freely "sloshing around."

The December commentary discusses two recent papers that contradicted this view: (1) a JACS paper from UNC researchers studying fluorine-labeled proteins inside E. coli via NMR, and (2) particularly a 2008 PNAS paper from Swedish researchers who performed careful NMR analysis of water states inside both E. coli and an extreme halophile bacterium. Key findings that surprised Lowe: approximately 85% of intracellular water molecules showed rotational states similar to bulk water (with water beyond the first layer on proteins being "more or less indistinguishable from plain water"), and about half of proteins in cells were rotationally immobile—likely bound in membranes or multi-protein assemblies, suggesting more structural order than he had previously envisioned.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2009 article, the scientific understanding of intracellular environments has continued evolving with more sophisticated biophysical techniques:

**Water behavior in cells:** Modern studies using advanced NMR, neutron scattering, and fluorescence techniques have largely confirmed that while water near protein surfaces (within ~5-10 Å) exhibits restricted mobility, the majority of intracellular water—typically 70-90% depending on cell type and conditions—behaves similar to bulk water in terms of rotational and translational diffusion. This understanding has practical implications for drug design, as it affects assumptions about how small molecules diffuse and bind to targets within cells.

**Protein mobility and crowding:** The observation that roughly half of cellular proteins are rotationally immobile has been validated and refined. Modern super-resolution microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, and in-cell NMR studies reveal extensive protein-protein interactions, phase-separated condensates (membraneless organelles), and cytoskeletal constraints that limit mobility. This "crowded" but organized intracellular environment affects reaction rates, protein folding, and therapeutic target accessibility.

**Impact on drug discovery:** These insights influenced pharmaceutical research practices. Understanding that intracellular environments contain substantial bulk-like water helped refine pharmacokinetic models for passive diffusion and binding kinetics. Recognition of protein immobility and organization led to greater emphasis on membrane permeability, intracellular target engagement assays, and consideration of phase-separated compartments (like stress granules or nucleoli) as potential drug targets or exclusion zones.

**Technical developments:** Solid-state NMR methods for studying intact cells improved significantly after 2009, allowing more precise characterization of water and protein dynamics. Techniques like hyperpolarized NMR and cryo-electron tomography provided higher-resolution views of intracellular organization.

**Clinical/business impact:** While this fundamental research doesn't directly lead to specific approved drugs, it contributed to the broader knowledge base that pharmaceutical companies use for rational drug design. No major policy changes resulted, but the findings supported continued funding for basic biophysics research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions in the article:**

• **That understanding of intracellular water behavior would shift toward recognizing substantial bulk-like water properties** ✓ **LARGELY CONFIRMED** - Subsequent research with improved NMR and scattering techniques has consistently shown 70-90% of intracellular water behaves similarly to bulk water, with only surface-bound layers showing restricted mobility.

• **That the finding of ~50% rotationally immobile proteins would indicate greater intracellular structural organization than previously appreciated** ✓ **CONFIRMED** - This has been validated through multiple techniques; we now understand this results from cytoskeletal organization, membrane binding, phase-separated condensates, and large complexes.

• **That this would require adjusting mental models of intracellular environments** ✓ **CONFIRMED** - Modern cell biology now emphasizes crowded but organized environments with both dynamic and immobile components, influencing everything from enzyme kinetics to drug design assumptions.

• **Implicit: That techniques like in-cell NMR would continue advancing** ✓ **CONFIRMED** - Significant improvements occurred in NMR methods for studying intact cells, cryo-EM tomography, and super-resolution microscopy, providing ever-better views of intracellular organization.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses fundamental questions about intracellular biophysics using then-recent NMR evidence, touching on issues relevant to drug design and cell biology. While the topic has enduring scientific importance, the specific 2009 commentary is moderately interesting but not exceptionally so—it captures a moment of shifting understanding but doesn't represent a major breakthrough.
