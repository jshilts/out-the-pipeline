# Merck Off the Mat (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2005 commentary addresses Merck's second Vioxx court victory in New Jersey. The author expressed relief at Merck's win, noting that the plaintiff had pre-existing heart conditions, survived the heart attack, and only used Vioxx for two months. The article warned that had Merck lost this relatively weak case, it would have faced thousands of similar lawsuits that could cripple the company. The author acknowledged Merck's questionable conduct regarding Vioxx's cardiovascular risks but argued against driving the company "into the ground like a tent peg," emphasizing that while drug companies should be held accountable for screw-ups, destroying them in such a chancy industry would harm the entire pharmaceutical ecosystem. The piece balanced criticism of Merck's actions with concern about the broader implications of excessive litigation on drug innovation.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article's publication, Merck's Vioxx legal strategy evolved significantly. In 2007, Merck began settling cases rather than fighting each trial individually. By November 2007, Merck announced a $4.85 billion settlement to resolve around 50,000 Vioxx lawsuits, representing the largest pharmaceutical litigation settlement at the time. The company's stock recovered over subsequent years, and Merck continued as a major pharmaceutical player, launching successful drugs including Januvia (2006) and Gardasil (2006). 

The Vioxx withdrawal did lead to significant regulatory changes. In 2007, the FDA implemented the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, strengthening post-market surveillance requirements and giving the agency authority to require safety labels and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). The COX-2 inhibitor class was largely abandoned, with Celebrex remaining on the market but carrying more prominent cardiovascular warnings.

Merck's financial performance demonstrated resilience. Despite paying billions in settlements and legal fees, the company maintained profitability and continued drug development. The case established important precedents in pharmaceutical tort litigation and influenced how companies handle drug safety data and the timing of product withdrawals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Merck's survival prospects**: The author feared Merck could be "crippled" or "driven into the ground" by repeated lawsuits. **OUTCOME**: Merck survived financially intact, settling cases for a substantial but manageable amount, and continued as a major pharmaceutical company.

• **Litigation trajectory**: The author suggested Merck might face hundreds or thousands of similar cases if they lost weak ones. **OUTCOME**: Merck did eventually face approximately 50,000 lawsuits but resolved them through a comprehensive settlement rather than individual trials.

• **Industry-wide impact**: The author worried that destroying drug companies through litigation would ensure "we don't have many working drug companies." **OUTCOME**: While Vioxx litigation had significant financial and regulatory impacts, it did not fundamentally undermine pharmaceutical industry viability or innovation capacity.

• **Risk-benefit assessment**: Implicit in the article was that drugs with risks can still have appropriate benefit-risk profiles. **OUTCOME**: Post-Vioxx, regulatory approaches evolved toward more nuanced risk-benefit evaluation and mandatory post-market surveillance rather than wholesale rejection of drugs with known risks.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article offers prescient analysis of the tension between corporate accountability and industry viability in pharmaceuticals. The author correctly anticipated the broader societal stakes of Vioxx litigation and the danger of overcorrecting through destructive litigation.
