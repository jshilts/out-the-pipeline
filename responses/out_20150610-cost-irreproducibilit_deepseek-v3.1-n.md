# The Cost of Irreproducibility (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a 2015 PLOS Biology study that estimated the annual cost of irreproducible biomedical research at $28 billion in the United States. The study defined irreproducibility broadly as errors, flaws, or omissions that prevent replication of results, identifying four main contributors: poor study design, incorrect biological reagents/reference materials, inadequate laboratory protocols, and problematic data analysis and reporting.

The researchers estimated that between 18-88% of preclinical research is irreproducible, with a central estimate of 53%. They calculated the $28 billion figure by applying a conservative 50% irreproducibility rate to the estimated $56.4 billion spent annually on preclinical research (out of $114.8 billion total life sciences research spending). The article's author acknowledges that even if the true rate is lower, the financial impact remains substantial, noting that $28 billion approximates 90% of the entire NIH budget at that time.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 study catalyzed significant institutional responses and ongoing evaluation of research reproducibility:

**Funding Agency Initiatives:**
- The NIH intensified efforts to address reproducibility, including enhanced guidelines for grant applications emphasizing rigorous experimental design and transparent reporting.
- Funding mechanisms increasingly required pre-registration of studies, data sharing plans, and statistical rigor standards.

**Industry Impact:**
- Pharmaceutical companies increasingly implemented internal validation requirements before advancing targets from academic research into drug development pipelines.
- Biopharma investment shifted toward requiring more robust validation data, particularly scrutinizing target validation studies.

**Scientific Community Developments:**
- Major journals (including Nature, Science, and PLOS) adopted more stringent requirements for methods reporting, mandatory data availability statements, and statistical review.
- The reproducibility crisis became widely recognized across scientific disciplines, not just biomedicine.
- Initiatives emerged such as the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, which systematically attempted to replicate high-profile cancer studies.

**Technical Improvements:**
- Increased adoption of cell line authentication (STR profiling) became standard practice in many laboratories.
- Antibody validation standards improved, with resources like the Human Protein Atlas providing systematic validation data.
- Automated laboratory information management systems became more common.

**Ongoing Challenges:**
While awareness increased significantly, reproducibility issues persisted throughout the late 2010s and early 2020s. Meta-research studies continued finding high irreproducibility rates, though exact figures remain debated. The $28 billion estimate served as an important benchmark that spurred reform efforts but was never definitively confirmed or refuted through comprehensive follow-up studies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions about future outcomes. It primarily reported on the existing state of irreproducibility and its estimated costs.

However, the underlying implication was that the research community needed to address these issues systematically. The subsequent developments described above—increased institutional awareness, journal policies, and laboratory practices—represent movement in the direction the authors hoped for, though challenges remained and the full $28 billion problem was not "solved."

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a fundamental issue in biomedical research that had significant and lasting impact on scientific practice, funding policies, and research transparency. The $28 billion cost estimate provided a concrete metric that accelerated institutional reforms across academia, industry, and government funding agencies.
