# Drug Repurposing (August 2014)

## 1. Summary

This 2014 commentary addresses a reader's question about whether repurposed drugs have been approved for new indications. The author initially struggles to recall examples, then identifies thalidomide as the most prominent case—originally a failed sedative/morning sickness drug that was later repurposed for leprosy and multiple myeloma. The article distinguishes between true repurposing (finding unexpected mechanisms or indications) versus routine market expansion (like kinase inhibitors gaining approvals for related cancer types). Eflornithine is highlighted as another key example—developed as a cancer drug, it failed oncology trials but proved effective for trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and was later approved for cosmetic use (facial hair reduction), creating an access crisis for African patients until Aventis partnered with WHO to provide the life-saving formulation. The piece notes that immunomodulators (like Orencia/abatacept) and neurological drugs (like propranolol) seem particularly amenable to repurposing due to their broad physiological effects. The article concludes by acknowledging that while no new major repurposing approvals had recently occurred, significant preclinical and clinical activity was ongoing, referencing NIH's drug repurposing initiative.

## 2. History

Since 2014, drug repurposing has evolved from a niche concept into an increasingly important strategy in pharmaceutical development. While many efforts remained at early stages, several notable developments occurred:

**COVID-19 catalyzed repurposing efforts**: The pandemic drove unprecedented large-scale screening of existing drugs for antiviral activity. While some initially promising candidates like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin ultimately failed to show efficacy in rigorous trials, the crisis demonstrated both the potential and limitations of rapid repurposing approaches.

**Orencia/abatacept progression**: The kidney condition mentioned (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) has seen continued research interest, but abatacept has not received FDA approval specifically for this indication as of now. The drug has gained additional approvals for conditions like psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

**Eflornithine developments**: Access to eflornithine for African sleeping sickness has improved through continued partnerships between manufacturers (now Sanofi following Aventis), WHO, and organizations like MSF, though challenges in distribution and diagnosis remain.

**NIH initiatives expanded**: Federal funding for drug repurposing has grown, with programs like the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) supporting systematic screening of existing drugs for new indications.

**Academic and nonprofit efforts**: Organizations like Cures Within Reach have continued systematic repurposing work, though converting research findings into approved therapies has proven slower than hoped.

**Regulatory pathways**: FDA has introduced expedited approval pathways that can benefit repurposed drugs, but many candidates get stuck in the "translational valley" between discovery and clinical validation.

## 3. Predictions

The article explicitly and implicitly included several predictions about drug repurposing's future:

• **Prediction**: The author anticipated that "an awful lot of preclinical and clinical activity going on" would lead to new approvals.

• **Reality**: While preclinical activity increased substantially—including systematic screening efforts and computational approaches—the rate of new approvals for truly repurposed drugs (distinct from label expansions) has been modest. COVID-19 highlighted how quickly repurposing can move under emergency conditions, but also revealed that most existing drugs won't work for new indications without better target understanding.

• **Prediction**: That immunomodulators and neurological drugs would continue showing broad therapeutic potential.

• **Reality**: This has proven correct. JAK inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, anti-inflammatory biologics, and other immunomodulators have continued expanding into new inflammatory and autoimmune indications. Neurological drugs like ketamine have found new life in depression treatment, beta-blockers continue finding off-label uses, and psychedelics are being repurposed for mental health conditions.

• **Prediction**: Implicit suggestion that NIH's drug repurposing initiative would yield results.

• **Reality**: NIH's efforts have produced valuable datasets and methodologies but relatively few approved drugs. The initiative has faced challenges in translating academic discoveries into pharmaceutical development, reflecting broader issues in academic-industry collaboration.

## 4. Interest

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important transition period when drug repurposing was gaining recognition as a development strategy, but before COVID-19 catalyzed widespread interest. The examples and challenges identified remain highly relevant, and the topic has grown rather than diminished in importance post-2014. The piece effectively illustrates both the potential and the practical barriers to finding new uses for existing medicines.
