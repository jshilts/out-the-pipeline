# The Drug Project Landscape (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a comprehensive Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper from Vertex researchers analyzing drug development projects over the previous 20 years using the Cortellis database. The study examined approximately 10,000 unique drugs across 22,000 projects, covering 2,400 mechanisms and 1,400 disease indications—yielding about 15,000 mechanism/indication pairs (such as "calcium channel blockers for angina").

The key findings included quantification of which therapeutic areas saw the most diverse mechanism attempts (breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, pain, Type II diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's) and revealed the highly concentrated nature of success: 128 mechanism/indication pairs accounted for 22% of all successful projects. Notably, even in repeatedly validated areas, 37% of projects still failed, and 11% of pairs actually had more failures than successes.

The article highlighted stark examples of failed approaches: 28 unsuccessful attempts at ACAT inhibitors for atherosclerosis, 93 discontinuations across various amyloid-targeting approaches for Alzheimer's, and highly inefficient categories like 5-LOX inhibitors for asthma (1 success in 30 attempts). The authors also noted a significant shift toward unvalidated targets in current research: of 1,241 ongoing projects, 81% were targeting unvalidated mechanisms, with 70% pursuing entirely novel combinations with neither previous successes nor failures.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2017 analysis, several key trends continued and intensified across the drug development landscape:

**Alzheimer's Disease Research** continued its difficult trajectory. The amyloid hypothesis, despite the 93 discontinuations mentioned in the article, saw major developments. Aducanumab (Aduhelm) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 despite mixed clinical data, followed by lecanemab (Leqembi) in 2023 with more convincing evidence. Both target amyloid, representing breakthrough regulatory successes after decades of failures, though questions remain about clinical meaningfulness and market uptake.

**mRNA Technology** emerged as a dominant new modality, particularly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of mRNA vaccines represented one of the largest mechanism/indication success stories of the modern era. This demonstrated that truly novel mechanisms could achieve rapid clinical success when conditions aligned.

**CAR-T Cell Therapies** became established as another major breakthrough, particularly for hematological cancers. These represented a fundamentally different approach (living cell therapy) that required entirely new infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.

**Rare Diseases** increasingly became a focus, driven by regulatory incentives, advances in genetic understanding, and the ability to command premium pricing. Many of these pursued highly specific mechanisms targeting small patient populations.

**Drug Pricing Pressures** intensified significantly, particularly in the United States. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced Medicare drug price negotiation, fundamentally changing commercial calculations and potentially affecting pipeline prioritization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The industry would continue moving toward more novel, unvalidated mechanisms rather than repeatedly pursuing validated targets.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. R&D spending has increasingly shifted toward novel modalities (gene therapies, cell therapies, RNA-based approaches) and novel targets. The proportion of drugs with novel mechanisms of action has increased, though validated mechanisms still dominate commercial success.

• **Prediction**: That historical failure rates would persist even in validated areas.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. The fundamental challenges of drug development remained, with continued high failure rates even in established therapeutic areas. The FDA's accelerated approval pathways and breakthrough therapy designations created new routes to market but didn't fundamentally change success probabilities.

• **Prediction**: That companies working on completely novel mechanisms without prior validation would face especially high risks.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Many novel mechanism projects have indeed failed, but some (like mRNA vaccines and CAR-T therapies) achieved breakthrough success, demonstrating that novel approaches could succeed when scientific readiness, clinical need, and manufacturing capability aligned.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provided a valuable quantitative framework for understanding drug development success patterns and effectively challenged simplistic criticisms of pharmaceutical R&D. While now somewhat dated (7 years old), its methodological insights and findings about the distribution of success and failure remain highly relevant for understanding pharmaceutical strategy.
