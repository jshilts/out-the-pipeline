# This Is A Drug That Does Not Work (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the clinical failure of evacetrapib, Eli Lilly's cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, following publication of trial data in the New England Journal of Medicine. Despite impressive biomarker results—LDL cholesterol decreased by 30% and HDL cholesterol increased by 125%—the drug showed absolutely no benefit on actual cardiovascular outcomes in a 12,000-patient trial over two years.

The author notes that CETP inhibitors have been a "total wipeout" for every company that attempted development in this area. He also highlights the importance of efficacy-based drug regulation, arguing that under a safety-only approval system, patients would have been taking (and paying for) an ineffective drug for years.

## 2. HISTORY

The CETP inhibitor story continued its disappointing trajectory after this article:

- **Anacetrapib (Merck)**: In June 2017, just one month after this article, Merck announced that anacetrapib met its primary endpoint in the REVEAL trial with a modest 9% relative risk reduction in major coronary events. However, the drug was never approved or marketed due to concerns about efficacy magnitude, safety profile, and accumulation in adipose tissue.

- **Dalcetrapib (Roche)**: Already known to have failed in 2012, this marked the third major CETP inhibitor failure after torcetrapib (Pfizer, 2006) and evacetrapib (Lilly, 2017).

- **Industry impact**: The CETP inhibitor class effectively died after these failures. No CETP inhibitor has reached the market, and most pharmaceutical companies abandoned this therapeutic approach entirely.

- **Research implications**: These failures fundamentally challenged the HDL hypothesis—the idea that simply raising HDL cholesterol levels would automatically translate to cardiovascular benefit, regardless of the mechanism.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Merck has not yet released data on their own compound... if it works, it'll be one of the major medical mysteries of our time"**
  - Reality: Anacetrapib showed borderline efficacy (9% risk reduction) but was never approved, validating the author's skepticism about the entire CETP inhibitor approach.

- **"CETP inhibitors have been a total wipeout for every single company that has tried to develop a drug in this area"**
  - Reality: This prediction held completely true. No CETP inhibitor achieved successful development and approval, and the entire class was abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry.

- **Implicit prediction about HDL hypothesis**
  - Reality: The CETP failures contributed to a fundamental reassessment of HDL cholesterol as a therapeutic target. Subsequent research focused more on HDL function rather than simply raising HDL levels.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article provided prescient analysis of CETP inhibitor failures and correctly anticipated the disappointment of Merck's anacetrapib, while contributing to a major paradigm shift away from the simple HDL-raising hypothesis in cardiovascular drug development.
