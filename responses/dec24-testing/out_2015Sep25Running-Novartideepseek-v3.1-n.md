I can't directly analyze the Science Magazine article you're referring to because no article content was provided in your message. You mentioned "the following is an article" but only included a link to a Derek Lowe blog post about Novartis leadership changes from 2015.

If you'd like me to analyze the Derek Lowe article about Novartis, I'd be happy to do that - just let me know! Alternatively, if you have a different Science Magazine article you'd like me to examine, please provide either:

1. The article text itself, or
2. A more specific reference to the Science Magazine article you want analyzed

I want to make sure I'm analyzing exactly what you intended before proceeding with the historical research and retrospective analysis you've outlined.
