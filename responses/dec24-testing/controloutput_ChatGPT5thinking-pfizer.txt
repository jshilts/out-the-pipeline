SUMMARY
The Science blog post (Derek Lowe, “Pfizer and Allergan: Here We Go Again”) summarized press reports that Pfizer was considering a very large merger with Allergan, noted Allergan’s Irish incorporation (making a tax inversion attractive), and argued that the proposed deal fit a familiar Pfizer strategy of pursuing growth through big cross-border acquisitions rather than organic R&D, while calling such mega-deals problematic.

HISTORY
• Pfizer and Allergan announced a definitive agreement in late November 2015 for a transaction valued at about $160 billion, structured so the combined company would be domiciled in Ireland. Reuters+1
• The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued temporary and proposed regulations in early April 2016 aimed at curbing tax inversions and related earnings-stripping strategies; the rules specifically limited certain post-acquisition structures that had been relied on in large inversion proposals. U.S. Department of the Treasury+1
• Within days of those Treasury actions, Pfizer and Allergan terminated their merger agreement in early April 2016; Pfizer’s public statement said the termination was driven by what the companies treated as an “adverse tax law change,” and Pfizer agreed to pay Allergan reimbursement for certain transaction expenses. pfizer.com+1
• After the aborted Pfizer–Allergan deal, broader policy and market developments followed: the Treasury/IRS regulatory steps plus subsequent U.S. tax legislation (the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which cut the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%) together removed much of the financial rationale for major tax-motivated inversions, and inversion activity among large U.S. corporations dropped sharply.

• Allergan itself remained independent until 2020, when AbbVie announced and completed an acquisition of Allergan, a transaction that closed in May 2020 after regulatory review and required divestitures. AbbVie News Center+1
PREDICTIONS — what the Science post got right and wrong
Correct or supported claims
• The post’s central observation—that Pfizer was pursuing a large cross-border acquisition with a tax-driven motive—matches what unfolded: the announced deal was explicitly structured as a move to an Irish domicile and was widely reported as tax-motivated. Reuters+1
• The post suggested that Pfizer’s M&A-heavy strategy was a repeatable playbook rather than a one-off; historically Pfizer had pursued large acquisitions for decades, and the Allergan move fit that pattern. mnacritique.mergersindia.com
Predictions or implications that did not play out, or that require nuance
• The post implied (by tone) a sense that the deal might simply proceed because Allergan’s smaller R&D footprint would not deter Pfizer; in practice, regulatory and policy responses (Treasury rules) intervened and prevented the deal from closing. That means the article understated the capacity of policymakers to alter the incentives for tax-motivated deals in a short time frame. U.S. Department of the Treasury+1
• The author worried about “what situation” Pfizer would be in afterward and hinted that repeating past M&A behavior would continue; while Pfizer did pursue other business strategies, the specific inversion attempt failed and Pfizer did not complete a grand tax inversion by acquiring an Irish parent at that time. Subsequent tax reform (TCJA 2017) later reshaped incentives, a development the 2015 post could not have anticipated in detail. pfizer.com+1
CRITICAL EVALUATION (hype, real-world impact, and missing angles)
• Hype versus substance: the Science post treated the story primarily as an example of recurring industry behavior and expressed skepticism about mega-mergers; that skepticism looks justified in hindsight because the deal’s dominant economic rationale was tax arbitrage rather than obvious operational synergies, and policymakers moved decisively to curtail that incentive. Reuters+1
• Real-world impacts: Treasury’s April 2016 actions and the 2017 tax reform together substantially reduced the financial payoff of inversion transactions, so the immediate real-world effect was a policy success in stopping at least that kind of tax-motivated relocation among the largest U.S. firms. That regulatory outcome removed the principal “driver” the blog criticized, which vindicates the post’s identification of tax motive but undermines any implicit fatalism that companies could pursue inversions regardless of political response. U.S. Department of the Treasury+1
• What the post omitted or under-emphasized: the post focused on corporate strategy and taxation but did not delve into the broader public-policy debate (loss of tax base, political consequences, legislative options) nor quantify the likely fiscal costs and claimed savings (e.g., the deal was projected to reduce Pfizer’s effective tax rate by several percentage points and save roughly $1 billion annually). Adding that fiscal context clarifies why the deal attracted swift political and regulatory attention. Reuters+1
INTEREST (hindsight score)
Score: 7/9 — The post is interesting and useful in hindsight because it captured the industry pattern (large, tax-driven cross-border M&A) and the internal debate over whether R&D or dealmaking drives big pharma strategy. It is not a perfect long-term analysis because it did not (and could not have) foresee the rapid regulatory countermeasures and the substantial tax-code overhaul in 2017; nonetheless, as a contemporaneous take it highlights a key structural tension (tax incentives versus R&D investment) that mattered a great deal for subsequent policy and corporate outcomes.

CAVEATS AND LESSONS
• Corporate incentives and political reality interact. The Pfizer–Allergan episode shows that when proposed deals lean heavily on tax arbitrage rather than operational synergies, they invite swift public and regulatory reaction that can change incentives quickly. U.S. Department of the Treasury+1
• Reporting and blogging that call attention to patterns of behavior (here, repeated pharma mega-deals aimed at tax domicile changes) serve a public function: they can focus oversight and political pressure. The post’s skeptical framing was therefore a reasonable heuristic even if some prognostications about corporate inevitability were too fatalistic. Science+1

My internal confidence in this analysis: 83%. I am confident about the main factual timeline (announcement Nov 2015, Treasury rules Apr 2016, termination Apr 2016, TCJA 2017, AbbVie acquisition 2020) because multiple authoritative news and government sources document those events; my confidence is lower for interpretive judgments about motives and the “wisdom” of corporate strategy, which are inherently partly subjective and depend on internal corporate deliberations not fully in the public record.
