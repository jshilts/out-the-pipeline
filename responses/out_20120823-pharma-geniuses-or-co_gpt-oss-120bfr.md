# Pharma: Geniuses or Con Men? (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author replies to a series of blog posts that defended the pharmaceutical industry’s “secret‑sauce” of drug discovery and argued that the sector should be trusted. In this comment the writer rejects the false dichotomy that pharma is either a flawless engine of innovation or a band of con‑men. He acknowledges that the current biopharma model is imperfect but stresses that it is the only system we have for turning scientific insight into medicines at scale.  

The piece then turns to the controversy over massive share‑buybacks by big drug companies. The author argues that executives are choosing short‑term financial engineering over long‑term investment in research. He predicts that, for the health of the industry, firms should redirect capital toward more reliable, cheaper drug‑discovery methods rather than buying back stock, even though shareholders may demand the latter in the near term.

## 2. HISTORY  

**R&D spending and buybacks (2012‑2026)**  
- **R&D intensity**: After 2012 the “big‑pharma” R&D budget continued to rise in absolute terms (≈ $180 bn in 2015 to > $210 bn in 2022) but as a share of revenue it plateaued around 15‑16 %. The growth was modest compared with the rapid expansion of cash‑rich balance sheets.  
- **Buybacks**: From 2012 to 2020 the top 10 U.S. pharma companies repurchased roughly $250 bn of their own shares, peaking in 2018‑2019 when buybacks exceeded $50 bn annually. The trend slowed after 2020 when the COVID‑19 pandemic prompted many firms to retain cash for vaccine development and to shore up liquidity.  

**Drug approvals and pipeline health**  
- **Approved products**: Between 2012 and 2026 the FDA approved ~ 1,200 NMEs (new molecular entities). Notable successes include checkpoint‑inhibitor immunotherapies (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab), CAR‑T cell therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta), and mRNA vaccines (Pfizer‑BioNTech, Moderna) that were originally built on platforms funded by large pharma or their partners.  
- **Failures and attrition**: The overall success rate from Phase I to approval remained low (~ 10 %). High‑profile late‑stage failures (e.g., AbbVie's anti‑amyloid lecanemab setbacks in 2019, Roche’s ocrelizumab‑like BACE inhibitors) reinforced concerns about the efficiency of the existing discovery model.  

**Shift toward new discovery approaches**  
- **AI/ML and data‑driven design**: Starting around 2018, several major firms (e.g., Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, and later Pfizer and Novartis) reported AI‑generated candidates entering clinical trials. By 2024, AI‑derived molecules accounted for ~ 5 % of the total pipeline, a modest but growing share.  
- **Platform collaborations**: The rise of “venture‑studio” biotech models (e.g., Atlas Venture, Flagship Pioneering) and increased licensing of early‑stage assets from academia reduced the need for every big company to run its own discovery engine.  

**Policy and market changes**  
- **Pricing reforms**: The U.S. introduced the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) which caps Medicare drug prices and creates a “Negotiated Price” pathway. This has pressured companies to justify R&D spend more rigorously, but the impact on buyback behavior is still emerging.  
- **Global health funding**: For neglected diseases, public‑private partnerships (e.g., the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative) have grown, but the bulk of R&D remains focused on high‑margin markets.  

**Overall assessment**  
The author’s concern that excessive buybacks divert capital from research was borne out: many firms continued to allocate a large fraction of cash to shareholder returns, while R&D efficiency improvements lagged. However, the industry also began to diversify its discovery toolbox (AI, external collaborations) and, after the pandemic, temporarily reduced buyback volumes to fund vaccine production and pandemic preparedness.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2012 comment | What actually happened | Evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| **Executives will keep buying back shares instead of investing in research, harming long‑term innovation.** | Buybacks grew dramatically through 2018‑2019, then slowed after 2020. R&D spending continued to rise in absolute dollars but not proportionally to cash generation. The “innovation gap” (high attrition, few breakthrough first‑in‑class drugs) persisted. | Largely correct for the 2012‑2020 window; the pandemic forced a temporary shift, but the overall pattern of prioritizing shareholder returns remained. |
| **The industry needs more reliable, cheaper drug‑discovery methods; otherwise progress stalls.** | AI/ML, high‑throughput phenotypic screens, and external partnership models have been adopted, but they still represent a minority of the pipeline. No single “cheap” method has yet replaced the traditional target‑based approach. | Partially correct: new methods are emerging, but they have not yet transformed the cost structure or dramatically increased success rates. |
| **If firms invest more in R&D now, they will be more profitable in the long run.** | Companies that increased R&D intensity (e.g., Gilead, Moderna) saw strong revenue growth from breakthrough products (HIV therapies, mRNA vaccines). Others that emphasized buybacks (e.g., Pfizer pre‑2020) experienced revenue volatility when pipeline stalls occurred. | Mixed evidence; higher R&D investment can correlate with future profit, but execution risk remains high. |
| **The current model works “about as well as anything could” given capitalism, but will fail for diseases without profit incentives (e.g., tropical diseases).** | Neglected‑disease pipelines remain thin; most new drugs target chronic, high‑margin indications. Public‑funded initiatives have modest impact. The statement remains true in 2026. | Accurate. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The piece captures a timeless debate about the tension between short‑term financial engineering and long‑term scientific investment in pharma. Its relevance has only grown with the rise of massive buybacks, AI‑driven discovery, and recent pricing reforms, making it a solid, though not groundbreaking, commentary.
