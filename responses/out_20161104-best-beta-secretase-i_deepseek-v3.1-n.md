# The Best Beta-Secretase Inhibitor Yet in Alzheimer's (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2016 commentary discusses Merck's beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931), highlighting both progress and uncertainty in Alzheimer's drug development. The article notes that Merck had demonstrated verubecestat successfully reduces amyloid fragments in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of both healthy volunteers and Alzheimer's patients, representing the most promising attempt yet at targeting the beta-secretase pathway. However, the author emphasizes that no clinical efficacy data existed at the time, with trial results not expected until 2019.

The commentary provides crucial context about BACE inhibitors' challenging history, including difficulties achieving brain penetration, concerns about effects on myelination of neurons, liver toxicity, and potential impacts on memory. While verubecestat showed promising reduction of amyloid species in animal models without severe toxicity issues, the author criticizes media hype suggesting an imminent cure, noting Alzheimer's drug development has essentially a zero percent success rate in clinical trials.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Trial Outcomes:**

Verubecestat's clinical journey ended in disappointment. In February 2017, just three months after this article, Merck announced it was discontinuing the Phase III EPOCH trial (mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients) due to futility - an independent data monitoring committee found the trial was unlikely to demonstrate clinical benefit. The company also discontinued the APECS trial (prodromal Alzheimer's patients) in February 2018, again due to futility.

**Industry-Wide BACE Inhibitor Failures:**

Verubecestat's failure was part of a broader pattern. Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca's BACE inhibitor lanabecestat was terminated in June 2018 after Phase II/III trials showed no clinical benefit. Johnson & Johnson's atabecestat was halted in May 2018 due to liver toxicity. Roche's BACE inhibitor programs also faced setbacks. By 2019, virtually all major pharmaceutical companies had abandoned BACE inhibitor development for Alzheimer's disease.

**Scientific Implications:**

These failures dealt a significant blow to the amyloid hypothesis - the theory that reducing amyloid-beta production would slow or reverse Alzheimer's progression. The fact that multiple BACE inhibitors successfully reduced amyloid fragments in CSF and brain tissue, yet showed no clinical benefit, raised fundamental questions about whether amyloid is the right therapeutic target or whether intervention occurs too late in the disease process.

**Business Impact:**

Merck, Lilly, AstraZeneca, and other companies writing off hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in R&D investment. This led to strategic shifts away from amyloid-targeting approaches and contributed to reduced overall investment in Alzheimer's drug development by some companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions from the article:**
- Verubecestat trial results were expected in 2019
- If the amyloid hypothesis is correct and no toxicity issues emerge, this compound "has a chance of being a treatment" for Alzheimer's
- It could reduce amyloid fragments "with no effect on Alzheimer's at all"

**What actually happened:**
- **The 2019 timeline was already wrong at publication**: The article contains a strikethrough correction noting that the 2019 readout was actually for early-stage patients, with mild-to-moderate patient results expected in 2017.
- **The trials failed much earlier than predicted**: Both major verubecestat trials were terminated in 2017-2018, well before the predicted completion dates.
- **The worst-case prediction was accurate**: Verubecestat did indeed reduce amyloid fragments (as demonstrated in the Science Translational Medicine paper) but ultimately showed no clinical efficacy, exactly as the author's most pessimistic scenario suggested.
- **The author's skepticism was prescient**: The prediction that "this field has a success rate of basically zero percent" proved accurate - verubecestat and all other BACE inhibitors failed in clinical trials.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates exceptional scientific skepticism and accurately predicted the most likely outcome, distinguishing itself from the media hype it criticized. The fact that the drug failed just months after publication, and that BACE inhibitors became a case study in failed drug development, makes this commentary scientifically important and prescient for understanding the challenges of Alzheimer's therapeutic development.
