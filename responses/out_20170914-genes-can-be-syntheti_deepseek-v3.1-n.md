# Genes Can Be Synthetic Chemicals, You Know (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Nature Chemistry paper from researchers at the University of Southampton demonstrating "clicked DNA" technology. The work shows that ten oligonucleotides functionalized with azides and alkynes can be assembled into a 350-base pair GFP gene using triazole linkages. This synthetic gene maintains DNA-like secondary structure and, remarkably, functions in E. coli with normal protein expression and error rates comparable to naturally ligated DNA.

The research reveals that cellular transcriptional machinery tolerates these chemical modifications, and synthetic assembly enables precise incorporation of epigenetic markers like 5-methylcytosine at specific positions. The author suggests this positions molecular biology as fundamentally a branch of chemistry, opening possibilities for chemically modified DNA that natural enzymes would reject.

## 2. HISTORY

**Technical Development:** Chemically synthesized DNA with non-natural linkages continued to advance. Click chemistry approaches, particularly copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), became more sophisticated for oligonucleotide assembly.

**Epigenetics Applications:** The ability to site-specifically incorporate modified bases (5-methylcytosine, hydroxymethylcytosine, etc.) through synthetic routes found utility in epigenetics research, enabling mechanistic studies of methylation patterns in gene regulation.

**Commercial Adoption:** While academic labs adopted these techniques for basic research, widespread clinical or therapeutic applications remained limited. The approach proved more valuable for research tools than for large-scale therapeutic DNA synthesis, where enzymatic methods dominated for efficiency and cost.

**Limitations:** PCR amplification remained problematic with multiply-modified DNA, and the expense of chemical oligonucleotide synthesis limited large-scale applications compared to enzymatic DNA synthesis and CRISPR-based methods that became dominant in gene editing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The transcriptional machinery will put up with a lot more than we might have thought"** - **Partially correct**. While tolerance of modified DNA is broader than previously assumed, hard limits exist. Circular synthetic genes work, but integrated or replicative challenges remain. Clinical translation has been slow.

• **"This should be of great interest to the epigenetics field"** - **Correct**. Synthetic DNA with precisely placed epigenetic marks became a valuable research tool for studying DNA methylation effects without the complexity of enzymatic modification systems.

• **"Molecular biology is slowly turning into a branch of chemistry"** - **Mixed**. Chemistry approaches remain niche for DNA assembly compared to enzymatic methods. Gene synthesis still relies heavily on polymerase-based technologies, although chemical expertise is increasingly valuable for designing modified nucleotides and synthetic biology applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

Interesting for specialists but limited broader impact. The approach demonstrated conceptual advance in synthetic biology's intersection with chemistry, but practical applications remained research-focused rather than leading to therapeutic or industrial breakthroughs.
