# Roche Prevails Over Stanford (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 7‑2 decision in **Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. v. Stanford University** (June 8 2011). The dispute centered on whether the Bayh‑Dole Act automatically grants title to inventions created with federal funding to the university, or whether the inventor retains title until an explicit assignment is made. Stanford argued that Bayh‑Dole should vest title in the university because the invention was reduced to practice with NIH money. The Court rejected that view, holding that Bayh‑Dole contains no such automatic vesting provision; title remains with the inventor until the inventor signs an assignment. In this case the post‑doctoral researcher had previously signed an agreement assigning his rights to Cetus (later acquired by Roche), so the patents remained Roche’s property. The author notes the broader policy debate about whether publicly funded research should ultimately benefit the public versus private companies.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Legal and policy impact**  
* The decision clarified that Bayh‑Dole does **not** automatically transfer title to the university, reinforcing the need for explicit invention‑assignment agreements.  
* No amendment to Bayh‑Dole has been enacted since 2011; Congress has not altered the statutory language despite occasional calls for reform.  
* The case is now a standard citation in IP‑law curricula and in university technology‑transfer policy manuals. Many research institutions (including Stanford) tightened their post‑doc and collaborator agreements to ensure clear assignment of rights.  

**Commercial outcome**  
* The patents at issue (U.S. Patents 6,332,299 and 6,332,300, covering a method for detecting a protein biomarker) remained enforceable for Roche until their scheduled expiration in 2025. Roche licensed the technology to diagnostic‑test manufacturers, and the patents generated modest royalty streams, primarily in the oncology‑diagnostics market.  
* By 2024 the patents had largely expired, and the underlying assay has been superseded by next‑generation sequencing‑based diagnostics. Consequently, the direct commercial value of the specific Roche‑Stanford patents has waned, though the case’s precedent continues to protect Roche’s broader portfolio of assigned inventions.  

**Academic‑industry relations**  
* The ruling did not deter university‑industry collaborations; the volume of federally funded research contracts and licensing agreements continued to grow through the 2010s, reaching a record $30 billion in U.S. university licensing revenue in 2022.  
* Stanford’s Office of Technology Licensing revised its standard “Invention Assignment Agreement” in 2012 to explicitly require post‑doctoral researchers to assign inventions to the university unless a prior agreement exists, a change directly attributed to the Supreme Court decision.  

**Subsequent litigation**  
* The decision has been cited in later cases involving Bayh‑Dole, such as *University of Utah v. Eli Lilly* (2015) and *Association of University Technology Managers v. USPTO* (2020), but none have overturned the core holding that title rests with the inventor absent an assignment.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
* **Prediction in the article:** *“Roche will prevail; the Court will uphold the assignment and Bayh‑Dole does not automatically vest title in the university.”*  
  *Outcome:* Correct. The Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit’s ruling, and Roche retained the patents.  

* **Implicit prediction:** *“The decision will have lasting implications for how universities handle invention assignments and may prompt legislative change.”*  
  *Outcome:* Partially correct. The case did prompt universities to tighten assignment language, but Congress has not amended Bayh‑Dole.  

* **Implicit prediction:** *“The controversy will fuel debate about public‑funded research being “leached” by private firms.”*  
  *Outcome:* The debate continued, but no major policy shift occurred; the biotech industry’s reliance on university licensing persisted.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The case is a landmark for IP law and university‑industry relations, offering concrete precedent that still shapes technology‑transfer practice, though its direct commercial relevance has faded.
