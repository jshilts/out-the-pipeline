# Back Under the Sheets For Me (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from late December 2004 reflects on drug safety concerns in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly surrounding AstraZeneca's cholesterol medication Crestor (rosuvastatin). The author references editorial coverage from USA Today and the Wall Street Journal discussing broader drug safety issues, while specifically highlighting an FDA warning letter sent to AstraZeneca regarding Crestor's safety profile, especially at higher doses. The piece captures a moment of industry uncertainty, with the author suggesting that 2005 might continue the challenging regulatory environment that characterized 2004, marked by intensified scrutiny over pharmaceutical safety.

## 2. HISTORY

**Crestor's Continued Market Presence**: Despite the 2004 FDA warning letter mentioned in the article, Crestor was not withdrawn from the market. The FDA did implement labeling changes and dose restrictions, but the drug remained available and went on to become one of the most prescribed statins globally.

**FDA's Evolving Drug Safety Approach**: The period following 2004 saw significant changes in FDA's post-marketing surveillance and risk communication. The agency established more formal risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) programs and enhanced its adverse event reporting systems.

**Statins Market Evolution**: The statin market continued to evolve after 2004, with multiple drugs facing varying degrees of safety scrutiny. However, statins as a class remained foundational to cardiovascular disease prevention, with continued widespread clinical use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"the drug industry may start off 2005 in the same way that we're ending 2004. Unfestively"**
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. 2005 did see continued drug safety scrutiny, including high-profile cases like Vioxx withdrawal discussions and ongoing regulatory pressures. However, the pharmaceutical industry adapted and continued to operate profitably, with many companies maintaining robust pipelines and market presence.

• **Implicit concern about Crestor's viability: "I'm not sure how long for the world Crestor is, at least at its high dose"**
  - **Outcome**: Significantly overstated the risk. Crestor continued to be marketed successfully for nearly two more decades, becoming a blockbuster drug with billions in annual sales before facing generic competition. Lower dose formulations saw wider use, but the drug maintained its market position far longer than this pessimistic assessment suggested.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While this captures a real moment in pharmaceutical regulatory history, it's primarily a brief industry blog post reflecting immediate concerns rather than providing substantial insight into broader biopharmaceutical trends. The drug safety discussions were genuine industry issues, but the article lacks the depth and scope that would make it highly informative for understanding major biotechnology developments of the era.

**Note**: As the article was published in December 2004, and this analysis is being conducted without access to current information databases, the historical assessment focuses on well-documented regulatory and market developments in the pharmaceutical industry during the mid-2000s period. Specific sales figures, exact timeline details, or recent developments beyond approximately 2015-2020 would require verification through updated sources.
