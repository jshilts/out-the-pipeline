# Who are YOU working for?
29 Sep 2015

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary describes a corporate communications misstep at Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company ran an internal campaign to reinforce that employees work for patients, symbolized by distributing tote bags with the slogan "Who are YOU working for?" The author notes this was particularly awkward timing because BMS was simultaneously closing its Wallingford site, leaving many employees uncertain about their future employment. The piece contrasts upbeat corporate messaging with the reality of workforce reductions.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2015 article, Bristol-Myers Squibb continued significant restructuring activities. The company underwent multiple rounds of site closures and layoffs throughout the late 2010s as part of broader pharmaceutical industry consolidation trends. During this period, BMS maintained focus on oncology and immunology therapeutic areas, with notable successes including the continued expansion of Opdivo (nivolumab) for cancer immunotherapy.

However, major changes occurred when Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Celgene in November 2019 for approximately \$74 billion, one of the largest pharmaceutical mergers in history. This acquisition significantly transformed BMS's portfolio, adding multiple blockbuster drugs and reshaping their research strategy. The early 2020s saw BMS navigating patent cliffs on key products while integrating Celgene's operations - a process that involved further workforce reductions and facility consolidations.

From a broader industry perspective, the biotechnology sector evolved toward greater emphasis on personalized medicine and cell/gene therapies during this period. The workforce dynamics mentioned in the article reflected ongoing industry trends of site optimization and strategic realignment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article does not contain formal predictions about future developments. It is primarily observational commentary about corporate communications practices and their disconnect from employee experiences during restructuring.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **3/10**
This article documents a minor corporate communications anecdote rather than substantive technological, scientific, or business developments in biotechnology. While it captures human aspects of pharmaceutical industry restructuring, it lacks analytical depth or broader implications relevant to biotech innovation, clinical outcomes, or industry transformation.

This is not topically relevant to biotechnology science/industry analysis.
