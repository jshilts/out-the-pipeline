# Alzheimer's and the Rare Disease Model (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The Politico article and Derek Lowe's commentary highlight a fundamental tension in pharmaceutical development circa 2018: the industry's business model increasingly favors rare disease drugs (like Kalydeco) with clear mechanisms and high prices for small patient populations, while major chronic diseases like Alzheimer's remain scientifically and commercially challenging. Alzheimer's has seen massive investments fail to produce effective therapies, with Eli Lilly's efforts serving as a prominent example of high-risk, low-reward outcomes.

The piece suggests that Alzheimer's may not be a single disease but rather a collection of pathologies requiring different therapeutic approaches. Some researchers propose precision medicine trials targeting specific genetic subgroups (e.g., the 10% with particular gene pairs), potentially enabling previously failed drug candidates to succeed in more carefully selected populations. However, the essay acknowledges that Alzheimer's lacks the clear mechanistic underpinnings that make rare disease drug development attractive—unlike monogenic diseases with solid genetic links to pathology, Alzheimer's mechanisms remain obscure and controversial even for the most established hypotheses like amyloid and tau.

The commentary expresses concern that even a future FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug might show statistically significant but clinically minimal benefits, while the industry's incentive structure continues steering investment away from these complex, high-risk therapeutic areas toward lucrative rare disease markets. Better biomarkers are universally recognized as essential but remain elusive despite decades of effort.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent six years (2018-2024) proved both validating and transformative for Alzheimer's drug development, though not entirely in the ways envisioned in 2018.

**Biomarker Revolution**: The 2018 wish for better biomarkers was answered dramatically. Blood-based biomarkers for amyloid and tau became viable, with FDA approval of the first blood test for Alzheimer's detection in 2022 (the PrecivityAD test). This revolutionized the ability to identify and monitor patients, making trials more efficient and accurate.

**Precision Medicine Success**: The precision medicine approach articulated by Serge Gauthier gained momentum. ApoE4 genotyping became standard in trials, and genetic subpopulations received focused attention. Biogen's Aduhelm and Eisai's Leqembi trials increasingly incorporated genetic stratification, though debate continued about which populations benefited most.

**Drug Approvals and Controversy**: In 2021, Biogen's Aduhelm (aducanumab) received controversial FDA approval despite mixed trial data—precisely the scenario the 2018 piece warned about. The drug showed statistical benefits in some measures but unclear real-world clinical impact. The approval generated enormous controversy and extremely limited patient uptake due to uncertain efficacy, high cost (~$56,000/year), and Medicare coverage restrictions. Only a few thousand patients received the drug.

More significantly, Eisai and Biogen's Leqembi (lecanemab) received full FDA approval in 2023 after showing clearer clinical benefits in a large Phase 3 trial. This marked the first drug to demonstrate both amyloid reduction and modest cognitive benefit across broader patient populations, though the effect size remained limited (27% slowing of decline on the CDR-SB scale over 18 months). Leqembi achieved wider adoption than Aduhelm but still faced cost and access challenges.

**Pipeline Evolution**: Lilly's donanemab, extensively tested post-2018, showed similar efficacy to Leqembi in 2023 trials, reinforcing that anti-amyloid approaches could provide modest benefits but not dramatic reversals of disease.

**Business Reality**: The rare disease model continued thriving with numerous drugs achieving blockbuster status (e.g., Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy, Trikafta for cystic fibrosis). Alzheimer's remained high-risk, but successful drugs now command premium pricing—Leqembi at ~$26,500/year—with potential for substantial revenue if effectiveness and access improve. The policy concern about costs threatening healthcare solvency persisted but focused more on overall specialty drug spending rather than specifically bankrupting the system.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction**: Alzheimer's should be treated as a bundle of diseases using different drugs targeting specific pathologies in narrower patient populations. Trials focusing on the 10% with particular gene pairs were already being planned in 2018.

**Reality**: Partially validated. Precision medicine approaches became standard in Alzheimer's trials, with genetic stratification (especially ApoE4 status) integrated into most studies. However, treatments remained broadly targeted rather than truly personalized to specific genetic subgroups. Anti-amyloid drugs like Leqembi and donanemab demonstrated efficacy across diverse populations rather than just narrow genetic subsets. The field moved toward earlier-stage patients (mild cognitive impairment) as a practical subgroup rather than purely genetic definitions.

**• Prediction**: If narrow population trials succeeded, companies would re-examine previously failed candidates for new trials with more carefully filtered groups.

**Reality**: Weakly validated. Some failed drugs (e.g., gantenerumab) re-entered trials in earlier-stage or different populations, but most previous failures remained shelved. The field's focus shifted primarily to improved versions of existing mechanisms (better anti-amyloid antibodies) rather than resurrecting older approaches. The fundamental challenge remained that most failed candidates targeted unclear or incorrect mechanisms.

**• Prediction**: The first successful Alzheimer's drug would likely show statistically significant results for FDA approval but minimal real-world difference, enabled by the incentive structure.

**Reality**: Strongly validated for Aduhelm, moderately for Leqembi. Aduhelm exemplified this concern perfectly—approval based on surrogate endpoints despite uncertain clinical benefits, leading to minimal patient uptake even after approval. Leqembi showed clearer but still modest benefits (roughly 5-point difference on the CDR-SB scale over 18 months), representing measurable but not dramatic clinical impact. Healthcare systems continue grappling with whether these benefits justify costs.

**• Prediction**: Better biomarkers were needed to accelerate trials and reduce costs, but this had been recognized for decades without solutions materializing.

**Reality**: Strongly contradicted. Blood-based biomarkers transformed Alzheimer's research within 3-4 years of this 2018 article. The development of plasma assays for amyloid and tau dramatically reduced trial costs, improved participant selection, and enabled more efficient monitoring. Blood tests moved from research tools to clinical reality faster than anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article provided prescient analysis of core tensions that continued playing out through 2024—the rare disease model vs. complex chronic diseases, biomarker needs, and concerns about marginal efficacy drugs. It correctly anticipated the precision medicine direction while underestimating the speed of biomarker breakthroughs. The piece captured a pivotal moment when Alzheimer's therapeutic strategy was fundamentally rethinking its approach.
