# Chemistry Class For the Food Babe (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses Vani Hari, known as the "Food Babe," who was revealed to be working as a menu consultant for Chick-fil-A. The author expresses frustration with Hari's widespread chemistry misconceptions and scientific errors on her website, which promote fear-based messaging about food ingredients. The piece mentions that Hari appears to lack fundamental chemistry knowledge, referencing another analysis by "Wavefunction" that critiques her claims. Notably, the article highlights a crowdsourced fundraising campaign on Indiegogo created to "send the Food Babe to chemistry class" - an ironic response to her anti-science messaging, though the author notes the likely futility of such efforts given Hari's apparent disinterest in scientific accuracy and her financial success from promoting chemical fears.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2014 commentary, Vani Hari's influence and business model continued to evolve significantly. She maintained a large following and expanded her brand, publishing books and continuing her activism against various food additives and chemicals. Her advocacy led to some concrete corporate responses: Subway removed azodicarbonamide from its bread in 2014 after her campaign, and other companies made similar formulation changes under public pressure.

However, Hari faced increasing criticism from the scientific community. Numerous scientists, science communicators, and organizations systematically debunked her claims about various chemicals and food additives. She was widely criticized for promoting chemophobia and misunderstanding basic toxicology principles (the dose makes the poison). Despite this scientific pushback, her business model remained financially successful, demonstrating that anti-science messaging can be lucrative even when contradicted by expert consensus.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction that chemistry education campaign would fail**: The author's skepticism about the Indiegogo campaign's effectiveness ("horse, water, drink") proved accurate. The campaign did not lead to Hari changing her approach or seeking chemistry education, and she continued her established messaging patterns.
• **Implicit prediction about financial incentives**: The article's observation about Hari making more money "telling people that they're eating yoga mats than I do trying to discover drugs" highlighted the economic dynamics that would persist. This financial incentive structure indeed continued, with anti-establishment health messaging proving more lucrative than legitimate scientific work, contributing to ongoing misinformation ecosystems.
• **Implicit prediction about knowledge gaps persisting**: The suggestion that Hari lacked fundamental chemistry knowledge and showed no interest in correction proved accurate over time, as she maintained similar messaging strategies despite scientific criticism.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important early moment in the anti-science health influencer phenomenon, documenting the economic and social dynamics that enable misinformation to thrive despite scientific consensus. It highlights the persistent challenge of communicating chemistry and toxicology to the public.
