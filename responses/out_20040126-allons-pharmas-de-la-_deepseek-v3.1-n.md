# Allons Pharmas de la Patrie! (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes Sanofi-Synthélabo's hostile takeover bid for Aventis in early 2004. The author expresses surprise that smaller Sanofi was pursuing larger Aventis, speculating that Sanofi's motivation stemmed from undisclosed troubles—specifically a patent challenge to its blockbuster drug Plavix from generic manufacturer Apotex. The article characterizes Aventis as a merger of "mediocre companies" that created "one really big mediocre company." A key factor highlighted is French government intervention, with Chirac's administration actively encouraging the deal to create the world's third-largest pharmaceutical company—and keeping it French. The analysis questions both whether the merger will succeed (predicting French political pressure will force it through) and whether it will actually work long-term, citing industry skepticism about pharmaceutical mergers generally. The commentary ends by noting the unique risks of hostile takeovers in pharma due to difficulty valuing clinical trial data, patents, and scientific talent.

## 2. HISTORY

The Sanofi-Aventis merger did indeed proceed in 2004, creating Sanofi-Aventis (later simplified to Sanofi). The French government played a significant role in facilitating the €54 billion deal. However, the article's concerns about merger effectiveness proved prescient in some respects.

Regarding the Plavix patent challenge mentioned, Apotex did eventually launch at-risk generic competition, but Sanofi and partner Bristol-Myers Squibb ultimately prevailed in patent litigation, protecting Plavix exclusivity until 2012. Plavix became one of the most prescribed drugs globally before genericization.

The "mediocre company" assessment of Aventis overlooked some valuable assets, most notably Lantus (insulin glargine), which became a multi-billion dollar diabetes blockbuster for Sanofi. However, Aventis did face pipeline challenges that justified some of the skepticism.

The merger created real integration difficulties, as predicted. It took years for Sanofi-Aventis to rationalize overlapping operations, and the company struggled with R&D productivity—a common post-merger issue. The article's skepticism about pharmaceutical mega-mergers proved generally warranted based on subsequent industry outcomes.

From a national perspective, the French government achieved its objective: Sanofi-Aventis became and remained a top-tier global pharmaceutical company headquartered in France, maintaining France's presence in the industry's upper echelons.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Merger will happen due to French government pressure**: ✓ ACCURATE. The merger proceeded in 2004, with French government playing an active role in negotiations.

• **Government intervention**: ✓ ACCURATE. The French administration indeed facilitated the deal, contrasting with what would likely happen in US regulatory approach.

• **Merger won't work well/not better than others**: ✓ LARGELY ACCURATE. The merger did create integration challenges and R&D productivity issues typical of pharmaceutical mergers, as the author predicted.

• **Aventis as mediocre company**: ⚠ PARTIALLY ACCURATE. While Aventis had pipeline weaknesses, it also possessed valuable assets like Lantus that exceeded "mediocre" status.

• **Hostile pharma takeovers are risky due to opaque valuations**: ✓ ACCURATE. This fundamental challenge in pharmaceutical M&A remains true and has been demonstrated in numerous subsequent deals.

• **Disruption exceeds resolution in pharma mergers**: ✓ GENERALLY ACCURATE. Subsequent industry history has shown mixed results for mega-mergers, with many struggling to boost innovation productivity.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrated strong analytical insight about pharmaceutical M&A dynamics and accurately predicted the merger's completion and many of its challenges. It captured important industry trends about government involvement in strategic sectors and the inherent difficulties of combining pharmaceutical companies. The piece remains relevant for understanding persistent issues in pharmaceutical consolidation.
