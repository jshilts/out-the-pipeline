# Too Many Cancer Drugs? Too Few? About Right? (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post notes a recent Ernst & Young estimate that **44 % of all drugs in U.S. clinical development were aimed at cancer**. The author wonders whether that share is unusually high. He points out three reasons oncology has attracted so much R&D:  

1. **A large and growing list of molecular targets** (e.g., kinases, receptors).  
2. **High pricing power** for any drug that shows efficacy.  
3. **A relatively fast, well‑defined clinical pathway** (often single‑arm Phase II/III trials, clear regulatory pathways, and a specialist prescriber base that does not require massive advertising).  

The piece asks whether these incentives have caused the industry to “overshoot” in the number of cancer candidates.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory approvals** – The FDA’s oncology approvals have risen sharply since 2011. In 2011 the agency approved 8 new cancer drugs; by 2022 the number was 55, and 2023 already exceeded 50. The surge is driven largely by **targeted kinase inhibitors** (e.g., osimertinib, 2020) and **immune‑checkpoint inhibitors** (e.g., pembrolizumab, 2014; nivolumab, 2014).  

**Pipeline composition** – Industry reports (e.g., EvaluatePharma, GlobalData) show that **≈40–45 % of all Phase I–III trials continue to be oncology‑focused** in 2022, essentially the same proportion reported in 2011. The absolute number of oncology trials has grown, but the share of the total pipeline has remained stable.  

**Commercial impact** – Oncology now accounts for **about 50 % of total pharmaceutical sales** worldwide (≈ $150 bn in 2022). A handful of blockbuster immunotherapies (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab) each generated > $10 bn annually at peak.  

**Clinical outcomes** – Survival gains have been real but modest on a population level. Between 2011 and 2022, the **5‑year relative survival for all cancers in the U.S. rose from 68 % to 71 %** (SEER). Gains are concentrated in lung, melanoma, and certain hematologic malignancies where checkpoint inhibitors and targeted agents are used. Many newly approved drugs provide **progression‑free survival improvements of 2–4 months** and are priced at **$100 k–$150 k per patient per year**.  

**Policy response** – The high price and modest incremental benefit have spurred **value‑based pricing initiatives** (e.g., CMS Oncology Care Model, ICER assessments) and **FDA reforms** such as the Oncology Center of Excellence and stricter post‑marketing confirmatory trial requirements for accelerated approvals.  

**Business dynamics** – Venture capital continues to pour into oncology biotech; the median pre‑IPO valuation of oncology‑focused companies rose from ~$300 M in 2011 to > $1 bn by 2022. At the same time, **large pharma has divested non‑oncology assets** to concentrate on cancer (e.g., Pfizer’s 2020 spin‑off of Upjohn, Merck’s 2022 acquisition of Acceleron).  

Overall, the **proportion of R&D devoted to cancer has stayed near the 44 % figure**, while the absolute scale of activity, sales, and regulatory approvals has expanded dramatically.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but it raises two implicit expectations:

| Implicit prediction (2011) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Oncology could be “overshooting”** – i.e., too many drugs relative to need. | The pipeline remained ~44 % of total, but the market became saturated with agents that often have overlapping mechanisms and modest incremental benefit. Critics now label the space “crowded,” and many late‑stage trials fail to meet primary endpoints. |
| **High pricing will continue to fuel investment** | Cancer drug revenues grew to ~½ of total pharma sales, confirming the pricing incentive. However, escalating prices triggered policy push‑back (value‑based contracts, CMS reforms). |
| **Short, definitive clinical pathways will keep oncology attractive** | Accelerated approvals and surrogate endpoints (e.g., ORR, PFS) remained common, sustaining rapid entry. Yet the FDA has tightened requirements for confirmatory trials, and some drugs (e.g., olaratumab) were withdrawn after Phase III failure, showing the pathway is not foolproof. |
| **Historical climb in oncology share** (author guessed a ten‑year upward trend) | The share **did not climb further** after 2011; it plateaued around 40–45 % of the pipeline. The absolute number of candidates rose, but the proportion stayed flat. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment when oncology began to dominate biotech investment and regulatory attention; its question about “too many” drugs remains highly relevant to current debates on drug value, pricing, and pipeline management.
