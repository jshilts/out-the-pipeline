# Clinical Trial Fraud Uncovered (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The Bloomberg article reported that Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and Pfizer's anticoagulant drug Eliquis (apixaban), a Factor Xa inhibitor, faced significant delays in FDA approval due to misconduct discovered in Chinese clinical trials. The misconduct occurred at Shanghai 9th People's Hospital and involved a BMS employee who altered patient records before an FDA inspection. Issues included improper manipulation of records for 35 patients, failure to report adverse medical events, discrepancies between Chinese and English records, and missing patient records prior to FDA site visits.

The problems came to light when a contract worker reported being asked to change data and documentation before an FDA inspection. The supervisor involved had worked at 18 other trial locations in China, raising broader concerns about oversight. FDA documents showed that despite these issues, when the agency re-ran the analysis excluding the problematic Chinese sites, the trial results still favored apixaban, though with less robust outcomes in some categories. The article noted that BMS had contracted with Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc. (PPD) for trial oversight, but PPD lacked presence in China when the trial began.

## 2. HISTORY

**Eliquis Approval and Market Performance:** Eliquis (apixaban) was ultimately FDA-approved in December 2012 for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients, despite the delays caused by the trial misconduct investigation. The drug went on to become highly successful commercially. By the late 2010s, Eliquis emerged as the leading oral anticoagulant in the US market, generating billions in annual revenue for BMS and Pfizer.

**Clinical Trial Oversight Changes:** In the years following this incident, regulatory scrutiny of international clinical trials, particularly those conducted in China and India, intensified. The FDA increased inspections of foreign trial sites and implemented more rigorous oversight requirements. Many pharmaceutical companies responded by enhancing their internal compliance programs and increasing monitoring of contract research organizations (CROs) operating in these regions.

**Broader Industry Impact:** This case contributed to growing awareness within the pharmaceutical industry about the risks associated with outsourcing clinical trials to countries with less stringent regulatory oversight. Some companies reevaluated their strategies for international trial conduct, while others invested more heavily in local monitoring and quality assurance programs in these markets. The incident also highlighted the critical role of whistleblowers in uncovering clinical trial misconduct.

**Regulatory Repercussions:** While the specific individuals involved faced consequences (the BMS employee was fired), broader regulatory action was limited. However, the case added to ongoing discussions about strengthening Good Clinical Practice (GCP) enforcement internationally and improving transparency in clinical trial data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The article predicted that making such misconduct public would create incentives for better behavior through reputational consequences.** This largely proved accurate. The publicity around cases like this contributed to improved industry practices and more robust oversight mechanisms, though challenges with international trial conduct persisted.

• **Christopher Granger's statement about greater likelihood of impropriety in certain regions (China and India) reflected concerns about oversight challenges in these markets.** This assessment was unfortunately prescient, as additional cases of clinical trial misconduct and data integrity issues continued to emerge in international trials conducted in these regions in subsequent years.

• **The implicit prediction that transparency and public exposure would drive positive change** had mixed results. While such incidents did lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and improved company practices, the fundamental economic pressures driving cost-sensitive trial outsourcing remained, continuing to create challenges for ensuring data integrity in international studies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses critical issues in pharmaceutical development and international clinical trial oversight that remain highly relevant. The case highlighted systemic challenges in balancing cost efficiency with data integrity in global drug development, and it demonstrated how transparency can serve as a corrective mechanism in regulatory oversight.
