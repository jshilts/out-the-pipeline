# Affymax In Trouble (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Affymax's history from its founding in 1988 as a pioneer in combinatorial chemistry, through its acquisition by Glaxo in 1995 and subsequent spin-off in 2001. The company had focused on developing peginesatide (brand name Omontys), a synthetic PEGylated peptide designed to mimic erythropoietin for treating anemia. After a long development period with safety concerns around cardiovascular effects, the drug was approved by the FDA in March 2012 with a black-box warning. However, post-approval real-world use in approximately 25,000 patients revealed severe anaphylactic reactions, with 19 serious cases including 3 fatalities occurring within 30 minutes of drug administration. This led Takeda and Affymax to voluntarily recall the drug in February 2013, resulting in massive layoffs and the company exploring strategic alternatives including sale or bankruptcy. The author presents this as a cautionary tale about the difficulty of drug development.

## 2. HISTORY

In the aftermath of the 2013 article, Affymax's fate was indeed sealed. The company never recovered from the Omontys recall and ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2014. The complete withdrawal of their only approved drug, representing over a decade of development and their primary revenue opportunity, proved fatal to the business. Takeda, their marketing partner, also suffered significant losses from the episode.

The peginesatide (Omontys) case became a notable example in pharmacovigilance and drug safety literature, highlighting the limitations of pre-approval clinical trials in detecting rare but serious adverse events that only emerge with larger patient populations post-marketing. The dramatic difference between the drug's major identified risk (cardiovascular events) versus what actually caused its withdrawal (anaphylaxis) underscored the challenges in predicting real-world safety profiles.

This failure also had broader implications for the PEGylated peptide therapeutic approach, making both investors and regulators more cautious about synthetic peptide mimetics of natural proteins, particularly those with complex structures and potential immunogenicity concerns. The case reinforced the difficulty of competing with established biologics like Amgen's EPO drugs, which by 2013 had a decades-long safety record despite their own well-documented cardiovascular risks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain specific forward-looking predictions about future outcomes, but rather presented the unfolding crisis as it was happening. The author's tone was heavily suggestive that this would likely be the end of Affymax, noting that "this has been their main chance for some years now" and quoting the company's language about exploring "strategic alternatives" including wind-down or bankruptcy.

**What actually happened:**
- **Company survival:** The implied prediction that the company would fail proved accurate. Affymax filed for bankruptcy in 2014, unable to recover from the loss of their only approved drug.
- **Drug's fate:** Omontys was permanently withdrawn and never returned to market, even with additional warnings or restricted indications.
- **Pharmacovigilance impact:** The case reinforced the critical importance of post-marketing surveillance and the reality that rare but serious adverse events may only be detected once a drug reaches broad patient populations.
- **Synthetic peptide development:** Development of similar PEGylated peptide therapeutics became more cautious, with heightened focus on immunogenicity assessment.

The author's assessment that "drug development is very hard indeed" was borne out by subsequent events, with this case becoming one more data point in the high failure rate of pharmaceutical development, particularly for novel therapeutic modalities competing against established treatments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article captures an important cautionary case study in drug development and post-marketing safety, but it's more valuable as an example of process failure than groundbreaking scientific insight. The core science (PEGylated peptide mimetics) was already established, so the main interest lies in the real-world demonstration of how unexpectedly drug development can fail.
