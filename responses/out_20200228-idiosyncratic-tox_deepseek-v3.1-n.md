# Idiosyncratic Tox
28 Feb 2020

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses the critical problem of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs) in drug development, particularly idiosyncratic liver injury that occurs at very low frequencies (less than 1 per 10,000 patients) but can cause severe damage. These reactions are nightmares for drug development because they often emerge late in clinical trials or even after market approval, with long and variable incubation times that make them difficult to detect and predict.

The author explains that IADRs are strongly linked to immunological mechanisms, involving the formation of neoantigens through reactive drug metabolites that bind to proteins (similar to poison ivy reactions). This triggers an immune response that starts with innate immunity and progresses to adaptive immunity, accounting for the delayed onset. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes have been associated with susceptibility to specific drug reactions. The article contrasts this with predictable toxicity like acetaminophen overdose (which affects everyone at high doses) versus true idiosyncratic reactions that depend on individual patient factors including genetics, co-morbidities, concurrent medications, and underlying cellular stress responses.

The author emphasizes the need for predictive assays combining advanced sequencing (to identify known HLA and metabolic variants) with ex vivo immunological tests, while acknowledging that current methods like blood liver enzyme markers produce too many false positives and existing immunological tests take weeks to perform. The goal is to develop standard screening panels that can alert developers to common IADR pathways before drugs enter clinical trials or fail late-stage development.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in February 2020, the field of idiosyncratic toxicity prediction and understanding has seen continued but incremental progress rather than transformative breakthroughs:

**Continued Focus on HLA Associations**: Research has expanded the catalog of HLA allele associations with specific drug-induced injuries. The strongest associations remain with drugs like carbamazepine (HLA-B*57:01), allopurinol (HLA-B*58:01), and flucloxacillin (HLA-B*57:01), but new associations continue to be identified for other medications.

**Biomarker Development Challenges**: The prediction of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity remains difficult. Blood-based markers like ALT, AST, and bilirubin continue to be the primary clinical indicators, with their known limitations of poor specificity and many false positives. More sophisticated biomarkers have not yet entered routine clinical use for prediction, though research continues on microRNAs, exosomes, and immune-related markers.

**Regulatory and Clinical Practice**: FDA and EMA have maintained their cautious approaches to drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Several drugs have been withdrawn or received black box warnings due to hepatotoxicity concerns since 2020. However, pre-market prediction remains primarily dependent on animal studies and careful clinical monitoring rather than definitive predictive tests.

**Covalently Binding Drugs**: The development of covalent drugs has continued, with several covalent inhibitors approved (such as some COVID-19 antiviral candidates and cancer therapeutics), but the concern about reactive metabolites and immune-mediated toxicity remains. The balance between designing selective, reversible covalent drugs versus avoiding highly reactive compounds is still an active area.

**Technological Advances**: Advanced sequencing technologies have become more accessible and affordable, potentially enabling broader HLA screening and pharmacogenomic testing. However, implementation in drug development pipelines has been slower than hoped, partly due to validation requirements and the complexity of interpreting genetic data.

**Post-Market Surveillance**: Pharmacovigilance systems have improved with better electronic health records and data mining approaches, allowing faster detection of safety signals after drug approval. However, rare idiosyncratic reactions still often only become apparent after widespread use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the future of idiosyncratic toxicity prediction:

• **Prediction of standardized screening panels**: The author suggested that "some sort of standard panel that can at least alert us to the more common IADR routes" would be needed for drug development. 
**Reality**: While some HLA screening is done for specific high-risk drugs (particularly in HIV and epilepsy treatments), universal or broad screening panels for IADRs have not been implemented. The complexity and diversity of IADR mechanisms have made standardized panels challenging to develop and validate.

• **Combination of advanced sequencing and ex vivo assays**: The author predicted that "some combination of advanced sequencing (to look for known HLAs and metabolic variants and to expand both of those lists) and ex-vivo immunological assays will work out."
**Reality**: Both technologies have advanced independently - sequencing is faster and cheaper, and ex vivo immunological assays exist - but their integration into predictive, validated systems for routine drug development use has been limited. Validation remains a major barrier.

• **Reduction in late-stage trial failures**: Implicit was the hope that better prediction would reduce the number of drugs failing in Phase III or post-market due to unexpected IADRs.
**Reality**: Drug failures due to toxicity and safety concerns continue to be a significant problem, with hepatotoxicity remaining a major cause of drug attrition and post-market withdrawals. While some progress has been made in specific areas (like HLA screening for certain drugs), overall the problem persists.

• **Improved understanding through immunology**: The author emphasized that immunology understanding would be key, stating "most of them do involve the immune system."
**Reality**: The immunological basis of many IADRs is better appreciated, and HLA associations continue to be discovered. However, the complex interplay between drugs, metabolites, immune responses, and individual patient factors means that mechanistic understanding remains incomplete for most IADRs.

• **Delayed rather than eliminated risk**: The author noted "we're never going to be able to wring all the risk out of taken an investigational drug into humans."
**Reality**: This prediction has held true - drug development remains risky, and unexpected safety issues continue to emerge. The hope for dramatic improvement in predicting idiosyncratic toxicity has not yet been realized.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses a persistent and important problem in drug development that remains highly relevant today. While it doesn't reveal groundbreaking new science, it provides a clear explanation of the mechanistic challenges that continue to plague pharmaceutical development. The moderate score reflects that the topic is crucial but the insights are more explanatory than predictive of major breakthroughs that would transform the field.
