# The GSK Jackpot (July 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses GlaxoSmithKline's reported plan to replace traditional milestone-based bonuses with large "jackpot" payments—potentially several million dollars—to key scientists upon successful drug approval. The central tension highlighted is the difficulty of assigning credit in drug discovery, which the author describes as fundamentally a team effort spanning chemistry, biology, toxicology, clinical trial design, and even serendipitous observations (citing Viagra's discovery by a nurse noticing unexpected side effects). John LaMattina's analysis is quoted extensively, emphasizing that drug R&amp;D involves numerous contributors beyond just the named patent inventors. The article raises concerns about this approach: the challenge of fairly distributing credit, the long time lag between discovery and approval (potentially 10+ years), the role of luck alongside skill, and the fact that many key contributors may have left the company by the time approval occurs.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2013 announcement, GSK (and the broader pharmaceutical industry) underwent significant evolution in incentive structures and faced changing R&amp;D productivity realities. **Specific outcomes of GSK's jackpot program are not publicly documented**, and the company did not widely publicize results of this specific incentive scheme. However, broader industry trends emerged:

**GSK's Pipeline Performance (2013-2020s):** GSK continued launching important drugs but faced mixed success. Notable post-2013 approvals included:
- Nucala (mepolizumab) for severe asthma (2015) and other eosinophilic diseases
- Shingrix (zoster vaccine) - highly successful commercially
- Benlysta (belimumab) for lupus (approved 2011 but expanded)
- However, GSK also experienced pipeline setbacks and continued the industry pattern of high R&amp;D costs with unpredictable outputs

**Incentive Structure Evolution:** The industry generally moved toward more balanced approaches, with major companies using combination incentive structures rather than pure "jackpot" models—typically mixing base salary, annual bonuses tied to individual/departmental milestones, long-term incentives (stock options), and sometimes special recognition awards. The challenges GSK likely encountered (team credit assignment, long timelines, attribution difficulty) reflect why such pure jackpot systems remain rare.

**Drug Discovery Timeline Reality:** The 10+ year timeline mentioned proved accurate, with modern drug development still averaging 10-12 years from discovery to approval. This reinforces the article's concern that incentives tied solely to final approval create motivational gaps.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about challenges the GSK jackpot system would face:

- **Credit Assignment Problems:** ✓ **Accurate.** The fundamental issue of fairly distributing credit in team-based drug discovery remains a persistent challenge across the industry. The prediction that "battery arguing with drive shaft" would emerge proved prescient about the inherent difficulty of isolating individual contributions.
- **Time Lag Undermining Incentive Value:** ✓ **Accurate.** The 10+ year timeline issue remains a significant challenge for drug development incentives. Later research confirms that long delays between effort and reward reduce motivational effectiveness, supporting the article's skepticism about this aspect.
- **Luck vs. Skill Problem:** ✓ **Accurate.** The role of serendipity and factors beyond individual control in drug discovery success has been well-documented. The article correctly identified that coupling large rewards entirely to approval outcomes (rather than quality of scientific work) creates misaligned incentives.
- **Key People Leaving Before Rewards:** ✓ **Accurate.** Pharmaceutical industry turnover rates remained substantial, with scientists frequently changing companies within typical drug development timelines. The predicted issue of rewarding people no longer with the organization proved to be a real structural challenge.

**Broader Implication:** The prediction that this incentive structure would face significant practical problems proved correct, as pure jackpot systems for drug discovery have not become industry standard despite the theoretical appeal.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

While the article addresses an important pharmaceutical industry topic, it focuses on a specific incentive scheme that appears to have had limited broader implementation or transformative impact. The discussion illuminates perennial challenges in drug discovery but doesn't represent a pivotal moment or major policy shift with widespread consequences. The analysis quality helps elevate its relevance for understanding R&amp;D management challenges.
