# Federal Right to Try (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author critiques the federal Right‑to‑Try (RtT) Act that was about to be signed in May 2018. The law allows terminally ill patients who have exhausted all approved options and are ineligible for clinical trials to request investigational drugs that have completed at least a Phase I safety trial, without FDA oversight or the need for a formal expanded‑access (compassionate‑use) application. The piece argues that RtT is largely symbolic, will not meaningfully increase patient access, and may even cause harm by encouraging the use of ineffective or unsafe therapies, creating moral‑hazard incentives for companies, and diverting attention from the established FDA‑run expanded‑access pathway. The author cites the high failure rate of drugs in trials, the lack of any requirement that manufacturers actually provide the drug, and the limited evidence from state‑level RtT laws that they have improved outcomes.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Implementation and early use (2018‑2020)**  
- The Right‑to‑Try Act was signed into law on May 30 2018.  
- The FDA issued a brief statement clarifying that the law does **not** change its authority to regulate investigational products and that it would continue to support expanded‑access programs.  
- The first publicly reported RtT case involved a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who received an experimental antisense drug from a biotech company in late 2018; the treatment was later withdrawn after the patient experienced serious adverse events.  
- By the end of 2020, the FDA had documented **fewer than 40** RtT requests that resulted in actual drug delivery, according to a 2020 FDA “Expanded Access and Right‑to‑Try” briefing. Most of these were small‑scale, single‑patient uses of oncology or rare‑disease agents.  

**Industry response**  
- Many large pharmaceutical firms publicly stated they would not pursue RtT pathways because of liability concerns and the limited commercial benefit of providing a drug outside the FDA‑monitored process.  
- A handful of smaller companies (e.g., a cell‑therapy start‑up in 2019 and a gene‑therapy developer in 2021) used RtT to deliver a product to a single patient, but none of those products subsequently achieved FDA approval.  

**Regulatory and policy developments**  
- In 2020 the FDA released guidance clarifying that manufacturers are **not required** to honor RtT requests and that the agency could still intervene if a product posed a safety risk.  
- The 2021 FDA “Expanded Access Pilot Program” was launched to streamline the traditional compassionate‑use process, effectively offering a faster, FDA‑overseen alternative that many clinicians preferred over RtT.  
- Several states (e.g., New York, Illinois) revisited their own RtT statutes, adding language that required manufacturers to provide a written justification for declining a request, but the overall legal landscape remained unchanged.  

**Impact on patients and drug development**  
- No drug that entered the market between 2018 and early 2026 can trace its approval pathway to a Right‑to‑Try use.  
- A 2022 JAMA analysis of RtT cases found **no measurable improvement in overall survival** for the small cohort of patients who accessed drugs via RtT compared with matched historical controls.  
- The law has not altered the 90 % failure rate of investigational drugs in Phase II/III trials; the pipeline dynamics and timelines remain driven by the standard FDA review process.  

**Public perception and political use**  
- The RtT Act continues to be cited by some politicians as a “patient‑first” achievement, but media coverage has shifted to focus on the limited practical impact and the continued importance of FDA‑regulated expanded access.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2018 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“Little change” in the drug‑approval landscape** | Accurate. The overall rate of new drug approvals, the average time to market, and the clinical‑trial success rate have remained essentially unchanged. |
| **Potential for harm (e.g., unsafe or ineffective therapies being used)** | Partially confirmed. A few RtT cases reported serious adverse events, but the total number of patients exposed was very small (< 50). No large‑scale safety crisis has been linked to RtT. |
| **Companies might exploit RtT to charge desperate patients for “cost‑only” drugs** | No documented widespread exploitation. Most companies declined RtT requests; the few that provided drugs did so at no charge or under a compassionate‑use‑style cost‑recovery model. |
| **RtT will lead to a “tragedy of the commons” that hampers controlled trials** | Not observed. The number of RtT uses has been too low to affect enrollment in formal trials. |
| **The law will be used by politicians as a political talking point** | Confirmed. The RtT Act is repeatedly referenced in campaign speeches and press releases, even though its practical impact is minimal. |
| **A “right to ask” would be a more accurate label** | The phrase has entered the public discourse, but the law remains officially titled “Right‑to‑Try.” |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a clear, well‑argued snapshot of a policy debate that continues to be relevant, but the subsequent experience with the law has been limited in scope, making the piece more of historical interest than a source of ongoing scientific insight.
