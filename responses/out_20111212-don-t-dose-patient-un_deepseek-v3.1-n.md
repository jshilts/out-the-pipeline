# Don't Dose That Patient Until You Pay Up (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the Supreme Court case *Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories*, which was hearing oral arguments in December 2011. Prometheus Laboratories held a patent claiming a method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy by administering a drug (6-thioguanine) to treat immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders and then determining blood levels of the drug to guide subsequent dosing decisions. Specifically, the patent claimed that levels below 230 pmol per 8×10⁸ red blood cells indicated need to increase dosage, while levels above 400 pmol indicated need to decrease dosage.

The author expresses strong concern that this represents an "awful idea" - what Prometheus essentially patented was the process of using a blood test to make medical treatment decisions. They did not discover the disease, the drug, or its therapeutic benefits, but rather claimed ownership over the diagnostic process itself. The article warns that if such medical diagnostic processes become patentable, it could create a "vast thicket of exclusive rights" that would restrict physicians' ability to practice medicine based on scientific literature without paying licensing fees, drawing parallels to the problematic expansion of software and business-method patents.

## 2. HISTORY
The Supreme Court issued its decision on March 20, 2012, ruling **unanimously (9-0) in favor of Mayo Clinic**. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion, which held that Prometheus's patent claims were invalid because they covered laws of nature, which are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101.

The Court found that the patent claims simply described the relationship between blood metabolite levels and drug efficacy - a natural phenomenon - and added only "well-understood, routine, conventional activity" around administering the drug and testing blood, which was insufficient to make an unpatentable natural law into a patentable invention. The Court emphasized that allowing such patents would improperly monopolize basic scientific and medical knowledge.

This landmark decision had **immediate and widespread impact**:

**Clinical Practice**: Following the decision, physicians and laboratories could freely use metabolite testing to guide thiopurine drug dosing without fear of patent infringement. Similar diagnostic patents became vulnerable to challenge, freeing up medical practice from licensing restrictions.

**Subsequent Cases**: The *Mayo* decision became foundational for subsequent important cases. In 2013's *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics*, the Supreme Court cited *Mayo* while ruling that naturally occurring DNA sequences were not patentable (though synthetic cDNA could be). In 2014's *Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank*, the Court extended *Mayo*'s reasoning to software patents, establishing the two-step "Mayo/Alice test" that has invalidated thousands of software patents.

**Industry Impact**: Diagnostic companies had to fundamentally rethink their patent strategies, as pure diagnostic method claims became extremely difficult to defend. Companies like Prometheus Laboratories faced significant challenges to their patent portfolios, though they continued operating in the diagnostics space with different business models.

The decision did **not** eliminate all diagnostic patents - those incorporating novel technological elements beyond natural correlations still survived. However, it established crucial boundaries that prevented the "vast thicket of exclusive rights" that the article's author and the AMA had feared.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**• Prediction: The Supreme Court might recoil from broader patent eligibility questions and decide the case on narrow grounds, "kicking the issue a few years into the future"**

**Reality**: The Court did the opposite - it issued a sweeping unanimous decision that established broad principles about patent eligibility of natural laws and diagnostic methods, making this one of the most important patent cases in decades rather than kicking the can down the road.

**• Prediction: Justice Breyer would be a "key player" in the eventual opinion**

**Reality**: This was accurate - Justice Breyer not only wrote the unanimous majority opinion but during oral arguments had indeed been the most active questioner, demonstrating his central role in shaping the Court's analysis.

**• Implicit prediction: If diagnostic processes become patentable, it would create problematic restrictions on medical practice and widespread litigation**

**Reality**: The Court's decision prevented this outcome. While some diagnostic patents still exist, the *Mayo* framework significantly curtailed the ability to patent pure diagnostic correlations, avoiding the scenario where physicians would need licensing to practice medicine using their knowledge of natural biological relationships.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8/9**

This article discussed what became one of the most important patent law decisions of the 21st century, whose legal framework now governs all diagnostic method patents and profoundly impacts medical innovation and practice.
