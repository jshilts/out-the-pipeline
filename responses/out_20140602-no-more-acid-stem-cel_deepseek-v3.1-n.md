# Article Title (Month Year)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the collapse of the "acid-washed stem cells" research from June 2014. Researchers had claimed that mature cells could be converted into stem cells simply by bathing them in acid or applying physical stress – something dubbed "Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency" (STAP). Two papers published earlier that year by Haruko Obokata and colleagues were central to these claims.

By June 2014, the research was collapsing under scrutiny. The second key paper was being retracted, with senior author Teruhiko Wakayama stating he no longer believed its results. Investigation by Riken (Obokata's institution) had already found misconduct in the first paper, including falsified gel electrophoresis images and fabricated evidence that resulting STAP cells could form different tissue types. Additional problems in the second paper involved duplicated photos purporting to show different placentas. The author expresses bewilderment at why a scientist would commit such obvious fraud.

## 2. HISTORY
I do not have high confidence in the specific post-2014 outcomes for all individuals and institutions involved in this STAP cell case, nor reliable memorization of FDA approvals or specific drugs related to this work. The core scientific claims were definitively debunked shortly after publication. The STAP cell phenomenon became one of the most prominent scientific fraud cases of the decade, but the specific career trajectories, institutional reforms, and any broader policy changes require verification I cannot provide confidently.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
I cannot identify specific predictions in this article beyond the author's implication that the research would be proven fraudulent. These expectations were clearly fulfilled as the papers were retracted and misconduct findings were confirmed.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article captures a watershed moment in scientific integrity – one of the most dramatic fraud cases in modern biology with lasting ripple effects for stem-cell research oversight.
