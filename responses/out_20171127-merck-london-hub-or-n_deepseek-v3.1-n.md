# Merck In London - A Hub, or Not?
## November 2017

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses Merck's announcement of a new £1.3 billion research hub in London with 950 staff members, positioned in the context of Brexit developments where the European Medicines Agency was relocating to Amsterdam. The article questions whether the frequently mentioned "London-Oxford-Cambridge hub" truly functions as a cohesive biopharma cluster. Derek Lowe raises skepticism about treating these three geographically distinct cities (London, Oxford, Cambridge) as a single integrated hub, noting their cultural differences and significant physical separation that would make daily commuting impractical between them. The piece draws comparisons to the San Francisco Bay Area's distributed tech hub while seeking input from UK readers about whether this three-city concept represents reality or aspiration.

## 2. HISTORY
The Merck London research hub was established as announced, contributing to the UK's life sciences sector during a period of uncertainty following the Brexit vote. The subsequent years saw mixed developments for UK biopharma:

- **Merck's facility became operational**, providing a significant research presence
- **European Medicines Agency** did relocate from London to Amsterdam by March 2019, taking approximately 900 jobs out of London
- **Brexit's broader impact** on UK biopharma has been complex, with concerns about regulatory alignment, talent access, and research collaboration affecting the sector
- **Life sciences investment** in the UK continued, though with some volatility related to political uncertainty
- **Actual commuting patterns** between London, Oxford, and Cambridge never developed into routine daily practice due to the distances involved (typically 60-100 miles between the three vertices)

The article's central premise proved largely accurate - these three cities remained distinct centers rather than evolving into a single integrated commuting hub.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: That daily commuting between London, Oxford, and Cambridge would be impractical due to physical distances
  - **Actual outcome**: Correct. The three cities remained separate employment markets without developing significant cross-commuting patterns
- **Prediction**: That Merck's investment would be welcomed by the UK government given EMA's departure
  - **Actual outcome**: Correct, though the broader Brexit context created ongoing challenges for talent recruitment and EU collaboration
- **Prediction**: That the "London-Oxford-Cambridge hub" concept might be more aspirational than functional
  - **Actual outcome**: Largely vindicated. While all three cities maintained strong biopharma sectors, they didn't functionally integrate into a single labor market the way Bay Area tech hubs did
- **Prediction**: That Merck's choice of London over Cambridge was notable given Cambridge's biopharma boom
  - **Actual outcome**: Both cities continued to attract life sciences investment, suggesting the market supported multiple strong centers rather than a single concentrated hub

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

The article captured an interesting moment in UK biopharma regional development and accurately questioned the feasibility of distant city integration, but the topic's impact remained limited to UK-specific life sciences geography rather than broader scientific breakthrough or therapeutic innovation.
