# DUCTS: Down with Useless Clinical Trial acronymS (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article criticizes the proliferation of promotional and frequently meaningless acronyms used to name clinical trials. The author notes that acronym inflation has been a long-standing issue, citing as early as 2003 when sixteen different cardiovascular trials all used the acronym HEART. The piece highlights that many trials are named with "jazzy" titles first, with a sensible acronym constructed only afterward, including an Acronym Generator based at a cardiac hospital unit in Liverpool. The author proposes that regulatory bodies like the FDA should require sponsors to adopt plainer naming conventions—such as "Kevorkirol Efficacy Trial #1"—to improve clarity and reduce confusion. The central argument is that descriptive, sequential naming would help scientists and clinicians keep studies straight without needing charts to decipher opaque trial acronyms.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the article's publication, the problem of opaque and duplicative trial acronyms has persisted and may have intensified. Regulatory and professional bodies have implemented changes that affect trial identification, but they have generally stopped short of mandating plainer names. Among the key developments:

- **Clinical trial registration and transparency**: The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 already required registration on ClinicalTrials.gov, but subsequent enforcement and expanded reporting have made protocol details and plain-text descriptions more accessible. While this does not eliminate promotional acronyms, it enables users to find trials even when acronyms are unhelpful, via structured searches by intervention, condition, and sponsor.

- **Regulatory guidance and nomenclature**: Neither the FDA nor the EMA adopted binding rules to "tone down" promotional acronyms. Instead, they focus on standardization of trial identifiers (e.g., NCT numbers on ClinicalTrials.gov, EudraCT numbers in Europe) and structured protocol elements. The FDA's guidance on protocol content and the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice standards address clarity and traceability, but they do not constrain naming beyond ensuring that titles are not false or misleading.

- **Al consolidation and search**: The rise of systematic review platforms, meta-analytic tools, and semantic search capabilities (e.g., Cochrane, Trip Database, later Al-driven aggregators) has partially mitigated confusion by allowing users to locate trials by inclusion criteria rather than acronym recall. PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov enhancements now facilitate filtering by sponsor, phase, and outcome, reducing reliance on memorizing acronyms to compare studies.

- **Continued acronym proliferation**: High-profile programs continued to employ "jazzy" names. For example, oncology saw trials such as CheckMate, KEYNOTE, and IM passion (often stylized in mixed case or with embedded brand elements). These names serve marketing purposes and occasionally enter medical lexicon shorthand. Duplication and ambiguity remain common, with acronyms like ACE/ACCORD/ASCEND appearing across cardiovascular and diabetes research, often for distinct interventions or populations.

- **Public and media perception**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, prominent trial names such as RECOVERY, SOLIDARITY, and COVt) became widely known. While these are often evocative rather than cryptic, public-health emergencies highlighted both the benefits of memorable names for public communication and the risks of oversimplification if the name conveys more certainty than the evidence warrants.

- **Industry and academic behavior**: Sponsors continue to use trial acronyms as part of branding, particularly for large, multi-trial programs. Sequential identifiers like "Study 301/302" are sometimes used within company pipelines, but public-facing names often retain promotional acronyms to build recognition. Some academic consortia have adopted more descriptive naming (e.g., adding qualifiers like "-HF" for heart failure), but this is inconsistent.

Overall, the author's proposal for mandatory plain names did not materialize. Instead, clinical research ecosystems have relied on registration databases, structured metadata, and search tools to manage complexity. Acronyms remain prevalent for marketing and recognition, but improved indexing and reporting have provided practical workarounds to the confusion the author described.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit, dated predictions about future events. However, it posed a hypothetical normative suggestion:
- **Prediction/implication**: If regulators required simpler, descriptive naming (such as "Kevorkirol Efficacy Trial #1"), it would help people keep studies straight and reduce confusion.
  - **What actually happened**: Regulatory bodies did not impose rules to force plain, sequential names. FDA and EMA guidance focused on transparency (registration, results reporting) and prevention of misleading titles, but they did not forbid promotional acronyms. As a result, promotional naming persisted in many high-profile programs. However, registry databases and search tools evolved to offset confusion, enabling users to discover and compare trials without relying on memorable acronyms. While the author's proposed mandate did not occur, the practical problem of confusion has been partly mitigated through better access to structured trial information.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

This is a well-argued opinion piece that highlights an ongoing issue in clinical research communication, but its scope, impact, and novelty are modest. The problem of confusing trial acronyms persists, while solutions have come from registries and search tools rather than the author's proposed regulatory mandate.
