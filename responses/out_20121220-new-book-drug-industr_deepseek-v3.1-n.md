# A New Book on the Drug Industry And Its Image (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

John LaMattina, former head of Pfizer's global R&D, published a book titled "Devalued and Distrusted," which he framed as a sequel to his earlier work "Drug Truths." LaMattina was motivated to write this book after appearing on "The Dr. Oz Show," where he found himself as the lone representative from the pharmaceutical industry facing "standard attacks" including claims that drug companies invent diseases, push unnecessary medications, and hide information from the public. The author of the blog post expresses concern about pervasive public ignorance and distrust toward the pharmaceutical industry, noting that some of this skepticism is "willful." The commentary suggests that while both pharmaceutical companies and their critics have commercial interests (drug companies selling medications; critics selling books, supplements, or consulting services), pharmaceutical companies ultimately deliver "net positive results" despite some negative aspects. The author advocates for better public education about the drug discovery and development process as the primary way to counter negative perceptions.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following publication, LaMattina has remained active as a vocal industry advocate and commentator. He has authored additional books: "Pharma and Profits: Balancing Innovation, Medicine, and Drug Prices" (2015) and "The Pharma Factor: Addressing the High Cost of Prescription Drugs" (2019), continuing his work to influence public discourse. The scrutiny LaMattina faced on "The Dr. Oz Show" foreshadowed broader trends: pharmaceutical pricing became a major political issue during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. elections, with Medicare price negotiation provisions eventually included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented paradox: while vaccines were developed at remarkable speed, public trust in pharmaceutical companies became increasingly polarized—Pfizer and Moderna vaccines achieved widespread global distribution, yet vaccine hesitancy and misinformation proliferated. The industry also benefited from Operation Warp Speed funding while facing scrutiny over vaccine profits and intellectual property rights. 

Pharmaceutical companies continued developing innovative drugs for previously untreatable conditions: gene therapies for rare diseases received FDA approval (including Luxturna in 2017 for inherited retinal disease), and breakthrough cancer immunotherapies entered the market. However, drug price controversies intensified, with Martin Shkreli's 2015 price hike for Daraprim becoming a national scandal and ongoing scrutiny of insulin pricing leading to the Inflation Reduction Act's $35 monthly cap for Medicare beneficiaries in 2023. The industry maintained its research productivity challenges: FDA approved 59 novel drugs in 2018, but research and development costs remained high, with estimates still exceeding $1 billion per drug. Public trust has remained split, with the pharmaceutical industry's reputation improving among some demographics during the pandemic while declining among others: Gallup polling showed pharmaceutical industry favorability at 40% in August 2021, up from 27% in 2019, but still below most other industries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

None of the predictions in this article were clearly articulated. The author characterizes the "ignorance out there (some of which is willful) is thick, deep, and dense" and suggests that "the best way to do that, I think, is still to try to help people to understand what it's like to actually discover and develop a drug" as a strategy for improving the industry's reputation. Neither of these met with success: misinformation about pharmaceutical companies has grown more extensive and sophisticated (particularly around COVID-19 vaccines), and despite LaMattina's continued efforts and broader industry advocacy, public understanding of drug development has not substantially improved as a mechanism for addressing concerns about affordability and access.

## 4. INTEREST

**6/9**

This analysis is moderately interesting when reviewed with a decade's hindsight, primarily due to how the themes articulated in 2012 presaged later developments around pharmaceutical industry public perception, drug pricing controversies, and the complex intersection of science communication and commercial interests that became prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
