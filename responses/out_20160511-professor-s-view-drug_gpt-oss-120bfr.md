# A Professor's View On Drug Company Collaborations (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece reproduces an email from a senior organic‑chemistry professor who, in 2016, lamented the shrinking opportunities for academic‑industry partnerships in medicinal chemistry. He notes several trends he had observed:

* **Natural‑product focus fading.** Historically, pharma’s “central research” groups pursued complex natural‑product families (e.g., macrolides, corticosteroids) and maintained long‑term ties with university labs. By 2016, companies were asking academics mainly for “new scaffolds” that could be slotted into high‑throughput screens, a shift that, in his view, discouraged the development of new synthetic methodology.  

* **Automation and outsourcing.** The rise of automated synthesis platforms and the outsourcing of scaffold synthesis to contract labs in China/India reduced the number of reactions that medicinal chemists deemed “useful.” At the same time, the need for **late‑stage functionalisation** (C–H activation, Minisci‑type radical chemistry) was growing, potentially opening new collaborative niches.  

* **Process‑vs‑discovery chemistry.** Process chemists still encountered genuine methodological gaps, whereas discovery chemists tended to design only what they could already make, limiting the demand for academic breakthroughs.  

* **Loss of “central research” labs.** The professor bemoaned the disappearance of internal, discovery‑oriented research groups at diversified firms such as DuPont, arguing that they provided a broad view of chemistry and acted as a bridge to academia.  

* **Small‑molecule relevance.** He questioned whether the expanding importance of biologics (antibodies, RNA‑based therapies) was eroding pharma’s appetite for collaborations with “hard‑core” organic chemists.

The author of the blog post adds his own perspective, agreeing on many points while noting that automation has so far impacted compound handling more than synthetic creativity, and that small‑molecule chemistry remains a major part of the drug pipeline.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Decline of Traditional Central Research Labs  
- **Industry restructuring (2016‑2022).** Most large, diversified chemical companies (e.g., DuPont, Dow, BASF) either spun off or shuttered their internal “central research” units. By 2020, only a handful of legacy pharma (e.g., Pfizer’s **Centres for Therapeutic Innovation**, Merck’s **Discovery Chemistry** group) retained sizable, discovery‑focused chemistry labs.  
- **Shift to “open‑innovation” models.** Companies increasingly rely on external collaborations, venture‑backed biotech startups, and university‑based drug‑discovery centers (e.g., **Broad Institute**, **MIT‑Harvard Center for Chemical Biology**). Funding is often channeled through **pharma‑sponsored research programs** (e.g., Novartis **Medicines for All**, Roche **Partnering Grants**) rather than internal labs.  

### Natural‑Product‑Inspired Programs  
- **Continued, but more targeted.** While the broad, “natural‑product‑scaffold‑generation” programs have contracted, several pharma groups launched focused **natural‑product‑derived libraries** (e.g., GSK’s **NP‑Inspired Collection**, Pfizer’s **Natural‑Product‑Inspired (NPI) library**) that are screened alongside synthetic collections. These efforts are typically run in partnership with academic groups specializing in complex synthesis.  
- **Success stories.** The **macrolide antibiotic solithromycin** (approved 2016) and **novel β‑lactamase inhibitors** (e.g., avibactam, approved 2015) illustrate that natural‑product‑derived chemistry can still reach market, though such cases remain relatively rare.  

### Late‑Stage Functionalisation & C–H Activation  
- **Commercial adoption.** By 2023, **late‑stage C–H functionalisation** had become a routine tool in several pharma discovery chemistry teams. Pfizer, Merck, and AstraZeneca each reported internal platforms that enable rapid diversification of lead‑like molecules (e.g., **Pfizer’s “Late‑Stage Functionalisation (LSF) Platform”**).  
- **Academic‑industry collaborations.** The rise of **C–H activation consortia** (e.g., the **C–H Activation for Drug Discovery (CHADD) Initiative**, funded jointly by the NIH and several pharma partners) has produced dozens of joint publications and several patents on scalable C–H functionalisation methods.  

### Automation, AI‑Driven Synthesis Planning, and Outsourcing  
- **Automation progress.** High‑throughput flow reactors (e.g., **MIT’s “Chemputer”**, **Merck’s “ChemSpeed”**) have been integrated into early‑discovery labs, but the number of *novel* reactions they can execute autonomously remains limited to a core set of cross‑couplings, amide formations, and a few photoredox transformations.  
- **AI synthesis planning.** Tools such as **IBM RXN**, **Chematica/Synthia**, and **DeepChem** have been adopted for route scouting, but most pharma teams still treat them as *idea generators* rather than production‑ready planners.  
- **Outsourcing trends.** The reliance on contract research organisations (CROs) in China and India for **scaffold synthesis** has continued, with the market for “synthetic chemistry services” growing at ~8 % CAGR (2020‑2025). This has not eliminated the need for academic expertise in **method development**; rather, it has shifted the collaboration model toward *project‑specific* service contracts.  

### Small‑Molecule vs. Biologics Market Share  
- **Sales data (2020‑2024).** Small‑molecule drugs still account for roughly **65‑70 %** of the top‑100 global drug sales, while biologics (antibodies, ADCs, RNA therapeutics) represent ~30 %. The absolute revenue of biologics has risen, but the *relative* share of small molecules has remained stable.  
- **Pipeline composition.** In 2023, **~55 %** of IND‑enabling candidates in major pharma pipelines were small molecules, with the remainder split among antibodies, gene‑therapy vectors, and oligonucleotides.  

### Overall Impact on Academic Collaboration  
- **Funding mechanisms.** The **NIH’s NCATS** and **EU’s Horizon Europe** have funded many **public‑private partnership (PPP)** projects that explicitly target methodology development (e.g., **“Catalysis for Medicine”**).  
- **Start‑up ecosystem.** A surge of chemistry‑focused start‑ups (e.g., **Bicycle Therapeutics**, **Enamine**, **Molecule Maker**) has created new avenues for academics to spin out technologies and receive venture‑backed pharma partnerships.  
- **Policy changes.** The 2022 **U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act** introduced a “research‑related tax credit” that incentivised some companies to retain modest internal chemistry groups, but the effect has been modest compared with the broader trend toward externalisation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 email / blog) | What actually happened (2024‑2025) |
|---|---|
| **Natural‑product‑centric collaborations will dwindle** | Largely true. Broad, open‑ended natural‑product programs have contracted, but *targeted* natural‑product‑inspired libraries remain funded, often via academic partnerships. |
| **Automation will limit the number of reactions useful to medicinal chemists** | Partially true. Automation has streamlined *execution* of a core set of reactions (cross‑couplings, amide bonds) but has **not** eliminated the need for novel methodology; instead, it has highlighted gaps (e.g., scalable C–H activation) that academia is filling. |
| **Outsourcing of scaffold synthesis to China/India will increase** | Accurate. CRO revenue for synthetic services grew ~8 % per year (2020‑2025), and many pharma discovery teams now treat external synthesis as the default route for non‑core scaffolds. |
| **Late‑stage functionalisation (C–H, Minisci) will revive long‑term collaborations** | Confirmed. Multiple pharma‑academic consortia on C–H activation launched between 2018‑2022, leading to patented methods now used in lead optimisation programs. |
| **Central research labs will disappear, harming long‑term chemistry innovation** | Largely correct. Most diversified chemical firms eliminated large central labs; however, *new* “innovation hubs” (e.g., Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research) have partially filled the role, though they are smaller and more project‑focused. |
| **Small molecules will become less important, reducing demand for organic chemists** | Overstated. Small‑molecule sales and pipeline presence have remained robust; the *pie* has grown with biologics, but the *slice* for small molecules has not dramatically shrunk. Demand for synthetic expertise persists, especially for complex, chiral, or heterocyclic scaffolds. |
| **The pendulum will swing back to favour organic synthesis** | Ongoing. While the “pendulum” metaphor is debated, the rise of AI‑guided synthesis, flow chemistry, and C–H functionalisation suggests a renewed appreciation for innovative synthetic methods, albeit within a more collaborative, outsourced ecosystem. |
