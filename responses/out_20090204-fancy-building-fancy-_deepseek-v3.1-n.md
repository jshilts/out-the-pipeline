# Fancy Building, Fancy Science? (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques the new biochemistry building at Oxford University, which was designed with an emphasis on open architecture to foster researcher communication. The building features labs on the outside with clear glass walls, a five-storey atrium, and commissioned artworks. The author expresses skepticism about whether such architectural features actually improve scientific productivity, drawing on personal experience in similarly designed corporate buildings that failed to enhance interaction. The piece questions whether money spent on artwork and fancy design provides any measurable return in scientific discovery, and suggests that practical laboratory details (bench size, equipment placement) matter more than grand architectural gestures. The author argues that forcing interaction through building design is difficult and that there may be a trade-off between convenience and interaction.

## 2. HISTORY

The skepticism expressed in this 2009 article reflects a broader debate about laboratory architecture that has continued. In the subsequent decade and a half, there have been no landmark studies definitively proving that specific architectural features alone significantly boost scientific productivity or discovery rates. Various institutions have continued experimenting with open-plan lab designs, but concerns about distractions, lack of privacy, and practical functionality persist.

The 2010s saw mixed outcomes for large-scale research facility investments. Many universities and companies continued building new research facilities with similar design philosophies, but reviews have been mixed. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, open-plan concepts faced challenges as physical distancing became necessary, potentially increasing appreciation for traditional lab layouts with better separation.

There is no evidence that large studies were conducted comparing output between buildings with elaborate artwork versus those without, making it impossible to determine whether such investments yielded returns in scientific discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: The artworks in the building would gradually become invisible to daily occupants and only affect visitors.**
- Outcome: This aligns with established psychological principles of habituation. People generally adapt to their environment and notice novel elements less over time, though the artwork aspect cannot be definitively verified without specific data from the building's occupants.

**Prediction: Practical details (bench size, hoods, electrical outlets, sinks) would matter more than grand design schemes for productivity.**
- Outcome: This prediction has held true across the industry. Laboratory design success continues to depend heavily on functional ergonomics and workflow efficiency over purely aesthetic or social-interaction-focused elements.

**Prediction: Forced interaction through building design has limited effectiveness and may conflict with convenience.**
- Outcome: This caution has proven wise. While collaborative spaces remain important in research design, the effectiveness of specific architectural interventions for forcing interaction remains controversial and difficult to measure objectively.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While thoughtfully skeptical about architectural hype, the article addresses a relatively narrow and speculative topic with limited broader scientific or policy implications. The discussion applies to laboratory management and design but doesn't engage with fundamental questions in biotechnology or biomedical research that would have lasting importance.
