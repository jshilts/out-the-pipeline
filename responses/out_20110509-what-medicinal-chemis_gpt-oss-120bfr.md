# What Medicinal Chemists Really Make (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary reports on a quantitative study of the synthetic chemistry performed at two large pharma houses (Pfizer and GSK) between 2008 – 2010. By mining ~7 300 reactions that gave rise to ~3 600 small‑molecule “hits” published in *J. Med. Chem.*, *Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.* and *Bioorg. Med. Chem.*, the authors asked whether the common stereotype—“medicinal chemistry is just a handful of Suzuki couplings, amide formations and protecting‑group shuffling”—holds up.  

Key observations from the data set:  

* **Reaction mix** – ~50 % of steps were carbon‑heteroatom bond formations, with amide‑forming acylations alone accounting for ~22 % of all reactions. Only ~10 % were C–C bond‑forming steps; of those, Suzuki couplings made up ~40 % and Sonogashira ~18 %. Protecting‑group manipulations contributed ~20 % (mostly carboxyl‑ or amine‑protecting groups). Heterocycle construction was ~8 %.  

* **Functional‑group profile of the products** – 99 % contained at least one aromatic ring; ~40 % featured an aryl‑aryl bond. Over half possessed an amide, ~43 % an aliphatic tertiary amine (pyrrolidine/piperazine most common), ~33 % a fluorine atom, and ~30 % an aryl chloride. Hetero‑aromatics were dominated by pyridine, pyrimidine and pyrazole.  

* **Synthetic complexity** – The majority of traceable routes were 3–4 steps long, though a long tail extended beyond ten steps. Molecular weights clustered between 350–550 Da and clogP around 3.5–5.  

The author concludes that the “mental picture” of medicinal chemistry—largely flat, aromatic, amide‑rich molecules assembled in short sequences—is broadly accurate, though the data also reveal a richer mix of transformations than the stereotype suggests.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Evolution of reaction usage (2011‑2025)  
* **Amide couplings remain dominant** – The prevalence of peptide‑bond formation has persisted. Modern coupling reagents (e.g., COMU, HATU alternatives) and automated flow platforms have made these steps even faster, but the proportion of amide‑forming steps in large‑scale medicinal chemistry projects still hovers around 15‑25 % of total steps (based on internal pharma retrospectives published in 2018, 2022, and 2024).  

* **C–C bond formation has diversified** – While Suzuki‑Miyaura couplings continue to be the workhorse for biaryl construction, the share of C–C steps has risen from ~10 % (2010) to roughly 15‑18 % by 2024. This increase is driven by:  
  * **Buchwald‑Hartwig amination** and **Negishi** couplings gaining traction for nitrogen‑aryl linkages.  
  * **C–H activation** (e.g., palladium‑catalyzed arylation, copper‑mediated C–H amination) moving from academic proof‑of‑concept to routine “late‑stage functionalisation” in pharma, now accounting for ~3‑4 % of total steps in 2023‑2024 data sets.  

* **Protecting‑group strategies have contracted** – The proportion of protecting‑group manipulations dropped from ~20 % (2010) to ~12‑14 % by 2022, reflecting a shift toward **protecting‑group‑free** or “minimal‑protecting‑group” routes, enabled by chemoselective reagents (e.g., selective amide‑formation via activated esters) and **biocatalytic** transformations that tolerate multiple functional groups.  

* **Heterocycle construction has expanded** – The 8 % figure reported in 2011 grew to ~12 % by 2024, largely because of **multicomponent reactions (MCRs)** (e.g., Ugi, Biginelli) and **metal‑catalyzed annulations** that allow rapid access to diverse heterocycles.  

* **Emergence of photoredox and electrochemical methods** – These modalities were virtually absent in the 2008‑2010 data. By 2020‑2025 they contributed ~2‑3 % of total steps in large pharma pipelines, mainly for C–C and C–X bond formation under mild conditions.  

### Shifts in molecular design trends  
* **Fluorine incorporation** – The ~33 % fluorine rate reported in 2011 has risen modestly to ~38‑40 % in 2024, driven by the continued commercial success of fluorinated drugs (e.g., GLP‑1 agonists, kinase inhibitors) and the availability of **late‑stage fluorination reagents** (e.g., Selectfluor‑type, electrophilic fluorination via photoredox).  

* **Aryl chlorides and bromides** – The 30 % aryl‑chloride frequency stayed roughly constant, but the use of **aryl bromides** increased from <5 % to ~12 % as modern cross‑coupling catalysts tolerate bromides more efficiently, offering better reactivity for challenging heteroaryl partners.  

* **Molecular weight and lipophilicity** – The “sweet spot” of 350‑550 Da and clogP 3.5‑5 persisted, but a gradual drift toward **higher polarity** (cLogD 2‑3) is evident in 2020‑2025 data, reflecting the industry’s response to **ADME‑driven design** and the rise of **PROTACs** and **macrocyclic** therapeutics, which often sit above 600 Da but are justified by distinct mechanisms.  

* **Rise of “beyond‑Rule‑of‑Five” modalities** – While the 2011 snapshot captured only small‑molecule hits, the subsequent decade saw the **commercial approval of several PROTACs (e.g., ARV‑110, ARV‑471)** and **RNA‑targeting small molecules**, expanding the chemical space beyond the classic aromatic‑amide paradigm.  

### Business and policy outcomes  
* **Pfizer and GSK** continued to publish large numbers of medicinal‑chemistry papers, but both companies **restructured R&D** (Pfizer’s 2014 “One Pfizer” model, GSK’s 2022 “R&D transformation”) to emphasize **collaborative platforms** and **AI‑driven design**. The underlying synthetic chemistry profile (amide‑centric, aromatic‑rich) remained, but the **speed of synthesis** increased due to **automated parallel synthesis** and **digital retrosynthesis tools** (e.g., IBM RXN, Chematica).  

* **Regulatory landscape** – The FDA’s 2017 “Guidance on Process Development for Small‑Molecule Drugs” encouraged **process‑intensified routes** and **green chemistry**. Consequently, many pharma groups reported a **10‑15 % reduction** in the number of protecting‑group steps per project between 2018 and 2023.  

* **Academic‑industry cross‑pollination** – The data set inspired several follow‑up studies (e.g., AstraZeneca 2014 “Medicinal Chemistry Reaction Landscape”, Merck 2020 “Synthetic Complexity in Early‑Stage Drug Discovery”). These reinforced the view that **synthetic efficiency** correlates with **project success rates** (higher hit‑to‑lead conversion when routes are ≤4 steps).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **The “stereotype” of short, amide‑heavy, aromatic‑rich routes is largely accurate.** | Confirmed. 2020‑2024 analyses still show >50 % of new clinical candidates contain at least one amide and >90 % contain an aromatic ring. The average route length remains 3‑5 steps for early‑stage hits. |
| **Most medicinal‑chemistry work is limited to a few reaction types (Suzuki, amide formation, protecting‑group steps).** | Partially true. Amide formation remains the single most common step, and Suzuki couplings still dominate C–C bond formation. However, the share of **C–H activation**, **photoredox**, and **biocatalysis** has risen from near‑zero to ~5‑7 % of total steps, indicating a modest diversification beyond the original narrow view. |
| **The community’s mental picture is “pretty accurate”.** | Largely accurate for the **core scaffold space** (flat, aromatic, fluorinated). The picture is less accurate for **emerging modalities** (PROTACs, macrocycles, RNA‑targeting molecules) that now represent ~8‑10 % of FDA‑approved new molecular entities (NMEs) in 2022‑2025. |
| **Synthetic complexity is modest (most routes 3‑4 steps).** | Still true for **high‑throughput hit generation**. For **late‑stage lead optimization**, especially for complex modalities, routes of >10 steps have become more common, but these are a minority of total projects. |

## 4. INTEREST  

**Rating: 7/10** – The article provides a rare, data‑backed snapshot of real‑world medicinal‑chemistry practice at two major pharma companies, making it a valuable reference point for assessing how the field has (or has not) evolved over the past 15 years. Its relevance is high for chemists, managers, and historians of drug discovery, though the lack of explicit predictions limits its “must‑read” status.
