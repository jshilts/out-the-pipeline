# A Scientist's Resolutions (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a personal reflection from a research scientist setting New Year's resolutions for 2006. The author identifies four key areas for improvement: spending more productive time in the laboratory rather than hiding in the office, cleaning up cluttered lab workspace, using office time effectively without using the lab as procrastination, and pursuing high-risk, high-reward research ideas. The author confesses that fear of failure has been preventing progress on a multi-year research project - specifically, the anxiety that promising preliminary results might not generalize to something truly useful. The article encourages both the author and fellow researchers to take scientific risks and push through the psychological barrier of staying in the "almost-done" state rather than reaching definitive conclusions.

## 2. HISTORY

The article was published on Derek Lowe's popular pharmaceutical industry blog "In the Pipeline" on Corante.com. Lowe, a medicinal chemist with experience at major pharmaceutical companies, used this platform to provide insider perspectives on drug discovery. His blog became one of the most influential voices in pharmaceutical industry discourse, running continuously for nearly two decades before moving to Science magazine's platform. The personal, reflective tone exemplified in this article was characteristic of Lowe's writing style, which blended technical expertise with candid discussions of the psychological and practical challenges facing researchers.

The specific research project mentioned in the article was never publicly identified or concluded in subsequent blog posts - a common pattern in industrial research where promising early results often fail to translate into drug candidates. This reflects the broader context of pharmaceutical R&D during this period: the mid-2000s marked a challenging time for drug discovery, with R&D productivity declining industry-wide despite increasing investment. Many companies struggled with high failure rates, and researchers frequently faced the dilemma Lowe describes - whether to continue pursuing risky projects or abandon them.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Cognitive bias in research evaluation**: The author implicitly acknowledges the psychological tendency to avoid definitive answers that might disprove promising hypotheses. This reflects broader recognition of confirmation bias in scientific research. Subsequent methodological work in psychology and metascience has extensively documented these cognitive biases, leading to increased emphasis on preregistration of studies and replication efforts, though pharmaceutical research has been slower to adopt such reforms than academic psychology.

• **Productivity challenges in late-career researchers**: The author notes that avoiding lab work becomes easier with seniority. This observation aligns with broader patterns in academic and industrial research where senior scientists often transition to administrative or advisory roles. However, the pharmaceutical industry has since seen increased pressure on all levels to accelerate drug discovery timelines, potentially limiting the "hiding in the office" phenomenon described.

• **High-risk research as viable strategy**: The author advocates pursuing "low-percentage high-reward ideas" noting that not everyone has this privilege. This reflects the resource allocation challenges in pharmaceutical R&D. The subsequent two decades have seen mixed outcomes for high-risk approaches, with some companies achieving breakthrough success while others faced costly failures. The biotechnology sector has generally maintained appetite for such projects, as evidenced by continued venture investment in novel therapeutic modalities.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article has limited broader interest as it primarily serves as personal reflection rather than addressing significant industry developments or scientific advances. While it captures authentic researcher psychology, it lacks concrete predictions about biotechnology or specific insights that would inform understanding of major trends.
