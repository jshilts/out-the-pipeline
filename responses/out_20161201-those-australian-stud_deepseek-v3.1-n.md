# Those Australian Students And Their Daraprim (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses media hype surrounding Australian high school students who synthesized daraprim in a school laboratory. The author emphasizes that daraprim is not difficult to synthesize—any competent organic chemist could produce it following standard procedures—and that the students' achievement represented a routine educational exercise, not a scientific breakthrough. 

The article explains that drug pricing doesn't depend primarily on synthesis costs but rather on regulatory factors, particularly FDA generic drug approval processes that create loopholes exploited by manufacturers. Martin Shkreli's controversial price increase from $13.50 to $750 per pill was enabled by these regulatory failures, not by any technical difficulty in manufacturing the drug. The author clarifies that while laboratory synthesis is straightforward, actually selling a medication requires Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliance, extensive regulatory approval, and bioequivalence testing—standards that neither school labs nor academic facilities can meet.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Aftermath (2016-2017):** Imprimis Pharmaceuticals began offering a compounded version of pyrimethamine (daraprim's active ingredient) at $99 for 100 capsules, though this competed in a different regulatory category than FDA-approved generics. Multiple generic manufacturers filed applications with the FDA to produce daraprim, but none received immediate approval due to the agency's backlog and complex approval requirements for older drugs.

**Regulatory Developments (2017-2020):** The FDA prioritized review of daraprim generic applications under its Drug Competition Action Plan launched in 2017. In February 2020, the FDA approved the first generic version of daraprim from Cerovene, priced at $750 for 30 tablets—significantly lower than Turing's $75,000+ pricing but still far above the original $13.50 price point. The FDA's approval process took nearly four years after Shkreli's price increase became national news.

**Market Impact:** While generic competition eventually emerged, the episode exposed fundamental weaknesses in the FDA's generic drug approval system for drugs with limited competition. The incident contributed to ongoing policy discussions about preventing "generic drug gouging" and accelerating approvals when prices spike dramatically. However, the core regulatory framework that enabled the price increase remained largely intact.

**Shkreli's Legal Outcome:** In 2017, Martin Shkreli was convicted of securities fraud unrelated to daraprim pricing and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was also banned from the pharmaceutical industry for life. The daraprim price increase itself was legal under existing regulations, highlighting the author's point about regulatory failure rather than illegal activity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"as soon as the FDA gets off its rear about the way it handles generic drug applications and approvals, the problem will start to go away"** → The FDA did establish expedited review processes, but approval still took nearly four years (2016-2020). Generic competition eventually emerged but not quickly enough to prevent years of inflated prices.

• **"Until it does that, the problem never will [go away]"** → This proved accurate—prices remained high until generic approval occurred. The fundamental regulatory vulnerabilities persisted after this specific case resolved.

• **Implicit prediction that media misunderstanding would continue** → Accurate; similar narratives about "garage labs" solving drug pricing continued appearing in coverage of insulin, EpiPen alternatives, and other medications, often missing the same regulatory complexity points.

• **Implicit prediction that regulatory framework would remain problematic** → Partially accurate; while some improvements occurred, the fundamental issues with generic drug market entry barriers and FDA approval timelines for older drugs remained contentious through 2024.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrates clear understanding of pharmaceutical manufacturing, regulatory realities, and media sensationalism. While focused on a specific incident, it identifies structural issues in generic drug regulation that remained relevant in subsequent years with similar pricing controversies involving other medications. The author's distinction between laboratory synthesis feasibility and actual drug approval requirements provides enduring insight into pharmaceutical economics and policy challenges.
