# Turmoil in Immuno-oncology

## 1. SUMMARY

This May 2017 article describes how immuno-oncology (IO) had fundamentally reshaped cancer drug development strategy, forcing companies to either compete directly in IO targets, complement existing IO therapies, or pursue indications resistant to immunotherapy. The piece focuses on a major clinical setback for Roche's PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab), which failed its Phase III bladder cancer trial despite having received accelerated FDA approval based on Phase II data.

The article highlights the competitive landscape in bladder cancer, where multiple PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were approved or under review (Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, Pfizer/Merck KGaA's Bavencio, Merck's Keytruda, and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi). The author notes that while these drugs show tumor response, the critical question remains whether this translates to improved overall survival—the "real currency" in oncology.

Additionally, the article discusses a concerning Science Translational Medicine study revealing that PD-1 antibodies are rapidly transferred from T cells to macrophages within 30 minutes via Fc/FcγR interactions, potentially limiting drug exposure at the intended target site, though this transfer mechanism might also be leveraged to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent years after this article's publication saw significant developments in the IO space that largely validated the author's analysis while also providing important clarifications:

**Tecentriq's Bladder Cancer Journey**: In March 2021, Roche voluntarily withdrew Tecentriq's bladder cancer indication after confirmatory trials failed to meet primary endpoints. However, Tecentriq found major success in other indications, particularly first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (approved 2019) and as adjuvant therapy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (2021), becoming the first IO drug approved in the adjuvant lung cancer setting.

**PD-1/PD-L1 Class Evolution**: The competitive landscape evolved with PD-1 inhibitors (Keytruda, Opdivo) generally demonstrating broader and more durable success than PD-L1 inhibitors across multiple indications. By 2024, Keytruda had become the world's top-selling drug, approved for over 30 indications including various combinations and adjuvant/neoadjuvant settings. The predicted differences between targeting PD-1 versus PD-L1 did emerge, with PD-1 inhibitors showing advantages in certain tumor types.

**Bladder Cancer IO Landscape**: In urothelial carcinoma specifically, the treatment paradigm shifted significantly. Keytruda eventually gained approval as first-line treatment for patients ineligible for cisplatin chemotherapy (2017) and as second-line therapy, while other agents faced challenges. The FDA did become more cautious about accelerated approvals, requiring more robust overall survival data and in some cases restricting use to biomarker-selected populations.

**Fc Receptor Biology Insights**: The mechanism of FcγR-mediated antibody transfer to macrophages continued to be studied extensively. This led to development of engineered antibodies with optimized Fc regions to either enhance or reduce FcγR interactions depending on therapeutic goals, though clinical implementation remained limited to specific contexts rather than becoming a universal design principle for IO antibodies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **PD-L1 Antibodies Face Challenges**: The article correctly anticipated that PD-L1 inhibitors like Tecentriq would struggle in bladder cancer relative to PD-1 inhibitors. **Outcome**: Accurate—several PD-L1 inhibitors either withdrew from bladder cancer or achieved only limited success compared to Keytruda.

• **FDA Regulatory Caution**: Predicted that FDA would "back off" accelerated approvals in this area. **Outcome**: Partially accurate—FDA did become more stringent, requiring randomized controlled trials with overall survival endpoints, but accelerated approvals continued for promising IO agents in other indications where benefit was clearer.

• **Competitive Differences Between PD-1 vs PD-L1**: Suggested unknown differences might exist between targeting PD-1 versus PD-L1. **Outcome**: Accurate—clinical data increasingly showed PD-1 inhibitors achieving broader success, though mechanistic reasons remained partially understood and context-dependent.

• **Fc Receptor Manipulation for Enhanced Efficacy**: Suggested that blocking macrophage transfer could enhance aPD-1 therapy. **Outcome**: Limited clinical translation—while the biology was validated, therapeutic strategies targeting FcγR in IO remained experimental rather than clinically implemented on a broad scale.

• **Keytruda's Superior Data**: Implied Keytruda's emerging superiority would continue. **Outcome**: Highly accurate—Keytruda became the dominant IO agent and ultimately the world's top-selling drug with expanding indications across numerous tumor types.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article successfully anticipated several key trends in immuno-oncology development and regulatory evolution, highlighting scientific and clinical uncertainties that proved prescient. The caution about accelerated approvals and the incomplete understanding of PD-1/PD-L1 differences reflected real challenges that shaped the field's subsequent trajectory.
