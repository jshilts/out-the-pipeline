# Engineering Biology, For Real? (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe is a critical response to Vijay Pande's Scientific American piece arguing that Silicon Valley engineering principles could revolutionize biotechnology. Lowe coins and defends the "Andy Grove Fallacy" – the mistaken belief that applying Valley-style engineering and management to drug development would automatically accelerate progress. Pande's article proposed five principles for engineering biology: (1) identifying biological "Legos" that can be mixed and matched; (2) achieving repeatability and reproducibility; (3) implementing testing and key performance indicators; (4) borrowing techniques from other disciplines; and (5) reinventing processes. Lowe systematically challenges each principle, arguing that Pande dramatically underestimates biological complexity compared to engineered systems. He uses examples like our incomplete understanding of regulatory RNAs, the heterogeneity of diseases like cancer, and our inability to build even a simple nematode despite decades of exhaustive study to illustrate fundamental gaps between engineering and biology.

## 2. HISTORY

The debate Lowe engages here has continued and evolved significantly since 2018. Several developments are noteworthy:

**Successes in specific domains:**
- mRNA vaccines (BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna) demonstrated rapid platform-based development during COVID-19, seemingly validating some engineering principles
- CRISPR gene editing has advanced significantly, with approved therapies like Casgevy for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia
- Monoclonal antibodies and protein engineering have become more systematic with computational tools
- AI-driven drug discovery companies have emerged (Atomwise, Exscientia, Insilico Medicine) with some candidates reaching clinical trials

**Ongoing limitations:**
- Biomarker discovery has not transformed into the "assembly-line production" Pande envisioned. Most biomarker work remains discovery-driven rather than engineered.
- Clinical trial success rates for new drugs remain around 10-20%, showing that biological complexity still dominates over engineering predictability
- Many AI drug discovery companies have struggled to demonstrate clear advantages over traditional methods in head-to-head comparisons
- The fundamental challenge Lowe identified – that we cannot engineer living systems from first principles – remains largely true. Even with CRISPR, outcomes are often unpredictable and require extensive empirical testing.

**Business outcomes:**
- Numerous biotech companies have pursued engineering-driven approaches, with mixed results
- Investment in computational biology and AI drug discovery has grown substantially
- However, most drug approvals still come from established pharmaceutical companies using traditional (though increasingly tech-enabled) approaches

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Biomarkers as assembly-line production (Pande)**: He predicted machine learning would turn biomarker discovery into mass-producible tests. **Outcome**: Limited success. While some AI-assisted biomarkers exist, the field has not achieved industrial-scale production. The fundamental biological heterogeneity Lowe identified remains a major obstacle.

• **Engineering biological "Legos" (Pande)**: Predicted that identifying biological building blocks would enable systematic engineering of novel function. **Outcome**: Partial progress. CRISPR and synthetic biology tools have advanced, but we still cannot engineer complex biological systems predictably. Lowe's nematode example remains relevant – we still cannot build even well-studied organisms from components.

• **KPIs transforming biology (Pande)**: Predicted engineering-style metrics would revolutionize biological research. **Outcome**: Limited adoption. While some companies use KPIs for process optimization, fundamental biological research remains discovery-driven rather than metric-driven.

• **Overturning the Andy Grove Fallacy (Pande)**: Asserted that engineering approaches were ready to transform biology. **Outcome**: The fallacy persists. Biotechnology has adopted some engineering practices successfully (especially for tools and manufacturing), but drug discovery and development timelines remain long and uncertain. The most rapid success (mRNA vaccines) still required decades of basic research foundation.

• **Biological complexity as fundamental barrier (Lowe)**: Implicitly predicted that fundamental differences between engineered and biological systems would limit Silicon Valley approaches. **Outcome**: Largely validated. While technology has advanced, the core challenge Lowe identified – that living systems have evolved complexity we don't understand and cannot predict – continues to limit engineering approaches to biology.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article addresses a persistent and important tension in biotechnology development – the gap between engineering predictability and biological complexity. The debate it engages remains highly relevant as computational approaches become more prominent in drug discovery.
