# Merry Christmas From the FDA (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2013 commentary notes three FDA regulatory decisions announced during the holiday season. First, Ariad's leukemia drug Iclusig was allowed to return to the US market with restrictions after having been suspended due to safety concerns. Second, Amarin received a temporary delay in proceedings regarding their fish-oil-based medication that had been struggling to gain broader approval. Third, United Therapeutics surprisingly received FDA approval for an oral version of treprostinil (a synthetic prostaglandin analog) to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), despite having been rejected twice previously and showing less-than-impressive clinical trial results.

## 2. HISTORY

**Iclusig (Ariad):** Following its return to market with restrictions in December 2013, Iclusig (ponatinib) continued to be used as a third-line treatment for certain leukemia types, particularly for patients with specific genetic mutations like T315I. The drug maintained its position as a niche therapy due to its cardiovascular toxicity risks, but remained important for patients resistant to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In subsequent years, Iclusig gained additional FDA approvals for more indications, and Ariad was eventually acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical in 2017 for approximately $5.2 billion, largely based on Iclusig's commercial potential.

**Amarin's Fish Oil Pill:** The fish-oil medication referenced was Vascepa (icosapent ethyl), which was already approved for severe triglyceride reduction but Amarin sought broader cardiovascular indication. The "stay of execution" mentioned in the article preceded years of regulatory and legal battles. Vascepa finally received FDA approval for cardiovascular risk reduction in December 2019, after the landmark REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits. Vascepa became a blockbuster drug, generating over $600 million in annual sales, though Amarin later faced generic competition and patent challenges.

**Orenitram (United Therapeutics):** The oral treprostinil product, branded as Orenitram, did enter the market following its 2013 approval. However, it faced significant commercial challenges. Oral treprostinil for PAH had limited efficacy compared to inhaled or injectable formulations, and uptake was slower than anticipated. United Therapeutics continued to invest in treprostinil delivery systems, developing better-tolerated formulations over time. The company maintained its focus on PAH treatments and remained profitable, but Orenitram never became a major revenue driver compared to their other PAH medications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Iclusig's market potential**: The article's cautious tone about Iclusig's return with restrictions was appropriate - while the drug found its place as a specialty therapy, it did not become a blockbuster drug, instead serving a limited patient population where its benefits outweighed safety concerns.

• **Amarin's regulatory prospects**: The article's description of Amarin's situation as getting a "stay of execution" accurately captured the precarious regulatory position - it would take another six years and a major clinical trial before Vascepa achieved broader approval, validating the skepticism about immediate prospects.

• **United Therapeutics' oral treprostinil**: The author's surprise at the approval proved well-founded - despite FDA approval, Orenitram faced clinical and commercial challenges, confirming that regulatory approval alone doesn't guarantee clinical utility or market success, especially when clinical data was already unimpressive.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5**

This article captures an interesting snapshot of FDA decision-making patterns and the unpredictability of regulatory outcomes, but its impact is narrow and focused on three specific drug approval stories rather than broader industry trends or scientific breakthroughs.
