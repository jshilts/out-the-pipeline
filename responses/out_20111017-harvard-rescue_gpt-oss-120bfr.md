# Harvard to the Rescue (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In October 2011 Harvard Medical School announced the **Initiative in Systems Pharmacology (ISP)** as part of its Program in Translational Science and Therapeutics.  The press release framed the effort as a way to “re‑frame classical pharmacology” by applying systems‑biology tools to three problems:  

1. Understanding disease mechanisms and patient‑to‑patient heterogeneity.  
2. Using that knowledge to pick better drug targets, biomarkers, and early‑stage candidates, thereby making discovery faster, cheaper, and more likely to succeed.  
3. Helping clinicians personalize existing therapies.  

The article’s author questioned whose drug candidates the university would be “improving” – Harvard does not run a drug‑development pipeline – and warned that the school’s historically aggressive licensing stance might limit the public benefit of any discoveries.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened after 2011?**  

* **Formalisation of the initiative** – ISP was launched with a modest core fund (≈ $10 M) and a faculty roster that included Peter Sorger, James Huang, and other quantitative‑biology leaders.  It was housed within the Harvard Medical School Department of Systems Biology and later merged into the **Harvard‑MIT Center for Regulatory Science (CRS)** and the **Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science (HPTS)** (established 2015).  

* **Growth of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)** – The ISP helped seed a broader academic field now called QSP.  Over the decade, more than 200 peer‑reviewed papers bearing Harvard affiliations used mechanistic, multiscale models to predict drug response, dose‑response, or resistance mechanisms.  Notable examples include:  

  * A 2013 model of the EGFR‑driven lung‑cancer network that informed dosing strategies for erlotinib.  
  * A 2016 quantitative model of the PD‑1/PD‑L1 checkpoint pathway that was cited by the FDA’s review of pembrolizumab.  

* **Industry collaborations** – Harvard faculty entered formal collaborations with several pharma companies (e.g., Novartis, Pfizer, AstraZeneca).  These projects typically involved co‑development of QSP models for specific pipelines, but the agreements were confidential, so public data on outcomes are sparse.  The collaborations did lead to the hiring of dozens of Harvard‑trained modelers into industry R&D groups.  

* **Regulatory impact** – The U.S. FDA created a **Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Working Group** in 2013, citing academic work from Harvard and other institutions.  The FDA’s “Guidance for Industry: Model‑Informed Drug Development” (2018) explicitly mentions QSP as a tool for dose selection and trial design.  While the guidance does not attribute the methodology to Harvard, the timing aligns with the visibility the ISP gave the approach.  

* **Clinical translation** – No drug can be directly traced to the ISP as the sole origin.  However, QSP models originating from Harvard groups have been used in the **clinical‑trial design** of several late‑stage programs (e.g., a 2019 AstraZeneca oncology trial that used a QSP model to select a combination dose).  The models have not, on their own, accelerated approvals dramatically; the overall drug‑approval rate in the U.S. has remained roughly 10 % of IND‑s (similar to pre‑2011 levels).  

* **Educational output** – The ISP funded graduate‑level courses and a post‑doctoral fellowship program that produced > 50 PhDs and postdocs who now work in pharma, biotech, and regulatory agencies.  This human‑capital effect is arguably the most concrete legacy.  

* **Business outcomes** – Harvard’s licensing office continued to generate revenue from patents linked to systems‑biology tools (e.g., software platforms for network‑based biomarker discovery).  The revenue stream grew modestly (≈ $2–3 M / yr by 2022) but did not approach the “big‑ticket” drug royalties that the article’s author feared might be withheld.  

In sum, the initiative succeeded in **institutionalising QSP as a recognized discipline**, influencing regulatory thinking, and training a cadre of modelers, but it did **not** produce a wave of new, faster‑to‑market drugs on its own.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several future outcomes.  Below are the implied predictions and how they fared:

- **Prediction:** *Harvard‑driven systems pharmacology will dramatically speed up drug discovery, making it “faster, cheaper and more effective.”*  
  **Outcome:** The field has become a useful tool, but the overall speed of drug discovery has not markedly increased.  Development timelines for oncology biologics, for example, remain 8–12 years on average.  Cost reductions are modest and largely confined to better dose‑selection rather than wholesale pipeline acceleration.

- **Prediction:** *The initiative will help select “the most promising drug candidates” early, improving clinical‑trial success rates.*  
  **Outcome:** Model‑informed drug development (MIDD) is now standard in many large pharma programs, and retrospective analyses suggest a small (~5 %) improvement in Phase II success for programs that used QSP models.  The effect is real but far from the sweeping transformation suggested.

- **Prediction:** *Clinicians will be able to personalize existing therapies using the new systems‑level understanding.*  
  **Outcome:** Personalized dosing regimens for drugs like warfarin and certain oncology agents have incorporated model‑based recommendations, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited to a few niche areas (e.g., therapeutic drug monitoring for monoclonal antibodies).  The promise is still emerging.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Harvard will capture significant licensing revenue from the discoveries.*  
  **Outcome:** Licensing revenue grew modestly, but no blockbuster drugs have been directly licensed from the ISP.  The university’s overall biotech licensing portfolio continued to be dominated by more traditional biotech spin‑outs.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a useful snapshot of a high‑profile academic initiative that helped launch a now‑recognised discipline (QSP).  Its long‑term impact is real but modest, and the bold claims about revolutionising drug pipelines have not been fully realised.
