# CB-1 Obesity Drugs: Farewell to the Whole Lot (November 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2008 commentary reflects on the collapse of CB-1 (cannabinoid receptor type 1) antagonist obesity drugs following two major industry failures. Sanofi-Aventis was forced to withdraw Acomplia (rimonabant) from the European market due to severe psychiatric side effects including depression and suicidal ideation, after the drug never gained FDA approval. Simultaneously, Pfizer abandoned its Phase III candidate CP-945,598, despite public statements suggesting the drug was safe and effective. The author notes that Merck had previously abandoned their CB-1 program as well. The article makes clear that the enormous research investments (8-10 years and substantial resources from three major pharmaceutical companies) had produced no viable obesity treatment. The author contrasts this outcome with mid-2006 predictions that these drugs would become blockbusters generating billions in revenue.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Aftermath (2008-2012):** The CB-1 antagonist class essentially disappeared from pharmaceutical development pipelines following these announcements. No major company successfully brought a CB-1 antagonist to market for obesity, and research in this specific area largely ceased.

**Alternative Obesity Drug Development:**
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists** emerged as the dominant obesity drug class
- **Liraglutide (Saxenda)** received FDA approval for obesity in 2014, and **semaglutide (Wegovy)** in 2021, both showing substantial weight loss efficacy
- **Other mechanisms:** Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia), naltrexone-bupropion (Contrave), and orlistat remained as approved options

**Clinical Impact:** While CB-1 antagonists failed completely, the obesity drug market eventually developed through other mechanisms, with GLP-1 agonists demonstrating superior efficacy and acceptable safety profiles, leading to widespread patient adoption and multi-billion dollar market success.

**Business Outcomes:** The failed investments represented significant losses for Sanofi, Pfizer, and Merck. However, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly later capitalized on the obesity market through GLP-1 drugs, with Wegovy and related GLP-1 products generating over $10 billion annually by the mid-2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I don't see much work going on in this area for some time to come, unless the pharmacology gets untangled to the point that someone can see a safe way through. There may well not be one."**
  - **Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate.** The CB-1 antagonist class was abandoned and received no significant pharmaceutical investment for obesity treatment in subsequent years. Research did not resume, and the "safe way through" was never found.

• **"[rimonabant] was poised to become one of the biggest selling drugs in all the world" with "billions of dollars in revenues"**
  - **Outcome:** ✗ **Completely wrong, but accurately captured the failed hype.** The drug never achieved commercial success, was withdrawn from all markets, and generated zero revenue in the obesity indication.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article serves as a valuable cautionary tale about pharmaceutical hype cycles and the difficulty of translating biological mechanisms into safe therapeutics, but it describes a research pathway that led nowhere rather than a field that evolved.
