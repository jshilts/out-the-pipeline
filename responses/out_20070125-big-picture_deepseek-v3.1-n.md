# The Big Picture (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques an Economist article about the pharmaceutical industry's struggles, using Pfizer's troubles as a representative case study. The author challenges the narrative that Big Pharma missed out on a "biotechnology bonanza," arguing instead that genomics, proteomics, and pharmacogenomics have been "frightful money pits" that failed to deliver marketed drugs despite massive investment. The piece disputes whether the industry's problems stem from a cyclical downturn versus a fundamental business model failure, and takes issue with the claim that academic labs and biotech startups outperformed pharmaceutical companies in turning scientific advances into real therapies. Additionally, the author dismisses criticisms from generics manufacturers like Ranbaxy, arguing they depend on innovative drugs eventually becoming available for generic production.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2007 article, the pharmaceutical industry experienced significant transformation. Pfizer continued facing patent cliffs, notably losing exclusivity for Lipitor in 2011, which had been their top-selling drug. The industry did indeed undergo major consolidation, with Pfizer itself acquiring Wyeth in 2009 and later attempting (unsuccessfully) to acquire AstraZeneca and successfully acquiring Hospira and Medivation.

The biotechnology revolution that the author dismisses as a "money pit" did eventually bear fruit. Genomic approaches led to approved therapies, including CAR-T cell therapies (Kymriah and Yescarta approved 2017-2018), gene therapies like Luxturna (2017), and numerous targeted cancer drugs based on genetic markers. Pharmacogenomics became integrated into drug labeling and clinical practice, particularly in oncology and certain chronic diseases.

Ranbaxy's trajectory was more troubled than predicted - the company faced multiple FDA import bans due to manufacturing quality issues, eventually being acquired by Sun Pharma in 2014. The generic industry continued expanding, but faced increased regulatory scrutiny and pricing pressures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Ask us again in ten years" regarding genomics impact**: This prediction proved remarkably prescient. By 2017, genomics had indeed produced marketed drugs, including targeted cancer therapies, CAR-T treatments, and gene therapies. However, the timeline was longer and the costs higher than initially expected.

• **The generics industry's dependence on innovative drugs**: This assessment was accurate - the generic industry continued relying on patent expirations. However, the author didn't anticipate the rise of complex generics and biosimilars, which required significant innovation in their own right.

• **Implicit assumption that biotechnology advances wouldn't deliver drugs "for a while yet"**: This proved conservative. While 2007-2012 saw limited genomic-based approvals, 2012-2017 marked significant acceleration in precision medicine approvals.

• **The cyclical downturn vs. business model crisis**: History suggests it was both - the industry survived but required fundamental restructuring, increased M&A activity, and greater reliance on external innovation through biotech partnerships.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates impressive foresight about the biotechnology sector's timeline while providing valuable perspective on pharmaceutical industry dynamics that remained relevant for years. The critique of premature genomics hype was historically accurate for its time and offers lessons about realistic technology adoption cycles.
