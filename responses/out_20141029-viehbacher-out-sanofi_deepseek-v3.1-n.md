# Viehbacher Out at Sanofi (October 29, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on the sudden dismissal of Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher following tensions with the company's board of directors. The termination came via a unanimous board vote, with the chairman citing a lack of trust and a "solitary management style" as contributing factors. Notably, the board had not yet identified a replacement CEO at the time of Viehbacher's departure. The article notes that the investment community had generally viewed Viehbacher favorably, and suggests that his departure could impact the company's partnerships, particularly with Regeneron. The piece includes an update referencing Matthew Herper's Forbes commentary that the firing was a significant mistake.

## 2. HISTORY

Following Viehbacher's dismissal, Sanofi underwent significant leadership and strategic changes:

**Leadership Transition**: The board appointed Serge Weinberg, Sanofi's chairman, as interim CEO immediately following Viehbacher's departure. In April 2015, the company named Olivier Brandicourt as permanent CEO, who had previously served as CEO of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. Brandicourt led the company for four years before being succeeded by Paul Hudson in September 2019.

**Sanofi-Regeneron Partnership Evolution**: The Sanofi-Regeneron partnership, which Viehbacher had cultivated, continued but evolved significantly. Sanofi's collaboration with Regeneron on PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) continued through regulatory approval in 2015, though it faced stiff competition from Amgen's Repatha. In 2019, Sanofi and Regeneron restructured their partnership, with Regeneron buying back approximately \$1.7 billion in rights to develop and commercialize antibody drugs, while Sanofi retained certain collaboration rights including co-commercialization rights to Dupixent (dupilumab), which became a blockbuster drug for Sanofi. Dupixent, an IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor for atopic dermatitis and asthma, became one of Sanofi's most important growth drivers, achieving peak sales projections exceeding 10 billion euros annually.

**Sanofi's Strategic Evolution**: Under subsequent leadership, Sanofi pursued strategic changes including major acquisitions. In 2018, the company acquired Bioverativ for \$11.6 billion to strengthen its rare disease portfolio, and Ablynx for \$4.8 billion to gain access to nanobody technology. However, the company also faced setbacks, including delays and failures in several late-stage clinical programs. Sanofi's diabetes franchise, which Viehbacher had overseen, faced generics competition and declining sales, contributing to ongoing portfolio challenges.

Public policy and regulatory environment evolved significantly post-2014, with drug pricing becoming an increasingly contentious issue worldwide, affecting pricing strategies across the industry including for Sanofi's key products.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Look for some top-level people at other companies to be taking some sudden vacation days over the next few weeks"** - This prediction about executive recruitment proved partially accurate. Sanofi conducted a CEO search that spanned several months, ultimately selecting an external candidate with pharmaceutical industry experience (Brandicourt from Bayer), though the process appears to have been more deliberate than implied.

• **"The company's partners, Regeneron in particular, will be hoping that the search is short"** - This prediction about partnership concerns proved valid. The Sanofi-Regeneron relationship underwent significant evolution and restructuring over the subsequent five years, culminating in the 2019 partnership restructuring that redefined their collaboration terms, suggesting ongoing strategic alignment challenges that likely were influenced by leadership changes.

• **The implicit prediction that a "more clubbable Frenchman from inside the company" would face investor skepticism was not validated** - The board ultimately selected an experienced pharmaceutical executive from outside Sanofi's existing leadership team, which likely addressed investor concerns about continuity and external perspective.

• **Matthew Herper's assessment that the firing was "a huge mistake"** - Judging this prediction's accuracy is complex. While Viehbacher's ouster was disruptive, Sanofi continued as a major pharmaceutical player with subsequent successes including the development and commercialization of Dupixent into a major blockbuster therapy. However, the company also faced significant challenges in its diabetes franchise and other areas, suggesting leadership continuity might have produced different outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captures a pivotal leadership change at a major pharmaceutical company that presaged broader industry trends toward external hiring of CEOs and strategic portfolio realignment. The dismissal's connection to the Sanofi-Regeneron partnership proved prescient, as that relationship evolved significantly in subsequent years.
