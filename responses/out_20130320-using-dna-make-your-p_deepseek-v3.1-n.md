# Using DNA to Make Your Polymers. No Enzymes Needed. (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses pioneering work by David Liu and colleagues on DNA-templated synthesis—using DNA sequences to direct the assembly of non-natural polymers without enzymes. The system employs peptide nucleic acid (PNA) pentamers attached to small-molecule monomers, which recognize specific DNA codons and align reactive groups in proximity for bond formation. While amide formation and reductive amination failed, click chemistry (copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition) proved most reliable. The researchers successfully created defined triazole-linked beta-peptide polymers up to 90 residues (26 kD), with the attached DNA serving as a barcode for PCR amplification. This opened possibilities for generating libraries of large, potentially bioactive molecules accessible through in vitro selection.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2013 publication, DNA-templated synthesis and DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology became a major paradigm in drug discovery, though the trajectory differed from the article's focus on defined polymers.

**DEL Technology Commercial Success**: While the article emphasized creating specific, sequence-defined polymers, the broader field evolved toward screening large DELs of smaller molecules. Companies like X-Chem (founded 2009, acquired by Charles River in 2021), Nuevolution, and Ensemble Therapeutics commercialized DEL platforms. By the mid-2010s, partnerships with major pharma became common—GSK, AstraZeneca, and Novartis invested heavily in DEL. The technology's key advantage was generating enormous libraries (billions of compounds) for affinity selection against drug targets.

**Clinical Outcomes**: DEL technology began delivering clinical candidates by the late 2010s. The most prominent example is **Belvarafenib**, a RAF inhibitor discovered by Array BioPharma (later acquired by Pfizer) using DNA-encoded chemistry approaches, which entered clinical trials for cancer. Other DEL-derived compounds progressed to various clinical phases for oncology, inflammatory diseases, and metabolic disorders. Commercial success came incrementally rather than as a sudden breakthrough.

**Academic Evolution**: David Liu's lab continued developing DNA-templated synthesis for complex molecules. In 2016, they demonstrated evolved polymerases capable of incorporating non-natural nucleotides, advancing synthetic biology. By 2020, applications expanded to materials science—creating DNA-templated nanomaterials and precise macromolecular architectures.

**Industrial Adoption**: The pharmaceutical industry widely adopted DEL for lead discovery because it accelerates screening timelines and reduces costs compared to traditional high-throughput screening. However, the technology focused more on small-molecule drug discovery than the article's vision of making large, complex polymers for selection.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions about the technology's future:

• **"Access to large and potentially bioactive molecules that would be basically impossible to synthesize in any defined form"**: **Partially realized**. While DEL technology succeeded in drug discovery, it primarily delivered small molecules rather than large, complex polymers. The field shifted toward practical drug-like compounds rather than the polymer-focused vision described.

• **In vitro selection using "the attached DNA as a barcode"**: **Accurately predicted**. This became the cornerstone of DEL technology—encoding synthesis history in DNA for rapid hit identification via sequencing. DELs now routinely apply selection pressure to identify high-affinity binders.

• **"Generate a lot of unusual stuff... people take up the challenge"**: **Correct**. The concept attracted significant attention, leading to new companies (e.g., Vipergen founded 2009, Nurix Therapeutics 2009, and others), substantial venture investment, and collaborations across drug discovery. The academic community also embraced the approach, with Harvard, Scripps, and others advancing the science.

• **Reaction scope expansion beyond click chemistry**: **Moderate success**. While click chemistry remains central, researchers developed new DNA-compatible reactions for diverse chemical space. Chemists expanded the repertoire to include cross-coupling reactions, cycloadditions, and multi-component reactions compatible with aqueous conditions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a technology with substantial real-world impact in drug discovery, though its practical applications evolved toward DEL for small molecules rather than the large-polymer vision described. The core concept catalyzed significant commercial activity and produced clinical candidates.
