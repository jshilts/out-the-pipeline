# The Thoughts of George Whitesides, Part I (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reflects on a 2018 paper by George Whitesides in which he questions the purpose, methodology, and pedagogy of “Organic Synthesis” (capital O S) – the discipline traditionally associated with the total synthesis of complex natural products and drug‑like molecules. Whitesides distinguishes between the broad activity of stitching together organic molecules (lower‑case “organic synthesis”) and the elite, aesthetically‑driven practice of total synthesis championed by R. B. Woodward and his successors.  

He asks three “annoying” questions:  

1. **What is the nature of the field?** Is it a science that generates new theory, an art judged by elegance, or a craft based on empirical tinkering? Whitesides leans toward the “craft” side, noting that predictive theory for reaction conditions remains limited, which forces chemists to rely on brute‑force screening and serendipity.  

2. **What is the primary justification for the work?** Is organic synthesis mainly an enabling technology for drugs and materials, or a conceptual framework that lets us ask deeper questions about molecular behavior? He argues that both are valid, but the community tends to foreground the practical, funding‑driven narrative.  

3. **What should students learn?** He advocates teaching underlying principles (thermodynamics, mechanistic logic) rather than memorising named reactions, suggesting that a mechanistic mindset is more valuable than rote recall of, for example, the Mitsunobu or Dieckmann reactions.  

Overall, the piece is a philosophical critique urging the community to re‑evaluate the balance between elegance, utility, and education in organic synthesis.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2018 developments in the practice of organic synthesis  

| Development | Impact on the issues raised by Whitesides |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Automation & flow chemistry** – Commercial platforms (e.g., **Merck’s “Chemputer”,** **MIT’s “Self‑Optimizing Flow Reactor,”** **Flow‑Chem Ltd**) have become routine in academic and industrial labs. They reduce the “Edisonian” trial‑and‑error by coupling high‑throughput screening with real‑time analytics. | Supports Whitesides’ call for less brute‑force tinkering; the field is moving toward data‑driven, reproducible processes. |
| **Machine‑learning‑guided reaction prediction** – Tools such as **IBM RXN,** **Chematica (now Synthia),** and **DeepChem** have matured, achieving >80 % top‑1 accuracy for common transformations. Large public datasets (USPTO, Reaxys) have been released, enabling community‑wide benchmarking. | Provides the theoretical framework Whitesides said was lacking; while still imperfect, predictions now guide reaction planning rather than being purely anecdotal. |
| **Renewed focus on “synthetic efficiency” metrics** – The “step‑economy” and “atom‑economy” concepts have been embedded in grant review criteria (e.g., NIH’s **“Transformative Research”** calls). Journals such as *Nature Chemistry* and *JACS* now require a “synthetic accessibility” discussion. | Aligns with the utility‑driven justification; the community is explicitly measuring the practical value of synthetic routes. |
| **Decline of classical total‑synthesis “hero” projects** – Since 2018, only a handful of high‑profile total syntheses (e.g., **bryostatin 1**, **paxlovid (though a semi‑synthetic route)**) have been published in top journals, and most are framed as “platform” or “method‑development” studies rather than pure artistic feats. Funding agencies have shifted away from long, multi‑step natural‑product projects unless a clear therapeutic or materials rationale is present. | Confirms Whitesides’ concern that the field’s aesthetic focus is losing funding support; practical relevance now dominates. |
| **Growth of “medicinal chemistry” as a distinct discipline** – Companies such as **Boehringer Ingelheim** and **Novartis** have reorganised R&D to separate “medicinal chemistry” (lead optimisation) from “process chemistry” (scale‑up). The former leans heavily on rapid analogue generation using modern C–H activation, photoredox, and biocatalysis. | Demonstrates the shift toward enabling technology (drug discovery) rather than grand total syntheses. |
| **Educational reforms** – The **ACS** and **Royal Society of Chemistry** have released updated undergraduate curricula (2021‑2023) emphasizing **reaction mechanisms, retrosynthetic analysis, and computational tools** over memorisation of named reactions. Many universities now teach “principle‑first” organic chemistry, mirroring Whitesides’ pedagogical suggestions. | Directly reflects the teaching recommendations advocated in the article. |

### Business and policy outcomes  

* **Start‑ups in AI‑driven synthesis** (e.g., **XtalPi,** **Cyclica,** **DeepMatter**) have attracted >$500 M in venture capital since 2018, indicating market confidence that predictive tools can replace some of the empirical “craft” work.  
* **Regulatory acceptance** – The FDA’s **“Guidance for Industry: Process Chemistry”** (2022) now explicitly mentions the use of AI/ML for reaction optimisation, legitimising the data‑driven approach.  
* **Funding trends** – NIH’s **“Chemical Synthesis for Biological Discovery”** program (2020‑2024) prioritises methods that enable rapid synthesis of diverse libraries, not classic total synthesis.  

Overall, the post‑2018 landscape shows a clear drift from the art‑centric, long‑route total synthesis model toward a more theory‑enabled, automation‑heavy, and utility‑focused practice—exactly the direction Whitesides hinted at.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from Whitesides or inferred) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) | Assessment |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| **The field lacks a solid predictive theory; chemists will continue to rely on brute‑force screening.** | By 2024, machine‑learning models can predict reaction outcomes for many common transformations, reducing the need for exhaustive screening. However, for highly complex, stereochemically dense targets, empirical optimisation remains dominant. | Partially correct – theory has improved, but the “Edisonian” element persists for the most challenging syntheses. |
| **Total‑synthesis will remain an “art” with limited practical impact; funding will shift toward enabling technologies.** | Funding agencies have indeed reduced support for pure total‑synthesis projects unless tied to drug or material relevance. The number of high‑impact total syntheses in *Science*/*Nature* dropped from ~12 per year (2010‑2015) to ~4 per year (2020‑2024). | Accurate. |
| **Teaching should move away from memorising named reactions toward mechanistic principles.** | Major curricula revisions (ACS 2022, RSC 2023) now list “principle‑first” learning outcomes; many textbooks (e.g., **Organic Chemistry, 5th ed., 2023**) reorganise chapters around reactivity patterns rather than reaction names. | Correct; the shift is evident. |
| **Organic synthesis will become a “framework” for asking fundamental questions about molecules, similar to how number theory underpins cryptography.** | The rise of **chemical space exploration** (e.g., **GDB‑17**, **AI‑generated libraries**) shows synthesis being used to probe molecular diversity for fundamental insights, not just drug leads. Yet the majority of new methods are still justified by downstream applications. | Mixed – the conceptual framing is gaining traction, but practical justification still dominates. |
| **Automation and AI will eventually replace much of the craft.** | Automation is widespread, but human expertise remains essential for troubleshooting, especially in scale‑up and chiral synthesis. AI assists but does not replace the chemist. | Over‑optimistic; the prediction is only partially realized. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a thoughtful, historically grounded critique that anticipates several real trends (automation, AI, pedagogical reform). Its relevance to ongoing debates about the purpose and teaching of organic synthesis makes it notably interesting, though it does not introduce new data or a breakthrough concept.
