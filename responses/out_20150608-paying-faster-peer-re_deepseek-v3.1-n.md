# Paying For Faster Peer Review (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article discusses an experimental "fast-track peer review" pilot launched by Nature Publishing Group's *Scientific Reports*. For one month, authors could pay an additional fee to have their manuscripts reviewed more quickly through a third-party service (Research Square) that compensated reviewers for rapid, quality reviews—shifting from the traditional model of voluntary, unpaid peer review. The trial attracted some uptake (reportedly with higher take-up from China, though the author cautions about normalization), was capped at a limited number of papers, and acknowledged potential risks of new abuses. During this period, there was an attempted mass resignation from the journal's editorial board over the issue. The journal ended the pilot but reserved the option to try it again, and the author notes that while the traditional peer-review system is widely seen as imperfect, NPG's willingness to experiment should be welcomed.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the 2015 experiment, the debate around paid, fast-track peer review persisted but did not lead to wholesale adoption across major journals. Fast-forward service offerings and accelerated review tracks became more common, but typically operated within journals’ existing editorial workflows rather than as externally managed paid add-ons. Research Square, the third-party vendor mentioned, continued to expand its offerings, developing the American Journal Experts (AJE) brand and broader author services, often partnering with publishers to ease submission and review logistics. However, these services generally did not offer direct payment to peer reviewers as a routine part of editorial decision-making. Instead, broader industry transformations occurred: increased automation in editorial management systems, growing adoption of preprint servers (e.g., bioRxiv), more transparent peer-review models (e.g., signed reviews, open peer review), and institutional pushes for faster review timelines without direct monetary incentives for reviewers. The concern over pay-for-speed creating conflicts of interest and bias remained salient, and major society and commercial publishers largely avoided monetizing review speed via direct reviewer payments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Paid fast-track peer review would face significant criticism and might not survive or scale**: The article noted the attempted mass resignation from the editorial board and potential for abuse. This concern proved fairly accurate; while some rapid-review models continued, paying reviewers directly for faster decisions did not become mainstream. Most journals that provided accelerated review did so internally rather than outsourcing to paid third parties, avoiding the appearance of pay-to-speed influencing editorial outcomes.

• **Experimentation with peer-review models would continue**: The author praised NPG's willingness to experiment, and predicted others should do the same. While not all experiments involved paid fast-tracking, publishers indeed explored innovations (e.g., transparent peer review, portable peer review, crowd review, and preprint cross-reviews). These experiments addressed speed and quality, but typically without direct reviewer payments.

• **The traditional peer-review system is not the "best of all possible worlds" and alternatives are needed**: This general prediction held true, with ongoing dissatisfaction over long timelines and inconsistent quality, leading to greater use of preprints and other models. However, paid fast-track did not become the go-to solution; instead reform focused on transparency, preprints, and improved editorial tools.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article covers an experimental service that highlights enduring tensions in academic publishing: speed versus equity, payment versus voluntary contribution, and conflicts of interest. While the specific paid fast-track model did not become widespread, it stimulated discussion on incentives in peer review and publisher experimentation.
