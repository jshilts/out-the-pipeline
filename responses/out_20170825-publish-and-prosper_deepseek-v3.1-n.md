# Publish and Prosper (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary examines the widespread practice, particularly in certain countries, of financially rewarding researchers for publishing papers rather than providing incentives for their specific impact or novel ideas. The article draws on a Science/Retraction Watch collaboration that documented substantial cash payments tied to journal publications. The findings reveal that while some countries offer what the author calls "'nice job' awards and pats on the back," China stands out with an average payout of $43,000 for a Science or Nature paper and a highest bounty of $165,000. Other countries offering similar incentives include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Malaysia, and Taiwan. The article also notes that the US and UK showed top payouts in the $6,000 range, but questions how widespread the practice is in these countries. The author struggles with whether there's anything inherently wrong with this approach, ultimately concluding that it may be "a difference of degree and not of kind" compared to the publish-or-perish culture already pervasive in academia. Concerns about potential corruption are mentioned but no evidence of wrongdoing is presented.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article was published, several significant developments occurred:

**Continued Growth and Stricter Policies in China:** In the years following this article, China moved to address the problematic aspects of cash-for-publication schemes. By 2020-2022, Chinese universities and government bodies began implementing stricter policies and guidelines to discourage excessive cash rewards for publications, though many institutions still provide substantial bonuses albeit with different criteria.

**Global Crackdown on Publish-or-Perish Culture:** Between 2018-2023, there were increasing calls internationally to reform academic evaluation systems. Organizations like DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment) gained traction, and some funding agencies and universities began adopting guidelines that move away from journal-based metrics toward evaluating research on its intrinsic merits.

**Retraction Crisis Expansion:** Retraction Watch continued its important work, and by 2019-2023, the number of retracted papers grew significantly, with studies linking some retractions to the pressure created by financial incentives for publishing - particularly papers from countries with large cash payouts.

**Editorial Practices Evolution:** Many high-impact journals adapted their peer review processes to handle the flood of submissions from regions offering cash rewards, implementing stricter quality controls and automated fraud detection systems.

**Shift Toward Open Science:** The broader open science movement during 2018-2023 indirectly addressed some of these issues by promoting transparency, preprints, and alternative metrics that don't solely rely on journal prestige.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit or potential predictions that can be evaluated against subsequent developments:

• **Prediction: Journal editorial staffs would face massive increases in China-derived manuscripts hoping to "get lucky" with acceptance.**  
**Outcome:** Partially accurate. High-impact journals did experience increased submissions from China and other countries offering cash rewards, but editorial standards largely held. However, many journals implemented additional screening measures and some saw increased scrutiny of papers from certain regions.

• **Prediction: Potential for corruption if authors proposed splitting publication bounties with editorial decision-makers.**  
**Outcome:** Limited evidence emerged of direct editorial corruption of this nature, but the subsequent years did reveal larger-scale systematic issues including citation rings, paper mills, and coordinated publication schemes that exploited these incentive systems in more sophisticated ways than simple bribery.

• **Prediction: As an "overt version of what goes on anyway," cash-for-publication schemes would likely continue or expand.**  
**Outcome:** True in the short term (2017-2020), but many institutions began reforming these systems after 2020 due to recognition of perverse incentives and quality concerns. The practice persists but with more nuance and some attempts at reform.

## 4. INTEREST 

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a critical and largely under-discussed aspect of academic publishing that had significant implications for research integrity, particularly highlighting how financial incentives can distort scholarly communications on a global scale. While focused on the specific practice of cash payouts, it touches on broader issues of research evaluation that remain highly relevant.
