# The Politics of the 21st Century Cures Act (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes the newly passed 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016, examining its key provisions and the political compromises that shaped the final legislation. The author draws heavily on analysis from Biocentury's Steve Usdin to highlight several important components: significant changes to NIH funding that centralize power and favor translational over basic research; an "orphan antiinfective" pathway for antibiotics and antifungals for limited patient populations; provisions for "real-world evidence" in drug approvals (though limited to post-approval label expansions rather than initial approvals); compassionate use requirements for companies developing life-threatening disease treatments; and a new "regenerative advanced therapy" designation that provides benefits similar to breakthrough therapy status without changing fundamental approval standards for safety and efficacy. The article also notes the political dynamics, including the exclusion of more radical "right to try" provisions and the expectation that many issues would resurface during upcoming FDA user fee reauthorization debates. Overall, the author presents the legislation as a moderate compromise that survived a winnowing process eliminating provisions opposed by Republicans, Democrats, industry, or FDA.

## 2. HISTORY

The 21st Century Cures Act has had significant real-world impact since its passage. The most tangible outcome has been **accretionary funding increases for key agencies**: Congress provided $500 million for FDA in FY2017 (expanding to billions over subsequent years), $300 million for NIH in FY2017 (growing to $1.5 billion annually by FY2021), and $106 million for the opioid crisis in its first year. These funds were used to implement many of the Act's provisions - though whether they've been "sufficient" to meet the Act's ambitious goals is an ongoing debate.

The **"regenerative advanced therapy" (RAT) designation** became a notable success pathway. Between 2017-2023, around **two dozen products received RAT designation**, including approved therapies like **Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel)** and **Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel)** for CAR-T cell therapy (though it's worth noting these approvals relied on substantial clinical data rather than shortcuts). Novartis's Kymriah was approved in Aug 2017 for pediatric/young adult B-cell ALL based on robust Phase II data showing ~83% remission rates, and both Kymriah and Yescarta were broadly adopted in their approved indications. However, concerns about high costs ($373K-$475K per treatment) and complex patient management limited broader use.

**Real-world evidence (RWE)** implementation evolved cautiously. FDA established the RWE framework as mandated, but early applications were conservative - primarily **label expansions for oncology drugs** like extending Ibrutinib indications and supporting **post-market commitments** for drugs like sodium oxybate (Xyrem) for narcolepsy. Major controversies emerged around drugs like **Aduhelm (aducanumab)** for Alzheimer's, which though not an RWE approval, reignited debates about evidentiary standards - Aduhelm's approval was based on biomarker data and faced intense criticism, representing the kind of evidentiary flexibility the Act enabled but not RWE specifically.

The **antibiotic pathways** had mixed results. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD) saw **limited uptake** - by 2023 only a handful of antibiotics had been approved via this pathway, many for narrow indications against resistant organisms. While technically successful, this pathway didn't fundamentally change the economics of antibiotic development, which remains challenging due to stewardship concerns and low commercial returns.

**Broader policy impacts** included accelerating digital health innovations through FDA's Digital Health Center of Excellence, fast-track designation expansions, and harmonization initiatives. However, the anticipated funding for NIH's "precision medicine initiative" (All of Us Research Program) did help launch programs that enrolled ~500,000 participants by 2023.

Compassionate use provisions had moderate impact - companies did establish clearer policies (as required) but without fundamentally expanding access, and costs remained substantial barriers even when companies permitted access.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations about future developments:

- **"Many provisions will come back before Congress during FDA user fee reauthorization"**: This proved accurate. The **Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) reauthorization in 2017** did incorporate follow-up discussions around Cures Act implementation, and subsequent reauthorizations (most recently PDUFA VII in 2022) continued addressing Cures Act provisions and their refinement.

- **"The incoming administration will find that causing Giant Transformational Change is not so easy in Washington"**: This **partially matched reality**. While Trump's FDA did pursue deregulatory approaches, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (2017-2019) generally operated within existing frameworks, maintaining the FDA's cautious approach to evidentiary standards. However, the Trump administration **did** make significant changes in areas like drug pricing rhetoric and faster generics approvals, suggesting real if not "transformational" change.

- **"FDA Commissioners could shift emphasis"**: This was validated. Gottlieb's emphasis on digital health and generics differed from subsequent commissioners, showing how leadership affects implementation priorities. The **accelerated approval pathway** faced increased scrutiny under later commissioners, and the **Aduhelm controversy** illustrated how dramatically standards could shift.

- **"Expansion of executive power" concerns**: This proved prescient in the biopharma context. Subsequent administrations have increasingly used executive orders and regulatory guidance to shape FDA policy without new legislation.

- **Implicit concerns about compromised standards**: **Partially realized**. Events like the **Aduhelm approval** (2021) showed flexibility in evidentiary standards could be controversial, though overall FDA maintained core requirements for robust data - the feared "race to the bottom" on standards did not occur.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article remains highly relevant for understanding ongoing debates about drug approval pathways, regulatory flexibility, and the practical implementation challenges of well-intentioned legislation. It accurately identified tensions that continue to shape biopharma policy, particularly around evidence standards and the difficult balance between innovation and patient access.
