# Holiday Blogging (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a brief personal blog post from Science Magazine's "In the Pipeline" column dated November 24, 2014. The author (Derek Lowe) announces reduced blogging frequency due to the Thanksgiving holiday week, mentions plans for traditional Thanksgiving cooking including a chocolate pecan pie from a previous recipe, and discusses the challenges of posting an Iranian rice dish recipe (javaher polow) due to regional variations in Iranian cuisine. The post is primarily a lighthearted personal update comparing Iranian culinary regionalism to American barbecue regional preferences.

## 2. HISTORY
This blog post was part of the ongoing "In the Pipeline" series that Derek Lowe has written for years, first at Science Magazine and later continuing independently. From 2014 to the present, Lowe continued writing detailed commentary about pharmaceutical drug discovery, clinical trials, and biotechnology industry developments. The "In the Pipeline" blog remains one of the most respected independent voices in pharmaceutical industry analysis, continuing to provide critical analysis of drug development failures, FDA approvals, and scientific controversies. Lowe's writing style - mixing technical expertise with personal anecdotes and cultural references - has remained consistent over the decade since this post.
