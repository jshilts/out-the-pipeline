# Exposing Faked Scientific Papers (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the problem of fraudulent and manipulated data in scientific publications, sparked by chemistry blogger Paul Bracher's (ChemBark) exposure of several egregious examples. The author, Derek Lowe, addresses the debate between private vs. public exposure of scientific misconduct, arguing strongly for public exposure in clear cases of fraud. 

The article cites specific examples including a nanorod paper with suspicious data and another paper where elemental analysis appears fabricated. Lowe argues that public exposure serves as important deterrence - both for potential fraudsters and for journal editors/reviewers who might otherwise be careless. He advocates for a "crowdsourced" approach where researchers most interested in a particular field (and thus most likely to be harmed by fake results) are best positioned to detect fraud. The piece acknowledges the risks of false accusations but emphasizes that cases with obvious, incontrovertible evidence deserve public scrutiny rather than quiet internal resolution.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2013 article, scientific integrity and data manipulation became increasingly prominent concerns:

**Increased Attention to Research Integrity**: The issues highlighted in this article gained significant traction. High-profile cases emerged, including the STAP cell controversy (2014) where Haruko Obokata's Nature papers on stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency were retracted after extensive investigations revealed image manipulation and irreproducible results.

**Retraction Rates Grew**: Journal retraction rates increased substantially post-2013. The Retraction Watch database tracked thousands of retractions, with image manipulation becoming one of the leading causes. Chemistry journals saw notable cases, including mass retractions from certain research groups.

**Enhanced Detection Tools**: Automated image analysis software emerged to detect duplicated or manipulated figures, including tools like ImageTwin and commercial services. Publishers began implementing more rigorous screening processes for submitted manuscripts.

**Community-Led Initiatives Expanded**: Blog-based oversight evolved into more formal platforms. PubPeer became a major venue for post-publication peer review and fraud detection, with researchers anonymously questioning suspicious papers. This platform played crucial roles in exposing multiple large-scale fraud cases.

**Institutional Responses**: Universities and funding agencies strengthened misconduct policies. Grant applications increasingly required data management plans and commitments to data sharing, partly in response to reproducibility crises in various fields.

**Publisher Policy Changes**: Major publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, ACS) implemented mandatory data-sharing policies, especially for chemical compounds and biological reagents. The "reproducibility crisis" in science became a mainstream concern across multiple disciplines.

**Notable Chemistry Cases**: Chemistry-specific fraud cases continued emerging, including manipulation of NMR spectra (the specific issue mentioned in the original article), leading to retractions from prominent journals like Organic Letters and Journal of the American Chemical Society.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and arguments about how scientific misconduct should be addressed:

- **Public exposure as deterrence**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - The deterrence argument proved valid. Public platforms like PubPeer and Retraction Watch became powerful forces in exposing fraud, and awareness of these platforms likely deterred some potential misconduct.

- **Crowdsourced detection works**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - The "wisdom of crowds" approach succeeded. PubPeer's model explicitly relies on community expertise to identify suspicious papers, with thousands of cases exposed through this mechanism.

- **Need for better editorial/reviewer vigilance**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - Publishers increasingly implemented systematic checks. Many journals now use automated software to screen for image manipulation before peer review begins.

- **Fraud affects those who build on fake results**: ✓ **ACCURATE** - This became a central justification for open post-publication review. Researchers regularly report on PubPeer when they cannot reproduce results, preventing wasted resources.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article was prescient in advocating for community-based oversight mechanisms that have since become institutionalized, predicting the evolution toward more transparent post-publication review and the need for technological solutions to data integrity problems.
