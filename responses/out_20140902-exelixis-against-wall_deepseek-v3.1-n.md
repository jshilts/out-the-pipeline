# Exelixis Against the Wall (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Exelixis as a company facing an existential crisis after years of setbacks. The company once had an expansive pipeline of kinase inhibitors, but multiple projects failed and major collaboration deals were terminated. The focus had narrowed to cabozantinib for prostate cancer, following a 2011 dispute with the FDA over clinical trial design where the agency insisted on overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint rather than faster surrogate markers. 

The Phase III results announced in September 2014 showed that while cabozantinib demonstrated some progression-free survival benefits, it failed to show overall survival improvement—the critical endpoint that mattered. The company announced significant workforce reduction from 330 employees down to 70 to preserve cash for ongoing trials in renal cell carcinoma and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Cabozantinib did have orphan drug status for medullary thyroid cancer with demonstrated efficacy, but the prostate cancer failure and resource constraints put the company's survival in question.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 article captured a pivotal moment, but the subsequent decade proved surprisingly different from the dire predictions. Here's what actually happened:

**Cabozantinib's Clinical Success:** Despite the prostate cancer failure in 2014, cabozantinib (brand name Cabometyx) went on to achieve multiple FDA approvals. It received approval for:
- Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 2016
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 2019  
- Differentiated thyroid cancer in 2021
- Various combination therapies and expanded indications

The two "tough" indications mentioned in the article—RCC and HCC—both became major commercial successes for the drug.

**Corporate Survival and Growth:** Far from being "it for them," Exelixis survived and thrived. The company avoided bankruptcy and instead became a successful commercial-stage company. Cabozantinib generated over $1.4 billion in annual revenue by 2022, making it a blockbuster oncology drug. The company grew significantly, expanding both its commercial infrastructure and R&D pipeline.

**Additional Drug Development:** Beyond cabozantinib, Exelixis continued drug development including partnerships and collaborations. The company maintained sufficient resources to pursue additional therapeutic candidates rather than merely scraping by to complete existing trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction:** "I'd have to think that this will be it for them" regarding Exelixis's survival if the remaining trials didn't succeed.
  
  **Reality:** The company not only survived but became a successful commercial entity with a blockbuster drug. Cabometyx sales exceeded $1 billion annually by 2019-2020.

- **Prediction:** The article suggested the remaining RCC and HCC trials were unlikely battlefields that offered little room for optimism given the prostate failure.
  
  **Reality:** Both RCC and HCC became approved indications where cabozantinib demonstrated clear clinical benefit, representing major commercial successes.

- **Prediction:** Implicit assumption that the prostate cancer OS failure indicated broader problems with the compound's efficacy.
  
  **Reality:** Cabozantinib proved highly effective in other cancer types, demonstrating that efficacy varies significantly by tumor type—a common pattern with targeted kinase inhibitors.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5**

This article ranks in the middle decile because while it accurately captured a dramatic moment in biotech, its dire predictions proved completely wrong, making it a useful cautionary tale about the difficulty of predicting company survival based on single clinical setbacks. The case illustrates how drug efficacy can vary dramatically across different cancer types, and how companies can survive near-death experiences in biotech.
