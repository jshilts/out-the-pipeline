# Exelixis Against the Wall (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Exelixis at a critical juncture in September 2014. The company had experienced years of challenges with a once-large pipeline of kinase inhibitors, including terminated collaboration deals and returned compounds. Exelixis was pinning its hopes on cabozantinib for prostate cancer after a 2011 dispute with the FDA over clinical trial design, where the agency insisted on overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint rather than surrogate measures.

The recently announced Phase III results for prostate cancer showed some progression-free survival (PFS) benefit but failed to demonstrate overall survival improvement—the clinically meaningful endpoint. This failure forced Exelixis to announce significant workforce reductions from 330 employees down to 70, with remaining resources focused on two other cabozantinib trials for renal cell carcinoma and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The company's survival depended on these remaining trials, though the article noted cabozantinib had shown real benefit and received orphan drug status for medullary thyroid cancer.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2014 article, Exelixis experienced a remarkable turnaround that defied the dire predictions. Cabozantinib (brand name Cabometyx) went on to achieve significant clinical and commercial success.

**FDA Approvals:**
- **April 2016:** FDA approved cabozantinib for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients who had received prior anti-angiogenic therapy
- **December 2017:** Expanded approval for first-line treatment of advanced RCC
- **January 2019:** Approved for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients previously treated with sorafenib (achieving the very indication mentioned as challenging in the 2014 article)
- **September 2012:** The drug had already been approved for medullary thyroid cancer (as Cometriq)

**Clinical Performance:** The pivotal METEOR trial demonstrated cabozantinib significantly improved overall survival in advanced RCC patients, achieving the type of OS benefit that was lacking in the 2014 prostate cancer trial. For HCC, the CELESTIAL trial showed meaningful survival benefit, leading to approval.

**Commercial Success:** By 2023, Cabometyx had become Exelixis's blockbuster drug, generating approximately $1.5-2 billion annually in revenue. The company's employee count grew significantly from the 70-person nadir mentioned in 2014 to over 1,000 employees by 2023.

**Company Outcome:** Exelixis transformed from a company on the brink of collapse to a profitable, commercially successful biopharmaceutical company. The company continues to develop additional compounds and expand cabozantinib into combination therapies and additional indications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article Predictions vs. Reality:**

• **"If nothing comes up there [RCC and HCC trials], I'd have to think that this will be it for them"**  
**Outcome (✗ Incorrect):** The opposite occurred. Both the RCC and HCC trials showed efficacy, leading to FDA approvals and transforming Exelixis into a successful commercial company. The company survived and thrived.

• **"The prostate results don't offer much room for optimism" for the remaining trials**  
**Outcome (✗ Incorrect):** Despite the prostate cancer failure, cabozantinib demonstrated strong efficacy in both RCC and HCC, becoming a standard treatment option in these indications.

• **"Those two remaining indications are tough ones... not the first battlefields you'd choose"**  
**Outcome (Mixed):** The statement about difficulty was correct—both RCC and HCC are challenging therapeutic areas. However, cabozantinib succeeded where the article was pessimistic, achieving meaningful clinical benefit and FDA approval in both indications.

• **"[Exelixis will try] to stay alive long enough to get through these last trials"**  
**Outcome (✓ Accurate, short-term):** The company did survive the period, though the concern about viability was legitimate given the 2014 circumstances.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrates the high-stakes unpredictability of drug development, where a single clinical readout can appear to doom a company, yet subsequent trials in different indications can trigger a dramatic turnaround that transforms both the drug's trajectory and the company's survival.
