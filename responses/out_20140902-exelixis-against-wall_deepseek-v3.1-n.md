# Analysis of "Exelixis Against the Wall" (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Exelixis facing a critical juncture in September 2014. The company, which once boasted an extensive pipeline of kinase inhibitors, had experienced multiple clinical failures and partnership reversals over the preceding years. The immediate crisis stemmed from disappointing Phase III results for cabozantinib in prostate cancer—while the drug showed some improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), it failed to demonstrate benefit in overall survival (OS), which the FDA considered the primary meaningful endpoint. Due to this failure, Exelixis announced a dramatic workforce reduction from 330 to just 70 employees, conserving resources to complete two remaining cabozantinib trials in renal cell carcinoma and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The company's survival essentially depended on these final trials, though the article noted that cabozantinib had orphan drug status for medullary thyroid cancer where it had shown real clinical benefit.

## 2. HISTORY

**Subsequent Developments (2014-2024):**

Exelixis did not collapse as the article suggested might happen. Instead, the company engineered a remarkable turnaround:

- **Cabozantinib (Cabometyx) Approvals**: Following the 2014 prostate cancer failure, cabozantinib received FDA approval for:
  - Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in April 2016
  - Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in January 2019  
  - Previously treated medullary thyroid cancer (approved 2012, the orphan indication mentioned in the article)

- **Clinical Success**: The "last two trials" referenced in the article—RCC and HCC—both succeeded. Cabozantinib demonstrated meaningful overall survival benefits in these indications, unlike the prostate cancer trial that failed.

- **Company Recovery**: Exelixis recovered financially and grew significantly. By the late 2010s, the company was generating over $1 billion annually in revenue from cabozantinib and expanded its workforce substantially beyond the 70-employee nadir of 2014.

- **Pipeline Expansion**: The company expanded beyond cabozantinib, developing additional oncology compounds and building a more diversified clinical portfolio.

- **Market Performance**: Exelixis became a profitable, sustainable biotechnology company rather than facing the predicted corporate demise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article Prediction**: "if nothing comes up there [in the RCC and HCC trials], I'd have to think that this will be it for them" - suggesting Exelixis would likely fail as a company if these remaining trials didn't succeed.

**Reality**: This prediction proved incorrect. The RCC and HCC trials did succeed, leading to FDA approvals that transformed Exelixis into a commercially successful company. Rather than representing "the end," these trials became the foundation of the company's subsequent growth and profitability.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile of interest. It's a compelling case study of biotech volatility and the difficulty of predicting clinical outcomes, but it's most valuable as a historical snapshot of how quickly fortunes can change in drug development. The dramatic contrast between the article's pessimistic assessment and what actually transpired makes it particularly instructive for understanding: (1) the binary nature of clinical trial outcomes and their company-defining consequences, (2) how orphan drug designations can anchor a company's survival strategy, and (3) the limitations of making definitive predictions about biotech companies based on single trial failures. The Exelixis story became a notable example of biotech turnaround and resilience in an industry where many companies do indeed fail after major clinical setbacks.
