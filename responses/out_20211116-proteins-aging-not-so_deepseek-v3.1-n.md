# Proteins Aging, Not So Gracefully (November 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article explores protein turnover and longevity, highlighting the dramatic range from rapidly degraded proteins like the transcription factor c-Myc (half-life of 20-30 minutes in normal cells, extended in cancer cells) to extremely long-lived proteins found in tissues like the eye lens. These lens proteins can persist for decades without cellular maintenance or enzymatic activity, making them vulnerable to age-related chemical degradation processes that eventually contribute to cataract formation.

The author identifies four key spontaneous degradation mechanisms that accumulate over time: nonenzymatic peptide cleavage (especially adjacent to aspartic acid and asparagine residues, with glutamate/glutamine showing similar behavior in recent research); protein crosslinking through phosphorylated serines/threonines; racemization of chiral amino acid centers (particularly affecting aspartic acid, asparagine, and serine); and deamidation of asparagine residues. The article suggests that asparagine appears "problematic" due to its involvement in multiple degradation pathways, and notes that evolutionary pressure likely hasn't selected against these slow degradation processes since they predominantly affect organisms after reproductive age.

## 2. HISTORY

Since November 2021, research on protein aging and stability has continued to advance, though no revolutionary clinical interventions targeting long-lived protein degradation have reached widespread clinical practice.

**Cataract research and drug development** has seen continued investigation of compounds targeting lens protein aggregation. However, no FDA-approved small molecule drugs have emerged that significantly reverse or prevent age-related cataracts through stabilization of crystalline proteins. Cataract surgery remains the primary treatment, with ongoing refinement of intraocular lens technology, but pharmaceutical interventions targeting the underlying protein degradation chemistry have not reached clinical practice despite decades of research.

**c-Myc as a cancer target** has remained challenging, as predicted in the article. While numerous academic and industry efforts continue targeting Myc pathways, no small-molecule Myc inhibitor has achieved FDA approval through 2024. The target's "undruggable" reputation persists due to its disordered protein structure and complex regulatory networks. Some approaches have shifted toward indirect Myc pathway modulation or targeting downstream effectors, but direct Myc inhibition remains elusive despite decades of research.

**The broader field of protein stability in aging** has gained attention in biogerontology research, with connections to other protein aggregation diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) receiving substantial research investment. However, the specific chemical degradation mechanisms described in the article—nonenzymatic cleavage, crosslinking, racemization, and deamidation—have not yet yielded approved therapies targeting these processes in humans.

**Cataract prevalence and treatment** continues to depend overwhelmingly on surgical intervention rather than preventive pharmacology. The fundamental insight that lens crystallins degrade through spontaneous chemical processes has informed research but not transformed treatment paradigms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was more descriptive than predictive, but several implicit outlooks can be evaluated:

• **"Perhaps we can find ways to do a better job protecting these long-lived proteins"**: This general hope for therapeutic interventions targeting protein degradation chemistry has not yet materialized in clinical practice. While research continues, no FDA-approved drugs specifically targeting nonenzymatic protein degradation mechanisms have emerged for cataract prevention or other age-related protein stability issues by late 2024.

• **Implicit outlook on c-Myc drug development**: The article's skeptical tone ("Don't be too shocked if they don't work, though, because people have been taking swings at that target for decades") has proven accurate. c-Myc remains an undrugged target through 2024 despite continued research efforts by major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms.

• **Implicit outlook on cataract treatment evolution**: The article's focus on underlying chemical mechanisms suggested potential for pharmacological interventions, but clinical practice has not shifted away from surgical solutions. If there was an implicit prediction that understanding these mechanisms would lead to preventive or therapeutic drugs, this has not yet occurred.

• **Broader implication for aging research**: The idea that protein degradation chemistry represents an important aging mechanism has continued to receive research attention, particularly in the context of other protein aggregation diseases, but tangible therapeutic interventions based on stabilizing long-lived proteins have not reached clinical fruition.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article synthesizes established protein turnover concepts with specific chemical degradation mechanisms in an accessible way, highlighting the tension between evolutionary fitness and post-reproductive aging processes, but the practical impact on drug development or clinical practice has remained limited through 2024.
