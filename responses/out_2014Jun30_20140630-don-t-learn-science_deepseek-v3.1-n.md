# Retrospective Analysis: "Don't Learn to Science?" (2014 Science Magazine)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article from Science Magazine's "Pipeline" blog, titled "Don't Learn to Science?", was written in response to a popular tech blog post arguing against the "learn to code" movement. The author, a chemist named Derek Lowe, applied this same logic to science education, questioning whether extensive scientific knowledge was essential for every citizen.

The piece was highly nuanced. Lowe started by agreeing with the argument that not everyone needs to be a programmer, using Michael Bloomberg as an example of someone who could perform his job without coding skills. He then extended this reasoning to chemistry and biology, arguing against the idea that deep scientific literacy was necessary for every person. While acknowledging that *some* basic scientific understanding is important for avoiding scams and making informed decisions, Lowe questioned the value of forcing advanced chemistry or detailed scientific knowledge on everyone. He advocated for strengthening the basic science education that already existed, rather than pushing for more advanced scientific literacy across the board. The author made a clear distinction between basic understanding and expert-level knowledge, suggesting that mental exercise from learning science was valuable, just as physical exercise is beneficial beyond any specific athletic need.

## 2. HISTORY

The article appeared in 2014, a pivotal year that preceded significant societal shifts in how both coding and science are perceived and valued. The subsequent eight years (2014-2022) witnessed several major developments that are highly relevant to the article's themes:

**Coding and Tech Culture:** The years immediately after 2014 saw an unprecedented explosion in coding bootcamps, "everyone should code" initiatives from companies like Apple and Google, and the integration of computational thinking into K-12 education across many developed countries. The "learn to code" movement that the article commented on actually intensified, with coding increasingly framed as a "new literacy." However, by 2020-2022, some of the original critiques started gaining traction again, with growing recognition that not everyone needs to be a developer, and that the tech industry's push for universal coding education may have been somewhat self-serving.

**Science in Society:** The period from 2014-2022 provided perhaps the most dramatic test case imaginable for Lowe's arguments about scientific literacy. The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in late 2019, made scientific understanding—particularly of virology, epidemiology, and statistics—into a matter of life and death for billions of people. Societies with higher baseline scientific literacy generally fared better in terms of public health compliance and policy support. The pandemic revealed both the importance of basic scientific understanding (ability to comprehend exponential growth, understand vaccine mechanisms, evaluate risk) and the dangers of scientific illiteracy (susceptibility to misinformation, inability to distinguish credible from non-credible sources).

Simultaneously, the climate crisis intensified, requiring citizens to understand complex scientific concepts about energy systems, atmospheric physics, and ecological relationships. The rise of social media algorithms created echo chambers where scientific misinformation could flourish, making Lowe's concern about people being vulnerable to pseudoscientific scams even more salient than in 2014.

**Education Trends:** During this period, there was indeed a push for more STEM education, but interestingly, the focus was often on getting more students *interested* in STEM careers rather than ensuring universal advanced scientific literacy. Many educational systems began emphasizing computational thinking, data literacy, and scientific reasoning skills over memorization of specific scientific facts—a direction that actually aligns well with Lowe's mental exercise analogy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

Lowe's article made several explicit and implicit predictions about the value and role of scientific literacy in society. Using the 2014-2022 timeframe as our testing ground:

**Predictions That Matched Reality:**
- **Scams and pseudoscience would continue to be problems:** Absolutely correct. The pandemic era saw an explosion of health scams, from miracle cures to dangerous misinformation. Lowe's examples of ridiculous scientific-sounding claims proved prescient.
- **Basic understanding is what's most needed, not expert-level knowledge:** This appears validated. The pandemic showed that what most people needed was enough scientific literacy to understand exponential growth, evaluate source credibility, and grasp basic concepts like viral transmission—not detailed knowledge of molecular biology.
- **Mental exercise value of science education:** This has been largely supported by educational research showing that scientific reasoning skills transfer to other domains.
- **Focus should be on improving existing science education rather than dramatically expanding it:** This aligns with what actually happened in most educational systems—there was evolution and strengthening of existing STEM programs, but not a radical transformation of curriculum to make everyone a scientist.

**Predictions That Were Partially Wrong:**
- **"It's not clear that a politician needs deep scientific knowledge":** The Trump administration (2017-2021) and the pandemic response revealed this to be more complicated. While politicians don't need to be scientists, their ability (or inability) to understand scientific advice and distinguish credible from non-credible scientific sources proved critically important. The absence of scientific literacy in leadership had devastating consequences.
- **Focus on "how computers and the Internet work" over coding:** This was partially correct, but the two became increasingly intertwined. Understanding algorithms, data privacy, and digital systems required some level of computational thinking that blurred the lines between coding and general digital literacy.

**Predictions That Were Too Pessimistic:**
Lowe seemed skeptical that improving scientific literacy would substantially help with scam resistance, but the pandemic experience suggested that populations with better baseline scientific literacy did show greater resilience to misinformation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 7/9**

This article deserves a high interest score (7 out of 9) for several reasons:

**Long-term importance:** The article touched on a fundamental tension in democratic societies—how much specialized knowledge do citizens need? This question became critically important during the pandemic and will remain crucial as technologies like AI, genetic engineering, and climate solutions become more prevalent.

**Prescience:** While Lowe couldn't have predicted the pandemic, his discussion of scientific scams and the importance of basic scientific reasoning proved remarkably prescient. His "mental exercise" analogy has held up well as educational research has increasingly focused on transferable reasoning skills rather than content knowledge.

**Nuanced thinking:** Unlike many pieces in the "science education" debate, this article resisted the temptation to either dismiss scientific literacy entirely or claim it was the solution to all problems. Its acknowledgment that different people need different levels and types of scientific knowledge was sophisticated and has aged better than more extreme positions.

**Practical impact:** The questions raised here influenced (and continue to influence) real educational policy decisions about what scientific knowledge is essential for all citizens versus what should be left to specialists.

The article isn't quite a 9 because it was more of a thoughtful blog post than a rigorous analysis, and some of its specific predictions (like the focus on Internet literacy over coding) ended up being too narrowly framed. But it demonstrated remarkable insight into a problem that would become even more critical in subsequent years. Eight years later, the tension between making everyone scientifically literate versus recognizing that specialization is necessary remains unresolved—and Lowe's thoughtful framing of this tension makes the article worth reading today.
