# NEJM vs. Its Contributors, Round Two (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reports on an escalating dispute between the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and contributors to the VIGOR (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research) trial of the arthritis drug Vioxx (rofecoxib). The controversy centered on three myocardial infarction (heart attack) events in the Vioxx treatment group that were not included in the published data. NEJM issued an "Expression of Concern" and later reaffirmed it, alleging that these events were improperly excluded from the submitted manuscript.

The academic authors (led by Claire Bombardier) and Merck representatives defended their methodology, explaining that a prespecified cutoff date (February 10, 2000) was established for cardiovascular event reporting, which differed from the cutoff date for gastrointestinal events (March 9, 2000). They maintained that the three heart attacks occurred after this cardiovascular cutoff date and were therefore appropriately excluded from the locked database used in their analysis and manuscript. The authors argued that including these events would not meaningfully change the reported relative risk (0.4% vs 0.1% MI rates for Vioxx vs naproxen, respectively). They also noted that cardiovascular events were not a prespecified primary endpoint of the gastrointestinal outcomes study.

The article's author sided with Merck and its academic collaborators, suggesting NEJM was overreaching in its criticism, though acknowledging that reputational damage to Merck had likely already occurred.

## 2. HISTORY

**Vioxx Withdrawal and Subsequent Developments:**
Vioxx (rofecoxib) was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by Merck in September 2004 due to cardiovascular safety concerns identified in the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on Vioxx) trial, which showed increased cardiovascular risk with long-term use. The withdrawal was one of the largest drug recalls in pharmaceutical history and marked a watershed moment in drug safety regulation and pharmacovigilance.

**Settlement and Legal Impact:**
In November 2007, Merck agreed to a $4.85 billion settlement to resolve approximately 50,000 lawsuits from patients who claimed they suffered heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx. The company maintained that it acted responsibly and that the evidence of harm only became clear through post-approval surveillance data. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical litigation resolutions in U.S. history and had significant financial and reputational consequences for Merck.

**Republished Analysis and Updated Findings:**
Additional data and analyses emerged over subsequent years that prompted NEJM to publish updated versions or corrected data. However, by the time of these editorial disputes in 2005-2006, the drug had already been withdrawn, making the debate about the data handling in the original VIGOR publication largely academic from a public health perspective, though highly significant for questions of scientific integrity and publication ethics.

**Methodological Impacts and Legacy:**
The Vioxx controversy led to increased scrutiny of selective reporting of adverse events in clinical trials and highlighted the importance of transparent data handling and comprehensive safety reporting. It prompted discussions around the ethics of industry-sponsored research and the responsibility of both pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers in ensuring complete and accurate reporting of trial results.

**Merck's Recovery:**
Despite the Vioxx withdrawal and associated costs, Merck continued operations and maintained market position. The company developed new drugs and remained a major player in the pharmaceutical industry, though the Vioxx episode remained a defining moment in its corporate history and served as a cautionary tale for the entire industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction about manuscript submissions:**
The article predicted that "editors of JAMA and the other top-ranked medical journals" would benefit by receiving manuscripts that "otherwise would have gone to NEJM" due to the reputational damage from the editorial dispute. 

**Outcome:** This prediction proved directionally correct in terms of general journal competition dynamics, though difficult to quantify empirically. NEJM maintained its premier status and continued receiving high-quality submissions, but the episode highlighted broader concerns about publication integrity that affected author considerations across top-tier medical journals. The controversy did contribute to increased awareness of journal oversight responsibilities and possibly influenced some authors' decisions about where to submit sensitive or controversial research.

**• Implicit prediction about the ongoing significance of the debate:**
The author suggested that "the damage has already been done" from Merck's viewpoint, implying the public and scientific community had already formed negative opinions regardless of the technical merits of the data exclusion arguments.

**Outcome:** This proved prescient. Despite the authors' defense that including the three heart attacks wouldn't meaningfully change results, the larger narrative about Vioxx's cardiovascular risks had already crystallized following the drug's withdrawal. The technical debate over cutoff dates and specific MI events became secondary to the broader public health outcome, where Vioxx's withdrawal and subsequent litigation largely defined public perception and policy discussions about drug safety regulation.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article captures a critical moment in pharmaceutical history where questions of data transparency, publication ethics, and corporate responsibility intersected with significant public health outcomes. The Vioxx controversy fundamentally shaped drug safety monitoring and regulatory practices, making this documentation of the scientific debate highly relevant to understanding how evidence-based medicine operates under commercial pressures.
