# Their Crime? Collaborating With Other Scientists... (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary by Derek Lowe highlighting the case of two Iranian physician brothers, Arash and Kamiar Alaei, who were sentenced to prison by Iranian authorities on charges of "communicating with an enemy government." The article explains that their actual activities consisted of attending international HIV/AIDS conferences, discussing public health challenges in Iran, and collaborating with US-based organizations on HIV prevention and treatment efforts. The piece criticizes the Iranian government's hypocrisy, noting that while President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly promoted international scientific collaboration, Iranian authorities were imprisoning scientists for precisely such activities. The commentary expresses solidarity with the Alaei brothers and hopes for international pressure to secure their release.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, significant developments occurred in the Alaei brothers' case and Iran's approach to scientist collaboration:

**Release and Aftermath:**
- Kamiar Alaei was released from prison in 2010 after serving approximately two years of his three-year sentence
- Arash Alaei was released in 2011 after serving roughly three years of his six-year sentence
- Both brothers were eventually allowed to leave Iran and resettled in the United States, where they continued their HIV/AIDS advocacy and academic work
- They became affiliated with SUNY Albany's School of Public Health

**Continued Academic Impact:**
- The brothers continued their research on HIV prevention, particularly focusing on harm reduction programs and treatment in developing countries
- They published extensively on public health approaches to HIV/AIDS and drug addiction treatment
- Their work maintained international recognition within the global health community

**Iran's Scientific Relations:**
- Iran has continued a pattern of restricting foreign collaboration for scientists, with periodic arrests and accusations against researchers
- The tensions reflect broader US-Iran political relations, with scientific collaboration remaining hostage to geopolitical dynamics
- Despite restrictions, Iranian scientists have continued to publish internationally, though with ongoing risks

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions in the article and their outcomes:**

• **Derek Lowe hoped international pressure would secure the brothers' release or successful appeal**
  - **Outcome:** Partially successful - both brothers were eventually released but served substantial portions of their sentences (Kamiar ~2 years, Arash ~3 years), though appeals did not appear to succeed
  - International attention from scientific organizations, human rights groups, and media likely contributed to eventual releases

• **Concern that Iranian scientists would continue working under restrictive conditions**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate - Iran maintained restrictions on scientific collaboration, with periodic arrests of researchers continuing in subsequent years
  - The "handcuffs" metaphor proved prescient as the government continued to arrest scientists for international collaboration activities

• **Implicit concern about Iran's commitment to scientific openness versus its public statements**
  - **Outcome:** Accurate assessment of hypocrisy - the gap between Iran's rhetoric about scientific collaboration and its actual treatment of collaborating scientists persisted and remains evident today

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article addressed an important human rights and scientific freedom issue but had limited direct impact on biological understanding, clinical outcomes, or biotechnology business development. While highlighting ongoing tensions affecting scientific collaboration, the piece is primarily important as a historical footnote about individual persecution and has limited lasting scientific significance compared to breakthrough research articles or broad industry trends analyses.
