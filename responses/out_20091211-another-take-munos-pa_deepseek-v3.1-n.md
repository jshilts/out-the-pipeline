# Another Take on the Munos Paper (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article serves as a referral post highlighting Eric Milgram's analysis at PharmaConduct of the same Munos paper that the author had been discussing. The article indicates that Milgram's perspective aligns with the author's own views, with both being experienced industry professionals who arrived at similar conclusions. The post mentions that Milgram's analysis includes references to Poisson distributions (a statistical concept also referenced by the original author) and presents additional data worth examining. The article essentially functions as a cross-promotion encouraging readers to check out Milgram's more detailed take on the pharmaceutical industry research being discussed.

## 2. HISTORY

Attempting to analyze subsequent developments presents challenges given the limited substantive content in this particular article. The post appears to be commentary about commentary - a meta-discussion of someone else's analysis of the Munos paper. Without access to either the original Munos paper or Milgram's detailed post, it's difficult to trace specific scientific claims, drug candidates, or policy recommendations that could be assessed for real-world outcomes. The article lacks concrete details about specific biotechnology developments, drug approvals, clinical trials, or business outcomes that could be tracked empirically over time.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains no explicit predictions about future biotechnology developments, drug approvals, policy changes, or business outcomes. It functions purely as a referral to someone else's analysis rather than presenting forward-looking statements about the industry's trajectory.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article has minimal standalone value as it primarily serves as a brief referral to more substantive content elsewhere, lacking original analysis or concrete information that would enable meaningful retrospective evaluation of biotechnology industry developments.
