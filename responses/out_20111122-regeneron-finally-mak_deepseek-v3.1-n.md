# Regeneron Finally Makes It to the Market (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes Regeneron's long journey to profitability, noting that after over 20 years in business (founded in the late 1980s) and burning through over $2 billion, the company was finally achieving its first major market success with Eylea (aflibercept), a VEGF-based therapy for macular degeneration approved by the FDA in November 2011. The author provides context about Regeneron's earlier struggles, including failed efforts on nerve growth factors for ALS in the early 1990s and the Axokine obesity drug project that was abandoned in 2003 due to antibody development problems. While Regeneron had received approval for Arcalyst (rilonacept) in 2008, it was described as barely covering expenses. The article mentions promising pipeline projects including expanding Arcalyst for gout prevention and PCSK9-targeting cholesterol drugs in collaboration with Sanofi, framing Regeneron as a rare survivor among biotech startups from that era.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2011 article, Regeneron's trajectory dramatically validated the author's assessment of their potential. Eylea became a blockbuster drug, generating billions in annual revenue and establishing Regeneron as a major player in ophthalmology. The drug received multiple additional FDA approvals for various retinal conditions beyond wet age-related macular degeneration, including diabetic macular edema and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion.

The PCSK9 inhibitor collaboration with Sanofi that was mentioned as promising development materialized into Praluent (alirocumab), approved by the FDA in 2015 for treating high cholesterol. While Praluent faced stiff competition from Amgen's Repatha, it still achieved significant market presence and contributed to Regeneron's revenue streams.

More significantly, the company's COVID-19 response demonstrated their scientific capabilities when they developed REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), an antibody cocktail that received FDA emergency use authorization in 2020. Though later revoked due to reduced efficacy against new variants, it generated massive revenue during the pandemic and showcased Regeneron's rapid response capabilities.

Arcalyst's expansion into gout prevention mentioned in the article did progress, with the drug receiving FDA approval for preventing gout flares in 2020. Overall, Regeneron transformed from the struggling company described in 2011 to a major biopharmaceutical company with multiple approved drugs and substantial profitability, validating the decades of investment and research efforts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **That Regeneron would soon join the ranks of profitable biotech companies**: This prediction proved accurate. Regeneron became consistently profitable in subsequent years, with Eylea driving substantial revenue growth and multiple other products contributing to financial success.

• **That Arcalyst's expanded use in preventative gout therapy was "coming along"**: This proved correct, though it took longer than might have been anticipated. The gout prevention indication was not approved until 2020, nearly nine years after the article was published.

• **Implicit prediction that the PCSK9 collaboration would be fruitful**: The collaboration did produce Praluent, which received FDA approval and achieved market presence, though it faced strong competition and may not have reached the blockbuster status some initially hoped for.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article captures a pivotal moment for a company that would become a major biopharmaceutical success story, written by someone with deep industry knowledge who recognized the significance of Regeneron's persistence paying off after decades of struggle.
