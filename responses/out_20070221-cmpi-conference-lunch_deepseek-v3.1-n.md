# Lunch With the FDA (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2007 blog-style commentary captures FDA Commissioner Andy von Eschenbach's speech and Q&A at a biotechnology conference. The article describes von Eschenbach's emphasis on improving FDA communication and transparency, moving away from purely reactive drug-safety oversight toward more proactive monitoring. Key themes include balancing free speech rights with factual accuracy in direct-to-consumer advertising, enhancing adverse event reporting systems, and managing resource constraints through PDUFA fee renewals. 

The session touched on several forward-looking topics including genomic information on drug labels (specifically warfarin and tamoxifen), regulation of genetic diagnostic tests, and whether direct-to-consumer genetic testing should bypass physician gatekeepers. Von Eschenbach expressed caution about releasing "omic" data and genetic tests to the public without robust validation, preferring integration into traditional medical practice models.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this 2007 commentary saw significant evolution in FDA practices and policies:

**PDUFA and FDA Resources**: The Prescription Drug User Fee Act was indeed reauthorized in 2007 (PDUFA IV), providing the FDA with increased funding and mandating specific performance goals for drug review times. Subsequent reauthorizations in 2012, 2017, and 2022 continued this framework, significantly expanding FDA's capacity for drug review and post-market surveillance.

**Drug Label Genomics**: The FDA did move forward with genomic information on drug labels. Warfarin labeling was updated in 2007 and 2010 to include information about CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes affecting dosing. Tamoxifen labeling was updated to include CYP2D6 testing considerations. However, uptake of pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice has been gradual rather than transformative, with warfarin pharmacogenetics showing mixed real-world utility studies.

**Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing**: This market expanded dramatically with companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA gaining popularity. In 2013, the FDA ordered 23andMe to stop marketing its health-related genetic tests, but by 2015 approved their carrier status test, followed by other health-related genetic risk reports. The regulatory approach evolved to allow some direct-to-consumer genetic health information while maintaining oversight for higher-risk applications.

**Adverse Event Reporting**: The FDA's adverse event reporting system evolved with implementation of the Sentinel Initiative in 2008, creating an active surveillance system using electronic health data from multiple sources. This represented a significant shift toward the proactive monitoring von Eschenbach advocated.

**Drug Safety Approach**: The FDA moved toward more proactive post-market surveillance, though high-profile safety issues (such as those with Vioxx, Avandia, and later opioid medications) continued to demonstrate that reaction to emerging safety signals remained a major component of FDA activity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Pharmacogenomics on Drug Labels**
- **Prediction**: von Eschenbach anticipated that "omic" information would need robust data before appearing on drug labels, but acknowledged "this is coming on"
- **Outcome**: The FDA did implement pharmacogenomic information on labels, notably for warfarin (2007-2010) and tamoxifen. However, clinical adoption has been slower than anticipated, and the real-world impact on patient outcomes has been modest rather than revolutionary for most applications.

**Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing Regulation**
- **Prediction**: The questioner suggested bypassing physicians as genetic gatekeepers, while von Eschenbach expressed reluctance to "turn these things loose on the public" and preferred integration into medical models
- **Outcome**: The market evolved toward a hybrid model. DTC genetic testing flourished for ancestry and some health applications, but the FDA maintained regulatory oversight, particularly after the 2013 enforcement action against 23andMe. Most clinical-grade genetic testing still operates through healthcare providers, though consumer access expanded significantly.

**Adverse Event Monitoring Evolution**
- **Prediction**: von Eschenbach wanted to move beyond purely reactive safety monitoring and implement systems detecting both adverse events and "unexpected efficacy"
- **Outcome**: The FDA made substantial progress in proactive surveillance through the Sentinel System and other active monitoring approaches. However, drug safety crises continued to emerge, and the promised comprehensive benefit-risk assessment system remains incomplete.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

While this captures an interesting historical moment of FDA leadership during the genomics boom, the content is more conversational than substantive, with limited lasting significance beyond documenting the agency's general direction during that period.
