# Another Blogroll Update (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from December 2009 is a simple resource list update rather than a commentary article about the biotechnology industry. The author announces the addition of several new links to their blogroll across three categories: blogs (Intermolecular, Natural Product Man, Experimental Error), chemistry data resources (Synthetic Pages, Not Voodoo, Organic Chemistry Portal), and the correction of an oversight by adding Ben Goldacre's Bad Science blog, which the author had previously linked to but inexplicably omitted from the blogroll.

The post contains no analysis, predictions, or commentary about biotechnology developments, trends, or industry dynamics. It is purely a curation announcement directing readers to useful chemistry and science-related websites.

## 2. HISTORY

This blogroll update served as a snapshot of scientific blogging and chemistry resources circa 2009. In the years that followed, the science blogging ecosystem underwent significant evolution. Ben Goldacre's Bad Science grew into one of the most influential science communication platforms, with Goldacre becoming a prominent advocate for evidence-based medicine and critical thinking, later authoring multiple bestselling books including "Bad Science" and "Bad Pharma."

The chemistry and scientific community continued shifting toward digital platforms and open-access resources. Many of the linked sites likely evolved, merged, or became obsolete as the internet landscape changed and platforms like Twitter, research-focused social networks, and institutional repositories became more prominent for scientific communication and resource sharing.

The period from 2009-2015 marked substantial growth in science blogging and online scientific communities, followed by platform consolidation and greater institutional engagement with social media and digital outreach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This post contained no predictions about biotechnology, scientific developments, or industry trends. As a simple resource list announcement, it did not attempt to forecast future developments in chemistry, drug discovery, or scientific communication methods.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This blog post is not a commentary article about biotechnology and contains no analysis of the biotech industry, making it inappropriate for the requested retrospective analysis format. It is simply a blogroll update announcement with no substantive biotechnology content.
