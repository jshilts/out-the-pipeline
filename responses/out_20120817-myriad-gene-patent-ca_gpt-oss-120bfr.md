# The Myriad Gene Patent Case: Trickier Than You Might Think (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article explains the legal battle over Myriad Genetics’ patents on isolated DNA sequences of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and on methods for testing those mutations. In the 1990s Myriad obtained patents covering the gene sequences themselves and the diagnostic assays, then sent cease‑and‑desist letters to other labs (notably the University of Pennsylvania’s Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory). By 1999 Myriad was the sole commercial provider of BRCA testing in the United States.  

A district‑court decision (2011) held the patents invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101, reasoning that isolated DNA is a “product of nature” and that the method claims were abstract mental steps. The article notes that the decision was appealed and that the appellate court (the Federal Circuit) reversed on the patent‑eligibility question, declaring isolated DNA “markedly different” from its natural counterpart because of the chemical manipulation involved. The author stresses that the case is about patent eligibility, not about the broader policy issues of whether a single company should control a life‑saving test.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Supreme Court decision (June 2013).**  
The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court as *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.* The Court held that naturally occurring DNA sequences, even when isolated, are not patent‑eligible subject matter. However, it distinguished complementary DNA (cDNA), which is synthetically created and therefore patent‑eligible. This ruling essentially adopted the district court’s view on the “product of nature” doctrine and rejected the Federal Circuit’s “markedly different” rationale.

**Impact on Myriad’s market position.**  
- After the decision, Myriad lost its exclusive right to the BRCA test. Competitors (e.g., Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics, and academic labs) entered the market, driving the price of BRCA testing down from roughly $3,000 – $4,000 per test to under $200 by the mid‑2010s.  
- Myriad’s revenue from BRCA testing fell sharply; the company shifted focus to other oncology assets, including next‑generation sequencing panels and targeted‑therapy development. It later merged with Bristol‑Myers Squibb (2020) and is now part of the BMS Oncology portfolio.

**Broader patent landscape.**  
- The *Myriad* ruling prompted the USPTO to issue new guidance (2014) clarifying that claims directed to isolated natural DNA are not eligible, while cDNA and other engineered nucleic acids remain patentable.  
- Numerous pending gene‑patent applications were abandoned or narrowed; several lower‑court cases (e.g., *In re BRCA1/2* at the USPTO) were dismissed on § 101 grounds.  
- The decision reinforced the “product of nature” line of cases (e.g., *Mayo v. Prometheus*, *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad*), influencing later disputes over CRISPR‑Cas9 and other genome‑editing technologies. The Supreme Court’s 2021 decision in *Myriad*‑related *Myriad v. Association for Molecular Pathology* (the same case) remains the controlling precedent.

**Clinical and public‑health outcomes.**  
- Wider availability of BRCA testing increased uptake: by 2020, over 1 million U.S. individuals had been screened, compared with roughly 200,000 before 2013.  
- Insurance coverage for BRCA testing expanded, partly because the market competition lowered costs and because the test became a standard preventive service under the Affordable Care Act.  
- The case spurred legislative proposals (e.g., the “Genetic Information Patent Reform Act”) but none have been enacted; the Supreme Court’s decision remains the primary driver of policy.

**Scientific practice.**  
- Researchers continued to use BRCA sequences freely for basic science; the ruling clarified that “research use” exemptions were unnecessary for natural DNA.  
- Commercial diagnostic companies now focus on proprietary methods (e.g., next‑generation sequencing pipelines, bioinformatic algorithms) rather than on claiming the DNA itself.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** “The appeals court will reverse the district‑court decision.”  
  - *Outcome:* Correct. The Federal Circuit reversed on eligibility, and the Supreme Court later affirmed the ineligibility of isolated natural DNA.

- **Implicit prediction:** “If society wants DNA treated differently, Congress must act; courts will not rewrite the statute.”  
  - *Outcome:* Largely accurate. No major congressional amendment has been passed; the Supreme Court’s interpretation remains the governing rule.

- **Implicit expectation:** “Myriad’s exclusive control of BRCA testing will be challenged, potentially opening the market.”  
  - *Outcome:* Realized. Competition entered the market after 2013, dramatically reducing test prices and expanding access.

- **Unstated speculation (common at the time):** “Patents on other disease‑related genes might survive if they are claimed as isolated molecules.”  
  - *Outcome:* Mostly false. The *Myriad* decision set a precedent that isolated natural DNA is not patent‑eligible, leading to the invalidation or narrowing of many other gene patents (e.g., patents on CFTR, LDLR, and other disease genes).

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **8/10**  

The article captures a pivotal moment in biotechnology law that reshaped patent practice, commercial diagnostics, and public‑health access to genetic testing. Its detailed legal analysis and forward‑looking commentary make it highly relevant for scientists, lawyers, and policy makers.
