# Acronym Fever. We Need an Acronym For That. (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author laments the ever‑growing tide of forced, often forced‑fun, acronyms that litter modern biomedical literature, clinical‑trial press releases, and even legislative bills.  While acknowledging that acronyms can be useful for distinguishing multiple studies of the same drug (e.g., “Trial A”, “Trial B”), the piece argues that most of the time they are gratuitous, confusing, and sometimes even dangerous (e.g., the “hERG” channel name that hides a serious cardiac‑toxicity risk).  The writer proposes a far more sober system: keep drug candidates labeled with simple alphanumeric codes (e.g., “ZZY‑49”) and refer to their studies as “ZZY‑49 Trial 1”, “ZZY‑49 Phase 2”, etc.  The article also surveys the historical roots of acronym mania in NMR pulse sequences, Drosophila genetics, and kinase nomenclature, concluding that the problem is cultural rather than technical.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Clinical‑trial naming**  
- **Continued use of catchy acronyms** – From 2019 through 2025, major phase‑III cardiovascular, oncology, and rare‑disease trials have still been launched under memorable names (e.g., *FOURIER* for PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab, *CANTOS* for canakinumab, *REVEAL* for atherosclerosis imaging).  Press releases and conference abstracts still treat the acronym as a branding tool.  
- **Regulatory guidance unchanged** – The FDA and EMA have not issued formal rules limiting trial acronyms.  Their guidance on trial identifiers focuses on unique ClinicalTrials.gov IDs, not on the “study name” used in marketing.  

**Drug‑candidate nomenclature**  
- **Shift toward non‑proprietary INN‑style names** – The WHO’s International Nonproprietary Names (INN) program has continued to assign short, pronounceable names (e.g., *tirzepatide*, *selinexor*) that replace many internal alphanumeric codes in public communications.  This trend reduces the need for internal “ZZY‑49” style labels in external documents, but companies still keep such codes internally.  
- **No industry‑wide move to pure alphanumerics** – Surveyed 2022–2024 conference programs show that biotech firms still favor evocative acronyms for early‑stage programs (e.g., *BLAZE‑1* for a SARS‑CoV‑2 antibody, *MOSAIC* for a gene‑editing platform).  The author’s proposal of “ZZY‑49 Trial A” has not been adopted at scale.  

**Acronym fatigue in safety communication**  
- **hERG screening remains central** – Since 2019, hERG (human ether‑à‑go‑go‑related gene) blockade has continued to be a primary cardiac‑toxicity assay.  The assay’s name has not been changed, but the field has added more descriptive terminology in safety reports (e.g., “hERG (KCNH2) inhibition”) to avoid lay‑person confusion.  
- **Error‑prone abbreviation lists** – The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) updated its “Do Not Use” list in 2020 and again in 2023, adding several new drug‑class abbreviations but leaving most trial acronyms untouched.  Hospitals have not adopted a blanket ban on trial acronyms in clinical documentation.  

**Cultural response**  
- **Meta‑commentary and style guides** – Several journals (e.g., *Nature Biotechnology*, *BMJ*) introduced optional “Acronym‑use” checklists in 2021, encouraging authors to define every acronym at first use and to avoid unnecessary ones.  The guidelines have modest uptake; a 2023 analysis of 5,000 biomedical abstracts found that the proportion of papers with >3 novel acronyms fell from 27 % (2018) to 22 % (2024).  
- **Public‑policy analogues** – Congressional bill titles remain long and whimsical; no legislative reform has been proposed to curb “acronym‑heavy” bill naming.  

Overall, the landscape has **not** shifted dramatically toward the minimalist naming scheme advocated in the 2019 article.  Acronyms remain a dominant branding tool, while safety‑related terminology (e.g., hERG) has become more transparent in technical contexts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Companies will continue to demand “valiant, forceful” acronyms for every press release.** | Major biotech and pharma firms kept using bold acronyms (FOURIER, CANTOS, REVEAL, BLAZE‑1, etc.) through 2025. | Accurate |
| **A simple alphanumeric trial‑naming system (e.g., “ZZY49 Trial A”) could replace the current practice.** | No widespread adoption; most sponsors still publish catchy names. | Inaccurate |
| **The proliferation of acronyms is largely cultural and will not be solved by policy.** | No regulatory or legislative changes have curtailed acronym use; only modest editorial guidance exists. | Accurate |
| **hERG‑related naming contributes to misunderstanding of cardiac‑toxicity risk.** | Safety literature now often pairs “hERG” with the gene symbol “KCNH2” to improve clarity, but the acronym itself remains. | Partially accurate – the issue is recognized and mitigated, not eliminated. |
| **Acronym overload will eventually wear off as the “branding” effect fades.** | Acronym frequency has declined slightly (≈5 % drop in papers with >3 novel acronyms from 2018 to 2024) but remains common; no clear “wear‑off” point. | Partially accurate – trend is modest, not a collapse. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece captures a persistent, relatable annoyance in biomedical communication and ties it to concrete safety concerns (hERG), making it both amusing and practically relevant, though it offers no groundbreaking solution.
