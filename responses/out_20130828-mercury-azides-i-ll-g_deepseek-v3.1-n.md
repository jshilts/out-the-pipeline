# Mercury Azides. I'll Get Right On Those For You. (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a new *Angewandte Chemie* paper describing the synthesis of various mercury azide compounds. The author, writing in the "Things I Won't Work With" series, highlights the extreme dangers of these materials. Mercury azides exist in different crystalline forms, with alpha-mercury azide being dangerously sensitive to impact and friction, while beta-mercury azide detonates spontaneously even when handled wet. The paper's main focus is actually the synthesis of the azide salt of Millon's base [Hg₂N]⁺, which requires extraordinarily long and hazardous procedures - one involving heating in an autoclave at 180°C for three weeks, and another requiring 200-300 days of weekly azide treatments under exclusion of light. The author expresses astonishment at the persistence required and the willingness of chemists to work with such dangerous materials.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at the research trajectory since 2013, mercury azide chemistry has remained a highly specialized and extremely dangerous field. Such compounds have no practical pharmaceutical or industrial applications due to their explosive nature and mercury toxicity. The field remains primarily of academic interest in energetic materials research and fundamental inorganic chemistry.

Mercury compounds in general have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny due to environmental and toxicity concerns. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, adopted in 2013, entered into force in 2017, restricting mercury production and use worldwide. This significantly limited any potential development of new mercury-containing materials.

The described compounds have no pathway to pharmaceutical development given mercury's toxicity profile and the compounds' explosive instability. No FDA-approved drugs or commercial applications emerged from this research lineage.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article contained no specific predictions about future developments, treatments, or commercial applications. It was purely descriptive of academic research in energetic materials chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **5/10**

This article is moderately interesting as an entertaining description of extreme chemistry, but has limited long-term importance since mercury azides never developed practical applications and mercury chemistry generally declined due to environmental regulations.
