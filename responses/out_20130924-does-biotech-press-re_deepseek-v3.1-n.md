# When Does a Biotech Press Release Constitute Fraud? (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article examines the legal and ethical boundaries of clinical trial communication through the case of Dr. W. Scott Harkonen, former CEO of InterMune. The company was developing Actimmune (interferon gamma-1b) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive lung disease with no effective treatments at the time. InterMune's Phase III trial failed to meet its primary endpoints, showing no statistically significant difference between drug and placebo overall.

However, a post-hoc analysis of a mild-to-moderate disease subgroup showed a dramatic survival benefit - 5% mortality on drug versus 16% on placebo, with a highly significant P value of 0.004. The problem: this subgroup analysis was not pre-specified in the trial protocol, making it susceptible to the statistical pitfall of "data dredging" - where enough subgroup analysis will eventually yield false-positive results by chance alone.

Harkonen authored a press release with headlines claiming "Phase III Data Demonstrating Survival Benefit" and "Reduces Mortality by 70% in Patients with Mild to Moderate Disease." While the text mentioned the study missed primary endpoints, it omitted that the subgroup analysis was post-hoc. This led to his conviction for wire fraud, which was under appeal at the time of the article.

## 2. HISTORY

**Legal Outcome:** Harkonen's case continued through the appeals process. He did not ultimately succeed in overturning his conviction. The case became a cautionary example of the legal risks associated with selective reporting of clinical trial data.

**Actimmune's Clinical Development:** The article's footnote proved prescient - InterMune's subsequent trial specifically targeting mild-to-moderate IPF patients definitively showed that Actimmune did not work for IPF. The post-hoc subgroup finding from the original trial was indeed a false positive, validating concerns about data dredging.

**IPF Treatment Landscape:** The article's context about IPF having "basically no therapies" changed significantly after 2014. Two drugs achieved FDA approval for IPF: 
- Pirfenidone (Esbriet) - approved 2014
- Nintedanib (Ofev) - approved 2014

Both drugs demonstrated modest but real efficacy in slowing disease progression, representing the first approved therapies for this devastating disease. Actimmune never gained IPF approval and remains available only for its original rare disease indications.

**Industry Impact:** The Harkonen case reinforced regulatory scrutiny of post-hoc analyses and selective data presentation. The case became a teaching example in medical communications and biostatistics courses about the dangers of undisclosed exploratory analyses.

**Scientific Methodology:** The concerns about data dredging raised in this case contributed to a growing awareness in the medical community. This aligned with the broader movement toward greater transparency in clinical trials, including the push for pre-specification of analyses and public registration of trial protocols.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions through its analysis:

- **That the Supreme Court might take the case to clarify commercial speech boundaries**: **Result: Mixed/Unclear**. The article speculated the case might reach the Supreme Court to untangle commercial speech issues, particularly for publicly traded companies where press releases affect stock prices. While the legal principle remains relevant, the specific case did not fundamentally reshape First Amendment protections for commercial speech in ways that dramatically changed biotech communications.

- **That the mild-to-moderate subgroup finding was likely a false positive**: **Result: Correct**. The article noted InterMune was running another trial specifically on mild-to-moderate IPF patients and included the footnote acknowledging it "didn't work." This prediction was empirically validated when the follow-up trial definitively failed, proving the original subgroup finding was indeed a statistical artifact of data dredging rather than a real treatment effect.

- **That this case would illuminate the boundaries between scientific interpretation and fraud**: **Result: Partially Correct**. The case did establish that undisclosed post-hoc analyses in promotional materials could constitute fraud, serving as a cautionary precedent. However, the broader biotech industry has continued to grapple with these boundaries, with various companies facing scrutiny for selective presentation of clinical data over the subsequent decade.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures a specific case at the intersection of clinical science, regulatory oversight, and legal accountability that proved instructive for the industry. While the particular drug and legal case had limited broader impact, the underlying issues about post-hoc analysis and appropriate communication remain perennially relevant in biopharmaceutical development. The case serves as a concrete example of statistical principles with real legal and clinical consequences.
