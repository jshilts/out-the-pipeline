# Possibly The Most Bungled Clinical Trial Ever? (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post critiques XBiotech's Phase III oncology trial execution based on the company's own press release. The author highlights XBiotech's unusual public admission that their trial suffered from significant implementation failures: the company had not yet received or analyzed all patient samples and data, and the study execution produced disappointing findings. The post uses dark humor to describe the press release as reading like "a compressed horror novel" and notes grammatical errors in the company's statements, suggesting they may have been written under stress or after drinking. The article also references the dramatic negative impact on XBiotech's stock price, which experienced a severe decline following the revelations about the bungled trial.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the November 2015 revelations, XBiotech's lead product candidate was bermekimab (formerly MABp1), an antibody targeting IL-1α, which was being evaluated for colorectal cancer. The trial in question was the Phase III study for this indication.

Subsequent developments: XBiotech did not gain FDA approval for bermekimab in colorectal cancer, and the company shifted its focus away from oncology applications. XBiotech later pursued bermekimab for inflammatory diseases, particularly Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). In March 2024, XBiotech announced the sale of bermekimab rights to Johnson & Johnson for an initial $750 million plus milestones, specifically for HS and other inflammatory indications - not cancer. XBiotech's oncology program appears to have been de-prioritized or abandoned following the 2015 trial failures. The company has since pivoted toward other therapeutic areas, including COVID-19 treatments and other inflammatory conditions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **No explicit predictions were made in the article**, which focused primarily on criticizing the immediate trial failures and management responses.
- **Implicit implications**: The tone suggested the company faced serious credibility and financial challenges that would be difficult to overcome.
- **Actual outcome**: While the immediate aftermath was devastating for XBiotech's stock and oncology program, the company successfully pivoted to inflammatory disease applications for bermekimab and eventually achieved a major pharmaceutical partnership with J&J, demonstrating a partial recovery and strategic shift rather than complete failure.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5/10**

This article captures an important case study in clinical trial management failures and corporate disclosure, but its relatively niche focus on a single company's trial problems limits broader significance compared to industry-wide regulatory or scientific breakthroughs.
