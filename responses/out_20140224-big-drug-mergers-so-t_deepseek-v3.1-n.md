# Big Drug Mergers: So They're OK, Right? (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques a McKinsey Consulting report claiming that pharmaceutical megamergers "work" based primarily on shareholder value metrics. The author highlights a counterargument from John LaMattina, former head of R&D at Pfizer, who argued from firsthand experience that megamergers create immense organizational disruption, research team conflicts, talent loss, and pipeline damage that may take years to become apparent. The article notes that while Pfizer's stock (PFE) had significantly outperformed the S&P 500 since 2008 when many mergers occurred, this shareholder-value-centric view ignores the hidden costs: drugs that were never discovered due to disrupted R&D and scientific focus being diverted to personal survival during lengthy integration periods. The piece raises concerns about whether these mergers ultimately harmed pharmaceutical innovation despite apparent financial success.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's 2014 publication, the pharmaceutical industry continued experiencing major M&A activity with mixed outcomes:

**Merger Activity:**
- **2015-2019:** Major deals included Pfizer's $160B acquisition of Allergan (ultimately abandoned due to tax inversion rules), Shire's $32B purchase by Takeda (2019), Celgene's $74B acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (announced 2019), and AbbVie's $63B purchase of Allergan (2019)

**Pipeline and R&D Impact:**
- Studies published post-2014 consistently showed that megamergers often failed to deliver promised innovation gains. Research in *Nature Reviews Drug Discovery* and other journals found that merged companies frequently reduced overall R&D productivity compared to pre-merger levels
- The FDA approved 59 new drugs in 2018 - a record high - but developed economies increasingly relied on smaller biotech companies and startups rather than merged pharma giants for breakthrough innovations

**Pfizer's Specific Trajectory:**
- Pfizer continued with smaller, strategic acquisitions (Hospira for $17B in 2015, Medivation for $14B in 2016) rather than transformational megamergers
- The company faced continued pipeline challenges; by 2018-2019, Pfizer's R&D pipeline remained below historical peaks despite acquisitions
- Pfizer became a major COVID-19 vaccine developer (BioNTech partnership, 2020-2021), demonstrating that large companies could still achieve scientific breakthroughs under certain conditions

**Industry Dynamics:**
- The "patent cliff" (loss of exclusivity on blockbuster drugs) continued driving M&A activity, with companies seeking scale and marketed products over early-stage R&D
- Industry R&D productivity metrics showed continued declines in output per dollar spent, supporting concerns about merger-driven disruption

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions from the article:**
- McKinsey's prediction: Megamergers "work" when measured by shareholder value
- Author/LaMattina's counter-prediction: Mergers harm R&D pipelines and drug discovery in ways that become apparent years later, ultimately damaging long-term innovation

**What actually happened:**
- **Shareholder value prediction (McKinsey):** Partially verified short-term. Acquiring companies often saw stock price increases post-merger, but long-term value creation remained questionable, with many merged entities underperforming innovation expectations
- **R&D damage prediction (Author/LaMattina):** Supported by subsequent evidence. Multiple studies confirmed that post-merger integration typically reduced R&D productivity, delayed pipeline development, and resulted in fewer new molecular entities reaching market
- **Missing innovation:** The article's question "what might they have done?" proved prescient; academic and industry analyses consistently showed that merged companies produced fewer innovative drugs than would be expected from pre-merger trajectories

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article identified a fundamental tension in pharmaceutical industry strategy (shareholder value vs. innovation capacity) that remained highly relevant throughout the subsequent decade, anticipating later research findings on merger impacts while providing insight into ongoing industry debates about R&D productivity and corporate development strategy.
