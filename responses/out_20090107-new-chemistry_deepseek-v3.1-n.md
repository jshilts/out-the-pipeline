# New Chemistry (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a short commentary from January 2009 discussing the upcoming launch of Nature Chemistry, a new journal from the Nature Publishing Group. The author speculates on whether this new journal can successfully compete with established flagship chemistry journals like JACS and Angewandte Chemie, noting that most new journals typically aim for the middle-tier market rather than high-end prestige. The piece questions whether Nature's brand reputation, which has been strong in other scientific fields, will carry the same weight in chemistry, where Nature has historically paid less attention. The author also predicts that any competitive pressure from a successful Nature Chemistry would likely impact journals one tier down from JACS and Angewandte.

## 2. HISTORY
After its launch in 2009, Nature Chemistry indeed succeeded in establishing itself as a top-tier chemistry journal alongside JACS and Angewandte Chemie. The journal maintained the Nature publishing group's reputation for high editorial standards and impact. It quickly gained recognition and became one of the premier venues for chemistry research, publishing significant papers across chemical disciplines. The existence of this high-impact journal added to the competitive landscape of chemistry publishing, as predicted. Rather than weakening existing mid-tier journals as originally suggested, it likely created additional pressure across the chemistry publishing ecosystem by providing another prestigious outlet for high-quality research that might have previously gone to JACS or Angewandte.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several predictions about Nature Chemistry's launch:
•  **That it would compete with JACS and Angewandte Chemie**: This prediction was accurate. Nature Chemistry successfully established itself as a top-tier chemistry journal alongside these older, established publications.
•  **That journals one tier down would feel consequences**: This prediction's accuracy is difficult to assess definitively, but it appears that mid-tier chemistry journals continued to exist and serve their roles, suggesting the impact may have been less dramatic than predicted.
•  **That Nature's cachet might not carry over to chemistry as it did for Nature Medicine**: This prediction proved incorrect, as Nature Chemistry quickly achieved high impact and prestige similar to other Nature specialty journals.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**
The article is a brief commentary on academic publishing with limited long-term significance, discussing the launch of a single journal without deeper implications for science or biotechnology.
