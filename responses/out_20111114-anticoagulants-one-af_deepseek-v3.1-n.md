# Anticoagulants, One After Another (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This November 2011 commentary reviews three major anticoagulant drug trials whose results were announced at an American Heart Association meeting. Merck's vorapaxar (a thrombin receptor antagonist), studied in 13,000 high-risk patients, failed to beat placebo and showed increased bleeding risk, with the follow-up terminated early for safety. Pfizer/BMS's apixaban, in 5,000 patients, failed to beat enoxaparin (Lovenox) for cardiovascular protection. Bayer's rivaroxaban (Xarelto) provided rare good news, beating placebo in 15,500 post-heart-attack patients, though still with elevated bleeding risk. The author notes the high bar in anticoagulation, where decade-old standards like warfarin and heparin prove difficult to displace despite physicians' desire for better options.

## 2. HISTORY

**Vorapaxar (Merck):** The drug eventually gained FDA approval in 2014 as Zontivity for reducing cardiovascular events in patients with prior heart attack or peripheral artery disease, but with a strict warning due to bleeding risk. It achieved only modest market uptake, never becoming a blockbuster, and Merck discontinued it in many countries by 2020–2022 due to disappointing sales and continued bleeding concerns. The European Medicines Agency had initially rejected it in 2014. The drug's limited indication (excluding stroke patients due to bleeding) and black-box warning severely constrained its clinical adoption. This aligns with the article's prediction that the compound was "in a great deal of trouble."

**Apixaban (Pfizer/Bristol-Myers Squibb):** This drug was approved by the FDA in 2012 as Eliquis for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and subsequently gained multiple indications (DVT/PE treatment, prevention in hip/knee surgery, secondary prevention post-ACS). It became one of the most successful novel oral anticoagulants, achieving blockbuster status and competing directly with rivaroxaban. The drug now generates over $10 billion annually in global sales. The 2011 trial failure mentioned in the article was specific to the acute coronary syndrome indication; later trials in atrial fibrillation succeeded, leading to approval.

**Rivaroxaban (Bayer/J&J):** Approved as Xarelto in 2011 for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, it expanded to multiple indications (DVT/PE, post-surgical prevention, CAD/PAD). It achieved blockbuster sales (over $5 billion annually) and became one of the most widely prescribed novel anticoagulants. However, it carried bleeding risks that led to thousands of lawsuits, with Bayer/J&J paying over $1.5 billion in settlements by 2019–2021 for failure to adequately warn about bleeding complications.

**Broader Field:** The period 2011–2021 saw DOACs (direct oral anticoagulants) largely displace warfarin and heparin for many indications due to convenience (fixed dosing, no monitoring), though warfarin retained significant use in certain patients (e.g., mechanical heart valves, renal impairment). The competitive landscape solidified around apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, with several other candidates failing in development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Vorapaxar "in a great deal of trouble":** Confirmed. Despite eventual approval, the drug faced regulatory delays, restricted indications, poor market uptake, and was ultimately discontinued in most markets due to commercial failure and bleeding concerns.

• **The high bar in anticoagulation, where "the standard of care is surprisingly hard to beat":** Partially confirmed. DOACs (including apixaban and rivaroxaban) ultimately displaced warfarin in many indications, but only after extensive trials and overcoming bleeding risk profiles. Several other candidates failed development entirely.

• **Cost/benefit bar remaining high with Plavix (clopidogrel) going generic:** Confirmed. The introduction of DOACs at premium prices limited their adoption in some markets, and warfarin remained widely used due to low cost, particularly in cost-conscious healthcare systems.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article captured a pivotal moment when the DOAC field was maturing, correctly identifying that early trial setbacks would shape which drugs succeeded commercially. It demonstrates how Phase III failures don't always predict ultimate drug failure (apixaban), yet early safety signals often persist into post-marketing (vorapaxar, rivaroxaban). The commentary's skepticism about unseating warfarin proved partially prescient given DOACs' eventual success but ongoing limitations due to cost and bleeding risk.
