# Human CRISPR (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The May 2015 Biocentury roundup highlighted intense scientific debate following the publication of early human CRISPR research. The article described a fundamental split in the scientific community regarding human germline gene editing. One camp advocated for allowing research on human germline cells under regulatory oversight, with any modified embryos being discarded, viewing this as necessary to establish safety and explore potential therapeutic applications. The opposing camp argued that germline editing should never be permitted for either research or clinical use, citing concerns about normalizing eugenics and slippery slope consequences. The overarching context was a sense of inevitability - that human germline editing would happen regardless, making the central challenge how to regulate it responsibly.

## 2. HISTORY

**Regulatory and Policy Developments (2015-2024):**
- **2015-2018**: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued major reports recommending caution and establishing criteria for potential germline editing
- **2018**: Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced the birth of CRISPR-edited twin girls, sparking global condemnation and renewed calls for regulation
- **2019**: WHO established a global registry for human genome editing research and called for international governance frameworks
- **2021**: WHO issued recommendations against human germline editing for clinical purposes
- **2023**: UK approved first CRISPR treatment (Casgevy) for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia - though these are somatic cell therapies, not germline

**Scientific Progress:**
- Clinical applications focused heavily on somatic cell editing rather than germline modifications
- Multiple CRISPR-based therapies entered clinical trials for blood disorders, inherited blindness, and cancer
- Base editing and prime editing technologies offered more precise alternatives to traditional CRISPR-Cas9
- Improved understanding of off-target effects and delivery mechanisms

**Public Policy Impact:**
- Most countries maintained strict prohibitions on human germline editing in clinical settings
- International consensus emphasized the need for transparent oversight and continued research moratoriums for reproductive applications
- Professional societies issued guidelines restricting germline editing research to non-implanted embryos

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Predictions in the Article:**

• **"Someone's going to be doing it; it's just a matter of when"** - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**: While the rogue 2018 Chinese experiment confirmed this prediction, widespread adoption didn't occur. Instead, strong international regulatory frameworks emerged that largely prevented additional unauthorized applications, contrary to the implied inevitability.

• **Slippery slope from therapeutic to eugenic applications** - **TOO SIMPLISTIC**: The emergence was less linear. The scientific community and governments actively constructed guardrails through moratoriums, oversight committees, and international cooperation, preventing the predicted slide while allowing responsible somatic research to advance.

• **Polygenic trait selection would follow** - **NOT REALIZED**: The focus remained on monogenic diseases rather than complex polygenic traits, partly due to technical challenges and ethical boundaries.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captured a pivotal moment in CRISPR ethics and governance at the exact inflection point when human applications became technically feasible yet remained profoundly controversial. It accurately anticipated the central governance challenge that would dominate the next decade of biotechnology policy and international cooperation. While focused narrowly on germline editing rather than the broader CRISPR therapeutic applications that dominated clinical development, it succeeded in identifying the critical ethical debate that shaped subsequent regulatory frameworks and scientific boundaries.

The piece demonstrated remarkable prescience about the inevitability tension - that despite widespread caution, germline research would inevitably be attempted somewhere, making governance the central challenge. Its framing of the dual-camp debate accurately reflected the lines along which international policy would develop, making it highly valuable as a historical snapshot of scientific ethics at a transformative technological moment.
