# The Drug Abacus (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article discusses the launch of the "Drug Abacus" by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an interactive tool designed to assess oncology drug pricing. The calculator incorporated various factors including survival benefit (with a default valuation of $120,000 per year of life), side effects, novelty, development costs, and population burden of disease.

Notable findings from the tool showed many cancer drugs as overpriced under standard assumptions, particularly Blincyto and Provenge, while Treanda appeared significantly underpriced. The article critiques several aspects of the approach: the weighting of factors like development costs and population-level considerations that individual patients don't face, and the fundamental tension in healthcare pricing compared to other markets. Through analogies to car and coffee pricing, the author explores how willingness-to-pay drives pricing, while acknowledging that healthcare decisions operate differently due to their life-and-death significance and patients' emotional investment.

## 2. HISTORY

The Drug Abacus was launched in June 2015 by Memorial Sloan Kettering's Center for Health Policy and Outcomes. It immediately captured attention in healthcare, policy, and pharmaceutical circles, positioned as a tool to bring transparency and rational methodology to oncology drug pricing discussions.

The tool gained influence primarily as a **conceptual and advocacy instrument** rather than a direct price-setting mechanism. In the years following its launch, drug pricing became an increasingly prominent policy issue. The framework influenced subsequent value assessment tools from organizations including ICER (Institute for Clinical and Economic Review), which expanded similar methodologies beyond oncology. However, the pharmaceutical industry largely rejected many of the tool's underlying assumptions, and actual drug prices continued to rise substantially. 

**Specific drugs mentioned:**
- **Blincyto (blinatumomab)**: FDA approved in 2014 for Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The drug maintained high pricing and experienced significant uptake, remaining an important therapy option.
- **Provenge (sipuleucel-T)**: Initially approved in 2010 for prostate cancer, the drug faced commercial challenges and was later withdrawn from European markets due to pricing and reimbursement issues. 
- **Treanda (bendamustine)**: Generic versions became available after patents expired, substantially lowering costs and increasing accessibility.

The broader policy environment shifted significantly over the subsequent decade, with Congress passing drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), giving Medicare limited negotiation authority beginning in 2026.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions, focusing instead on conceptual analysis of contemporary evaluation methodologies and economic principles. Any implications about future developments remained implicit and were not specified.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a meaningful moment in healthcare economics discourse, examining conceptual tensions that remain unresolved and increasingly relevant as drug pricing controversies continue.
