## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 blog post by Derek Lowe (part of Science Magazine's "In the Pipeline" blog) directs readers to a BioCentury TV video about the early history of the FDA. The author briefly mentions—as noteworthy examples—Harvey Wiley and the "Poison Squad," while noting that both the products on the market and regulatory practices in that era were "wild and alarming by today's standards." This brief commentary serves mainly as a contextual pointer to deeper historical content rather than presenting new analysis of its own.

## 2. HISTORY

The article references Harvey Wiley (1844–1930), who led the USDA Bureau of Chemistry and whose "Poison Squad" experiments (volunteers consuming food additives to test safety) helped galvanize public support for federal food and drug regulation. This culminated in the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, a foundational law that preceded the modern FDA. The FDA itself evolved from Wiley's bureau and was formally named the Food and Drug Administration in 1930, gaining expanded powers through subsequent legislation such as the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments (requiring proof of efficacy and adverse-event reporting).

After 2014, FDA history continued to unfold with notable developments: the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) accelerated pathways for drugs and devices; the agency navigated controversies over drug approvals (e.g., Sarepta's eteplirsen, Aduhelm) and issues such as the opioid crisis and off-shore manufacturing quality; COVID-19 spurred Emergency Use Authorizations (vaccines, therapies) alongside heightened scrutiny of its decision-making; and the affirmation of its broad authority over tobacco and ongoing debates over user fees and accelerated approval pathways kept the FDA at the center of science policy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes no predictions. It is a backward-looking historical commentary, delivering no forward-looking claims. Therefore, questions of whether its predictions matched or diverged from later events are inapplicable.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3** (30th percentile)

The item is a very brief blog "pointer" rather than an article. It has minimal original analysis, serving principally to highlight a video about early FDA history. While the underlying history (Wiley, the Poison Squad, origins of U.S. regulation of drugs and food) is important and colorful, Lowe's post itself offers no new insight beyond "did you see this video?" For readers interested in regulatory history, the linked video and sources may rank higher in interest, but as a standalone Science Magazine post appearing as an article, its content and utility are modest. The deciles used here reflect interest and importance of the posted item itself: 3 corresponds to memorable mainly for its pointer value but low on original substance.
