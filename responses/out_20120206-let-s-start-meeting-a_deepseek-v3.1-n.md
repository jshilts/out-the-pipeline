# Let's Start Off the Meeting With An Ad, OK? (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The author reports attending the SLAS (Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening) conference and witnessing an unprecedented sight: a Thermo Scientific advertisement with NFL-style voiceover ("The power to win!") being broadcast on screens to the entire audience just before the keynote address. The article captures the author's surprise at this commercialization of scientific conference proceedings, noting that while Thermo Scientific clearly invested heavily in the meeting, explicitly playing an advertisement to captive attendees at a scientific gathering represented a new development in conference culture.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2012 article, the trend of commercial content integration at scientific conferences has continued and in many ways intensified, though the specific practice of pre-keynote advertisements has remained relatively limited. The biotech and pharmaceutical industries experienced substantial growth in the 2010s, with increased merger and acquisition activity and expanded marketing budgets.

Industry sponsorship has become even more deeply embedded in scientific conferences, with companies often sponsoring specific sessions, providing educational grants, hosting satellite symposia, and maintaining significant exhibition presence. However, most major scientific conferences (including SLAS meetings) have generally maintained separation between educational content and explicit advertising within formal presentation sessions.

Notably, the period saw heightened scrutiny of industry influence in medical education and scientific meetings, leading professional organizations to implement more stringent disclosure policies and conflict-of-interest guidelines. Academic institutions and professional societies developed clearer policies around commercial involvement while balancing the financial realities of conference organization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction that this might become more common**: The article's tone suggests concern that such practices might proliferate. In reality, while commercial involvement in conferences has increased, explicit advertisement interruptions during main sessions remain relatively uncommon at major scientific meetings, though sponsorship recognition has become more prominent and integrated into conference proceedings.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article captures an interesting moment in the evolving relationship between commercial interests and scientific communication, but focuses on a relatively narrow aspect of conference culture rather than substantive developments in biotechnology.
