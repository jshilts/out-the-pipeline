# Andy Grove: Rich, Famous, Smart and Wrong (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article responds to Andy Grove's critique of the pharmaceutical industry that appeared in Newsweek, in which Grove argued that drug development lacked the urgency and rapid innovation pace seen in the semiconductor industry governed by Moore's Law. Grove believed pharma executives didn't set aggressive timelines like tech leaders (such as Steve Jobs with the iPhone launch), and this lack of "time to market" mentality explained why diseases like Parkinson's, ALS, and Alzheimer's still had inadequate treatments.

The author sharply disagrees, countering that biotechnology faces fundamentally different—and far harder—challenges than semiconductor engineering. Where chips are designed from scratch to be comprehensible (and Intel can print out technical specifications), living systems evolved through billions of years of random tinkering, with immense complexity, countless cell types, genetic variability across species, and environmental factors that make drug development incomparably more difficult. The author argues that pharma does have constant year-end goals and timetables, but pursuing these often leads to harmful decisions, and Grove misunderstands the core problem: "What we suffer from is working on some of the hardest scientific problems in the history of the species."

## 2. HISTORY

The 17 years since this article was published have largely validated the author's fundamental premise about the difficulty of drug development, though with important caveats and partial exceptions.

**Semiconductor productivity vs. drug development timelines:** Moore's Law continued its exponential progress through roughly 2015-2017, then began slowing due to physics constraints (transistor density, power, heat), while CPU performance gains increasingly shifted to architectural and specialized chip improvements rather than pure scaling. Meanwhile, drug development timelines have not dramatically accelerated; the Tufts Center for Drug Development reported an average total time of ~10-12 years from synthesis to FDA approval (with recent modest improvements driven by expedited programs like breakthrough therapy designation).

**Biotech innovation vs. pharma productivity:** Major advances occurred in many areas, but rarely with the predictable timeline Grove envisioned.
- **Gene therapies:** Luxturna (2017) and Zolgensma (2019) reached market, but took many years; high costs ($850,000-$2.1M per treatment) and complex manufacturing limited broad adoption
- **Immuno-oncology:** PD-1 inhibitors like Keytruda and Opdivo transformed cancer care starting ~2014-2015, but took decades of basic research. Checkpoint inhibitors now used across dozens of cancers, but only ~20-30% of patients respond to single-agent therapy
- **Alzheimer's disease:** Not only has there been no breakthrough treatment, but numerous high-profile failures occurred (solanezumab, gantenerumab, crenezumab, among many others). Aducanumab (Aduhelm, 2021 approval) remains highly controversial and has seen extremely limited uptake due to questionable efficacy, with Medicare severely restricting coverage; lecanemab (Leqembi, 2023) shows modest benefit but safety concerns
- **ALS:** No cure emerged; riluzole remains the primary treatment (modest benefit), with only two additional FDA approvals in 30+ years (edaravone 2017, AMX0035 2022) offering limited efficacy
- **Parkinson's:** Treatment still centers on levodopa-based therapies (the exact issue Grove raised); no disease-modifying therapies have reached market. Deep brain stimulation and device technologies improved symptom management

**Business and market realities:** Grove's notion that tech-style urgency would improve outcomes has faced real tests. The biotech sector has experienced multiple boom-bust cycles (2015-2016 downturn, the 2020-2021 pandemic-fueled boom, then sharp contraction in 2022-2023). Many companies founded with aggressive timelines failed when science didn't cooperate; even heavily-funded ventures with experienced teams often required 7-15 years to reach commercialization.

However, some areas have seen acceleration: mRNA vaccine development was famously compressed to ~11 months during COVID-19 (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna), but this built on decades of prior research and benefited from massive funding and streamlined clinical trial enrollment. The response didn't generalize to other diseases, and cancer mRNA vaccines remain in development with unclear timelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Grove's predictions/implicit forecasts:**

- **That semiconductor-style urgency and "time to market" focus would accelerate pharmaceutical progress**
  - *Outcome:* Not substantiated. Throughout 2008-2024, most breakthrough drugs still required 10-15 years, with major disease areas (Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's) showing minimal progress despite urgency. The fundamental bottlenecks (biological complexity, clinical trial requirements, regulatory pathways) remained dominant.

- **That Parkinson's, ALS, and Alzheimer's would see improved treatments if pharma adopted Moore's Law mentality**
  - *Outcome:* Notably incorrect. Parkinson's treatment remains levodopa-centric; ALS has seen only two marginal new drugs in 15+ years; Alzheimer's has seen more high-profile failures than successes, and no transformative therapies exist despite massive investment.

- **Implicit: That tech-style executive goal-setting ("I'm going to have xyz drug by year-end") would drive results in pharma**
  - *Outcome:* Real-world data suggests aggressive timelines often harm rather than help. Countless biotech companies with explicit milestones went bankrupt when biology proved uncooperative. This vindicates the article's core point about methodology mismatch.

**Article's implicit counter-prediction:**

- **That living system complexity makes Grove's analogy fundamentally flawed**
  - *Outcome:* Strongly supported by subsequent developments. Even with massive genomics advances (CRISPR, single-cell sequencing), personalized medicine, and AI drug discovery, first-in-human success rates remain ~10% and few diseases see Moore's Law-style exponential improvement.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **7/10**

This article has aged exceptionally well, correctly identifying why technological analogies often fail in biology and foreshadowing the fundamental challenges that persisted through 2024. The Grove-vs-pharma-scientist debate became increasingly relevant as tech billionaires continued attempting to apply Silicon Valley approaches to healthcare with mixed results. The piece remains highly readable and more prescient than the expert it critiques.
