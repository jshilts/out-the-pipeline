# Reporting Clinical Trials: Nothing Happens When Nothing Happens (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses widespread failures in clinical trial results reporting, highlighting new investigation that reveals both pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions systematically violate legal requirements to report trial outcomes to ClinicalTrials.gov. The analysis focused on approximately 9,000 trials that were legally mandated to report results, finding that both industry and academic sectors performed poorly on compliance. However, the data showed that major drug companies (specifically Eli Lilly and AbbVie) had better compliance rates than academic institutions, with some notable academic centers like Sloan-Kettering showing zero compliance on required reporting. The article also notes that federal agencies themselves, including FDA staff scientists, had poor compliance rates, suggesting the problem was systemic across all sectors involved in clinical research.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 investigation and increased media attention, clinical trial transparency has seen some improvements but remains an ongoing challenge. In 2016, the NIH and FDA implemented stronger enforcement mechanisms and issued final rules expanding reporting requirements. The FDA began issuing warning letters to non-compliant institutions starting in 2017, with escalating penalties including fines of up to $10,000 per day for continued noncompliance. 

Academic institutions gradually improved their reporting rates, though gaps persisted. A 2018 analysis showed industry compliance rates had increased to approximately 70-80% for large pharmaceutical companies, while academic compliance remained lower at around 50-60%. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of trial transparency, leading to accelerated reporting for coronavirus-related trials and increased public awareness of clinical trial data sharing.

Enforcement has been inconsistent, with the FDA issuing relatively few penalties compared to the scale of noncompliance. The NIH's ClinicalTrials.gov database expanded significantly, now containing over 400,000 trials as of 2024. However, research from 2023 indicates that approximately 30-40% of completed trials still fail to report results within the required timeframe, suggesting the problem remains substantial despite increased attention and regulatory pressure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself was primarily descriptive rather than predictive, focusing on documenting the existing regulatory failures rather than forecasting future developments. No explicit predictions were included in the source material.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6**

This article addresses a persistent and important problem in clinical research transparency with concrete data, but focuses mainly on regulatory compliance rather than scientific breakthroughs or patient outcomes directly.
