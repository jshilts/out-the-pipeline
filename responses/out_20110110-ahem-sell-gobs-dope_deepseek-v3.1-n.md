# Ahem: Sell Gobs of Dope (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2011 commentary discusses allegations made in a lawsuit against Gilead Pharmaceuticals regarding off-label marketing of their angina medication Ranexa (ranolazine). According to court documents from a whistle-blower case, a Gilead sales training director allegedly instructed sales teams to "sell gobs of dope" and "get those pills into people's mouths any way you can." The lawsuit claimed Gilead sales representatives were promoting Ranexa for broader cardiovascular indications beyond its FDA-approved use for refractory angina.

However, the article notes important caveats: the Department of Justice declined to intervene in the case, which likely contributed to the lawsuit being dropped. The author also suggests these practices might have originated from CV Therapeutics, the original seller of Ranexa before Gilead acquired them in 2009. The piece serves as a cautionary commentary about pharmaceutical sales practices and their impact on public perception of the industry.

## 2. HISTORY
The Ranexa saga continued to unfold in the years following this 2011 article:

**Regulatory and Legal Developments:**
- In 2013, the FDA approved a new extended-release formulation of Ranexa for chronic angina treatment in patients who have not responded adequately to other anti-anginal medications. This expanded its legitimate clinical use.
- The off-label marketing concerns raised in the 2011 whistle-blower case did not result in major FDA enforcement actions against Gilead specifically related to Ranexa marketing practices.
- In 2014, Gilead faced separate high-profile legal challenges related to its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi pricing, drawing significant public and congressional scrutiny.

**Market Performance:**
- Ranexa continued to be prescribed for chronic angina, generating several hundred million dollars annually for Gilead in the following years.
- In 2015, Gilead sold the European rights to Ranexa to Menarini for \$65 million, and in 2016 sold the U.S. rights to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals for \$10 million plus royalties, suggesting it was becoming a less strategic asset as Gilead focused on its viral franchise.
- The drug remained on the market and was still prescribed, but never achieved blockbuster status.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several implicit predictions about Gilead's future:

- **Predicted that such sales practices could lead to successful whistle-blower cases**: The Department of Justice's decision not to pursue the case meant this particular prediction did not materialize for Ranexa specifically. However, Gilead did face scrutiny over other issues like Sovaldi pricing in subsequent years.
- **Predicted continued decline in public opinion of the pharma industry**: This proved accurate, particularly after incidents like the 2015 Turing Pharmaceuticals price-gouging scandal and ongoing controversies over drug pricing that extended into the late 2010s.
- **Predicted that aggressive sales tactics would eventually generate enough evidence for regulatory action**: While this specific case didn't result in major sanctions, it reflected ongoing industry problems with off-label marketing that did result in significant fines for other companies (notably GlaxoSmithKline's \$3 billion settlement in 2012).

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**
The article touches on important, persistent ethical issues in pharmaceutical marketing and provides insight into the type of sales pressure present in the industry. However, the specific case discussed did not lead to major legal outcomes or set notable precedents, making its impact moderate. The piece highlights ongoing challenges with off-label promotion that continue to affect the pharmaceutical industry's reputation and regulatory relationships.
