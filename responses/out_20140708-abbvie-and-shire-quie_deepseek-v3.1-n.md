# AbbVie and Shire, Quietly (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article contrasts the relatively quiet AbbVie-Shire acquisition attempt with the highly publicized Pfizer-AstraZeneca bid that occurred around the same time. The author notes that while Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca generated weeks of headlines and political attention on both sides of the Atlantic, AbbVie's bid for Shire was proceeding with much less public controversy or political involvement.

The key reasons cited for this difference include: the smaller scale of the AbbVie-Shire deal, the fact that Shire had relatively few UK employees (only 91% of its workforce was elsewhere), and Shire's previous corporate restructuring to become an Irish-domiciled company for tax optimization purposes. The author suggests that politicians showed less interest because the deal would have minimal impact on their UK constituencies, despite similar tax inversion motivations driving both acquisition attempts.

## 2. HISTORY

The AbbVie-Shire deal referenced in this July 2014 article was formally announced in July 2014, with AbbVie offering approximately $54 billion to acquire Shire. Like the Pfizer-AstraZeneca situation, this was primarily driven by tax inversion strategies - AbbVie sought to relocate its tax domicile to the UK to benefit from lower corporate tax rates.

However, in October 2014, AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal. The primary reason was significant changes to US tax regulations - specifically, new Treasury Department rules in September 2014 that made tax inversion deals much less economically attractive. These rule changes effectively closed many of the tax loopholes that had made these acquisitions financially compelling.

As a result, AbbVie terminated the $54 billion acquisition and was required to pay Shire a $1.6 billion breakup fee. Shire continued as an independent company for several more years before ultimately being acquired by Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda in 2019 for approximately $62 billion.

The Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal referenced in the article also ultimately failed to materialize, with AstraZeneca rejecting Pfizer's final offer in May 2014.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained implicit rather than explicit predictions. Its main implied forecast was that the AbbVie-Shire deal would continue quietly with minimal political interference, in contrast to the Pfizer-AstraZeneca situation.

• **Predicted**: The AbbVie-Shire deal would proceed with little political controversy or public outrage
• **Outcome**: This proved partially accurate in that the deal did receive less political attention than Pfizer-AstraZeneca, but it ultimately failed for reasons unrelated to political opposition - specifically, US tax regulation changes that eliminated the financial incentives

• **Predicted**: Political interest would remain low because of minimal UK job impact
• **Outcome**: This was generally accurate - the deal did not generate significant political controversy before its collapse, though the primary factor in its failure was regulatory rather than political

The bigger picture prediction that tax inversion deals would face ongoing challenges proved prescient, as demonstrated by the subsequent regulatory changes that undermined this entire category of pharmaceutical M&A activity.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article provides valuable historical context about pharmaceutical industry M&A dynamics and tax inversion strategies during a critical period. While the AbbVie-Shire deal ultimately collapsed, understanding the regulatory and political factors that shaped these major transactions offers insight into how tax policy directly influenced corporate strategy. The contrast between high-profile and lower-profile deal-making attempts is instructive for understanding what drives political and public attention in the biopharmaceutical sector.
