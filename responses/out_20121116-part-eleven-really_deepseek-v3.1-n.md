# Part Eleven? Really? (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2012 blog post from Science magazine commented on a publication in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters that was labeled "Part Eleven." The author questioned why research would be sliced so thinly across multiple parts, suggesting the possibility that this approach was used to distribute authorship credit among a wide group of co-authors for CV-building purposes. The post raised broader questions about publication practices in medicinal chemistry and how much weight such multipart publications carry in academic hiring decisions. The author clarified that this wasn't a long-running series but appeared to involve multiple parts being published around the same time.

## 2. HISTORY
The practice of splitting research into multiple "part" publications has continued in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research over the past decade, though it remains controversial. Many journals have since implemented more stringent policies requiring authors to justify multipart publications and demonstrate that each part represents substantial, distinct research contributions. The academic and pharmaceutical research community has generally moved toward transparency in authorship, with credit systems like the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) being adopted by major publishers to clarify individual contributions.

However, the incentive structures that drove publication splitting—academic promotion requirements, grant funding metrics, and the publish-or-perish culture—have largely persisted. Medicinal chemistry series like these continue to appear, sometimes containing valuable SAR (structure-activity relationship) data that pharmaceutical companies publish systematically. The Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters journal remains a respected venue for medicinal chemistry research, but the broader discussion about research quality versus quantity continues unresolved in academic hiring and promotion committees.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction about hiring practices**: The article questioned "how much does most any publication count for in today's hiring environment?" It implied that the value of publications was being diluted. **Outcome**: Academic hiring has become even more competitive, with increased emphasis on publication metrics, citations, and journal impact factors, though many institutions are now exploring alternative metrics and holistic evaluation approaches.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

This represents a moderately interesting meta-discussion about academic publishing practices rather than a breakthrough in scientific content. While it touches on ongoing systemic issues in research culture, it's primarily a commentary piece rather than substantive scientific analysis.
