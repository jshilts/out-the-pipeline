# George Olah, 1927–2017 (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is an obituary and retrospective on George Olah, the 1994 Nobel laureate in chemistry who had recently passed away. It frames him as part of the distinguished cohort of Hungarian-born 20th-century scientists and highlights his pioneering use of superacid media to directly observe and study carbocations (stable carbenium ions), which were previously only inferred intermediates. The piece emphasizes Olah’s long-running dispute with H. C. Brown over the non-classical structure of the norbornyl cation—a controversy rooted in Saul Winstein’s 1940s proposal—and notes that Olah’s camp was ultimately proven correct. The obituary also credits Olah with contributions to new reagents, synthetic methods, and deeper insights into reaction mechanisms, spanning a career in both industry and academia (USC), while observing that fewer chemists of his generation remained.

## 2. HISTORY
After the article’s publication, Olah’s scientific legacy has remained actively cited and broadly relevant to both fundamental and applied research streams. Key post-2017 developments include:
- **Carbocation and superacid chemistry**: The mechanistic framework Olah established continues to underpin modern work on carbocation rearrangements, selectivity in reactions, and catalysis, including in industrial processes such as hydrocarbon upgrading and polymerization. No major paradigm shift has overturned his foundational work; instead, it is routinely taught and used to interpret outcomes in synthetic and mechanistic studies.
- **Methanol economy (Olah’s late-career advocacy)**: Olah’s proposal for a “methanol economy”—to use methanol as a fuel and chemical feedstock and to recycle CO₂ into methanol—has seen mixed progress. Methanol remains an important commodity chemical and fuel component (e.g., in biodiesel transesterification and as a gasoline additive), and it is a key feedstock for olefins (MTO) and other chemicals. However, large-scale CO₂-to-methanol processes have not displaced fossil routes at scale due to economic and energy barriers. Interest in green methanol has grown in sustainability and decarbonization circles, but widespread commercial deployment has been limited.
- **USC and the Olah community**: USC has continued to maintain resources and recognition of Olah’s contributions, and research in carbocation chemistry, catalysis, and energy-related chemistry often references his body of work. His former collaborators and students remain active in academia and industry, contributing to areas such as catalysis and synthetic chemistry.
- **H−C Brown and norbornyl cation legacy**: The long-resolved norbornyl cation debate remains a landmark case study of how physical organic chemistry resolves structural questions via spectroscopy and computational methods. The verdict that Olah’s two-dimensional description (with delocalized, pentacoordinate carbon) was largely correct still stands and is widely covered in graduate organic chemistry curricula.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- There were no explicit predictions in this obituary article. It was retrospective in nature, focusing on Olah’s accomplishments and the resolution of historical scientific disputes rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**

This is a standard obituary for a major chemist, but its scope is primarily historical. It is of moderate-to-low ongoing relevance outside niche history-of-chemistry discussions or graduate courses covering carbocation chemistry. It does not highlight new research directions or immediate societal applications and focuses on a resolved debate. Hence, it ranks in the lower end of the interest spectrum for a general or applied science audience beyond foundational education and citation context.
