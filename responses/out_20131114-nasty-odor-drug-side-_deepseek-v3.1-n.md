# Nasty Odor as a Drug Side Effect (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief 2013 blog post discusses an unusual side effect observed in clinical trials of darapladib, a compound being developed by GSK. The article highlights how medical publications for this drug mentioned "odor" as a side effect in trial subjects, which the author found noteworthy and odd. The author speculates that this may be due to a para-fluorobenzyl thioether group in the drug's structure that is not oxidized in vivo. The author asks readers for other examples of modern drugs with similar odor liabilities, noting that this seemed unusual at the time. The drug had just failed a Phase III clinical trial when the article was written.

## 2. HISTORY

Darapladib, the drug discussed in this article, was indeed failing its Phase III trials when the article was written in November 2013. The drug was being developed by GSK as an inhibitor of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) for treating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Despite earlier hopes, darapladib failed to meet its primary endpoints in both the STABILITY trial (published in 2014) and subsequent trials, showing no significant reduction in cardiovascular events. The drug was never FDA-approved. One concrete outcome was that the odor side effect, while unusual, turned out to be overshadowed by the drug's fundamental lack of efficacy. The "nasty odor" issue did not emerge as a major pattern affecting other drugs in development, and this specific metabolic pathway characteristic did not become a widely discussed liability in drug design. The article's identification of this unusual side effect was accurate, but ultimately became a minor footnote given the drug's clinical failure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction that odor would be a notable drug development issue**: While the article doesn't explicitly predict widespread odor problems, it frames this as unusual ("can't think of another modern drug that has a severe odor liability"), implying this might be rare or unique. What actually happened: Odor-related side effects remained relatively uncommon in pharmaceutical development, and this did not emerge as a major systematic problem.

- **The question/hope for reader examples**: The author asked for other examples and anticipated readers would provide them (noting "plenty of examples in the comments!"). This turned out accurate - the article did generate discussion, though odor remained a relatively minor class of side effects in drug development.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile score: 7**

This article earns a high score because it identified a genuinely unusual pharmaceutical phenomenon that most discussion had overlooked, and it did so at a moment when the drug was failing (providing useful real-time context). The observation was scientifically astute and specific, linking chemical structure to clinical side effects in a memorable way, even though it didn't ultimately change drug development practices.
