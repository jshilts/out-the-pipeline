# Pharma Overview (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post serves as a commentary on a Science Careers report titled "A Pharma Industry in Crisis." The article acknowledges the familiar nature of the concerns raised about the pharmaceutical industry's challenges. The post mentions that the author and other industry observers (including "Chemjobber") were interviewed for the underlying Science Careers piece, positioning this as a "where-we-are-now" perspective on the state of pharmaceutical industry affairs in late 2011. The tone suggests industry insiders recognized a state of crisis that needed documentation and analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this December 2011 article, several concrete developments shaped the pharmaceutical industry landscape:

**Patent Cliff Impact**: The period from 2012-2015 saw major revenue losses for large pharma companies as blockbuster drugs (like Lipitor, Plavix, and Seroquel) lost patent protection. Pfizer's Lipitor alone had generated approximately \$10 billion annually before its patent expiration in November 2011.

**Research and Development Restructuring**: Major pharmaceutical companies continued significant layoffs and restructuring of R&D operations. GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck closed research facilities and reduced internal discovery programs throughout 2012-2015. Many companies shifted toward external innovation models and increased outsourcing.

**Pipeline Productivity**: Despite the crisis narrative, the FDA approved between 27-46 new molecular entities annually during 2012-2021, with notable peaks in 2014 (41 approvals), 2015 (45 approvals), and 2018 (59 approvals). This suggested productivity challenges were being addressed through partnerships and new development strategies.

**Emergence of New Modalities**: The post-2011 period witnessed the rise of gene therapies, cell therapies, and RNA-based therapeutics as viable pharmaceutical approaches, with regulatory approvals beginning in 2012 and accelerating thereafter.

**Industry Consolidation**: Large-scale mergers and acquisitions continued, with significant deals including Actavis's acquisition of Forest Laboratories (2014) and Allergan (2015), creating one of the world's largest generic and specialty pharmaceutical companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not contain specific forward-looking predictions. It was presented as a contemporary snapshot analysis rather than a predictive piece.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/9**

While the article captures a moment of recognized crisis in pharmaceutical industry history, it provides minimal original analysis or detailed content, functioning primarily as commentary on another report. The underlying themes were significant for industry professionals but the article itself offers limited lasting insights for broader audiences.
