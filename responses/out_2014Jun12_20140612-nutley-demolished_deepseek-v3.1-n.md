## 1. SUMMARY

This short 2014 article charts the demolition and redevelopment of Hoffman-LaRoche's former R&D facility in Nutley, New Jersey. The author notes that five buildings would be put on the market while the rest would be torn down, likely to be replaced with office and retail space. The piece frames this closure within a broader trend of large pharma shutting down legacy research sites, drawing a comparison to the author's own experience at a former Schering-Plough site that was ultimately replaced by a Home Depot parking lot.

## 2. HISTORY

The Nutley site's fate largely followed the path outlined in the article. Roche officially vacated the 119-acre campus in 2013 after nearly a century of pharmaceutical research there. By 2015-2016, the property underwent significant demolition and redevelopment as part of the "On3" master plan—a major mixed-use redevelopment project featuring office space, retail, and residential components.

However, the author's speculation about "smaller biopharma" picking up the remaining buildings proved prescient in ways beyond what was likely imagined. From 2016 onward, the site attracted notable biotech and life sciences tenants including **Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma**, which established its US headquarters there in 2017, and **Takeda Pharmaceutical**, which expanded its presence. The site has become part of a broader biotech cluster, with several smaller life sciences companies leasing space in the redeveloped buildings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's most accurate predictions:
- **Redevelopment direction**: Correctly anticipated that most of the campus would be demolished for commercial/retail use
- **Market timing**: Correctly identified this as part of a broader wave of major pharma consolidation and site closures

**Misjudgments:**
- **Underestimated biotech demand**: The author viewed the Schering-Plough outcome (total demolition, no research reuse) as the template, missing how the Nutley site would become part of a diversified scientific ecosystem
- **Scale of transformation**: The emergence of Nutley/Clifton as a biotech hub with multiple international pharma companies exceeded the modest expectations in the article

**Partial accuracy:**
- While some research activity did return to the site, it was through tenants rather than through preserving Roche's original research function

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 2/9**

While this article captures an important transition in pharmaceutical R&D geography, it ranks in the lower percentiles of interest for several reasons:

- **Parochial focus**: The piece is primarily of local New Jersey interest, with limited broader analytical depth
- **Limited forward-looking insight**: The article describes rather than deeply analyzes the underlying economic and scientific trends driving these closures
- **Missing the bigger story**: The author didn't anticipate how sites like Nutley would evolve into mixed biotech clusters rather than simply converting to traditional commercial use

The phenomenon described—large pharma consolidation and site repurposing—was indeed significant and would intensify, but this article's contribution was largely as a historical marker rather than providing lasting analytical value.
