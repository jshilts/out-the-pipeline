# Politics, Unfortunately (Nov 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a political commentary written on the eve of the 2016 US presidential election by a blogger who explicitly states they rarely discuss politics. The author expresses profound opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy, describing him as "the person least fit for the office that I have ever seen a major US party nominate" and someone they "loathed" more than any other political candidate. 

The author clarifies that this opinion is not based on pharmaceutical or scientific policy positions, which they consider "roundoff errors compared to everything else." While stating they would normally "cheerfully vote against" Hillary Clinton based on her political record, the author views 2016 as an exceptional year requiring a vote against Trump as priority. The piece characterizes Trump's supporters as including outright racists, low-information voters, people deeply angered by feeling ignored by political elites, and those voting purely as anti-Clinton protest. The author expresses particular disgust with Republican leadership endorsing Trump, stating this would ensure they "never vote Republican again."

The commentary acknowledges Trump's likely defeat but expresses horror that his candidacy was even possible, viewing it as revealing serious underlying problems in American society that would require difficult post-election work to address.

## 2. HISTORY

The article's central prediction—that Trump would likely lose—proved incorrect. Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, defeating Hillary Clinton with 304 electoral votes to her 227, despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.

Trump's presidency (2017-2021) was marked by significant volatility and disruption across multiple domains. Key relevant developments include:

**Scientific Research and Response**: The Trump administration was notably hostile toward science, most prominently through its handling of COVID-19. The administration downplayed the pandemic's severity, contradicted public health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC guidance, promoted unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine, and most significantly, presided over one of the highest per-capita COVID death rates among developed nations with approximately 400,000 deaths occurring by the time he left office. This directly contradicted the author's dismissal of scientific policy as a "roundoff error"—science policy became central to national crisis response.

**Biotechnology and Drug Development**: Trump's "Operation Warp Speed" accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development, resulting in the fastest vaccine development in history with mRNA vaccines receiving Emergency Use Authorization from FDA within months rather than years. While this achieved concrete results in vaccine deployment, the administration's broader anti-science rhetoric undermined public trust in vaccines and public health institutions, contributing to vaccine hesitancy that persisted beyond his term.

**Pharmaceutical Policy**: The Trump administration made drug pricing a focus, though with limited concrete achievements. Executive orders attempted to address pricing through importation and reference pricing schemes, but most initiatives were blocked by legal challenges or failed to achieve substantial implementation.

**Author's Prediction About Republican Party**: Contrary to the author's declaration of never voting Republican again due to party support for Trump, the Republican party consolidated around Trump more strongly after 2016. The party leadership largely supported or accommodated his presidency, and Trump remained the dominant figure in Republican politics through 2020 and beyond, maintaining control over party direction and personnel.

**Broader Political Consequences**: Trump's election, far from being an aberration resolved by post-election work, fundamentally realigned American politics. His term included two impeachments, numerous cabinet departures and scandals, withdrawal from international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord, and most significantly, culminated in the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection—an unprecedented assault on American democratic institutions led by his supporters attempting to overturn the election he lost to Joe Biden.

The author's hope that Trump represented a one-time deviation proved incorrect; instead Trump reshaped the Republican party in his image and remained a dominant force in American politics, running again in 2024.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Trump would lose the election**: The author states "it certainly looks as if he'll lose" and builds much of the argument around opposing a candidate viewed as likely to be defeated. **Reality**: Trump won the election, making this the article's most significant failed prediction.

• **Politics would return to normal after the election**: The author expresses hope this will be "the last time for a while" discussing politics and that after the election "this country has some real problems to deal with" implying a return to substantive rather than crisis governance. **Reality**: Trump's presidency was characterized by continuous crisis and norm-breaking, with politics becoming more polarized and volatile rather than returning to normal functioning.

• **Republican party was permanently stained and unelectable**: The author writes "I will never vote Republican again" and that "the party has been stained beyond cleansing by the events of this electoral cycle." **Reality**: The Republican party consolidated around Trump, maintained control of the Senate for most of his term, nearly won the 2020 election, and remained competitive in 2022 midterms, with Trump-endorsed candidates largely prevailing in Republican primaries.

• **Trump represented a historical anomaly**: The author compares Trump to 19th century presidents like Fillmore and Pierce, and reaches back over 100 years to William Jennings Bryan, suggesting Trump represents an unprecedented departure from normal political standards. **Reality**: While Trump's presidency was indeed unprecedented in many respects, he successfully reshaped rather than destroyed Republican politics, with Trump-style candidates and conspiracy theories becoming more rather than less common in Republican primaries.

• **The country would need to do "hard work" after the election to address underlying problems**: **Reality**: The post-election period brought greater polarization rather than reconciliation, with Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 defeat culminating in the January 6 insurrection—precisely the opposite of addressing underlying problems through democratic processes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

The article represents one of the most dramatic examples of confident political prediction being completely wrong, making it historically significant as a case study in 2016 election analysis. The author's certainty about both Trump's imminent defeat and the impossibility of such a candidate succeeding provides valuable insight into the widespread underestimation of Trump's political viability that characterized most mainstream analysis. The piece captures the genuine disbelief and horror that many educated, politically engaged Americans felt at Trump's candidacy, emotions that proved prophetic in anticipating the extraordinary nature of his presidency, even as the specific predictions failed completely.
