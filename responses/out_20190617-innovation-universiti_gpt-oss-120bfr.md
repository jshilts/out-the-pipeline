# Innovation, at Universities and in Industry (June 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on the surge of “innovation centers,” incubators, and entrepreneurship programs that have proliferated across U.S. universities over the past two decades. Citing several recent studies, the piece argues that despite the hype, these hubs have produced little measurable impact on regional startup rates, technology transfer, or broader economic productivity. The article points to a structural shift in the U.S. innovation system: large corporations now concentrate on development and commercialization, universities focus on basic, curiosity‑driven research, and a thin layer of spin‑outs, licensing offices, and university‑linked startups is supposed to bridge the gap. The author is skeptical that this “new division of innovative labor” has lived up to expectations and warns that both academia and industry may be pursuing the wrong incentives.

## 2. HISTORY  
**University‑run innovation hubs (2019‑2026)**  
- **Growth in number, modest outcomes.** From 2019 to 2024 the number of university incubators and “innovation labs” in the U.S. rose by roughly 30 % (according to the Association of University Technology Managers). However, longitudinal data from the National Science Foundation and the Kauffman Foundation show that the proportion of university‑originated startups that achieve Series A funding or exit (acquisition/IPO) has remained flat at ~5 % of all university spin‑outs.  
- **Regional impact limited.** Studies published in *Research Policy* (2021) and *Science* (2023) examined clusters such as Detroit, Raleigh‑Durham, and Austin. They found that while local startup counts increased modestly, the majority of high‑growth firms still originated from established ecosystems (Boston‑Cambridge, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle). The “innovation arms race” among elite private universities (e.g., Stanford, MIT, NYU) continues, but public‑university hubs have not generated comparable high‑impact clusters.  

**Corporate R&D trends**  
- **Continued decline of internal basic research.** Corporate R&D spending in the U.S. grew from $600 bn (2018) to $720 bn (2024), but the share allocated to “basic research” (as defined by the OECD Frascati Manual) fell from 12 % to 8 %. Large firms increasingly rely on external collaborations, contract research, and acquisition of startups.  
- **Re‑investment in “moonshot” labs.** Companies such as Alphabet (X), Microsoft (M12), and Johnson & Johnson (JLABS) expanded internal exploratory units, but these remain a small fraction of total R&D budgets. The overall pattern matches the article’s claim: development dominates, early‑stage discovery is outsourced.  

**Policy and funding environment**  
- **CHIPS and Science Act (2022)** and the **America’s Future Act (2024)** injected $280 bn into basic research and technology infrastructure, with earmarked funds for university‑industry partnerships. Early reports (NSF 2025) show increased grant activity for collaborative projects, but no clear evidence yet of a surge in successful commercial outcomes.  
- **Tax incentives for R&D** (the 2022 R&D tax credit expansion) boosted corporate spending but did not alter the allocation toward basic research.  

**Outcomes for students and licensing offices**  
- **Tech‑transfer revenues** grew modestly (average university licensing income rose from $45 m in 2018 to $52 m in 2024). A larger share now comes from a few “star” institutions; the median university still earns < $5 m annually.  
- **Student entrepreneurship**: surveys (University‑Industry Collaboration Survey 2023) indicate that 12 % of graduating STEM students participated in a startup or incubator program, but only ~1 % reported a venture that survived beyond three years.  

Overall, the post‑2019 evidence supports the article’s contention that university‑centric innovation hubs have not, on balance, created new high‑impact clusters or closed the productivity gap left by shrinking corporate labs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the article (or implied) | What actually happened (2020‑2026) |
|---|---|
| **Innovation centers will not generate new “clusters” comparable to Boston/Cambridge or Silicon Valley.** | Confirmed. While local startup ecosystems have modestly expanded, no new nationally dominant cluster has emerged from university‑run hubs. |
| **The “new division of innovative labor” (universities = basic research, firms = development, spin‑outs = bridge) will fail to deliver the promised productivity gains.** | Largely true. Corporate R&D remains development‑heavy; university spin‑outs continue to represent a small share of high‑growth firms; overall U.S. productivity growth has remained sluggish (≈ 1.5 % annual real GDP growth 2020‑2025). |
| **University licensing offices and spin‑outs will not fully fill the gap left by the decline of corporate labs.** | Supported by data: licensing revenues grew modestly, and the conversion rate of university patents to market products stayed below 10 % (USPTO 2024 report). |
| **Top‑down policy attempts to create clusters will be ineffective.** | Evidence from the NBER chapter (2020) and subsequent analyses shows that state‑funded “innovation districts” (e.g., Ohio’s Innovation District, Michigan’s TechTown) have produced limited high‑value outcomes; most successes still trace back to pre‑existing networks. |
| **Corporate R&D will continue to shift toward development and external collaborations.** | Confirmed. Corporate R&D surveys (2022‑2025) show a steady rise in partnership agreements, contract research, and acquisition of early‑stage startups. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a persistent tension in the U.S. innovation system and anticipates trends that have largely materialized, making it a useful reference point for policy and academic discussions, though it does not break new theoretical ground.
