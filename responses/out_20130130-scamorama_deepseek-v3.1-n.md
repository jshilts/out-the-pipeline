# Scamorama (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the exposure of S.W.A.T.S. (Sports With Alternatives To Steroids), a company that sold pseudoscientific performance-enhancing products to professional and college athletes. The company promoted a bizarre regimen including holographic stickers, deer-antler velvet pills and spray, "negatively charged water," and sleeping in front of "beam-ray light" supposedly programmed with tissue-regeneration frequencies.

The theoretical framework claimed that radio waves could be stored in fluids and holograms, then "re-emitted" when consumed or worn by athletes to trigger hormone production—analogous to how sunlight stimulates vitamin D. The article draws parallels between S.W.A.T.S. and Nativis, a biotech company that promoted similar "photonic signals stored in water" technology and later ventured into radio-frequency cancer treatments. The author presents these approaches as pseudoscientific scams targeting the gullible.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent events validated the article's skeptical assessment. Ray Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens linebacker mentioned in the original SI report, faced NFL investigation after the story broke. In January 2013, shortly after the article's publication, Lewis denied using the deer-antler spray during the Super Bowl, though he had appeared in promotional materials for S.W.A.T.S. The company became a cautionary tale in professional sports.

The broader pattern of sports pseudoscience continued to draw scrutiny. In 2013, the FDA issued warning letters to manufacturers of deer-antler velvet products about unsubstantiated health claims and illegal marketing. Multiple companies faced legal action for making false performance-enhancement claims about deer-antler products containing IGF-1.

In the biotech space, Nativis—the parallel example cited—continued operating with its controversial radio-frequency cancer treatment approach but never achieved clinical validation or regulatory approval for their core technology. The company's trajectory illustrated how pseudoscientific concepts could persist despite lacking credible scientific backing.

Professional sports leagues subsequently tightened regulations around unapproved substances and required more rigorous education for athletes about legitimate vs. fraudulent performance-enhancement products.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made implicit predictions through its critique:

- **Prediction:** S.W.A.T.S.-type pseudoscience would continue targeting gullible athletes and consumers
- **Outcome:** Accurate. Similar companies have continued operations with overlapping pseudoscientific claims (e.g., cryotherapy, various "frequency" devices, collagen products with vague mechanisms), targeting both athletes and the broader wellness market.

- **Prediction:** The "thin spray-painted layer" of science education over minds "wanting miracles" would remain insufficient
- **Outcome:** This pattern has persisted. The wellness industry has grown significantly, with many products making evidence-free claims about frequency therapy, quantum effects, "holographic" technology, and related pseudoscience concepts.

The article's implicit guidance that proper scientific scrutiny should prevail over pseudoscience was validated by regulatory actions and the continued exposure of fraudulent products, though the underlying market for such solutions has not disappeared.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses the important issue of pseudoscience in sports and biotech, but focuses on an obvious scam rather than exploring more nuanced or borderline cases where scientific development might genuinely be advancing. While documenting fraud remains valuable, the low sophistication of the target and the repetitive nature of such scams limits broad interest.
