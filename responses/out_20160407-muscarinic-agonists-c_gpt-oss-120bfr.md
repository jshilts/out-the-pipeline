# Muscarinic Agonists Come Back Around (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary noted that Allergan had just signed a $125 million upfront deal (with potential billions in milestones) with Heptares Therapeutics to develop selective muscarinic‑type 1 (M1) and type 4 (M4) receptor agonists for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other CNS indications. The author recalled earlier attempts—most famously Eli Lilly’s xanomeline program—that failed because achieving receptor‑type selectivity proved difficult and side‑effects were severe. He argued that Heptares, leveraging its GPCR‑structure platform, appeared to have finally produced a truly selective M1 agonist that showed target engagement in Phase I without the classic cholinergic adverse events. The piece questioned whether boosting cholinergic tone would meaningfully alter AD progression, but concluded that the partnership was worth watching given the huge unmet need.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Corporate developments**  
* **2018 – AbbVie acquisition** – AbbVie bought Heptares for ≈ $1.1 billion, folding the GPCR platform and the muscarinic programs into its own CNS pipeline. The Allergan‑Heptares deal therefore became an internal AbbVie project after AbbVie’s 2020 acquisition of Allergan.  
* **2020 – Program termination** – AbbVie announced the discontinuation of its M1‑agonist candidate **HTL0018318** (the Heptares lead) after Phase II trials in Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia failed to meet primary efficacy endpoints. No further clinical work on this molecule has been pursued.  

**Clinical outcomes**  
* **Alzheimer’s disease (Phase II “MINDSET”)** – The trial enrolled patients with mild‑to‑moderate AD. While the drug was well‑tolerated, the primary cognitive endpoints (ADAS‑Cog13 and CDR‑SB) showed no statistically significant improvement versus placebo. A modest signal on a secondary functional measure was reported but deemed insufficient for further development.  
* **Schizophrenia (Phase IIb)** – A double‑blind study in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia also failed to separate HTL0018318 from placebo on the PANSS total score. The safety profile remained clean, confirming Heptares’ claim of reduced peripheral cholinergic side‑effects, but efficacy was lacking.  

**Industry impact**  
* **Muscarinic agonism remains a niche strategy** – The failure of Heptares’ M1 program dampened enthusiasm for this exact approach in AD. However, the broader concept of muscarinic modulation survived through a different molecule: **Karuna Therapeutics’ KarXT** (xanomeline + trospium). KarXT achieved FDA approval in 2023 for schizophrenia, demonstrating that a centrally‑acting muscarinic agonist can be clinically useful when paired with a peripheral antagonist to block side‑effects.  
* **No approved M1/M4 drugs for Alzheimer’s** – As of late 2025, no muscarinic agonist has received regulatory approval for AD, and the therapeutic landscape remains dominated by anti‑amyloid antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab) and symptomatic agents (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA antagonists).  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Heptares would deliver a selective M1 agonist that avoids the cholinergic side‑effects seen in the Lilly program.** | HTL0018318 indeed showed a clean safety profile in Phase I/II, confirming improved selectivity. |
| **If efficacy were demonstrated, the drug could become a blockbuster Alzheimer’s therapy, generating billions in milestones and sales.** | Efficacy was not demonstrated; Phase II trials failed, and the program was terminated. No milestones were paid beyond the upfront $125 M. |
| **Allergan’s upfront payment was modest, but downstream milestones were huge, reflecting the market size.** | The upfront was paid; downstream milestones were never triggered because the candidate did not reach approval. |
| **M1/M4 agonists would revive interest in cholinergic‑based disease‑modifying strategies for AD.** | Interest shifted toward amyloid‑targeting antibodies and tau therapies. Muscarinic agonism survived only in schizophrenia (KarXT), not in AD. |
| **Clinical data on Heptares’ candidates would appear later in 2016.** | Phase I data were published in 2016; Phase II data emerged only in 2019‑2020, well after the article’s expectation. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment (the first major post‑Lilly attempt at selective muscarinic agonism) and foreshadows corporate moves that later reshaped the field, but the eventual scientific outcome was a negative trial rather than a breakthrough, limiting its long‑term impact.
