# Google Honors Dorothy Hodgkin and Percy Julian (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses Google's decision to feature Percy Julian and Dorothy Hodgkin in their famous birthday doodles, celebrating two pioneering chemists who overcame significant social barriers to make landmark contributions to science. 

Percy Julian was an African-American natural products chemist who revolutionized steroid chemistry in the 1940s-50s despite facing severe racial discrimination throughout his career. Born in Alabama in 1899 to a family with slave ancestry, he overcame numerous obstacles including Harvard withdrawing his teaching assistantship because of his race. He eventually earned his PhD in Vienna and went on to shift the entire steroid industry toward soybean feedstocks through his work at Glidden and his own Julian Laboratories.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a world-leading X-ray crystallographer who solved the structures of critically important molecules including penicillin (1945), vitamin B12, and worked extensively on insulin beginning as early as 1934. Operating in the 1930s-60s when ambitious female scientists faced significant barriers, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for her transformative work that laid the foundation for modern protein crystallography. The article notes the complex personalities of both scientists, including Hodgkin's controversial political sympathies, while arguing that both deserve recognition for their scientific achievements independent of their identities.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this article's publication in 2014, recognition and scholarship around both figures has continued to evolve, though their core scientific legacies were already well-established by that point.

**Post-2014 Recognition and Memorialization:**
- Both Hodgkin and Julian have maintained their status as celebrated figures in science history, with numerous subsequent honors, exhibits, and educational initiatives bearing their names
- The Royal Society established the Dorothy Hodgkin fellowship scheme for early-career researchers, which continues to support scientists
- Various chemistry awards, buildings, and programs at universities continue to be named after both scientists
- Historical scholarship has continued to examine their careers and the social contexts in which they worked

**Scientific Fields They Pioneered:**
- **X-ray crystallography** (Hodgkin's field) has become absolutely central to modern drug discovery, with cryo-EM and advanced crystallography now routine tools in structural biology and pharmaceutical research
- **Steroid chemistry and natural products** (Julian's domain) remain important, though the pharmaceutical industry's focus has shifted significantly toward biologics, targeted therapies, and biotech approaches since the 2010s
- Both fields remain foundational to medicinal chemistry education and practice

**Social/Historical Impact:**
- The issues of diversity in STEM that the article touches upon have remained prominent topics in science policy and education
- Both scientists continue to serve as role models and case studies in discussions about overcoming systemic barriers in science

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not contain explicit predictions about the future. It is primarily retrospective, focusing on Google's recognition of these historical figures and contextualizing their achievements within the discrimination they faced.

The implicit argument—that these scientists deserve recognition for their achievements independent of their identities while acknowledging the additional obstacles they overcame—reflects an ongoing tension in how science history is presented and taught, which remains relevant today.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article provides important historical context about two significant scientists and addresses meaningful questions about recognition and diversity in science, its retrospective nature and focus on well-established biographical information limit its long-term analytical interest for understanding developments in biotechnology since 2014.
