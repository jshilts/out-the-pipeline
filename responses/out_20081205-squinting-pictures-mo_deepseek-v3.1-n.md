# Squinting At The Pictures, The Modern Way (Dec 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary article addresses usability issues with the American Chemical Society (ACS) journal websites following a redesign. The author, writing from a chemist's perspective, criticizes how graphical abstracts were initially displayed at extremely small "itsy bitsy" sizes, making them difficult to view when browsing in-press articles. 

More significantly, the article focuses on problems with RSS feeds, which many scientists used to follow journal content. After the redesign, ACS RSS feeds initially eliminated graphical abstracts entirely, then restored them but only as tiny, blurry images that were essentially useless for browsing. The author contrasts this deterioration with existing poor RSS implementations from other publishers like Elsevier and Wiley, while noting that Tetrahedron Letters—despite pioneering graphical abstracts—also failed to include them in RSS feeds. The piece serves as both criticism and call-to-action, documenting the author's complaint to ACS support and encouraging readers to voice similar concerns about restoring functionality to what had worked perfectly before the "improvements."

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2008 article, the broader context of academic publishing and RSS technology evolved significantly, though not always in directions that would have pleased the author.

**RSS Technology Decline**: Despite the author's advocacy for improved RSS functionality, the technology landscape shifted away from RSS readers. Google Reader, which the author specifically mentioned using, was discontinued by Google in July 2013. This was part of a broader industry trend where many platforms reduced RSS support in favor of social media feeds, email newsletters, and proprietary content distribution channels. By the mid-2010s, RSS had become a niche technology primarily used by technical users rather than the mainstream distribution channel it appeared to be in 2008.

**Academic Publishing UX Improvements**: Over the subsequent 15+ years, academic publishers gradually improved their digital platforms. The type of interface issues described in the article—tiny graphical abstracts and poor RSS implementations—became less common as publishers invested in better web design and mobile-responsive platforms. However, these improvements often came through proprietary platforms and APIs rather than open standards like RSS.

**Graphical Abstracts Standardization**: The concept of graphical abstracts that the author references did become more standardized and widely adopted across chemistry and other scientific fields. Modern journal websites now typically display graphical abstracts at reasonable sizes with better resolution. However, the distribution mechanisms shifted away from the RSS-based aggregation the author advocated for.

**Publishing Industry Consolidation**: The concerns about different publishers (ACS, Elsevier, Wiley) remained relevant, as academic publishing continued to consolidate with these major players maintaining dominant positions. The fundamental tension between user-friendly access and publisher business models persisted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article didn't explicitly make forward-looking predictions about biotechnology or science publishing. Instead, it advocated for immediate fixes to existing problems—specifically requesting that ACS restore functional RSS feeds with usable graphical abstracts. 

The implicit assumption in the author's advocacy was that:
- RSS would remain a crucial technology for scientists to follow journal literature
- Publishers would respond to user feedback by fixing these interface problems
- Graphical abstracts would continue to be important for article discovery and browsing

**Reality vs. Expectations**:
• RSS did not maintain its position as a primary content distribution method for scientific literature
• Publishers did eventually improve their interfaces, but often through different mechanisms than RSS
• The underlying concern about publisher usability remained valid, though the specific technical solutions evolved

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**

This article has very limited long-term importance as it addresses transient technical interface issues from 2008 using technology (RSS readers) that largely became obsolete within a few years. While it documents real usability problems that scientists faced, the rapid evolution of web technology and the decline of RSS make it primarily of historical interest rather than containing insights relevant to biotechnology or science policy more broadly.
