# Pursuing Other Interests, As They Say (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article reports on Bristol-Myers Squibb's Sunday announcement that their Chief Scientific Officer, Elliott Sigal, was retiring. The piece notes the unusual timing of the announcement (Sunday rather than a typical business day) and references a FierceBiotech article about the leadership change, with Sigal being replaced by a lieutenant. The article's tone suggests some speculation about the sudden nature of the departure.

## 2. HISTORY

After Elliott Sigal's retirement announcement in April 2013, he had served as CSO since 2004, overseeing a significant period of R&D transformation at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Between 2013 and his actual departure, the company continued several major drug development programs he had overseen. Subsequently, Francis Cuss became head of R&D, and over the following years, Bristol-Myers Squibb continued development of key therapeutic areas including oncology (particularly immuno-oncology), cardiovascular drugs, and virology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contained no explicit predictions about future events or outcomes. It was purely a report of a leadership announcement without forward-looking statements about the company's direction, drug pipeline, or industry trends.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a routine corporate leadership announcement with minimal substantive content about biotechnology developments or their implications.
