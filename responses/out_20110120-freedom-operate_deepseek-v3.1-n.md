# Freedom to Operate (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses patent considerations in drug discovery, distinguishing between two key intellectual property concepts: patentability (can you get a patent on your molecules?) and "freedom to operate" (FTO) - whether you can develop and commercialize your compounds without infringing others' existing patents. The author notes that while patentability often centers on novelty and prior art, FTO examines whether others' patent rights could block your development efforts.

The piece raises the question of whether FTO concerns actually derail drug development programs in practice. The author suggests that in small molecule drug discovery, FTO may be less problematic than in other fields because broad medical use claims have generally failed to hold up, and patent disputes typically involve patentability challenges rather than FTO issues. The article concludes by asking for real-world examples of drugs or programs blocked specifically by FTO problems.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2011, several significant developments reshaped the FTO landscape in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals:

**Biologics and Biosimilars**: The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) created an abbreviated FDA pathway for biosimilars starting in 2010, but the complexity of demonstrating biosimilarity and navigating patent thickets made FTO analysis increasingly critical for follow-on biologics. Patent litigation between originator and biosimilar manufacturers became common.

**Gene Therapy and CRISPR**: The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing created a major FTO crisis in the industry. The bitter patent dispute between the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley (resolved in 2022 with the Broad prevailing on US patent claims) meant companies developing CRISPR therapies faced significant licensing challenges. Many had to secure licenses from both parties or different universities to achieve FTO, impacting therapeutic development timelines and costs.

**Antibody Therapeutics**: As the number of antibody drugs grew post-2011, concerns emerged about patent thickets and stacking licensing requirements for complex biologics programs, particularly affecting smaller companies and academic spin-outs.

**CAR-T and Cell Therapy**: The field encountered FTO challenges as foundational patents around chimeric antigen receptors and manufacturing processes created complex licensing landscapes.

**Patent Litigation Outcomes**: The America Invents Act (2011) created new post-grant patent challenges, affecting pharmaceutical patent strategies. However, patentability challenges remained more common than pure FTO disputes.

No major FDA-approved small molecule drugs appear to have been permanently derailed primarily due to FTO concerns since 2011, though several programs likely required licensing negotiations or design-around strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit predictions but raised implicit questions:

- **Whether FTO would become a greater constraint in drug development**: This partially materialized, particularly in biologics and gene therapy, but less so in traditional small molecules as the author suspected
- **Whether broad medical use claims would remain difficult to enforce**: This largely held true throughout the period, though biologics and diagnostic methods faced different standards

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article identified an important distinction in pharmaceutical IP strategy at a time when the landscape was becoming more complex, though it focused primarily on small molecules and thus missed the bigger FTO challenges that emerged in biologics and gene therapies.
