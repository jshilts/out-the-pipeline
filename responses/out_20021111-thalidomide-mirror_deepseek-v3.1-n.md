# Thalidomide in the Mirror (November 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article addresses widespread misconceptions about thalidomide, particularly the persistent myth that only one chiral form (enantiomer) of the drug caused the teratogenic effects that led to severe birth defects in the 1950s-60s. The author cites a Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery paper that debunks this "chirality myth" using two key findings: in vivo studies in rabbits (which, like humans, are highly sensitive to thalidomide) show both enantiomers are equally teratogenic, and the chiral center in thalidomide is unstable under physiological conditions - meaning the drug racemizes (converts to a mixture) in the body.

The article notes that thalidomide was experiencing a pharmaceutical comeback around 2002-2003, with Celgene developing it for leprosy treatment and investigating applications in cancer and other diseases, while emphasizing the critical need for pregnancy prevention programs given its known teratogenicity.

## 2. HISTORY

Thalidomide's second life indeed materialized as predicted. The FDA approved thalidomide (Thalomid) in 1998 for treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of leprosy, making it the first FDA-approved use despite the 1960s tragedy. This was followed by off-label use and eventually FDA approval in 2006 for multiple myeloma, particularly in combination with dexamethasone.

The pregnancy prevention challenge was addressed through mandatory Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) programs - the STEPS program (System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety) and later the more comprehensive Thalomid REMS program. These required patient registration, contraceptive use, and periodic pregnancy testing.

Scientifically, the chirality mechanism has become even more nuanced. While the article correctly noted interconversion between enantiomers, later research (2010+) revealed thalidomide acts through multiple mechanisms, particularly binding to cereblon, part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to degradation of specific proteins including transcription factors. This mechanism has been harnessed therapeutically and led to development of related immunomodulatory drugs like lenalidomide and pomalidomide.

Thalidomide derivatives now represent a multi-billion dollar drug class in oncology, though the original compound faces generic competition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Main prediction**: Thalidomide would see expanded therapeutic use in cancer and other diseases - **✓ CORRECT**. Beyond leprosy, thalidomide gained FDA approval for multiple myeloma in 2006 and is used in other cancers including myelodysplastic syndromes. The mechanism spawned an entire class of immunomodulatory drugs.

• **Implicit prediction**: Pharmaceutical companies would successfully manage pregnancy risks - **✓ CORRECT**. Mandatory REMS programs implemented since 1998 have largely prevented repeat of the birth defect crisis through strict monitoring and education requirements.

• **Implicit prediction**: The scientific understanding of thalidomide's chirality and mechanism would improve - **✓ CORRECT**. Research post-2002, particularly after 2010, identified cereblon binding and targeted protein degradation as key mechanisms, explaining both therapeutic and teratogenic effects while confirming the instability of the chiral center noted in the article.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article correctly debunked a persistent scientific myth that was still cited in pharmacology and toxicology circles, and presciently identified thalidomide's therapeutic potential at a time when its comeback was just beginning. The topic addresses fundamental principles in drug safety and chirality that remain highly relevant to pharmaceutical development.
