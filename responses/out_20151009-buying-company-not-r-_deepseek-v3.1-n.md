# Buying A Company Is Not R&D Spending (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article by Derek Lowe responds to a reader comment defending Valeant's business model. The commentator argued that when companies like Valeant spend hundreds of millions acquiring other companies with drugs, this should be considered equivalent to R&D spending. 

Lowe systematically rejects this argument by explaining that acquiring an already-developed drug is fundamentally different from funding the actual R&D process. He describes how Valeant would purchase companies whose drugs had already survived clinical trials, then immediately shut down research facilities, sell equipment as surplus, and fire all the scientists and lab personnel. The acquisition money flows to shareholders of the purchased company—mutual funds, pension funds, and money managers—who are free to invest elsewhere or not at all. Lowe argues this actually destroys R&D capacity rather than funding it, comparing it to buying an existing building (not spending on architecture) or buying an old painting (not spending on art supplies).

## 2. HISTORY

In the months and years following this article's publication in October 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals became engulfed in one of the largest pharmaceutical scandals in recent history:

**The Downfall (2015-2016)**: Just weeks after this article, Valeant's stock began collapsing amid investigations into its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services. The company had been using Philidor to artificially inflate drug prices and manipulate insurance reimbursements. By November 2015, Valeant's stock had lost over 60% of its value. Congressional investigations followed in 2016, revealing massive price hikes—some drugs increased 500-600% overnight—and questionable accounting practices.

**The Ackman Exit (2017)**: Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who had been one of Valeant's most prominent defenders and held a massive stake through Pershing Square, finally sold his entire position in March 2017 at a staggering $4 billion loss, calling it a "huge mistake."

**Corporate Transformation (2018-present)**: Valeant changed its name to Bausch Health Companies in 2018, attempting to distance itself from the scandal. The company sold off numerous assets to pay down its massive $30+ billion debt load. Most significantly, Valeant's business model that Lowe criticized—acquiring companies and slashing R&D—proved unsustainable. The company ultimately had to return to investing in actual R&D to develop a pipeline.

**Industry Impact**: The Valeant scandal led to increased scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices and helped catalyze policy discussions about drug price regulation. Many other pharma companies that had emulated parts of Valeant's model either went bankrupt or were forced to restructure. The episode served as a cautionary tale about the limitations of growth through acquisition without genuine innovation investment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about Valeant's business model:

• **Prediction**: That shutting down R&D capacity would prove unsustainable for long-term growth
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Valeant's lack of internal R&D pipeline ultimately contributed to its collapse, as it had no new products to replace aging acquired drugs.

• **Prediction**: That money from acquisitions flowing to shareholders wouldn't necessarily return to biotech R&D
  - **Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. While some shareholders did reinvest in biotech, the broader point about capital allocation inefficiencies proved true as many acquired companies' research programs were permanently lost.

• **Prediction**: That Valeant's approach represented genuine R&D destruction rather than efficient capital allocation
  - **Outcome**: **Very accurate**. This became a central theme in post-mortem analyses of Valeant's failure, with industry observers pointing to the long-term damage caused by eliminating research infrastructure.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 9/9**

This article presciently identified fundamental flaws in Valeant's entire business strategy just as the company was approaching its zenith, making it exceptionally insightful and ahead of its time in understanding the broader implications of financial engineering in pharmaceuticals.
