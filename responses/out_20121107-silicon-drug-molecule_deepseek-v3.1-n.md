# Silicon In Drug Molecules: Not Quite There (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary reflects on the limited adoption of silicon-for-carbon substitution in drug molecules. The author notes that while medicinal chemists occasionally consider replacing carbon atoms with silicon (particularly in groups like t-butyl to trimethylsilyl), the approach remains marginal and "too out there" for mainstream drug discovery. The article references the failure of UK company Amedis, which specialized in silicon-containing drugs before being acquired by Paradigm Therapeutics (2005), which was later acquired by Takeda, with no apparent continuation of the silicon-focused strategy.

The most advanced silicon-containing drug mentioned is Karenitecin, a camptothecin analogue that entered Phase III trials in 2008 but appears to have stalled without apparent success. The author concludes that silicon substitution needs "one success" to gain traction, but the right combination of activity, commercial interest, and medical need hasn't materialized.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2012 article, silicon-containing drugs have seen continued but modest development. Karenitecin (BNP1350), the Phase III cancer drug mentioned, ultimately failed in clinical trials and was not approved by the FDA. The drug's developer, Bionumerik Pharmaceuticals, halted development, and no silicon-containing small molecule drugs have achieved FDA approval as of 2024.

Research into organosilicon medicinal chemistry has continued, with academic groups publishing studies on silicon-containing drug candidates, particularly in oncology and antimicrobial applications. However, these efforts remain primarily in preclinical stages. No major pharmaceutical company has adopted silicon substitution as a systematic drug design strategy.

The organosilicon chemistry approach has found more practical application in other areas, such as drug delivery systems (silicon-based nanoparticles and materials) and medical devices rather than as direct therapeutic small molecules. Silicon-based contrast agents for medical imaging have also seen some development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"All silicon needs is one success, and then people will take it more seriously"**: This has not materialized - no silicon-containing small molecule drugs have achieved FDA approval or commercial success in the decade-plus since publication. The field remains niche.

- **"The right combination of activity, interest, and need hasn't quite come together"**: This assessment has proven accurate - the combination still hasn't emerged, and silicon substitution remains a curiosity rather than a practical drug design approach.

- **Implicit prediction that Karenitecin might succeed**: This proved incorrect - Karenitecin failed in Phase III trials and was abandoned.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

The article identifies an interesting but ultimately minor thread in drug discovery - the attempt to systematically use silicon in pharmaceuticals. While the topic has theoretical appeal for chemists, it has had minimal practical impact on medicine or the pharmaceutical industry over the subsequent decade. The subject occupies an intriguing middle ground: too chemically interesting to ignore completely, but not important enough to drive commercial or clinical success.
