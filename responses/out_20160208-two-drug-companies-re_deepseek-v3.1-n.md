# Two Drug Companies Rewrite Some Cancer Biochemistry (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a joint PNAS publication by Novartis and Pfizer that challenged a widely accepted hypothesis in cancer biology. The prevailing belief was that KRAS-mutant cancers—a particularly difficult-to-treat category—were dependent on the cellular recycling process called autophagy (specifically macroautophagy) for survival. This dependency had made autophagy inhibition an attractive therapeutic strategy, with the antimalarial drug chloroquine being used clinically as an autophagy inhibitor to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy.

The key finding from the Novartis-Pfizer collaboration was that deleting ATG7—an enzyme considered essential for macroautophagy—from multiple KRAS-mutant cancer cell lines had no effect on their growth or survival. The cells continued growing normally and showed no increased sensitivity to radiation or various chemical agents. Additionally, the research revealed that chloroquine still worked as a cancer cell sensitizer even when autophagy was eliminated, meaning its clinical benefit remained valid but for unknown reasons.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2016 publication, several important developments occurred in the autophagy-cancer field:

**Clinical Trial Outcomes:**
The article's skepticism about autophagy inhibition as a cancer therapy proved prescient. Subsequent clinical trials of autophagy inhibitors in cancer largely failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit:
- Multiple phase I and II trials combining hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with chemotherapy in various cancers showed limited efficacy
- The largest randomized phase II trial (NCT01206530) of HCQ plus chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer—a KRAS-driven tumor—failed to show survival benefit
- By 2020, enthusiasm for chloroquine derivatives as autophagy inhibitors in oncology had substantially waned

**Scientific Understanding Evolution:**
- Research subsequent to 2016 revealed that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have multiple cellular effects beyond autophagy inhibition, including effects on lysosomal function, immune modulation, and other pathways
- The field recognized that many early studies attributing effects solely to autophagy inhibition were oversimplified
- Autophagy's role in cancer became understood as more context-dependent: sometimes tumor-suppressive, sometimes tumor-promoting, varying by cancer type, stage, and genetic background

**Drug Development Impact:**
- Most pharmaceutical programs targeting autophagy inhibition for oncology were deprioritized or discontinued following these findings
- Attention shifted toward direct KRAS inhibitors, with compounds like sotorasib (AMG 510) and adagrasib (MRTX849) becoming the first FDA-approved drugs targeting KRAS G12C mutations in 2021-2022
- The discovery that chloroquine worked through non-autophagy mechanisms led to investigations of its other properties, including potential antiviral applications (which became highly relevant during COVID-19)

**Business/Market Developments:**
- Novartis and Pfizer's collaboration demonstrated industry's ability to self-correct when faced with contradictory data
- The publication likely influenced resource allocation away from autophagy inhibition programs at multiple companies
- Academic programs studying autophagy in cancer underwent significant reassessment

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather analyzed the implications of existing data. However, several implicit predictions/expectations can be evaluated:

- **Implicit prediction: Challenge to autophagy dogma would be impactful** 
  ✓ **Correct:** The findings significantly influenced the field and led to reassessment of therapeutic strategies
  
- **Implicit prediction: Chloroquine would continue to have clinical value despite mechanism uncertainty**
  ✓ **Correct:** While cancer applications were limited, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine remained important for other indications (malaria, autoimmune diseases, with brief COVID-19 interest)

- **Implicit prediction: Target identification would become more important**
  ✓ **Correct:** The "let the target hunts commence" comment proved accurate—subsequent research focused on identifying the true mechanism of chloroquine's effects

- **Implicit prediction: Basic vs applied research boundaries would remain blurry**
  ✓ **Correct:** Industry continues to conduct fundamental biology research as part of drug development

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article ranks in the top 20% of interest because it captured a significant paradigm shift in cancer biology at the moment it was occurring. The Novartis-Pfizer collaboration demonstrated how rigorous science can overturn widely accepted dogma, with direct implications for clinical practice and drug development strategy.
