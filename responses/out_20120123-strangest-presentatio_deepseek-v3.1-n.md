# Strangest Presentation You've Seen? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post recounts an unexpected presentation at the 1998 Gordon Conference on Heterocycles, where a young faculty member from Montana was scheduled to speak on metal-catalyzed reactions of indoles but instead delivered an impromptu talk challenging the RNA world hypothesis. The speaker showed visible agitation and passion against mainstream origins-of-life research, which he regarded as nearly conspiratorial, leaving the audience uncomfortable and unconvinced. The post notes the speaker subsequently moved to a small Adventist institution before becoming untraceable.

## 2. HISTORY
The article focuses on an anecdote from 1998 and was published as a blog post in 2012, during a period when origins-of-life research continued progressing along established lines. The RNA world hypothesis—described in the post as mainstream—has remained a leading framework, with ongoing experimental work developing RNA-based models, ribozyme engineering, and prebiotic chemistry throughout the 2010s to the present. No large-scale scientific reversal or policy shift away from RNA world models occurred subsequently. The presentation described did not catalyze broader scientific debates or lead to new research programs, and the speaker cited (from Montana, later affiliated with an Adventist school) did not emerge as a prominent researcher or public commentator on origins-of-life topics in the years after 2012.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- The blog post does not include explicit forward-looking predictions about biotechnology, the scientific field, or the wider impact of the presentation it describes. It is framed as an anecdotal recollection without forecasting.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
A minor, quirky anecdote with no substantive scientific or biotech implications; it lacks concrete outcomes, policy relevance, or broader adoption.
