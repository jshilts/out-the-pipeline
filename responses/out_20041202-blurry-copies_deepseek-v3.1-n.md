# Blurry Copies (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the phenomenon of "me-too drugs" in the pharmaceutical industry - when companies develop drugs that are structurally similar to already-approved medications rather than pursuing entirely new mechanisms. The piece responds to criticism that this practice is wasteful and uninnovative.

The author argues that me-too drugs serve important purposes: they provide alternatives when safety issues emerge (as with Vioxx, where Celebrex remained available), offer variations in efficacy and side effect profiles, and create competitive pressure that benefits patients. The author notes that first-in-class drugs prove a mechanism is viable and commercially successful, which then attracts follow-on drugs that attempt to improve upon the original through better dosing, efficacy, or safety profiles. The key point is that "no two drugs are, or even can be, completely identical," meaning even similar drugs can have meaningful differences for patients.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical landscape evolved significantly after 2004 regarding me-too drugs, though the fundamental dynamics described remained largely accurate:

**Vioxx/Celebrex Aftermath**: Merck withdrew Vioxx (rofecoxib) in September 2004 due to cardiovascular risks discovered in post-marketing surveillance. Celebrex (celecoxib) remained on the market with updated warnings. This became a textbook case validating the article's argument - having multiple COX-2 inhibitors allowed patients continued access to this drug class. However, the controversy led to increased scrutiny of COX-2 inhibitors overall, with both drugs facing new prescribing restrictions and declining use.

**Regulatory Changes**: The Vioxx withdrawal triggered major FDA reforms. In 2007, the FDA Amendments Act strengthened post-market surveillance requirements and gave FDA new authority to mandate additional safety studies. Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) became common for drugs with significant safety concerns. Direct head-to-head trials, mentioned in the article as becoming more common, indeed became more frequent as payers and regulators demanded comparative effectiveness data.

**Market Evolution**: The economics of me-too drugs changed substantially. Patent cliffs in the 2010s saw many blockbuster drugs lose protection, leading to generic competition that dramatically reduced prices. This affected me-too strategies - developing expensive new me-too drugs became less profitable when generics could undercut both originator and follow-on branded drugs.

**Industry Consolidation**: The pharmaceutical industry saw significant consolidation through mergers and acquisitions. Many smaller companies that might have pursued me-too strategies were acquired, and R&D focus shifted somewhat toward specialty drugs with smaller patient populations but higher prices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions, both explicit and implicit:

• **Prediction**: Head-to-head trials would become more common in the post-Vioxx world
  - **Outcome**: **Mostly accurate**. Comparative effectiveness research gained prominence, though it took longer than implied. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $1.1 billion to comparative effectiveness research, and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was established in 2010. However, mandatory head-to-head trials remain the exception rather than the rule for most drug approvals.

• **Prediction**: The "least safe drug in any class" would be "knocked out" similarly to Vioxx
  - **Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. Several drugs were withdrawn or restricted in the following years, but not systematically the "least safe" in each class. For example, the diabetes drug Avandia (rosiglitazone) faced severe restrictions in 2010 due to cardiovascular risks, while the related drug Actos (pioglitazone) remained widely available. The dynamic was more complex than simple class-wide safety rankings.

• **Prediction**: Me-too drugs would continue to be developed because proven mechanisms attract investment
  - **Outcome**: **Accurate**. This pattern continued, though at varying rates across therapeutic areas. For example, multiple PCSK9 inhibitors followed after Repatha and Praluent proved the mechanism, multiple SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetes, and several checkpoint inhibitors in oncology after initial PD-1 inhibitors demonstrated success. The basic economic logic remained sound.

• **Prediction**: Competition from me-too drugs benefits consumers/patients
  - **Outcome**: **Mixed**. In some cases, yes - alternatives provided when safety issues emerged, and some price competition occurred. However, me-too drugs often launched at similar premium prices rather than dramatically undercutting originator drugs. The benefits were more evident in choice and availability than in affordability until generic entry.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article remains relevant for understanding fundamental pharmaceutical industry dynamics, and the Vioxx case study became historically significant. However, it covers well-established territory with only moderate predictive depth.
