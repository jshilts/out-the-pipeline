# Marathon's Real Costs (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes Marathon Pharmaceuticals' development costs for Emflaza (deflazacort), a corticosteroid drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The author cites an Endpoints report estimating that Marathon's actual R&D costs ranged from as low as \$10 million to no more than \$70 million. 

The key context is that deflazacort was not a new drug—it had been discovered decades earlier, was already being manufactured, and the major clinical trials had been completed 20 years prior by other researchers. Marathon's development work consisted primarily of standard regulatory requirements like drug-drug interaction and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) studies, but no new registrational clinical trials were conducted.

The article argues that Marathon was exploiting a regulatory pathway by repurposing an old generic steroid and criticized the company's pricing strategy and CEO statements about extensive development costs as misleading. The author asserts that Marathon benefited from others' prior work while positioning themselves to "rake in the cash."

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Timeline:**
- February 2017: The debate sparked by Marathon's \$89,000 annual price tag for Emflaza (deflazacort)
- March 2017: Marathon announced it would delay the U.S. launch amid intense public and political backlash
- April 2017: Marathon sold Emflaza to PTC Therapeutics for approximately \$140 million in upfront payments plus potential milestones and royalties

**Post-Acquisition Developments:**
- PTC Therapeutics relaunched Emflaza at a reduced price point, though still expensive for patients
- The drug received FDA approval under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which allows reliance on previous studies
- Deflazacort became a case study in pharmaceutical pricing controversies and regulatory pathway questions
- Public scrutiny intensified around drug repurposing strategies and pricing of orphan drugs

**Regulatory and Policy Impact:**
- The case contributed to ongoing debates about whether the 505(b)(2) pathway was being exploited
- It highlighted concerns about systemic issues in orphan drug pricing and the balance between innovation incentives and access
- Patient advocacy groups became more vocal about pricing transparency and fair access to treatments

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about Marathon benefiting financially**: The article stated "they're going to rake in the cash, so who cares?" This proved partially accurate—Marathon did profit through the \$140 million sale to PTC Therapeutics within months, but they never successfully commercialized the drug themselves due to public backlash.

• **No explicit forward-looking predictions were made** about the drug's clinical adoption, patient outcomes, or broader industry changes, so no other predictions can be evaluated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures a significant moment in pharmaceutical pricing debates and illustrates the mechanics of drug repurposing controversies, but it documents a well-understood pattern rather than revealing novel industry dynamics.
