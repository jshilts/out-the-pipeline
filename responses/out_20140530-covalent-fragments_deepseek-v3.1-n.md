# Covalent Fragments (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines a 2014 paper by Alexander Statsyuk and colleagues at Northwestern University, which appears to be the first published example of screening a library of covalent, irreversibly-binding fragments. The research addressed the challenge of balancing the reactivity of covalent modifiers with fragment-like properties—avoiding both overly reactive "hot" groups that lack selectivity and overly "tame" groups that require perfect binding geometry to react.

The Northwestern team systematically evaluated various reactive functional groups (acrylamides, vinylsulfonamides, acrylates, vinylsulfones) against a test thiol. Acrylates emerged as the optimal choice, showing only about twofold reactivity variation across different structures—striking the right balance between reactivity and selectivity. They screened a 100-compound acrylate library against papain (a cysteine protease), identifying three distinct fragment hits. Critically, 97 other fragments failed to label even the highly reactive active-site cysteine, suggesting the hits succeeded through structure-driven binding selectivity rather than indiscriminate reactivity. The approach showed target-specificity, as screening against a rhinovirus protease (HRV3C) yielded three different hits, while other targets (USP08, UbcH7) produced few or no hits.

The article concludes by posing a key question: whether optimized covalent fragments could have their reactive "warheads" removed while retaining sufficient potency—what might be called a "bait-and-switch" strategy for converting covalent hits into reversible inhibitors.

## 2. HISTORY

The covalent fragment approach reported in 2014 proved prescient and grew into a significant trend in drug discovery over the subsequent decade. The general trajectory can be summarized:

**Commercial adoption and library development**: The concept of covalent fragment screening gained traction, with several companies and academic groups developing dedicated covalent fragment libraries. While maintaining the challenging balance between reactivity and selectivity remained non-trivial, the approach became recognized as complementary to both traditional fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) and conventional covalent inhibitor discovery.

**Covalent drugs reach market**: During the post-2014 period, several covalent drugs achieved FDA approval. Ibrutinib (approved 2013 for certain B-cell malignancies) and osimertinib (approved 2015 for EGFR-mutant lung cancer) exemplified the continuing clinical success of rationally designed covalent kinase inhibitors, reinforcing the drug discovery community's interest in covalent mechanisms. However, these generally arose from traditional medicinal chemistry rather than the specific fragment-based covalent discovery described in this article.

**Covalent fragment screening becomes recognized as a distinct approach**: Publications and conferences increasingly treated covalent fragment screening as an established method. It found application primarily against targets with nucleophilic residues (most commonly cysteine, sometimes serine, lysine, or others) and became recognized as especially valuable for challenging undruggable targets where reversible binding modes proved insufficient.

**Technological maturation**: Screening technologies advanced, but the fundamental principle identified by Statsyuk—the need to balance warhead reactivity against selectivity—remained central. Mass spectrometry (as used in the original paper) became widely adopted for screening, alongside other readouts. The practical challenge of achieving sufficient hit rates persisted, especially compared with larger, conventional high-throughput screening (HTS) libraries.

**Business development**: Companies explicitly offering covalent fragment libraries or services emerged and gained traction, and several biotech startups incorporated covalent targeting into their discovery platforms. However, covalent fragment screening largely remained a specialized capability rather than a universally adopted standard like conventional HTS.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article asks relatively specific questions rather than making broad predictions, but one stands out:

- **"If you find such a covalent fragment, and optimize it to be a much more potent binder, can you then pull the bait-and-switch by removing the covalent warhead, and still retain enough potency? Or is that too much to ask?"**

In practice, the covalent warhead provides anywhere from a modest "binding contribution"—perhaps 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in potency—to functioning as an absolutely essential anchor, depending on the system. While examples exist where removal of a warhead yields a useful reversible binder (often at the cost of potency), this "bait-and-switch" proved far from universal. Many successful covalent programs retained the covalent mechanism throughout optimization and into the clinic, since the superior potency and prolonged target residence time often outweighed the potential risks associated with reactive metabolites or off-target reactivity.

More broadly, the underlying premise—that **covalent fragment screening would prove practically useful**—did mature into reality. Over subsequent years, covalent fragment screening identified starting points that progressed into potent, selective chemical probes and, in some cases, clinical candidates. However, the success rate does not appear to have fundamentally outpaced conventional fragment discovery; rather, covalent fragments became appreciated as a tool for specific target classes or druggability challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article reports the first published example of covalent fragment screening—a now-established technique—and correctly identifies the key challenge (balancing reactivity versus selectivity). It offers useful technical insight and raises an astute question about warhead removal.
