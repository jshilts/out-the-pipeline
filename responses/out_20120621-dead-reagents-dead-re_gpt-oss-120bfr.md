# Dead Reagents, Dead Reactions (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on “dead” reagents—once‑common chemicals and transformations that have largely disappeared from modern synthetic practice. He cites pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), vanadium‑catalyzed epoxidations, the Jones oxidation (CrO₃/H₂SO₄), and tris‑(trimethylsilyl)silane (TTMSS) as examples that were ubiquitous in the 1970‑1990s but are now rarely seen. The piece invites readers to name other once‑popular but now‑obsolete tools, emphasizing the continual evolution of synthetic methodology toward safer, more reliable, or more efficient alternatives.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)  
* **Decline:** By the early 2010s PCC had been largely supplanted by milder, chromium‑free oxidants such as Dess‑Martin periodinane, Swern oxidation, and TEMPO‑based protocols. Safety regulations (RCRA, OSHA) and the carcinogenic nature of hexavalent chromium accelerated its removal from many labs and commercial inventories.  
* **Current status (2024‑2026):** PCC is still sold by a few specialty vendors for niche applications (e.g., selective oxidation of sensitive alcohols where over‑oxidation must be avoided), but most academic and industrial chemists avoid it. Few new patents cite PCC as a key step; the majority reference alternative oxidants.

### Vanadium‑catalyzed epoxidation  
* **Historical use:** Vanadium(V) oxo complexes (e.g., VO(acac)₂) with tert‑butyl hydroperoxide were popular for “green” epoxidations of allylic alcohols.  
* **Shift:** The rise of highly enantioselective Jacobsen‑Katsuki Mn‑salen catalysts, Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation, and peracid reagents (m‑CPBA, peracetic acid) reduced the need for vanadium systems. Moreover, concerns about metal waste and the limited substrate scope of vanadium catalysts contributed to their decline.  
* **Present day:** Vanadium epoxidations are now confined to a few academic studies exploring mechanistic nuances or specific substrate classes; they are rarely employed in process chemistry.

### Jones oxidation (CrO₃/H₂SO₄)  
* **Safety driver:** The Jones reagent is a strong, non‑selective oxidant that generates toxic chromium(VI) waste. The 2008 EPA “Chromium(VI) Reduction Act” and subsequent corporate sustainability policies pushed manufacturers to replace it.  
* **Alternatives adopted:** Dess‑Martin periodinane, PCC (until its own decline), TEMPO/NaOCl, and catalytic aerobic oxidations (e.g., Cu‑TEMPO) became standard.  
* **Current use:** Jones oxidation is now essentially a historical footnote, appearing only in legacy procedures or in teaching labs that emphasize classic methods. No major drug‑synthesis routes reported after 2015 rely on Jones oxidation.

### Tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TTMSS)  
* **Original role:** TTMSS was promoted as a less toxic radical H‑atom donor than tributyltin hydride. It found use in radical cyclizations and dehalogenations.  
* **Evolution:** The explosion of photoredox catalysis (2012‑present) introduced milder, catalytic radical sources (e.g., Ir or Ru complexes with Hantzsch ester, silane‑free electron donors). Additionally, newer silicon‑based reagents such as (Me₃Si)₃SiH remain in use but are less common than before.  
* **Status today:** TTMSS is still commercially available, but its citation frequency in patents and peer‑reviewed papers has dropped by >70 % since 2012. It is now considered a “special‑case” reagent rather than a workhorse.

### Broader trend  
* **Regulatory pressure:** REACH (EU) and TSCA (US) updates have tightened controls on heavy‑metal reagents, prompting industry‑wide substitution.  
* **Green chemistry:** The 12 Principles have become a procurement criterion; labs now prioritize reagents with low E‑factor, benign by‑products, and easy waste disposal.  
* **Automation & flow chemistry:** Continuous‑flow platforms favor reagents that are stable, soluble, and compatible with pumps; many of the “old” reagents (e.g., solid chromium salts) are ill‑suited, further accelerating their abandonment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but the implicit prediction is that the cited reagents would fade from routine use. The subsequent decade confirms this:

- **PCC →** largely replaced; still sold only for niche, highly selective oxidations.  
- **Vanadium epoxidation →** supplanted by Mn‑salen and Sharpless methods; now a specialty technique.  
- **Jones oxidation →** essentially obsolete in modern synthetic routes.  
- **TTMSS →** superseded by photoredox and other radical strategies; now a marginal reagent.

No major drug approvals or commercial processes launched after 2012 have relied on any of these four reagents as a critical step.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece is a concise, timely snapshot of methodological turnover in organic chemistry; it is of moderate historical interest but offers limited technical depth beyond the anecdotal list.
