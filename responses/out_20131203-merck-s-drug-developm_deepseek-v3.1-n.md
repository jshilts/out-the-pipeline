# Merck's Drug Development in The New Yorker (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Merck's development of suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist for treating insomnia, framed around the broader context of sleep medication and drug development challenges. It highlights the serendipitous discovery of orexin's role in sleep regulation, originating from research on narcoleptic dogs that lacked functional orexin receptors, and later confirmation that narcoleptic humans lacked orexin itself.

The piece covers the extensive timeline of drug development, including the 2006 milestone when MK-4305 (suvorexant's development code) was cleared for human testing. A significant portion focuses on the FDA regulatory process, particularly the dosage controversy where the FDA favored a lower 10-mg starting dose while Merck worried this might be insufficient for clinical efficacy. The article also briefly covers the history of zolpidem (Ambien) as the main competitor and provides insights into the pharmaceutical industry's high failure rates in drug development.

## 2. HISTORY
**FDA Approval and Marketing:** Suvorexant was eventually approved by the FDA in August 2014 under the brand name BELSOMRA, with the exact dosing strategy that was debated in the article: starting dose of 10 mg, with options of 15 mg and 20 mg for patients who don't respond adequately to the lower dose.

**Clinical Performance and Market Reception:** Despite the novel mechanism of action, BELSOMRA has had relatively modest commercial success. It achieved FDA approval but never captured substantial market share from zolpidem and other established sleep medications. Annual sales peaked around $300-400 million globally, significantly below initial projections of blockbuster potential (>$1 billion annually).

**Clinical Issues:** Post-approval monitoring revealed concerns about next-day impairment and residual effects, similar to existing sleep medications. The distinctive mechanism targeting orexin pathways, while scientifically innovative, did not translate into clearly superior clinical outcomes compared to existing treatments.

**Research Continuation:** Merck continued developing orexin antagonists, including exploring different formulations and potential applications beyond insomnia, though no major breakthrough products emerged from this research line through the late 2010s and early 2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Merck's dosing strategy concerns**: The article highlighted Merck's worry that 10mg might be "not enough to be effective in enough patients." **Outcome**: The FDA did approve the 10mg starting dose, and while the drug worked pharmacologically, market penetration remained limited, partially due to modest efficacy at approved doses.

• **Implicit expectation of significant commercial success**: The article's narrative suggested this innovative mechanism could lead to a major new sleep medication. **Outcome**: BELSOMRA achieved regulatory approval but underperformed commercially, failing to displace zolpidem or become a blockbuster drug.

• **"Pharmaceutical companies are very skilled at selling stories"**: The article noted that companies market innovative mechanisms effectively. **Outcome**: Despite having a genuinely novel scientific story around orexin biology, Merck was unable to translate this into significant market success for BELSOMRA.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4/10**

This article provides valuable insights into FDA regulatory processes and represents a case study in drug development, but it focuses on a drug that ultimately had modest commercial and clinical impact, limiting its long-term significance.
