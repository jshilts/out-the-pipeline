# Novartis Stays With the

## 1. SUMMARY

The article announces that James "Jay" Bradner will succeed Mark Fishman as president of the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR) in Cambridge, starting January 2016. This represents a leadership transition for Novartis's R&D operations. Bradner, coming from Harvard, had a prominent research profile at the time, with work that had been discussed multiple times in the biotech commentary space, particularly around chemical biology approaches. The transition was planned to allow overlap between the outgoing and incoming leaders.

## 2. HISTORY

**Leadership and R&D Performance (2015-2024):**
- Jay Bradner led NIBR from 2016, maintaining Novartis's position as one of the largest pharmaceutical R&D operations globally.
- Under Bradner, Novartis continued investment in oncology, immunology, and gene therapy platforms.
- In 2021, Bradner announced he would step down as NIBR president to become an entrepreneur-in-residence at Third Rock Ventures, succeeded by Fiona H. Marshall.
- Novartis maintained steady clinical pipelines across this period, with notable successes and failures typical of large pharma.

**Concrete Drug Development Outcomes:**
- Novartis continued development and approvals: CAR-T therapy Kymriah (2017), gene therapy Zolgensma (2019), and other therapies across cardiovascular, oncology, and immunology therapeutic areas.
- Multiple phase 2/3 clinical trial readouts during Bradner's tenure, though the causal relationship between NIBR leadership and approval timelines is complex.
- Novartis maintained its global top-5 pharmaceutical R&D budget throughout this period.

**R&D Strategy:**
- The company continued emphasizing open innovation models, collaborations with academic institutions, and early-stage research, consistent with hiring academic leaders like Bradner.
- No major restructuring of NIBR's fundamental structure occurred under Bradner.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction (implicit):** The article expected Jay Bradner would steer NIBR differently, with his research background bringing new directions in chemical biology and early-stage research.

**Outcome:**
- **Partial match:** Bradner prioritized collaborative academic partnerships and early-stage innovative programs at NIBR, consistent with his background.
- **However:** Large pharma R&D is highly constrained by existing pipelines and corporate strategy; revolutionary directional changes are rare.
- **Empirical result:** Novartis continued investments in previously established therapeutic areas (oncology, gene therapy, immunology), suggesting broad continuity despite leadership transitions.
- **Research directions:** The chemical biology and epigenetics interests highlighted in the article showed mixed results; the field saw continued development but not paradigm-shifting outcomes for Novartis specifically.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article's importance primarily concerns one company's internal leadership transition and carries limited broader industry-wide or public health significance beyond personnel changes. Leadership transitions at major pharma companies are routine occurrences, and the consequences for drug development are diffuse and difficult to attribute.
