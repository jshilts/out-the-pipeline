# The Economist's Take On Drug Discovery (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 blog post by Derek Lowe critiques an Economist article about the pharmaceutical industry, written in the context of the Pfizer-Allergan merger. The Economist article questioned whether large drug companies are necessary for drug research, challenged the PhRMA figure of $2.6 billion as the cost to develop a new drug, and suggested that Médecins Sans Frontières estimates of $50-190 million are more realistic. The Economist also argued that the industry was moving away from in-house research toward bringing in drugs partway through development, and criticized companies for focusing on "beauty products" like Botox rather than life-saving cures.

Lowe systematically refutes these points, arguing that the $2.6 billion figure, while probably inflated, is much closer to reality than MSF's numbers, which he notes are based on outdated compounds from the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative and don't reflect modern drug discovery costs. He points out that large companies have been acquiring drugs partway through development for decades, contradicting the Economist's framing of this as a "new model." He also challenges the characterization of companies focusing heavily on beauty products, using Allergan as an unrepresentative example, and notes that the merger being discussed is primarily for tax purposes rather than representing industry trends.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical landscape evolved significantly after 2015, though many of the fundamental tensions Lowe identified persisted:

**Drug Development Costs:** The $2.6 billion figure continued to be debated, with subsequent analyses (including from institutions like the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development) generally supporting that drug development costs remain very high, particularly for innovative therapies. The R&D cost discussion became more nuanced with the rise of specialties like oncology and rare diseases, where development pathways and costs vary dramatically.

**Industry Consolidation:** The Pfizer-Allergan merger ultimately collapsed in April 2016 due to new US Treasury Department regulations targeting tax inversion deals. However, pharmaceutical mergers and acquisitions continued at a steady pace, with companies increasingly relying on acquisitions of smaller biotech firms for pipeline growth. This trend essentially validated Lowe's point that large companies acquiring externally developed assets wasn't "new" but had been ongoing for decades.

**Drug Pricing Controversies:** The Turing and Valeant pricing scandals mentioned in the article intensified, leading to congressional hearings, public outrage, and increased scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices. However, high drug prices remained a defining feature of the US market, with new controversies over treatments like Sovaldi, CAR-T therapies, and gene therapies costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per patient.

**R&D Productivity:** The industry did see a continued increase in FDA drug approvals in subsequent years, with 2018 being a particularly strong year. However, the relationship between R&D spending and output remained complex, with many companies continuing to struggle with research productivity despite various strategic shifts.

**Biotech Evolution:** The outsourcing and external innovation model that the Economist characterized as "new" became even more entrenched, with virtually all major pharmaceutical companies maintaining extensive networks of partnerships with smaller biotech companies and academic institutions. This reinforced Lowe's argument that external innovation wasn't a recent development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The Economist article made several implicit predictions about industry trends:

- **Prediction: Large pharmaceutical companies would increasingly move away from in-house research toward acquiring externally developed drugs**
  - **Reality: Mixed.** Large pharma companies did continue to rely heavily on external innovation through acquisitions and partnerships, but they also maintained substantial internal R&D operations. The trend wasn't as dramatic a departure as portrayed, and internal research remained important for target identification, platform development, and early-stage research.

- **Prediction: Drug development costs would be revealed as significantly lower than industry claims**
  - **Reality: Not supported.** Drug development costs generally remained high, with some analyses actually showing increasing costs due to factors like larger clinical trial requirements, longer development times, and higher failure rates, particularly in complex therapeutic areas.

- **Prediction: Companies would continue focusing on "beauty products" and incremental improvements over breakthrough innovations**
  - **Reality: Oversimplified.** While some companies continued to pursue cosmetic and incremental products, the industry also delivered significant breakthrough innovations in areas like immunotherapy, gene therapy, and precision medicine. The characterization proved too simplistic for the diverse strategies across different companies and therapeutic areas.

- **Prediction: The "new model" would improve drug development efficiency**
  - **Reality: Unclear.** While there were periods of increased FDA approvals, attributing this to any single "model" was difficult, and research productivity remained a persistent challenge across the industry.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6**

This represents a moderately interesting article from the mid-2010s that provides a critical perspective on common media narratives about the pharmaceutical industry. While it offers thought-provoking pushback against simplistic characterizations, its impact was primarily within industry circles, and many of the debates it addresses represent ongoing, unresolved tensions rather than transformative insights.
