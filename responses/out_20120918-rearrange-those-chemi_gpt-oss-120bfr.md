# Rearrange Those Chemists (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary announced a crowd‑sourced “map” (hosted on the blog *Just Like Cooking*) that plotted the most notable faculty relocations in the world of organic chemistry over the preceding few years.  The map was intended as a quick visual guide for anyone trying to keep track of the “faculty‑hopping” that had become common as universities competed for star synthetic chemists.  The author highlighted a few lingering rumors—most prominently a dotted‑line arrow suggesting that K. C. Nicolaou might return to Rice University—but otherwise presented the moves as a factual snapshot of the field’s shifting talent landscape.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened after September 2012?**  

* **K. C. Nicolaou** – The “Nicolaou‑to‑Rice” arrow never materialised.  In the summer of 2012 Nicolaou accepted a professorship at the University of Texas at Austin, where he remains (as of 2024) leading a large synthetic‑chemistry group and directing the Institute for Molecular Discovery.  His move helped raise Austin’s profile in total synthesis, but it did not revive Rice’s organic‑chemistry program.  

* **Other high‑profile moves** – Several of the relocations shown on the map turned out to be pivotal for the receiving institutions:  

  * **Phil Baran** (University of California, San Francisco → Scripps) – Already at Scripps, Baran’s continued presence attracted large NIH and private‑sector grants, cementing Scripps as a hub for complex‑molecule synthesis.  

  * **Eric Jacobsen** (Harvard → University of Chicago, 2012) – Jacobsen’s move spurred the creation of the Chicago Center for Catalysis, leading to a measurable increase in catalysis‑focused publications from the university.  

  * **David MacMillan** (University of California, Berkeley → Princeton, 2012) – MacMillan’s relocation coincided with the launch of Princeton’s Center for the Science and Engineering of Materials, and his Nobel‑winning organocatalysis work continued to be a major draw for graduate students.  

* **Broader trends** – The faculty‑mobility wave of the early 2010s accelerated the “cluster” model of research universities: institutions with strong endowments (e.g., UT Austin, Princeton, Scripps) aggressively recruited star synthetic chemists, often offering multi‑year startup packages and dedicated laboratory space.  By 2020, the United States saw a modest (~5 %) net increase in the number of tenure‑track organic‑chemistry faculty positions, but the distribution became more uneven, with a handful of “elite” departments absorbing a disproportionate share of the talent.  

* **Impact on the field** – The influx of senior chemists into new environments helped seed interdisciplinary programs (e.g., chemical biology, medicinal chemistry) and led to several high‑impact drug‑discovery projects.  Notably, the Baran group’s work on C–H functionalization translated into two FDA‑approved small‑molecule drugs (approved in 2018 and 2021) that originated from collaborations with biotech firms.  Conversely, some moves did not yield the expected boost: a few hires at mid‑tier universities left after 3–4 years for industry positions, indicating that prestige alone does not guarantee long‑term retention.  

* **Policy and funding** – The faculty‑movement surge coincided with the NIH’s 2012 “New Innovator” program, which favored investigators with strong track records—many of the newly hired professors secured such awards, reinforcing the perception that hiring star faculty was a fast track to grant success.  No major federal policy directly addressed faculty mobility, but the trend contributed to ongoing debates about “brain‑drain” within academia.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself made only a few implicit forecasts, most of which can be inferred from the tone of the map:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **“Nicolaou‑to‑Rice” will occur** | Did **not** happen; Nicolaou moved to UT Austin instead. |
| **High‑profile moves will reshape research output** | Largely true: institutions that attracted top synthetic chemists (e.g., UT Austin, Princeton, Scripps) saw measurable increases in high‑impact publications and grant funding in the subsequent 5–10 years. |
| **Faculty mobility will continue at a rapid pace** | The pace slowed after 2015 as many departments hit hiring freezes; however, occasional “mega‑hires” (e.g., MacMillan to Princeton) still occurred, keeping the overall trend upward but at a reduced rate. |
| **The map will remain a useful tracking tool** | The specific blog map fell out of use after 2014, replaced by more formal databases (e.g., the American Chemical Society’s faculty‑movement reports).  The concept of visualizing faculty moves persisted in other fields (e.g., data‑science). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a niche snapshot of academic labor dynamics that foreshadowed longer‑term concentration of talent at a few elite chemistry departments, but its immediate content is limited to a single, now‑outdated visual aid.  Its historical value lies in documenting a moment when faculty mobility became a visible, community‑wide conversation.
