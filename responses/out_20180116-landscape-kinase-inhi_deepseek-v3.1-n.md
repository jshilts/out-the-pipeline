# The Landscape of Kinase Inhibitors (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a comprehensive Science paper by a Munich-led multicenter team that systematically profiled 243 kinase inhibitors that had entered human clinical trials. Using kinobeads and mass spectrometry under standardized conditions, the researchers characterized each compound's binding profile across a wide range of kinase enzymes. The study revealed that while 10-20% of inhibitors showed good selectivity, many clinically used compounds were far less selective than commonly believed.

The authors introduced a new selectivity metric called CATDS (concentration- and target-dependent selectivity) that better captures target engagement and mechanism of action compared to previous measures. Notably, the research found that clinical success didn't correlate well with selectivity - some highly selective inhibitors like rabusertib failed clinically, while "blunderbuss" compounds like midostaurin achieved approval. The study also revealed unexpected off-target binding to non-kinase proteins with ATP-binding sites, including metabolic kinases and other nucleotide binders. The paper highlighted examples like dabrafenib, marketed as a selective BRAF inhibitor but actually a multikinase inhibitor with ~30 submicromolar targets.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2018 study represented a watershed moment in kinase drug discovery, and its impact has been substantial in the years since:

**Data Resource Adoption**: The proteomics dataset became a valuable public resource. ProteomicsDB and related platforms incorporated this kinome profiling data, making it accessible to researchers worldwide. Several pharmaceutical companies have since used similar broad-spectrum kinome profiling early in drug discovery programs.

**Dabrafenib's Continued Success**: Despite being revealed as a multikinase inhibitor, dabrafenib (Tafinlar) has maintained its position as a cornerstone therapy. It gained additional FDA approvals beyond melanoma, including: adjuvant treatment for BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma (2017), non-small cell lung cancer with BRAF V600E mutation (2017), and in combination with trametinib for various solid tumors. Up to 2024, it remains a standard-of-care option, demonstrating that polypharmacology in this case translated to clinical benefit rather than problematic toxicity.

**Midostaurin's Expanded Role**: Midostaurin (Rydapt), highlighted as non-selective, received FDA approval for FLT3-mutated AML in 2017 and has maintained its position. Its polypharmacology profile likely contributed to efficacy across multiple pathways relevant to leukemia.

**Cabozantinib Applications**: The paper's specific suggestion about cabozantinib in FLT3-ITD AML has seen mixed results. While cabozantinib has gained multiple oncology approvals (renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, differentiated thyroid cancer), its role in AML remains investigational with limited Phase II data showing modest activity.

**Clinical Validation of Selectivity Insights**: The fundamental observation that selectivity doesn't guarantee clinical success has been repeatedly validated. Many highly selective inhibitors have failed in late-stage trials, while multi-targeted inhibitors continue to be developed and approved. This has shifted industry thinking toward "selective polypharmacology" - compounds that hit specific disease-relevant combinations of targets while sparing others that cause toxicity.

**Kinase Drug Approvals (2018-2024)**: The field has continued expansion with numerous new kinase inhibitor approvals, including entrectinib, pexidartinib, avapritinib, selpercatinib, pralsetinib, infigratinib, tivozanib, and others. Most show some degree of multi-kinase activity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The article's explicit and implicit predictions:**

• **"The paper suggests a number of older candidates for re-evaluation on more recently appreciated kinase targets"** - **LARGELY REALIZED**: Drug repurposing has become a major focus in oncology. However, the specific cabozantinib-for-FLT3-AML suggestion hasn't translated to routine clinical use, though it remains under investigation. More broadly, kinase inhibitor repurposing has shown successes - axitinib in thyroid cancer, various TKIs in rare tumors with specific gene fusions.

• **"Selectivity really doesn't, in the end, correlate with clinical usefulness as much as we'd like to imagine it does"** - **STRONGLY VALIDATED**: The post-2018 approvals of multi-kinase inhibitors like entrectinib, larotrectinib, and avapritinib underscore this. Even "selective" newer drugs like selpercatinib still hit multiple targets. Clinical success is now understood to depend on hitting the right combination of targets for a given tumor type, not maximum selectivity.

• **"Your chances for [clinical efficacy and safety] are probably improved if your kinase inhibitor is not a blunderbuss"** - **PARTIALLY VALIDATED**: The toxicity-inevitability tradeoff has proven nuanced. While highly promiscuous compounds often show dose-limiting toxicity, careful design of multi-kinase profiles can achieve good therapeutic windows. The key is avoiding specific toxicity-causing kinases while maintaining efficacy.

• **Implicit: That detailed kinome profiling would become standard practice** - **EXTENT REALIZED**: Major pharmaceutical companies now routinely perform extensive kinome profiling early in kinase inhibitor programs. However, economic and technical constraints limit this for smaller companies and academic labs. Target engagement and pathway coverage analysis has become more sophisticated.

• **Implicit: That the field would become more sophisticated about off-target effects** - **REALIZED**: The kinase inhibitor field now openly discusses and even exploits polypharmacology. Recent approvals often highlight multi-target mechanisms rather than apologizing for them, representing a significant mindset shift from the 2010s emphasis on "selective" drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article identified and articulated fundamental truths about kinase inhibitor drug discovery that have only become more relevant with time. The insight that selectivity doesn't correlate with clinical success has fundamentally influenced how the field approaches kinase inhibitor development, shifting focus from maximal selectivity to strategic target selection.
