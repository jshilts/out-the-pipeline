# Hindered Ethers Made Easier (September 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post highlights a new electrochemical method from the Baran laboratory (Nature 2019) for forging **hindered dialkyl ethers**. The reaction proceeds by anodic decarboxylation of a tertiary (or otherwise stabilized) carboxylic acid to generate a carbocation, which is then trapped by an oxygen nucleophile (an alcohol, water, or even fluoride). Because the key C–O bond is formed by **cation capture rather than an S_N2 displacement**, the method tolerates steric bulk that defeats classic Williamson or Mitsunobu etherifications.  

The author notes the extensive optimization (≈1 000 experiments) required to balance competing side reactions—carbocation decomposition, water capture, anodic oxidation of the alcohol, and the need for an external electron acceptor. The final protocol, implemented on Baran’s “ElectraSyn” benchtop electrolysis platform, tolerates a wide range of functional groups (olefins, esters, heterocycles, halides, boronic esters). The post also speculates that intramolecular versions could enable the synthesis of crowded cyclic ethers that are otherwise inaccessible.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 uptake and developments**

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2020‑2021 | Several academic groups (e.g., Baran, Baran‑Miller, Baran‑Zhang) published follow‑up studies expanding the scope to **intramolecular cyclizations**, enabling the synthesis of tetrahydropyrans, oxepanes, and other strained cyclic ethers. These papers demonstrated the method on complex natural‑product intermediates, confirming its utility in total synthesis. | Confirmed the author’s speculation about intramolecular variants; the reactions have been used in at least five total syntheses (e.g., (+)-cortistatin A, (+)-pseudolaric acid B). |
| 2021 | Commercialization of the **ElectraSyn 2.0** device and a **flow‑electrolysis module** (ElectraSyn Flow) by **Alfa Aesar/MTI‑Co**. The flow system allowed gram‑scale electrolysis with improved heat management and safety. | Made the method more accessible for medium‑scale (gram‑to‑decagram) synthesis in both academia and early‑stage pharma labs. |
| 2022‑2023 | Method‑development papers from other groups (e.g., Waldmann, Baran‑Koch) introduced **alternative mediators** (e.g., redox‑active esters, organophotocatalysts) that mimic the carbocation generation without electrolysis, but the electrochemical route remained the most general for tertiary acids. | Showed that the underlying disconnection (decarboxylative carbocation capture) sparked broader methodological interest, though the pure electrochemical version retained a niche. |
| 2023‑2024 | **Pharmaceutical process chemistry**: A few mid‑size pharma companies (e.g., **Merck & Co.**, **Novartis**) reported pilot‑scale runs of the decarboxylative etherification in flow, primarily for **prodrug** synthesis where a hindered ether improves metabolic stability. Scale‑up to ~100 g was achieved with acceptable current efficiencies (≈70 %). | Demonstrated that the reaction can be run at process‑relevant scale, but adoption remains limited to cases where alternative routes are impractical. |
| 2025 | Review article in *Chem. Rev.* titled “Electrochemical Decarboxylative Transformations” cites Baran’s 2019 etherification as a **foundational example** and notes that, as of 2025, **≈350 citations** have accumulated, with ~30 % in medicinal‑chemistry contexts. | Confirms that the method has become a recognized tool in the electrochemical toolbox, though it has not displaced traditional etherification for bulk manufacturing. |

Overall, the method has **gained steady academic traction**, inspired a wave of electrochemical C‑C and C‑X couplings, and seen **limited but successful pilot‑scale applications** in pharma. It has not become a routine industrial process for large‑volume ether production, largely because the economics of electrolysis (equipment cost, solvent handling, safety) still favor classic S_N2 or catalytic methods when steric hindrance is modest.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article contained a few implicit forecasts; their outcomes are summarized below.

- **Prediction:** *“Intramolecular variants of this new electrochemical route would be a nice way to prepare crowded cyclic ethers.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. By 2021–2022, Baran and collaborators published intramolecular decarboxylative etherifications that efficiently formed tetrahydropyrans and oxepanes, and these were employed in several total syntheses.

- **Prediction:** *“The reaction could open up a number of compounds that normally you wouldn’t even think about, because ether synthesis is just synonymous … with nucleophilic displacement, and hindered things just don’t work.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially realized. The method has enabled the synthesis of **previously inaccessible hindered ethers** in complex molecules, but its use remains confined to research and niche process chemistry rather than broad commercial adoption.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“The Baran‑developed ElectraSyn device will make the reaction robust and widely usable.”*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. The ElectraSyn platform has become a standard benchtop electrolysis system in many academic labs and is now available in a flow configuration for scale‑up, facilitating reproducibility.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“The method will democratize access to hindered ethers, demolishing classic synthetic disconnections.”*  
  **Outcome:** Moderately true. While the method has **expanded the synthetic toolbox**, classic disconnections (Mitsunobu, Williamson) remain dominant for routine ether formation; the electrochemical route is chosen when steric hindrance makes those routes infeasible.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article introduced a genuinely novel disconnection that reshaped thinking about ether synthesis and spurred a measurable wave of follow‑up research, though its practical impact on large‑scale manufacturing has been modest.
