# So What Did Lipitor Do for Pfizer? Or Its Shareholders? (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques Pfizer's acquisition strategy surrounding Lipitor through the lens of shareholder value. Written in November 2011, just as Lipitor was losing patent protection, the piece references a Harvard Business Review analysis questioning whether the drug was "worth it" for Pfizer. The author notes that despite Lipitor becoming the best-selling drug in pharmaceutical history, Pfizer's stock performance had declined roughly 60% from the time of the Warner-Lambert merger in June 2000 through late 2011, underperforming the S&P 500. The broader context is that most major pharmaceutical companies showed similarly poor stock performance during this period, with companies like Eli Lilly performing even worse. The article suggests that mega-acquisitions like Pfizer's approach didn't deliver superior returns compared to simply holding the broader market, raising doubts about whether the Lipitor-focused strategy created meaningful value for shareholders beyond what alternative approaches might have achieved.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Pfizer's trajectory with Lipitor and broader corporate strategy continued to evolve in several significant ways:

**Lipitor's Post-Patent Performance (2011-ongoing):** After losing patent exclusivity in November 2011, Lipitor faced immediate generic competition from atorvastatin. Despite efforts to maintain market share through authorized generics and patient assistance programs, the drug's revenue plummeted from over $10 billion annually to a fraction of that amount. Generic versions quickly captured the majority of the market.

**Pfizer's Stock Performance:** From November 2011 through mid-2020s, Pfizer stock continued to underperform the broader market. The company faced the "patent cliff" challenge affecting much of the pharmaceutical industry, where blockbuster drugs lost protection without sufficient pipeline replacements. Pfizer's stock saw periods of decline and recovery but generally lagged the S&P 500 over the subsequent decade.

**Continued Acquisition Strategy:** Rather than abandoning the acquisition approach, Pfizer doubled down with major deals including the attempted $160 billion acquisition of AstraZeneca in 2014 (which failed), the $15 billion acquisition of Hospira in 2015, the $14 billion purchase of Medivation in 2016, and the $11.4 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma in 2019. Most significantly, Pfizer acquired Wyeth in 2009 for $68 billion, which had already occurred before this article but reinforced their strategy.

**Pipeline Challenges:** Pfizer continued to struggle with research and development productivity. While the company had successes like Ibrance (palbociclib) for breast cancer and Eliquis (apixaban) for stroke prevention (through Bristol-Myers Squibb partnership), many experimental drugs failed in late-stage trials, continuing the pattern of insufficient replacement for lost revenue from patent expirations.

**COVID-19 Vaccine Impact:** The development of the COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) with BioNTech became Pfizer's most significant success in decades, generating approximately $37 billion in 2021 revenue. However, questions remained about whether this represented strategic excellence or fortuitous timing, and whether the windfall would translate into sustainable long-term growth.

**Dividend Policy:** Pfizer maintained its dividend, though the yield fluctuated with stock price movements. The company's status as a "dividend aristocrat" (raising dividends for 25+ consecutive years) ended in 2009 when dividends were cut, though they were later restored and increased.

**Broader Industry Context:** The pharmaceutical industry trends identified in the 2011 article generally persisted. Most major pharmaceutical companies continued to face patent cliff challenges, struggled with R&D productivity, and frequently turned to mergers and acquisitions as a primary growth strategy. Stock performance across the sector remained mixed, with some companies performing better than others but few consistently outperforming the broader market over extended periods.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains several implicit predictions and evaluative statements:

• **Big Pharma won't learn from Pfizer's experience** - The author stated "I doubt that anyone will" learn from the Lipitor example. *Outcome*: This prediction proved accurate. Major pharmaceutical companies continued pursuing large acquisitions throughout the 2010s, including Pfizer's own continued acquisition strategy, AbbVie's acquisition of Pharmacyclics and Allergan, Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition of Celgene, and numerous other mega-deals, suggesting the industry did not fundamentally change its approach despite questionable shareholder returns.

• **Pfizer's strategy hasn't allowed it to stand out from peers** - The article noted Pfizer's stock performance was "in the same nasty shape as its brethren." *Outcome*: This continued to be largely true through the 2010s. While some pharmaceutical companies performed better than others during specific periods, Pfizer generally remained in the middle of the pack rather than distinguishing itself through superior performance, until the COVID-19 vaccine provided a temporary boost.

• **Nothing would have gotten worse if they'd never pursued the Lipitor strategy, and things might have been better** - This speculative assessment suggested alternative strategies might have yielded better results. *Outcome*: This is impossible to definitively evaluate as counterfactual, though the continued underperformance of major pharmaceutical companies suggests structural industry challenges beyond any single company's strategy were at play.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7**

This article provides enduring insight into the structural challenges facing pharmaceutical companies, specifically how even blockbuster drugs and mega-mergers may not create sustainable shareholder value. The analysis remains relevant as the industry continues grappling with similar issues today.
