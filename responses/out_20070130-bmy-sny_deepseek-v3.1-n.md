## January 2007

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses rumors that Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Sanofi-Aventis might be considering a merger. The author notes this possibility was plausible because both companies were looking to maximize revenues from their blockbuster drug Plavix, and both felt their pipelines needed strengthening. Cost savings through layoffs and site closures were also seen as motivators. 

However, the author expresses skepticism about whether such a merger would be beneficial, drawing a parallel to Pfizer's growth into what the author calls a "leviathan." The core argument is that research productivity doesn't scale well in mega-mergers—in fact, it often gets worse as organizations become too large and bureaucratic. Instead of solving pipeline problems through mergers and acquisitions, companies should focus on improving their own internal research capabilities.

## 2. HISTORY

The actual merger did not happen as speculated in this article. However, the two companies did enter into a lengthy period of complex partnership arrangements, particularly around Plavix (clopidogrel), which was co-marketed by both companies.

What actually unfolded was quite different from a full merger:

**Plavix Journey**: Plavix remained a blockbuster drug for several years after this article, but eventually faced patent expiration around 2012, leading to generic competition and dramatically reduced revenues for both companies.

**Research Productivity Concerns Validated**: The author's concerns about large pharma mergers and research productivity proved prescient. In the years following 2007, major pharmaceutical mergers (not BMY-Sanofi specifically) often resulted in significant R&D site closures, pipeline pruning, and struggles to maintain innovation output. The "too big to innovate" problem became more widely recognized in the industry.

**Alternative Strategies**: Instead of merging, both companies pursued other strategies. Sanofi engaged in several major acquisitions (notably Genzyme in 2011 for $20.1 billion) while Bristol-Myers Squibb made significant acquisitions including Medarex in 2009 (gaining access to Yervoy/ipilimumab) and later the major acquisition of Celgene in 2019 for $74 billion.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Merger would happen to maximize Plavix revenue before patent expiry**
  - **Outcome**: No merger occurred. The companies maintained their partnership arrangement for Plavix until generic competition emerged.

• **Prediction: Large mergers hurt research productivity and don't solve pipeline problems**
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated by broader industry trends, though not specifically tested by these two companies since they didn't merge. Industry data from the 2007-2020 period showed that large pharma mergers often led to reduced R&D productivity per dollar spent and pipeline consolidation rather than expansion.

• **Prediction: Mergers create leviathans with diminishing returns on innovation**
  - **Outcome**: Demonstrated more broadly across the pharmaceutical industry. Very large merged entities often struggled with integrating R&D cultures and maintaining consistent innovation output, leading many to pivot more heavily toward acquiring smaller innovative companies rather than organic growth.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an interesting moment in pharmaceutical industry speculation and demonstrates reasonable analytical thinking about merger dynamics, even though the specific prediction didn't materialize. The broader insights about research productivity and merger challenges remain relevant to ongoing industry consolidation trends.
