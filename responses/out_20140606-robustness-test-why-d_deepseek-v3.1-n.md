# The Robustness Test: Why Don't We Just Require It? (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a follow-up paper in *Nature Protocols* that provides detailed methodology for systematically testing the robustness of new synthetic chemical reactions, specifically using a rhodium-catalyzed indole formation as a test case. The authors propose a standardized matrix of additives and reaction conditions analyzed by GC to profile what each reaction can tolerate. The blogger suggests implementing a standardized "additives grid" for all new reactions, color-coded red/yellow/green to immediately show robustness. The article advocates that major synthetic chemistry journals should require this standardization as part of publication, arguing it would provide clearer comparison between methods and expose reactions with hidden limitations.

## 2. HISTORY

The call for greater experimental reproducibility and robustness testing in synthetic chemistry significantly gained momentum after 2014. Several developments occurred:

**Journal Policy Changes**: Major journals increasingly adopted stricter requirements for experimental reproducibility. *Nature* introduced more stringent reporting standards, requiring detailed experimental procedures, characterization data, and often encouraging or requiring deposition of datasets. The American Chemical Society implemented similar enhanced reporting standards.

**Community Initiatives**: Organizations like the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable developed standardized reagent sets and reaction screening protocols. Commercial suppliers (including Aldrich/Sigma-Aldrich, now MilliporeSigma) did develop pre-made screening kits for reaction robustness testing, making implementation more accessible.

**Impact on Drug Discovery**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted standardized robustness testing protocols internally, as failed reproducibility in medicinal chemistry routes represented significant cost and timeline risks. This shift influenced hiring practices and graduate training, with greater emphasis on practical synthetic skills rather than just developing novel reactions.

**Publication Landscape**: High-profile journals increasingly expected detailed scope and limitation discussions in synthetic methodology papers. However, the specific "standard additives grid" approach with color coding did not become universally mandated across the field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1**: "If the major synthetic chemistry journals starting asking for it, that would be that" - The major journals did gradually implement stricter reproducibility requirements and more detailed reporting standards, but did not specifically mandate the proposed "standard additives grid" format universally.

**Prediction 2**: "Aldrich and others could sell the pre-assembled kit" - Companies including Aldrich/Sigma-Aldrich did develop various reaction screening kits and standardized reagent sets for robustness testing, though adoption varied by institution and application area.

**Prediction 3**: "Titles that don't ask for extra few days... would be hard-pressed to make a case they weren't venues for hackwork" - The gap between top-tier and lower-tier synthetic chemistry journals did widen regarding reproducibility standards, with leading journals implementing more rigorous review processes for experimental reproducibility, while some specialized or regional journals maintained more relaxed standards.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article addresses an important ongoing issue in chemical research methodology, but is not groundbreaking. While reproducibility and robustness testing remained significant in chemistry, the broader research community was already moving in similar directions, and the specific approach advocated did not revolutionize the field as suggested.
