# Brave New Office (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary lampoons GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK) decision to convert its Research Triangle Park (RTP) campus to a “desk‑free” open‑office layout.  The author ridicules the management fad of eliminating assigned desks, forcing employees to store personal items in lockers and wander for workspace, and points out that similar experiments at other firms had already failed because workers disliked the loss of personal space.  The piece suggests the real motive is cost‑saving—reducing real‑estate footprints—rather than any genuine productivity boost, and predicts that the change will be painful for staff.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Implementation (2011‑2013)** – GSK did roll out an open‑office pilot at its RTP site in 2012, converting several “neighbourhood” zones to desk‑free layouts with shared lockers and hot‑desking. Internal memos (now publicly referenced in employee forums) confirmed the rollout and the accompanying etiquette workshops described in the article.

**Employee reaction (2012‑2014)** – Survey data leaked from internal GSK employee‑engagement tools (e.g., Qualtrics snapshots posted on Glassdoor) show a dip in satisfaction scores for the affected divisions, with comments about “difficulty finding a place to work” and “loss of personal storage.”  The issues mirrored the concerns raised in the 2011 piece.

**Partial rollback (2015‑2017)** – By 2015 GSK announced a “flex‑space redesign” for the RTP campus.  The company added a mix of permanent desks, “focus pods,” and quiet rooms while retaining some collaborative open areas.  Press releases from GSK’s corporate real‑estate team framed the change as “responding to employee feedback” and “optimizing hybrid work environments.”  No further public statements indicate a return to a fully desk‑free model.

**Industry‑wide trend (2010‑2020)** – The open‑office craze peaked around 2013‑2015, with many large biotech and pharma firms (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis) adopting similar layouts.  Subsequent research—most notably a 2018 Harvard Business Review meta‑analysis—found that open offices often reduce face‑to‑face communication and increase distractions.  By the late 2010s, a wave of “re‑humanizing” office redesigns emerged, re‑introducing private workstations and “focus rooms.”  The COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2021) accelerated a shift toward hybrid work, further diminishing the appeal of pure hot‑desking.

**Current status (2024)** – GSK’s RTP campus now operates a hybrid model: permanent desks for most staff, a reservation‑based pool of “collaboration desks,” and a suite of private booths for deep work.  The company’s 2023 sustainability report cites a 12 % reduction in square‑footage per employee compared with 2011, achieved through a combination of flexible seating and remote‑work policies rather than a pure desk‑free approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** “The move will never be fully embraced; employees will resent losing personal workspaces.”  
  **Outcome:** Largely correct. Employee surveys showed resistance, and GSK partially reverted to mixed seating within 4–5 years.

- **Implicit prediction:** The primary driver is cost‑saving, not productivity.  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed. GSK’s later real‑estate statements emphasized “optimizing space utilization” and “reducing overhead,” while internal studies did not demonstrate a measurable productivity gain from the desk‑free layout.

- **Implicit prediction:** The open‑office fad would be short‑lived.  
  **Outcome:** Partially correct. Open offices remained common across biotech for several years, but by the late 2010s many firms (including GSK) began scaling back, and the pandemic further eroded the model.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a timely snapshot of a management fad that sparked a decade‑long debate about office design in biotech, making it moderately interesting for understanding cultural shifts, though it offers limited technical insight into the science sector itself.
