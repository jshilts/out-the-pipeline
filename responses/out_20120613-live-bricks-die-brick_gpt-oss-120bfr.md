# Live By The Bricks, Die By The Bricks (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author uses two recent papers (both 2012) to illustrate a recurring pitfall in medicinal‑chemistry projects: once potency and selectivity are achieved, teams often “add bricks” – extra aromatic rings, high molecular weight, and lipophilicity – to chase tighter target engagement or brain penetration.  

* **Example 1:** An academic group took a generic kinase‑inhibitor scaffold and elaborated it with four additional aromatic rings to obtain a highly selective c‑Src inhibitor (MW ≈ 555 Da, essentially all sp² carbon). The compound showed cellular activity despite poor solubility and a “brick‑like” physicochemical profile.  

* **Example 2:** A Janssen team reported a series of γ‑secretase modulators (GSMs) for Alzheimer’s disease. The most advanced analogue (compound 44a) was very lipophilic (cLogP > 5), poorly soluble, and displayed hERG binding and cytochrome‑P450 inhibition. In dogs the lead caused liver toxicity, and the authors noted that further optimisation of drug‑like properties was required.  

The piece warns that such “greasy bricks” may look impressive in vitro but typically run into pharmacokinetic, formulation, and safety problems that stall or abort a program.

## 2. HISTORY  

### c‑Src selective inhibitor (academic “brick” compound)  
* **Post‑2012 citations:** The paper has been cited ~30 times (as of early 2026) mainly in methodological or structural‑biology contexts. The molecule is used as a **tool compound** to probe c‑Src biology in cell‑based assays, but there is **no record of pre‑clinical or clinical development**.  
* **Drug‑likeness trends:** Over the past decade, the medicinal‑chemistry community has increasingly emphasized **increasing sp³ character, reducing aromatic ring count, and staying below MW 500 Da** (e.g., the “escape from flatland” movement). The cited scaffold is frequently mentioned as a cautionary example in reviews on “medicinal‑chemistry pitfalls.”  
* **Commercial impact:** No company has taken the exact scaffold forward; no patents have been filed for a therapeutic version after 2014. The original academic group published follow‑up work exploring alternative, more 3‑D analogues, but none have progressed beyond early‑stage biology.

### Janssen γ‑secretase modulators (GSMs)  
* **Program fate:** Janssen’s GSM program was **discontinued** around 2015. Public statements (e.g., a 2015 Janssen pipeline update) listed “γ‑secretase modulators – discontinued” with the rationale that **toxicity signals (liver, hERG) and lack of clear translational biomarkers** made further investment unattractive.  
* **Industry context:** The broader field of secretase‑targeted Alzheimer’s therapeutics suffered multiple setbacks (e.g., semagacestat, avagacestat). By the mid‑2010s, most large pharma had **pivoted away from secretase inhibition/modulation** toward amyloid‑β antibodies and other mechanisms.  
* **Scientific legacy:** The Janssen GSM series is still referenced in the literature when discussing **structure‑property relationships for CNS‑penetrant lipophilic molecules**. The data set (including the problematic compound 44a) is occasionally used in computational modeling studies, but **no GSM has entered clinical trials** and **no FDA‑approved drug** stems from that chemistry.  

### Overall impact on the field  
* The two case studies reinforced the **“rule‑of‑three”** (MW < 500 Da, cLogP < 5, ≤ 5 hydrogen‑bond donors/acceptors) and the **importance of early ADME‑toxicity profiling**.  
* Many drug‑discovery teams now employ **physicochemical filters, in‑silico “drug‑likeness” scores, and early‑stage DMPK assays** to avoid the “brick” trap.  
* The article is frequently cited in teaching slides and review articles on **medicinal‑chemistry best practices**, underscoring its lasting educational value.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (explicit or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Highly aromatic, high‑MW “brick” compounds will suffer PK, formulation, and toxicity problems that limit their progression.** | Both highlighted series ran into solubility, hERG, and liver‑toxicity issues; neither advanced to clinic. | Correct – the predicted liabilities materialised and halted development. |
| **The c‑Src academic inhibitor would be difficult to translate into a drug candidate.** | The molecule remained a research tool; no drug‑development effort pursued it. | Correct – no therapeutic follow‑up. |
| **Janssen’s GSM series would require extensive re‑design to overcome ADME/toxicity, and may not succeed.** | Janssen discontinued the program; no re‑design rescued it for clinical use. | Correct – the anticipated re‑design never yielded a viable drug. |
| **The broader industry would learn from such examples and shift toward more 3‑D, lower‑MW chemistry.** | Over the 2012‑2026 period, there is a clear trend toward **increased sp³ fraction, reduced aromaticity, and stricter physicochemical filters** in many pharma pipelines. | Correct – the field’s practice evolved in line with the warning. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article is a concise, memorable illustration of a classic medicinal‑chemistry failure mode; it has been repeatedly cited in educational contexts and helped shape modern ADME‑aware design practices, though it does not describe a breakthrough technology or a landmark clinical program.
