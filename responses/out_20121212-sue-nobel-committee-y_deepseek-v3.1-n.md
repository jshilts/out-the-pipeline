# Sue the Nobel Committee. Yeah, That'll Work. (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post by Derek Lowe describes a novel reaction to the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was awarded to John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for their discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells. Rongxiang Xu, founder of MEBO International Group, claimed the Nobel Committee had defamed his reputation by omitting him from the prize. Xu alleged that his team had achieved the awakening of mature somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells without genetic engineering as early as 2000. The post frames Xu's lawsuit as a publicity-seeking maneuver unlikely to succeed, comparing it to the 2003 controversy over Raymond Damadian's exclusion from the NMR imaging Nobel Prize, where the Nobel Committee did not reverse its decision.

## 2. HISTORY
The lawsuit by Rongxiang Xu against the Nobel Committee did not succeed. Courts have consistently held that the Nobel Committee's decisions are not subject to legal challenge, and there is no record of any such defamation claim prevailing. The core scientific recognition remained firmly with Gurdon and Yamanaka for their work on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Their 2012 Nobel Prize was based on established, reproducible methods (nuclear transfer in Gurdon’s case; the Yamanaka factors in Shinya Yamanaka’s case) that have become foundational to regenerative medicine research and have since been cited extensively in developing therapeutic strategies. By contrast, Xu’s specific claims—often linked to his company MEBO’s “moist-exposed burn ointment” (MEBO) and a putative mechanism involving the induction of pluripotent stem cells in wound repair—did not gain broad acceptance within the mainstream scientific community. Systematic reviews and regulatory assessments have found insufficient evidence to support MEBO’s efficacy, often describing it as unproven. Clinical uptake of MEBO has remained limited, with no significant endorsement by major Western clinical guidelines for burns. No drug approvals in the U.S. or EU have cited the 2000 “reprogramming without engineering” concept attributed to Xu. Subsequently, the iPSC field advanced primarily along the lines of defined genetic and chemical reprogramming, leading to clinical trials (e.g., for macular degeneration) and cellular therapies, alongside tools for disease modeling and drug screening. MEBO International Group did not emerge as a major player in these research and clinical pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- The author predicted that Xu’s lawsuit would fail and amount to a publicity effort, noting the Nobel Committee “never backed down in such a case.” **Outcome:** The Committee did not reverse its decision. The legal action did not change the outcome of the award.
- Lowe forecast that Xu’s legal team would only stay engaged as long as payments continued, implying the case lacked merit. **Outcome:** The public record shows no successful legal claim against the Nobel Committee, consistent with the expectation that such challenges would not succeed.

## 4. INTEREST
**Decile score: 3**

The article is a brief, reactive blog post documenting a fringe legal response to a Nobel Prize. It highlights perennial tensions around credit in science but does not touch on the substantive science, treatments, or major commercial outcomes related to the iPSC field.
