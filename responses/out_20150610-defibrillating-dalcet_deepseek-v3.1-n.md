# Defibrillating Dalcetrapib (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes how Roche halted development of dalcetrapib in 2012 due to lack of efficacy in cardiovascular outcomes. Dalcetrapib was a CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) inhibitor, part of a drug class with a troubled history including Pfizer's torcetrapib which showed adverse effects.

However, in 2015, DalCor Pharmaceuticals licensed the compound with a new strategy: instead of testing the drug broadly, they would restrict clinical trials to patients with specific genetic polymorphisms in the ADCY9 gene (adenylate cyclase 9). Analysis of previous trial data suggested these genetic variations could account for large differences in drug response. DalCor planned to screen approximately 30,000 potential patients to identify those with the favorable genetic profile.

The key strategic shift was moving from a one-size-fits-all cardiovascular drug to a precision medicine approach targeting a genetically-defined subgroup, acknowledging that dalcetrapib would never be the blockbuster Roche originally envisioned.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2015 article, DalCor proceeded with the precision medicine approach:

**Clinical Trial Progression:**
DalCor initiated a Phase 3 trial called dal-GenE (dalcetrapib genomics evidence), a large cardiovascular outcomes study specifically enrolling patients with the AA genotype at the ADCY9 gene variant rs1967309. The trial enrolled over 6,000 patients.

**Trial Failure and Termination:**
In January 2018, DalCor announced that the dal-GenE trial **failed to meet its primary endpoint**. Despite the genetic selection strategy, the trial showed no significant cardiovascular benefit in the genetically-selected population. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended early termination of the trial.

**Business Impact:**
Following the trial failure, DalCor effectively ceased operations. The company had raised substantial funding and collaborated with the Montreal Heart Institute on this precision medicine approach. The failure marked another setback for the CETP inhibitor class and for pharmacogenomics in cardiovascular disease.

**CETP Inhibitor Landscape:**
The dalcetrapib failure added to the troubled history of CETP inhibitors:
- Torcetrapib (Pfizer): Failed due to off-target toxicity
- Dalcetrapib (Roche/DalCor): Failed despite genetic selection
- Evacetrapib (Eli Lilly): Failed in 2015
- Anacetrapib (Merck): Showed modest LDL reduction but significant HDL increase with some cardiovascular benefit, but never achieved widespread clinical use

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: DalCor's genetic selection strategy might succeed where Roche's broader approach failed**
- **Outcome**: FAILED. The dal-GenE trial with ADCY9 genotyping (AA genotype selection) showed no significant benefit and was terminated early.
- **Impact**: Despite the scientific rationale and retrospective genetic analysis, the precision medicine approach did not rescue dalcetrapib.

**Prediction: Dalcetrapib would not be the blockbuster Roche hoped for, but approval would make "quite a story"**
- **Outcome**: ACCURATE on both counts. The drug indeed never became a blockbuster (nor even an approved drug), but the precision medicine rescue attempt did create a notable story in drug development history.
- **Impact**: The attempt represented one of the first major tests of retrospective pharmacogenomic analysis to revive a failed drug.

**Prediction: The approach depends on the retrospective genetic analysis being solid**
- **Outcome**: VALIDATED concern. The genetic-stratified approach failed, suggesting either: (1) the retrospective signal was spurious, (2) the effect size was too small, or (3) other factors outweighed the genetic effect.

**Prediction: Question about market size if the polymorphism-restricted approach worked**
- **Outcome**: The concern about patient population size became moot as the drug failed regardless.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article highlights an early example of using pharmacogenomics to rescue a failed drug—an approach that remains scientifically interesting and represents learning from failure. However, the strategy ultimately failed, and the CETP inhibitor mechanism has largely been abandoned, limiting broader impact.
