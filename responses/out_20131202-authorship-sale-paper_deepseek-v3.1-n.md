# Authorship For Sale. Papers For Sale. Everything For Sale (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary highlights a *Science* magazine investigation into widespread academic publishing fraud in China. The article describes a black market for scientific publications where brokers facilitated fraudulent practices including: selling authorship positions on papers for thousands of dollars (e.g., Wanfang Huizhi charged $14,800-$26,300), hiring ghostwriters to fabricate data and papers from scratch, translating Chinese papers to English for self-plagiarism, and purchasing manuscripts from online catalogs with guarantees of publication.

According to the *Science* investigation, 22 of 27 Chinese agencies contacted offered these fraudulent services. The demand was driven by institutional requirements for high-impact-factor publications, with some institutions offering bonuses for such publications. The article notes that some agencies claimed to source real data from national laboratories for fabricated papers.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 revelations were part of ongoing, escalating concerns about research integrity in China that continue through the present. In the years following this article, several developments occurred:

**Institutional responses**: Chinese authorities implemented stricter policies, including retraction databases and research integrity initiatives at major universities. However, fraudulent practices persisted and evolved.

**Retraction patterns**: Academic journals, particularly *Tumor Biology* (Springer) experienced massive retractions in 2017, with 107 papers retracted for faked peer reviews stemming from China. This led to increased scrutiny from international publishers.

**Policy changes**: Some Chinese institutions reduced exclusive reliance on impact factors for evaluation, but the fundamental incentive structure remained largely unchanged. Research misconduct investigations increased but remained fragmented.

**Continued problems**: Similar schemes evolved to include paper mills operating internationally. Studies have shown that retractions originating from China remained elevated through the 2020s compared to other countries.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made implicit predictions:

- **Risk to Chinese scientific literature credibility**: Predicted Chinese publications would face skepticism → **Accurate**: International journals increased scrutiny; retraction rates remained concerning
- **Need for incentive realignment to solve problem**: Predicted real solutions required changing incentive structures → **Mostly accurate**: Limited reform occurred; problems persisted
- **Extra scrutiny for Chinese submissions**: Predicted foreign journals would treat Chinese submissions with suspicion → **Accurate**: Many publishers implemented stricter verification

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article addresses a persistent structural problem in Chinese academic publishing, but the specific instances and agencies mentioned were already being exposed contemporaneously. The broader pattern of research misconduct in China was previously reported.
