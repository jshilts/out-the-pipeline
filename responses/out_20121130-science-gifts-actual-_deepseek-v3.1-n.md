# Science Gifts: Actual Med-Chem Books (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The author compiled a list of recommended books for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery, soliciting reader suggestions for additional titles. The list covered general medicinal chemistry texts (Rydzewski, Wermuth, Patrick, Silverman), process chemistry references (Anderson, Lee & Robinson), drug development case histories (Ng, Sneader), specialized topics like enzyme inhibitors (Copeland), pharmacology primers for chemists (Kenakin, Nogrady & Weaver), and ADME/toxicity references (Kerns & Di, Birkett, Casarett & Doull).

## 2. HISTORY
The book recommendations from 2012 have shown mixed longevity over the subsequent decade. Several texts remained in print with updated editions: Wermuth's "The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry" (4th edition published), Patrick's "Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry" (7th edition released, still widely adopted in university courses), and Casarett & Doull's "Toxicology" (continues as a standard reference, with multiple new editions). The field has evolved substantially since 2012 with major developments in areas like CRISPR, immunotherapy, and mRNA therapeutics, creating demand for newer resources addressing contemporary techniques. Process chemistry texts have maintained relevance given ongoing need for manufacturing optimization. The books focusing on foundational concepts (ADME, basic toxicology, enzyme kinetics) retained value as training materials, while case history books became somewhat dated as newer drug approvals accumulated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions about future outcomes appeared in this article—it was a curated list rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST
**1/9**

The article was a practical but time-limited resource list for practitioners, not a forward-looking analysis of technology or industry trends.
