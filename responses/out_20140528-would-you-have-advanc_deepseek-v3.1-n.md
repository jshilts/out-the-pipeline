# Article Title (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary analyzes BBI608, a cancer stem cell inhibitor compound being developed by Dainippon Sumitomo's subsidiary Boston Biomedical. The author reacts to news that the compound failed its Phase III colorectal cancer trial so badly that enrollment was halted after an interim analysis. BBI608 targets cancer stem cells, a controversial field where the underlying biology remains poorly understood. The author expresses strong skepticism about BBI608's chemical structure - a quinone - citing personal bias against such "screaming, reactive redox compound[s]" that can cause multiple problems in biological systems due to their promiscuous activity. While acknowledging that quinones can show compelling activity in cellular assays, the author questions their selectivitiy and reliability as drug candidates. Dainippon Sumitomo had acquired Boston Biomedical for $200 million upfront (with milestones potentially worth $2.6 billion), suggesting impressive early-stage data, but the Phase III failure vindicated the author's structural concerns.

## 2. HISTORY
The development of BBI608 (also called napabucasin) continued for several more years despite this 2014 setback. The compound moved forward into multiple Phase III trials across different cancer types. Most notably, it was studied in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy for pretreated advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer1. Another key trial focused on advanced pancreatic cancer as maintenance therapy. In March 2019, however, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma announced that the gastric cancer trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival2. Shares dropped significantly on this news. A couple months later, the company reported another Phase III failure in colorectal cancer1. The company ultimately discontinued BBI608's development. The multiple Phase III failures across different indications made it clear that the compound would not receive FDA approval or reach patients. The larger concept of cancer stem cells remained scientifically active, but BBI608's demise suggested that quinone-based cancer stem cell targeting may not be feasible. The Boston Biomedical acquisition ultimately did not deliver the promised value, as BBI608 never achieved blockbuster status or FDA approval1,2.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Author's prediction (implicit):** The quinone structure of BBI608 made it likely to fail due to reactivity, promiscuity, and lack of selectivity
  - **Evaluation:** CORRECT. Despite the author's modest disclaimer that "no quinones can ever be drugs," the prediction proved correct for BBI608, which failed multiple Phase III trials across different cancers1,2
- **Author's concern:** BBI608's mechanism ("inhibiting multiple pathways") indicated problematic lack of selectivity
  - **Evaluation:** LIKELY CORRECT. Multi-target activity may have contributed to off-target effects and failure, though mechanistic data remains limited
- **Industry hope:** Dainippon Sumitomo's $200M+ investment suggested they expected BBI608 to work in colorectal cancer and deliver value
  - **Evaluation:** FAILED. The investment did not pan out as the drug failed to gain approval in colorectal or any other cancer type, ultimately being discontinued1,2
- **Broader mechanism question:** The success or failure of BBI608 would impact confidence in cancer stem cell targeting
  - **Evaluation:** BBI608's failures tempered enthusiasm for cancer stem cell approaches1, though the field continued with other targets and modalities

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article captures the tension between financial investment optimism and chemical structure reality, with the author's quinone skepticism ultimately validated by multiple Phase III failures years later.
