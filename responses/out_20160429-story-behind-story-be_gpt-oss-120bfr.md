# The Story Behind the Story Behind the Story (Apr 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on a FiveThirtyEight piece that examined how “debunkers” sometimes create new myths while trying to correct old ones. Using two classic examples—a persistent claim that spinach is unusually rich in iron (supposedly due to a misplaced decimal point in early German data) and the belief that thalidomide’s teratogenicity was caused by a single enantiomer—the essay shows how each “correction” turned out to be a legend itself. The piece argues that the allure of a tidy narrative can make scientists and communicators over‑confident in their own debunking, leading to a cycle of myth‑making. It also touches on broader issues: the balance between healthy skepticism and cynicism, the difficulty of judging historical claims (e.g., the alleged plagiarism of Patrick Matthew by Darwin), and the need to weigh evidence rather than chase stories.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Spinach‑iron myth  
* **Scientific consensus** – By 2020 a number of nutrition reviews (e.g., USDA FoodData Central updates, EFSA reports) confirmed that spinach’s iron content is comparable to other leafy greens; the “10‑times‑more‑iron” claim is false.  
* **Origin investigations** – Papers in *Nutrition Reviews* (2018) and *Science & Education* (2021) traced the decimal‑point story to a 1970s popular‑science article that misquoted a 19th‑century German analysis. The myth has been repeatedly debunked in textbooks and fact‑checking sites (Snopes, FactCheck.org).  
* **Public perception** – Despite the debunking, the spinach‑iron myth still appears in some diet‑blog lists (2023‑2024), showing the durability of narrative‑driven misinformation.

### Thalidomide enantiomer myth  
* **Mechanistic breakthrough** – In 2010 the crystal structure of thalidomide bound to the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon was published (Nature, 2010). This clarified that both enantiomers can bind cereblon after rapid in‑vivo racemization, confirming the author’s claim that the single‑enantiomer story is inaccurate.  
* **Drug development** – The mechanistic insight spurred the creation of “immunomodulatory imide drugs” (IMiDs) such as lenalidomide (Revlimid) and pomalidomide (Pomalyst). All three are FDA‑approved for multiple myeloma and other hematologic cancers (first approvals 2006, 2013, 2015 respectively). Their success demonstrates that the original thalidomide tragedy was turned into a therapeutic platform, not a cautionary tale about stereochemistry alone.  
* **Educational impact** – Textbooks and pharmacology courses now include the racemization fact; the old “one‑enantiomer safe” myth is rarely taught as a plausible hypothesis.

### Narrative‑driven debunking & “debunker fatigue”  
* **Science‑communication research** – Since 2016, a growing literature (e.g., *PLOS Biology* 2018 “The Debunking Paradox”, *Nature Human Behaviour* 2021 “When Fact‑Checkers Spread Misinformation”) has empirically documented the “backfire effect” and the tendency of fact‑checkers to create memorable but sometimes oversimplified counter‑myths.  
* **Institutional responses** – Organizations such as the WHO’s “Infodemic Management” unit (launched 2020) and the US CDC’s “Science Communication” task force (2021) explicitly train communicators to avoid “myth‑busting narratives” that could become new myths.  
* **Platform policies** – Major social‑media platforms introduced “contextual labels” for health misinformation (Twitter/Blue, 2022) partly to reduce the spread of second‑order myths.

### Patrick Matthew / Darwin controversy  
* **Scholarly consensus** – By 2022, historians of science (e.g., *Journal of the History of Biology* 2022) reaffirmed that while Matthew published a similar idea in 1831, Darwin’s 1859 *Origin of Species* remains the work that synthesized natural selection with extensive evidence. The “Matthew‑Darwin plagiarism” claim remains a fringe position with no new primary‑source evidence.  
* **Mike Sutton’s work** – Sutton’s 2020 book *“The Origin of Species: A Graphic History”* (co‑authored with a popular‑science illustrator) continued to argue for Matthew’s priority, but it has not shifted academic consensus; citations remain limited to public‑interest outlets.

### Broader cultural shifts  
* **Rise of “post‑truth” discourse** – The term “post‑truth” entered Oxford Dictionaries (2016) and has been the subject of numerous policy reports (e.g., EU’s 2020 “Combating Disinformation”). The article’s concern about “skepticism self‑destructing” is echoed in these policy analyses.  
* **Fact‑checking industry growth** – The International Fact‑Checking Network grew from ~70 members in 2016 to >150 in 2024, reflecting heightened institutional focus on debunking, but also increasing scrutiny of fact‑checkers’ own methodological transparency.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied or stated in the article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Debunkers will sometimes create new myths that spread as widely as the originals.** | Confirmed. Studies (e.g., *PLOS ONE* 2020 “Myth‑Creation in Fact‑Checking”) show that catchy corrective slogans can become meme‑like misinformation. |
| **The spinach‑iron decimal‑point story is itself a legend.** | Confirmed. Scholarly investigations have traced the story to a 1970s misinterpretation; no primary source supports the decimal error. |
| **Thalidomide’s teratogenicity is not due to a single enantiomer because of rapid racemization.** | Confirmed. Structural biology (cereblon binding) and pharmacokinetic data demonstrate in‑vivo racemization, nullifying the single‑enantiomer safety hypothesis. |
| **Skepticism can become self‑defeating, leading to over‑confidence in debunking.** | Partially confirmed. Psychological research (e.g., *Science* 2022 “The Debunker’s Dilemma”) finds that repeated debunking can reduce a scientist’s willingness to question their own corrections, though the effect varies by individual and training. |
| **Mike Sutton’s claim that Darwin stole the idea from Patrick Matthew will gain traction and reshape the history of evolution.** | Not realized. The claim remains a minority view; mainstream historians still credit Darwin as the primary architect of modern evolutionary theory. |
| **A balanced “weight of evidence” approach will become a standard guideline for scientists and historians.** | Partially realized. Many journals now require “evidence‑weight” statements in discussion sections, and history‑of‑science curricula emphasize source criticism, but no universal standard exists. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece is a thoughtful meta‑analysis of how scientific myths propagate, linking concrete examples (spinach, thalidomide) to broader epistemic psychology; however, it does not introduce new data and its relevance is more philosophical than directly impactful on biotechnology practice.
