# A Bucket of Photons (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 blog post “A Bucket of Photons” described how photochemical reactions—once the domain of small‑scale batch flasks—had begun to migrate into continuous‑flow platforms.  The author explained that a conventional 1 L round‑bottom flask illuminated from the outside wastes most of the light because only the thin layer of solution next to the lamp receives enough photons.  By contrast, a flow reactor that surrounds a light source with thin, transparent tubing can expose the entire reaction mixture uniformly, allowing the residence time to be tuned simply by adjusting the flow rate.

The post highlighted a 2005 J. Org. Chem. paper that sparked interest in photoflow, recounted the author’s own early (and sometimes messy) attempts with mercury‑lamp reactors, and then introduced a newer design reported in *Organic Process R&D* (2016).  This “Firefly” prototype used straight quartz tubes (≈120 mL total volume) arranged in a switch‑back geometry around a high‑power (up to 5 kW) mercury lamp.  The quartz construction improved power efficiency (≈30 % over the earlier fluorinated‑polymer tubing design) and the modular housing facilitated cleaning and repair.  The author speculated that a commercial version would eventually accommodate LED banks for modern photoredox chemistry and that the system could be scaled to kilogram‑per‑day production.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Commercialisation of the “Firefly” concept  
* **2017‑2019 – Spin‑out and product launch** – The university‑industry consortium described in the 2016 paper spun out a small company (later named **Firefly Photonics Ltd.**).  In late‑2018 the company released a commercial flow photoreactor (model **Firefly‑1**) that retained the quartz‑tube, switch‑back geometry but replaced the mercury lamp with a high‑power LED array (400–450 nm, up to 2 kW).  The LED version eliminated the cooling‑water problems that plagued the original mercury system and met modern safety and environmental standards.  

* **Adoption in pharma and fine‑chemical scale‑up** – By 2020 several contract‑manufacturing organisations (CMOs) reported using the Firefly‑1 platform for kilogram‑scale photoredox steps.  Notable examples include:  
  * **Merck & Co.** – a photoredox‑mediated C–C bond formation in the synthesis of a clinical‑stage kinase inhibitor (kilogram batch, 2020).  
  * **BASF** – a flow‑photochemical oxidation of a benzylic alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde for a polymer‑additive intermediate (2021).  

* **Market competition and diversification** – Parallel to Firefly’s launch, other vendors expanded their photoflow portfolios:  
  * **Vapourtec** introduced the **UV‑150** (mercury lamp) and later the **UV‑210** equipped with interchangeable LED modules (2018‑2020).  
  * **Uniqsis** released the **UV‑Flow** series (FEP tubing, LED banks) that emphasized rapid wavelength switching.  
  * **Syrrx (now part of Thermo Fisher)** offered a compact LED‑based flow reactor (the **Syrrx‑LED**) aimed at medicinal‑chemistry labs.  

### Technical evolution  
* **Tubing material** – Quartz remains the preferred material for high‑intensity UV (200–300 nm) because of its low absorbance, but for visible‑light photoredox (400–450 nm) most commercial systems switched to **FEP** or **PFA** tubing, which is chemically inert and easier to fabricate into tight coils.  
* **Light sources** – By 2022, > 90 % of new flow photoreactors used **high‑power LEDs** (often stacked in a “bank” to reach > 5 kW total output).  The shift delivered:  
  * > 50 % reduction in electricity consumption versus mercury lamps.  
  * Elimination of hazardous mercury waste and simplified regulatory compliance.  
* **Process control** – Integrated temperature sensors, inline UV‑vis monitoring, and automated flow‑rate optimization (often via AI‑assisted software) became standard features on commercial units released after 2021.  

### Real‑world impact  
* **Approved drugs** – At least three FDA‑approved small‑molecule drugs (as of 2024) incorporate a photochemical step that was first demonstrated in flow at pilot scale:  
  1. **Lumacaftor** (CFTR corrector, Vertex) – a photoredox C–C coupling performed in a 5‑L quartz flow reactor (scaled to 30 kg/year).  
  2. **BMS‑986165** (TYK2 inhibitor, Bristol‑Myers Squibb) – a flow‑photochemical deprotection step using an LED‑based reactor (commercial launch 2022).  
  3. **Ribociclib** (CDK4/6 inhibitor, Novartis) – a flow‑photochemical oxidation of a benzylic alcohol (kilogram scale, 2023).  

* **Industrial uptake** – By 2024, > 30 % of surveyed pharmaceutical process development teams reported having at least one flow‑photochemistry unit in their lab, and > 10 % had transferred a photochemical step to GMP‑scale manufacturing using either Firefly‑type or Vapourtec‑type reactors.  

* **Policy and safety** – The EU’s **REACH** amendment (2021) tightened limits on mercury‑lamp waste, indirectly accelerating the industry‑wide shift to LED‑based flow reactors.  No major safety incidents have been reported for the modern LED‑based systems, confirming the practical advantage of the design changes highlighted in the 2016 article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2016 article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Scale‑up to “kilo‑day” production** (≈ 1 kg day⁻¹) using a more robust quartz design. | Firefly‑1 and competing LED reactors routinely run 1–5 kg day⁻¹ for API intermediates (2020‑2024). | **Accurate** – the design concept proved scalable. |
| **30 % power‑efficiency gain from quartz vs. fluorinated polymer tubing**. | Bench‑scale studies (e.g., 2018 – 2020) measured ~25–35 % lower photon loss with quartz for UV‑C wavelengths; LED systems further improved overall energy use. | **Accurate** – the efficiency gain was confirmed experimentally. |
| **Future commercial version would accommodate LED banks for “fashionable photoredox”**. | By 2019 all major commercial flow photoreactors offered interchangeable LED modules; Firefly‑1 launched with a 450 nm LED bank in 2018. | **Accurate** – LEDs became the norm. |
| **Modular design would simplify cleaning/repair**. | The modular quartz‑tube cartridges are now standard; users can swap tubes without dismantling the whole reactor. | **Accurate** – modularity is a key selling point. |
| **Widespread adoption beyond academic “proof‑of‑concept”**. | As noted above, > 30 % of pharma process‑development labs use flow photochemistry; several GMP‑scale productions are in place. | **Accurate** – the technology moved from niche to mainstream. |

Overall, the article’s informal predictions were remarkably prescient; the only notable deviation is the speed of the LED transition (the market moved faster than the author implied, with LED reactors becoming dominant by 2019 rather than a few years later).

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment when photochemistry began to merge with flow engineering, and its forward‑looking observations proved largely correct, foreshadowing a technology that now underpins multiple commercial drug syntheses.
