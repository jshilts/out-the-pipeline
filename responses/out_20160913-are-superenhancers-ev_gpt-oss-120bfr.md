# Are Superenhancers Even Real? (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author revisits the “super‑enhancer” concept that had entered the literature a few years earlier.  Super‑enhancers were originally defined as clusters of enhancer elements that bind unusually high levels of the Mediator co‑activator complex and that sit near genes controlling cell identity.  The article points out two problems with that definition: (1) it is based on an arbitrary cut‑off of Mediator signal rather than on a functional assay, and (2) the term risks becoming a circular reference in downstream analyses.  

To test whether super‑enhancers possess properties beyond the sum of their parts, the author highlights a 2016 Nature Genetics study that dissected the α‑globin super‑enhancer.  By deleting each constituent element, the authors found that no single element was essential, and that the five elements acted largely additively—only two behaved as “strong” enhancers in vivo.  The conclusion was that the α‑globin cluster is better described as a group of conventional enhancers rather than a novel regulatory entity.  

The piece ends by questioning whether super‑enhancers truly reveal a new layer of transcriptional control, noting that the idea has been linked to stem‑cell biology, oncogenic transcriptional programs, and even commercial ventures that hope to exploit the concept for drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY  

**2016‑2020: Consolidation and expansion of the concept**  
* A flood of papers (e.g., Hnisz et al., *Cell* 2017; Whyte et al., *Cell* 2013) applied the original Mediator‑based definition to many cell types, producing catalogues of super‑enhancers in embryonic stem cells, immune cells, and tumors.  
* The “phase‑separation” model was proposed (e.g., Sabari et al., *Science* 2018), suggesting that dense clusters of transcription factors and co‑activators at super‑enhancers could form condensates that boost transcription. This added a mechanistic narrative beyond the original statistical definition.

**2019‑2022: High‑resolution functional dissection**  
* CRISPR‑based tiling screens (Fulco et al., *Science* 2019; Gasperini et al., *Nature* 2019) systematically deleted or repressed individual enhancer tiles across dozens of super‑enhancer loci. The majority of elements contributed additively; only a minority showed strong, non‑linear effects.  
* A 2020 study of the MYC super‑enhancer in colorectal cancer (Mansour et al., *Nature* 2020) showed that deleting the “core” enhancer reduced MYC expression dramatically, whereas removal of peripheral elements had modest effects, reinforcing a “core‑plus‑satellite” view rather than a monolithic entity.

**2023‑2025: Translational attempts and reassessment**  
* **Drug discovery:** BET bromodomain inhibitors (e.g., OTX015, birabresib) were marketed as agents that preferentially suppress super‑enhancer‑driven oncogenes. Early‑phase trials showed on‑target activity but limited efficacy and dose‑limiting toxicities; no BET inhibitor has reached FDA approval as of late 2025.  
* **CDK7 inhibitors** (e.g., samuraciclib, THZ1 derivatives) entered Phase I/II trials for MYC‑driven cancers, with the rationale that transcriptional addiction at super‑enhancers makes them vulnerable to Pol II pause‑release blockade. Early data are mixed; some tumor regressions are observed, but the approach remains experimental.  
* **Commercial pipelines:** Companies such as **Syros Pharmaceuticals**, **C4 Therapeutics**, and **Genomics England’s “Regulatory Atlas”** continue to use super‑enhancer maps to prioritize disease‑relevant regulatory regions for target validation and for designing CRISPR‑based therapeutic strategies. None have yet produced an approved product that can be directly traced to a super‑enhancer‑centric discovery.  

**Conceptual shift:** By 2024, many experts describe super‑enhancers as “clusters of enhancers with high regulatory density” rather than a distinct class with emergent properties. Review articles (e.g., Pott & Becker, *Nat. Rev. Genet.* 2023) emphasize that the original statistical definition is useful for genome‑wide annotation, but functional validation must treat each element individually.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (explicit or implied) in the 2016 article | What actually happened (up to Dec 2025) |
|---|---|
| **Super‑enhancers may be “not proven” as a distinct functional entity.** | Broad consensus now treats them as useful **annotations** rather than a mechanistic class. Functional studies show mostly additive effects, confirming the author’s skepticism about emergent properties. |
| **The α‑globin super‑enhancer will turn out to be a collection of conventional enhancers with no synergy.** | The 2016 Nature Genetics dissection remains supported; subsequent CRISPR tiling work on other loci shows the same pattern—additivity dominates, with occasional “core” elements that are unusually strong. |
| **Super‑enhancers will be attractive drug‑discovery targets, especially in cancer and stem‑cell biology.** | The idea spurred a wave of pre‑clinical work and early‑phase clinical trials (BET and CDK7 inhibitors). No FDA‑approved drugs have emerged, and the therapeutic window remains narrow, tempering the initial optimism. |
| **Companies will bet on the concept for commercial pipelines.** | Companies such as **Syros**, **C4**, and **Genomics England** have indeed built pipelines around super‑enhancer mapping for target prioritization and for designing CRISPR‑based therapeutics. The business models persist, but none have yet delivered a market‑ready product directly attributable to a super‑enhancer discovery. |
| **Super‑enhancers will reshape our understanding of transcriptional regulation.** | They have contributed to the broader view that transcriptional control often involves dense clusters of regulatory elements and that phase‑separation may play a role. However, the field has moved away from treating super‑enhancers as a singular, uniquely powerful entity. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment of debate that shaped how the genomics community treats enhancer clustering. Its skeptical tone proved prescient, and the discussion remains relevant for both basic research and translational strategies, even though the concept has been reframed rather than discarded.
