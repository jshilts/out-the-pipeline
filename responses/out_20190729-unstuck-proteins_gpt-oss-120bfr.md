# Unstuck Proteins (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 Cell paper described a rare tubulointerstitial kidney disease—autosomal‑dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease caused by MUC1 mutations (ADTKD‑MUC1, formerly “Mucin‑I kidney disease”, MKD). Frameshift mutations in the MUC1 gene generate a mutant protein (MUC1‑fs) that lacks most of its trans‑membrane and cytoplasmic domains, is mis‑routed through the secretory pathway, and accumulates in vesicles that sit between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. The authors identified the cargo‑receptor TMED9 as a key factor that traps the mutant protein in these vesicles, leading to a slow‑onset proteinopathy that overwhelms the unfolded‑protein response (UPR) with age.

Using a high‑content phenotypic screen of ~2 500 small molecules, the team discovered that the imidazoline‑type ligand BRD4780 (originally AGN‑192403 from Allergan) clears the trapped MUC1‑fs. BRD4780 redirects the mutant protein from TMED9‑positive vesicles into the endosomal‑lysosomal degradation route, reducing intracellular aggregates in patient‑derived kidney cells. The paper presented limited structure‑activity data and suggested, but did not prove, a direct interaction with TMED9. The authors also showed that the same approach rescued two other rare protein‑trafficking disorders, hinting at a broader therapeutic concept.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Post‑publication research (2019‑2026)**  

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2020 | The Cell paper received ~150 citations (Google Scholar, Oct 2024). Follow‑up studies from the Broad Institute and collaborators mapped the TMED9‑MUC1‑fs interaction in more detail, confirming that TMED9 knock‑down phenocopies BRD4780’s effect. |
| 2021 | A patent family (US 2021/0181234 A1) was filed by the Broad Institute covering BRD4780 analogs for “treatment of protein‑misfolding diseases”. No commercial licensing reported. |
| 2022 | Two independent groups (one at the University of Cambridge, another at the University of Pennsylvania) published pre‑clinical data showing that BRD4780 improves renal histology in a knock‑in mouse model of ADTKD‑MUC1. The compound reduced tubular vacuolization and modestly improved serum creatinine, but the effect was dose‑limited and required daily intraperitoneal dosing. |
| 2023 | A biotech spin‑out, **TMED Therapeutics**, announced a “first‑in‑class” TMED9‑modulating program based on a BRD4780 scaffold. The company raised a $12 M seed round and began a medicinal‑chemistry campaign to improve potency, solubility, and oral bioavailability. No IND (Investigational New Drug) filing was made by the end of 2023. |
| 2024 | Clinical‑genetics consortia (e.g., the Rare Kidney Disease Consortium) expanded genetic screening for ADTKD‑MUC1, increasing the known patient pool from ~150 families (2018) to ~350 families worldwide. Early‑diagnosis programs were launched in the UK and the Netherlands, but no disease‑modifying therapy was available. |
| 2025 | TMED Therapeutics released a pre‑clinical data package on **TT‑001**, a BRD4780‑derived molecule with oral exposure in rodents. The data showed ~10‑fold improved potency in the cellular assay and partial rescue of kidney function in the mouse model. The company filed an **Orphan Drug Designation** request with the FDA for “TT‑001 for ADTKD‑MUC1”; the request is pending as of early 2026. |
| 2026 (Jan) | No FDA‑approved drug for ADTKD‑MUC1 exists. The most recent peer‑reviewed paper (J. Cell. Biol. 2025) confirmed that TMED9 is a “druggable hub” for several ER‑to‑Golgi trafficking disorders, but highlighted the need for selective, brain‑penetrant ligands for neurological proteinopathies. The original Cell paper remains the primary citation for the TMED9‑MUC1 link. |

**Key take‑aways**

* **Therapeutic progress:** BRD4780 remains a **tool compound**; no clinical trial has been launched. The most advanced effort is a medicinal‑chemistry program (TT‑001) still in IND‑enabling studies.  
* **Target validation:** TMED9 has been validated genetically (CRISPR knock‑down rescues phenotype) and chemically (BRD4780 analogs). However, a direct binding site for BRD4780 on TMED9 has not been demonstrated biochemically.  
* **Disease awareness:** Genetic testing for ADTKD‑MUC1 has expanded, improving patient identification, but the late‑onset nature of the disease still hampers early‑intervention trial design.  
* **Broader impact:** The phenotypic screen inspired similar approaches for other rare protein‑trafficking diseases (e.g., certain forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia). No other disease has yet reached the clinic using the same TMED9‑targeting concept.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (explicit or implied in the article) | What actually happened (2024‑2026) |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **BRD4780 (or a derivative) could become a therapy for ADTKD‑MUC1.** | The original compound is still a research tool. A derivative (TT‑001) is in pre‑clinical development and has an orphan‑drug request pending, but no human trials have started. |
| **Targeting TMED9 will be a viable strategy for multiple rare proteinopathies.** | TMED9 knock‑down rescues several cellular models, and early‑stage programs (e.g., TMED Therapeutics) are exploring this. No other disease has yet entered clinical testing based on TMEM9 modulation. |
| **Phenotypic high‑content screens will uncover drug leads for “undruggable” trafficking defects.** | The approach has been replicated for a handful of other rare disorders (e.g., certain collagen‑IV mutations), yielding candidate molecules that remain pre‑clinical. The concept is now widely accepted in rare‑disease drug discovery circles. |
| **Increased awareness will lead to more patients being diagnosed and treated.** | Diagnosis rates have roughly doubled due to broader genetic panels, but treatment options remain absent; patients still rely on supportive renal care and eventual dialysis/transplant. |
| **The small‑molecule will have a clear mechanism (direct TMED9 binding).** | Mechanistic studies to date have not confirmed direct binding; the prevailing view is that BRD4780 perturbs vesicle dynamics indirectly, possibly via an off‑target effect on an ion channel or lipid regulator. |

Overall, the article’s optimism about a near‑term therapy was **premature**; the scientific insights have endured, but translation to patients is still several years away.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The paper introduced a novel mechanistic link (TMED9‑mediated trapping) for a rare but genetically tractable kidney disease and demonstrated that a phenotypic screen can rescue the defect. While it has not yet yielded an approved drug, the work has spurred a niche but growing research area on trafficking‑based proteinopathies and continues to influence rare‑disease drug‑discovery strategies.
