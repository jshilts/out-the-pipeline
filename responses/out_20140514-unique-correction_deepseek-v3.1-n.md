# A Unique Correction (14 May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article describes an unusual author correction notice published in ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters. The correction was remarkable because the authors collectively decided to "rearrange the order of the authors and remove Dr. Usui" from the paper's author list. Even more notably, Dr. Usui—identified as the supervisor—authorized and approved his own removal from the publication. The article's author notes this appears to be an unprecedented situation in academic publishing, acknowledging there's likely an interesting story behind this correction but stating they don't know what actually happened.

## 2. HISTORY

Post-publication developments:

**The corrected paper**: The article referenced ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters paper (DOI: 10.1021/ml500149q), published in 2014. The research described synthesis and evaluation of novel compounds.

**Academic authorship norms**: This incident occurred during ongoing discussions about authorship ethics in academic publishing. While unusual, such corrections highlight the complex dynamics that can occur in research collaborations, including disputes over intellectual contributions or supervision disagreements.

**Impact on publishing standards**: Major publishers like ACS have established guidelines for authorship disputes and corrections, but this type of author removal—especially with the removed person's consent—remains relatively uncommon in the scientific literature.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It was primarily observational, noting the unusual nature of the correction notice without speculating about broader implications for scientific publishing or the biotechnology industry.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This scores in the lower range because, while the correction notice was indeed unusual, it represents more of a procedural curiosity in academic publishing rather than substantive developments in biotechnology or science policy with broader impact.
