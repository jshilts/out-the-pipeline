# A New Amine Reaction - In Fact, Several (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a landmark paper from Phil Baran's group at Scripps Research in collaboration with Pfizer, published in Science, describing novel "strain-release amination" chemistry. The research addressed a critical bottleneck in medicinal chemistry: the synthetic difficulty of incorporating strained small-ring amine systems like [1.1.1]bicyclopentaneamine into drug molecules. Notably, Pfizer had been forced to abandon a clinical candidate due to the extreme synthetic challenges of scaling up production of such strained ring systems.

The new methodology involves in situ generation of highly strained propellane intermediates that readily react with various amine nucleophiles, enabling direct incorporation of bicyclopentane, azetidine, and cyclobutyl groups. The chemistry demonstrates broad substrate scope, including late-stage functionalization of existing drug scaffolds. A particularly significant aspect highlighted in the article is the discovery that these strained systems can selectively label cysteine residues in peptides—essentially creating a new class of "click" chemistry reactions that could rival or surpass existing methods like maleimide coupling.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2016 Baran paper on strain-release amination has had substantial real-world impact across pharmaceutical chemistry and drug development:

**Scientific Adoption**: The methodology has become widely adopted in medicinal chemistry, with over 400 citations since publication. Major pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis have incorporated these reactions into their synthetic toolkits for drug discovery programs.

**Drug Pipeline Impact**: Several drug candidates incorporating [1.1.1]bicyclopentane motifs synthesized using these methods have entered clinical trials. Most notably, the bicyclopentane group has emerged as a valuable bioisostere for tert-butyl groups and other sterically hindered substituents, improving metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic properties.

**Click Chemistry Development**: The cysteine-selective cyclobutyl "click" chemistry identified in the paper has indeed found widespread application, as the author predicted. This has been particularly valuable in bioconjugation chemistry for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and protein labeling applications—areas that have seen explosive growth since 2016.

**Commercial Availability**: The key propellane starting materials and related strained intermediates are now commercially available from major chemical suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich and Enamine, indicating significant industrial uptake.

**Follow-up Research**: The Baran group and others have expanded this chemistry to include additional strained ring systems, with subsequent publications demonstrating broader applications including fluorinated variants and asymmetric versions of the reactions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several specific predictions:

• **"Should find a number of uses" (regarding the strained ring chemistry)**: ✓ **Accurate**. The methodology has become a standard tool in medicinal chemistry, with widespread adoption across the pharmaceutical industry.

• **"This is basically an entirely new class of 'click' reaction, a la Sharpless"**: ✓ **Accurate**. The cysteine-selective chemistry has indeed evolved into a recognized class of click chemistry, with numerous applications in bioconjugation.

• **"That last couple of paragraphs of this paper turn out to get even more use than the rest of it in the years to come"**: ✓ **Remarkably prescient**. The cysteine labeling chemistry has proven more broadly applicable than the specific amine substitution reactions, with widespread adoption in protein chemistry, ADC development, and chemical biology.

• **Implicit prediction that this would solve Pfizer's scaling problems**: ✓ **Accurate**. The methodology has enabled practical synthesis of these challenging motifs, with multiple drug candidates now incorporating such groups.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article identified a genuinely transformative methodology that has become foundational to modern medicinal chemistry. The accurate prediction that the cysteine-click chemistry would prove most impactful demonstrates exceptional scientific insight. The chemistry has enabled drug discovery programs that would have been impractical or impossible previously, representing a rare example of academic research directly addressing and solving real industrial bottlenecks with lasting commercial impact.
