# Links and Such (November 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from November 2006 serves as a personal update from a science blogger experiencing technical issues with their Movable Type platform. The author mentions being occupied with following election coverage while enjoying Indian food, offering specific product recommendations for Patak's tandoori paste and papads available on Amazon.

The main substantive content is a comprehensive update to the blog's blogroll, with the author noting that "blogging does seem to have finally reached takeoff in the chemistry world over the last few months." The post welcomes several new chemistry and science blogs including Omics! Omics!, Molecule of the Day, Kinase Pro, Org Prep Daily, and approximately fifteen additional chemistry-focused blogs, spanning topics from pharmaceutical chemistry to chemical forums and practical laboratory work.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2006 post, the chemistry and science blogging landscape underwent significant transformation, though not necessarily in the direction the author anticipated. The "takeoff" moment described was genuine—science blogging did experience substantial growth in the late 2000s, with platforms like ScienceBlogs (launched 2006) becoming major hubs for scientific communication.

However, the subsequent fifteen years saw several major shifts. Many of the individual blogger sites mentioned likely became inactive as platforms evolved. The late 2000s to early 2010s represented a golden age for science blogging, with many academic scientists maintaining active blogs. By the mid-2010s, much science communication migrated toward social media platforms like Twitter, which offered easier discoverability and engagement. Some bloggers transitioned to platforms like Medium or continued on WordPress, while others reduced activity or stopped blogging entirely.

The broader trend saw a shift from independent blogs to centralized platforms, then to social media, and more recently toward newsletter platforms like Substack and video formats like YouTube for science communication. Many academics found that institutional pressures, time constraints, and the changing digital landscape made maintaining active blogs increasingly challenging.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author's observation that "blogging does seem to have finally reached takeoff in the chemistry world" contained both accurate and inaccurate elements when viewed with hindsight:

• **Accurate**: Chemistry and science blogging did experience significant growth following 2006, with many new voices entering the space throughout 2007-2012
• **Partially accurate**: The format did achieve notable impact, with science blogs influencing public understanding of science and occasionally policy discussions
• **Inaccurate timeline**: The "takeoff" moment was more of a plateau peak than sustained exponential growth; within 5-10 years, many traditional science blogs had declined in activity
• **Missed shifts**: The post captured a genuine moment but couldn't anticipate the migration to social media platforms and video formats that would reshape science communication by 2010-2020

The prediction captured a real trend but underestimated how quickly digital communication formats would evolve away from traditional blogging.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While historically noteworthy as a snapshot of the 2006 science blogging moment, this post contains minimal substantive scientific or biotechnology content. It's primarily administrative blog maintenance with recommendations for Indian food products and blogroll updates, lacking the technical depth or forward-looking analysis that would make it valuable for understanding biotechnology developments.
