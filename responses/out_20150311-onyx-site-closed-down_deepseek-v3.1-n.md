# Onyx Site Closed Down (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports that Amgen is closing the Onyx Pharmaceuticals site and laying off at least 300 people following its 2013 acquisition of Onyx. The author notes this outcome was widely expected, as Amgen's primary interest was obtaining the multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis (carfilzomib), a proteasome inhibitor. The acquisition is characterized as essentially an asset purchase where Amgen acquired what it wanted (Kyprolis) and is now eliminating redundant infrastructure and personnel.

## 2. HISTORY
Amgen's acquisition of Onyx for approximately $10.4 billion in 2013 was indeed driven primarily by Kyprolis, which had received FDA approval in 2012 for multiple myeloma patients who had received prior treatments. Following the acquisition:

**Kyprolis development continued successfully:** The drug gained additional FDA approvals - in 2015 for combination therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma, and in 2016 as a frontline treatment. It became a standard treatment option for multiple myeloma patients.

**Site closure implications:** The South San Francisco Onyx site closure represented consolidation typical of pharmaceutical mergers, where acquirers eliminate duplicate R&D infrastructure while retaining valuable assets and personnel essential to the acquired products.

**Business performance:** Kyprolis generated substantial revenue for Amgen, reaching blockbuster status with sales exceeding $1 billion annually by the late 2010s, validating the strategic rationale for the expensive acquisition.

**Clinical landscape:** Proteasome inhibitors like Kyprolis and bortezomib became cornerstone treatments for multiple myeloma, demonstrating the viability of this therapeutic approach.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **"Kyprolis is working out fine"** - This assessment proved accurate. Kyprolis maintained its position as an important multiple myeloma treatment, expanded into earlier lines of therapy, and achieved strong commercial success.

• **"That's all Amgen wanted"** - The prediction that Amgen was primarily acquiring Kyprolis rather than broader Onyx capabilities was correct. Amgen retained and developed the drug while divesting from the Onyx infrastructure.

• **Implied prediction about site closure being inevitable** - The article's tone suggested site closure was expected, which proved correct as Amgen consolidated operations post-acquisition.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **5/10**
This is a routine pharma business consolidation story with predictable outcomes. While it correctly identified the strategic rationale, it covers familiar merger dynamics rather than novel scientific or policy developments. The most it offers is confirmation of business strategy patterns in drug development acquisitions.
