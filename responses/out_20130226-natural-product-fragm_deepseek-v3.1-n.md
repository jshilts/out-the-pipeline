# Natural Product Fragments: Get Rid of the Ugly Ones Now (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a research paper that attempted to break down known natural product structures into fragment-sized pieces for use in drug discovery screening libraries. The author expresses sympathy for the goal of creating fragment libraries with more polarity, hydrogen-bonding character, and three-dimensional structures compared to typical fragment libraries that are "top-heavy with aromatic and heteroaromatic groups." Natural products were seen as a good source for such diversity.

However, the article highlights a critical problem identified by Dan Erlanson of Practical Fragments: many of these natural product fragments contained PAINS (Pan-Assay Interference Compounds) - structures known to cause nonspecific interference in biological assays. The author strongly agrees with this concern, noting that 17 particularly problematic structures were identified among the 193 tested fragments. The article concludes that these "dreadful" structures should be excluded from fragment screening libraries due to their high likelihood of leading to false positives and failed drug development efforts.

## 2. HISTORY

The concern raised in this 2013 article proved prescient as the pharmaceutical industry became increasingly sophisticated about assay interference compounds over the subsequent decade.

**PAINS Awareness Growth**: The period after 2013 saw widespread adoption of PAINS filtering in early drug discovery. Major pharmaceutical companies and academic screening centers increasingly implemented computational filters to remove PAINS compounds from screening libraries. The work of Baell and Holloway (2010), which formally categorized PAINS, became standard reference material across the industry.

**Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) Evolution**: Fragment-based approaches continued to mature, with several drugs reaching the market or late-stage clinical trials that originated from fragment screening. Examples include vemurafenib (approved in 2011, originating from fragment screening) and venetoclax (approved in 2016). However, these successes came from carefully curated fragment libraries, not from natural product fragments containing interference compounds.

**Natural Product Drug Discovery Trends**: Despite the challenges highlighted in the article, natural products remained important in drug discovery. Between 2013-2023, approximately 30-40% of new FDA-approved drugs were natural products, natural product derivatives, or inspired by natural products. However, the industry increasingly favored semi-synthetic approaches or focused on well-characterized natural product scaffolds rather than random fragmentation approaches.

**Screening Library Best Practices**: By the late 2010s, best practices for fragment library design had become established, emphasizing chemical diversity, favorable physicochemical properties, and rigorous filtering for reactive and interfering compounds. Commercial fragment libraries from companies like Enamine, ChemBridge, and Life Chemicals explicitly marketed their "PAINS-free" credentials as a key selling point.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained implicit predictions about the future of fragment-based drug discovery:

- **Prediction**: That natural product fragments containing PAINS structures would "lead only to heartbreak" if included in screening libraries
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The industry broadly adopted PAINS filtering, and libraries with reactive/interfering compounds consistently showed higher false positive rates and poor track records in drug development.

- **Prediction**: That "something with more polarity, more hydrogen-bonding character, and more three-dimensional structures would be useful" for fragment libraries
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. Fragment library design evolved to prioritize three-dimensional complexity and better coverage of chemical space, with successful fragment-to-lead programs increasingly emphasizing these properties.

- **Prediction**: That efficiently synthesizing natural product fragments would require "novel, efficient synthesis methodologies"
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. While some progress occurred in synthetic methodology, the practical challenges of accessing diverse natural product fragments at scale remained significant, limiting widespread adoption of this approach.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article was prescient in highlighting a critical quality control issue that became central to fragment-based drug discovery best practices. The PAINS problem it identified had real economic impact, as false positives in screening cost pharmaceutical companies significant time and resources. While not revolutionary, it was an influential piece that contributed to improved screening practices across the industry.
