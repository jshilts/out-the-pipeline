# Another Orphan Reunited (November 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the sigma-2 receptor (also known as Tmem97), which along with sigma-1 had been an "orphan" receptor since 1990—meaning these membrane-spanning proteins were known to exist and bind synthetic ligands, but their natural endogenous binding partners remained unidentified for over 30 years. A Caltech team (Ondrus group) successfully identified the endogenous ligand as 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, an oxysterol metabolite of cholesterol. This discovery was surprising because most researchers had assumed the ligand would contain a basic amine, while 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol is completely neutral and nitrogen-free. The identification was achieved using a covalent reactive probe version of cholesterol with alkyne and diazirine groups for labeling and subsequent click chemistry. The oxysterol family includes many signaling molecules (such as 27-, 24(S)-, 25-, and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol) involved in neurotransmission, immune function, cancer pathways, and embryonic development, often functioning as transient, local, but important signals. The sigma-2 receptor showed connections to NPC1, a cholesterol transport protein, suggesting broader roles in membrane lipid homeostasis and cellular trafficking beyond just the orphan receptor problem.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the November 2021 publication reporting 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol as the endogenous ligand for sigma-2/Tmem97, several developments have occurred in the field, though clinical translation remains limited:

**Mechanism and Biology**: Subsequent research confirmed that 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol binds Tmem97 with high selectivity and modulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis, membrane trafficking, and lipid raft organization. Tmem97 continues to be studied primarily within cholesterol metabolism pathways, often interacting with NPC1 and related proteins involved in intracellular cholesterol transport.

**Drug Discovery**: No FDA-approved drugs targeting Tmem97/sigma-2 receptor have emerged since 2021. There are no marketed medications specifically designed to modulate this pathway, and no large pharmaceutical programs have publicly progressed sigma-2 modulators into late-stage clinical trials. The field largely remains in preclinical investigation.

**Research Adoption**: The identification has been widely cited in pharmacological literature and adopted by researchers studying oxysterol biology and cholesterol metabolism. Tmem97 is now routinely included in discussions of oxysterol signaling networks, representing a meaningful advance in fundamental receptor pharmacology, but it has not become a major drug target in practice.

**Clinical Development**: Several companies and academic groups had previously explored sigma-2 receptor agonists for oncology applications (capitalizing on the receptor's overexpression in certain tumors), but these programs have generally not progressed to approval. No breakthrough therapeutic applications leveraging the 2021 endogenous ligand discovery have reached the clinic.

**Scientific Community**: The discovery has generated moderate interest within specialized fields (biochemistry, pharmacology, cholesterol research), but has not produced the broader biomedical impact that sometimes follows successful receptor de-orphanization (such as the discovery of ghrelin or orexin ligands).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions about drugs, timelines, or commercial outcomes. Instead, it focused on describing the successful identification of 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol as the endogenous sigma-2 ligand and celebrating this scientific achievement. However, by discussing the broader context of oxysterol roles in cancer, immune function, and embryonic development, it implicitly suggested that this discovery could lead to new therapeutic opportunities and deeper biological understanding.

**Evaluating Implicit Expectations**:
• **Therapeutic potential**: While the article implied that de-orphanization might enable drug development, no FDA-approved therapies targeting Tmem97/sigma-2 have emerged since 2021, and few if any programs have advanced meaningfully in clinical trials
• **Biological insight**: The expectation of illuminating "interesting biology" has been partially fulfilled—Tmem97's role in cholesterol homeostasis is better understood, though revolutionary biological insights have been modest
• **Target validation**: Despite hopes that identifying the endogenous ligand would validate therapeutic targeting, the receptor has not become a major drug target in practice
• **Oxysterol network mapping**: Progress has been incremental rather than transformative; the "very transient, very local, and very important" signaling concept remains relevant but has not revolutionized clinical medicine

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This article documents a notable pharmacological achievement—the successful de-orphanization of a receptor after 30 years—but it has had limited broader impact on drug development or clinical practice since 2021. The discovery advanced fundamental scientific knowledge in a specialized niche, but did not catalyze major therapeutic programs or produce widely adopted clinical applications. While scientifically accurate and historically significant within receptor pharmacology, it ranks in the lower-middle tier of biomedical articles in terms of transformative long-term importance.
