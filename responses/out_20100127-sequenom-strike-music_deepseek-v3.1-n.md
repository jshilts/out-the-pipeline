# Sequenom: Strike Up the Music, Bring On the Cream Pies (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes the unfolding scandal at Sequenom, a San Diego diagnostics company that claimed to have developed a non-invasive prenatal test for Down syndrome. In April 2009, Sequenom announced problems with its test and launched an internal investigation. By September 2009, the company admitted that the data backing their product were "inadequately substantiated," leading to the departure of the CEO and six other executives amid SEC and FBI scrutiny. The company settled shareholder lawsuits with alarming terms that revealed basic research protocol failures, such as poor blinding of studies and inadequate sample controls. Compounding the scandal, Xenomics—which had licensed nucleic acid technology to Sequenom—filed a lawsuit claiming the test never actually existed and that Sequenom had maintained a "charade" about having a viable product.

## 2. HISTORY

**Sequenom's Downfall and Aftermath:**
The scandal continued to unfold after this January 2010 article. In October 2010, the SEC charged Sequenom's former CEO Harry Stylli and former senior VP Elizabeth Dragon with securities fraud for making false and misleading statements about the Down syndrome test's clinical trial results. They settled without admitting guilt, paying penalties and disgorgement totaling over $500,000 combined.

**Industry Impact and Transformation:**
While Sequenom struggled with credibility, the broader field of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) advanced significantly. Between 2011-2012, multiple companies including Sequenom (with their revised MaterniT21 test), Verinata Health, and Ariosa Diagnostics launched validated NIPT tests using cell-free DNA technology. By October 2011, Sequenom's MaterniT21 test received FDA clearance and became clinically available.

**Clinical Adoption and Market Growth:**
NIPT technology proved clinically valuable and achieved widespread adoption. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued guidelines supporting NIPT use in high-risk pregnancies. By the mid-2010s, millions of NIPT tests were performed annually worldwide. Sequenom's stock never fully recovered from the 2008-2009 highs, and in 2016, the company was acquired by LabCorp for approximately $371 million—significantly less than its peak valuation during the pre-scandal hype.

**Xenomics Outcomes:**
Xenomics, the company that sued Sequenom, never achieved major commercial success in NIPT and eventually shifted focus to other diagnostic areas. The lawsuit outcomes remain unclear from public records.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Article's skepticism about "Three Reasons to Buy Sequenom Today"**: The author's negative assessment proved accurate. Sequenom stock declined significantly after January 2010, and the company was eventually acquired at a fraction of its previous valuation, validating the skepticism about investment prospects.

• **Skeptical analysts' concerns about company prospects**: Early skeptics (referenced from 2008 Barron's article) who doubted Sequenom's prospects were proven correct. Despite eventually launching a real NIPT product (MaterniT21), the company never recovered the market confidence or valuation lost during the scandal.

• **Xenomics lawsuit claims about nonexistent test**: While Xenomics' lawsuit was settled or dismissed (outcomes not fully public), the historical record shows that Sequenom did eventually develop real NIPT technology, suggesting Xenomics' strongest claims may have been exaggerated, though they correctly identified serious fraud in the earlier data.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article is historically significant as it captures a critical moment in the NIPT industry's development, documenting both scientific fraud and the validation of important medical technology. It demonstrates how scientific scandals can temporarily derail but not permanently prevent beneficial medical advances.
