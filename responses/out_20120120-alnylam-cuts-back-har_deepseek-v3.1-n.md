# Alnylam Cuts Back Hard (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports that Alnylam, an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics company, is cutting approximately one-third of its workforce to conserve resources and advance its most promising drug candidates through clinical trials. The author characterizes this as a "familiar story" in small pharmaceutical companies, where limited funding forces a choice between sustaining early-stage R&D or pushing select programs through the clinic. The piece references earlier indicators of trouble in the RNAi field, including setbacks at Merck and Roche, and frames Alnylam's situation as a race against time and resources. The author expresses cautious optimism that "there's really something there in their pipeline" while questioning whether the company's prospects will prove sufficient and reach the market soon enough to ensure survival.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent developments proved transformative for both Alnylam and the RNAi therapeutics field. Alnylam survived this difficult period and went on to achieve multiple FDA approvals, becoming the first company to bring RNAi-based medicines to patients.

**Clinical Success and FDA Approvals:**
- **Onpattro (patisiran)**: Approved by the FDA in August 2018 for treating polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR). This marked the first-ever RNAi therapeutic approved in the United States and represented a validation of the entire field.
- **Givlaari (givosiran)**: Approved in November 2019 for acute hepatic porphyria.
- **Oxlumo (lumasiran)**: Approved in November 2020 for primary hyperoxaluria type 1.
- **Leqvio (inclisiran)**: Partnership drug approved in December 2021 for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (though developed with Novartis, not Alnylam).

**Market Impact and Uptake:**
Onpattro demonstrated significant real-world impact for hATTR patients, a rare disease with limited treatment options. By 2022, Alnylam had multiple approved drugs generating substantial revenue (approximately $1.18 billion in 2022 product revenues), with Onpattro alone reaching hundreds of millions in annual sales. The company's stock price recovered dramatically from its 2012 lows, increasing more than tenfold by 2018.

**Industry Validation:**
Alnylam's breakthrough catalyzed renewed interest in RNAi therapeutics across the pharmaceutical industry. Major companies that had exited the field began returning, with Alnylam establishing multiple partnerships. The company's success helped validate the fundamental science of RNA interference for therapeutic applications, moving it from experimental promise to clinical reality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Author's implicit concern about company survival**: The article expressed doubt about whether Alnylam could "get something that will bring the income before time and resources get too tight." **Outcome**: The company successfully survived the 2012 crisis and became profitable, with multiple approved drugs generating over $1 billion annually by 2022.

- **Unstated prediction about RNAi field viability**: The article's tone suggested that RNAi faced significant challenges and uncertain commercial prospects. **Outcome**: RNAi therapeutics proved clinically viable and commercially successful, with Alnylam leading the transformation from experimental technology to approved medicines.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article provides a historically significant snapshot of biotech commercial development at a critical turning point—the moment when groundbreaking science faces financial reality. It captures the tension between scientific promise and commercial viability that defines therapeutic development, making it valuable for understanding the dynamics of innovation cycles in biotechnology.
