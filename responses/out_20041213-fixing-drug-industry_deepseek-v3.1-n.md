# Fixing the Drug Industry? (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2004 blog post discusses a Becker-Posner blog debate about pharmaceutical patent reform. The author summarizes Gary Becker's examination of patent system tensions: high drug prices reduce patient access while helping companies recoup R&D costs. Richard Posner suggested shortening patent terms to reduce "patent racing" waste—where companies overspend to be first by minimal margins—arguing this could benefit consumers by redirecting investments elsewhere in the economy. The author worries shorter patents would simply drive prices higher to maintain the same profit "prize," potentially worsening price-gouging complaints. Becker's alternative suggestions included prize money instead of patent protection for high-impact diseases, and loosening FDA efficacy requirements while maintaining safety standards.

## 2. HISTORY
The pharmaceutical patent landscape did not move significantly toward the reforms discussed in this 2004 article. Shorter patent terms were not implemented on a broad scale, and debates about patent protection in pharmaceuticals remain largely unchanged in their fundamental structure. The Hatch-Waxman Act framework, which already balanced patent life against generic competition, continued operating without major overhaul.

FDA's efficacy requirement standards were not substantially weakened. Instead, the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and other reforms focused on expediting pathways (fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review) while maintaining rigorous efficacy standards, particularly for serious conditions. Rather than loosening requirements, regulatory evolution has emphasized adaptive trial designs and real-world evidence while preserving evidentiary standards.

Prize-based incentive systems for drug development did not become mainstream alternatives to patents. Limited experiments exist (such as priority review vouchers for neglected diseases), but the patent-driven R&D incentive model remains dominant. Global pharmaceutical market dynamics have evolved with increased focus on orphan drugs, biologics, and specialty medications, but the fundamental patent-protected business model persists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Becker/Posner predictions evaluated:**
- **Posner's shortened patent term proposal**: Did not materialize. Patent life for pharmaceuticals remained largely unchanged, and no evidence suggests systematic reduction occurred. The patent racing concern persisted in some competitive therapeutic areas, but industry structure did not shift as proposed.

- **Becker's efficacy requirement loosening**: Did not happen. FDA maintained strict efficacy standards, and pharmaceutical industry reputation concerns about "snake oil" salesmen likely contributed to preserving robust regulatory oversight.

- **Prize systems replacing patents**: Were not widely adopted. Patent protection remained the primary incentive mechanism for pharmaceutical R&D investment, with limited exceptions for neglected diseases.

The author's concern about shorter patents driving higher prices to maintain profit levels cannot be tested empirically, as the patent term reduction proposal was never implemented.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses enduring pharmaceutical policy questions, but the specific proposals discussed were not implemented, making it more historically notable than practically impactful. The piece reflects ongoing tensions in pharmaceutical innovation policy rather than anticipating genuine reform trajectories.
