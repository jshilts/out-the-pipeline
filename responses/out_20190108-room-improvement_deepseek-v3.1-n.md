# Room For Improvement (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the challenge of improving on nature, focusing on the inefficiency of RuBisCO, a key enzyme in photosynthesis. RuBisCO is described as slow and frequently grabs oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, creating toxic 2-phosphoglycolate that plants must clear through photorespiration. While evolution has had billions of years to optimize this system, the author notes that engineered improvements remain difficult.

The article highlights a breakthrough from University of Illinois researchers who engineered tobacco plants with bacterial and algal glycolate-handling enzymes to improve photorespiration efficiency. Field tests showed 17% improved light-use efficiency and 25-40% increased biomass production. The researchers were optimistic about translating this to food crops, potentially increasing yields, reducing land use, and improving CO₂ uptake.

The author concludes that while assuming we can easily beat evolution is naive, refusing to improve on natural systems is equally unsound, drawing parallels to medical research where intervention is standard practice.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at developments since this 2019 article, the promising approach described (called "photorespiratory bypass") has encountered the typical challenges of translating plant biotechnology from model systems to food crops:

- **Continued Research Progress**: The University of Illinois research group (part of the Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency or RIPE project) has continued publishing work on photosynthetic efficiency improvements, including studies in cowpea and attempts to transfer these improvements to staple crops.

- **Commercial Development Challenges**: While the tobacco results were impressive, translating these gains to major food crops like rice, wheat, and soybeans has proven more difficult than initially hoped, as is typical with plant biotechnology timelines.

- **Tobacco as Test System**: The choice of tobacco mentioned in the article—easy genetics, robust growth—remains a standard model system, but the path from model system to commercial crops typically takes one to two decades even when successful.

- **Regulatory and Public Acceptance**: Bioengineered crops continue to face significant regulatory hurdles in many countries, and public acceptance varies widely, affecting commercialization of any improved crop varieties.

The photorespiration bypass work represents real scientific progress, but as of now, has not led to widely adopted improved crop varieties in major food systems, though research continues.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article included several predictions and hopeful statements:

- **Prediction**: "They're optimistic that this can be translated to other more useful C3 plants, including food sources."
  - **Reality**: Translation to food crops remains a work in progress. While research has advanced, commercial deployment has not yet occurred on a significant scale.

- **Prediction**: "This will also allow these plants to thrive even more if carbon dioxide levels keep increasing"
  - **Reality**: CO₂ levels have indeed continued rising, but the engineered photosynthetic improvements aren't yet deployed at scale in agriculture.

- **Prediction**: "Increased crop yields would allow us to feed the Earth's population while plowing up less of the planet"
  - **Reality**: Based on empirical data about crop yield gains, while many agricultural improvements have helped, achieving 25-40% biomass gains across major food crops would indeed be transformative but hasn't materialized yet from this specific approach.

- **Bigger Picture**: The strategy of improving photosynthesis remains scientifically valid, but deployment timelines for plant biotechnology innovations are typically much longer than the optimistic scenarios sometimes presented in breakthrough announcements.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **7/10**

This article remains interesting because it highlights an authentic scientific challenge (RuBisCO's inefficiency) and a genuine research breakthrough, while acknowledging the philosophical tension between improving on nature and recognizing evolution's constraints. The topic sits at the intersection of biotechnology, agriculture, and climate change—all areas of ongoing importance.
