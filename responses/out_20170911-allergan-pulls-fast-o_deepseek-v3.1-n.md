# Allergan Pulls A Fast One (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes an unprecedented legal maneuver by pharmaceutical company Allergan to protect its blockbuster dry-eye drug Restasis (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion), which generated over $1 billion in annual revenues. The drug faced patent challenges from generic manufacturers Mylan and Teva through an inter partes review (IPR) process at the U.S. Patent Office—a mechanism established in 2011 specifically to challenge patents based on prior art.

In a move that surprised the industry, Allergan transferred its Restasis patent rights to the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Nation in exchange for upfront and ongoing payments. The tribe then invoked sovereign immunity to shield the patents from IPR challenges, as sovereign entities are protected from such administrative proceedings. The author expressed strong disapproval, calling the tactic "awful on several levels" and predicting it would damage the pharmaceutical industry's public image while undermining the patent system's integrity. The article noted that reversing this would require Congressional action, potentially drawing more scrutiny to drug pricing and patents during the 2018 midterm elections.

## 2. HISTORY

The sovereign immunity patent strategy proved short-lived and unsuccessful. In February 2018, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) rejected the sovereign immunity defense in the Restasis case, ruling that the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe could not shield the patents from review. The Federal Circuit upheld this decision later that year, establishing that tribal sovereign immunity does not apply to IPR proceedings.

For Restasis specifically, the patent challenges ultimately succeeded. Generic competition eventually entered the market, though Allergan maintained exclusivity longer than if the sovereign immunity strategy had never been attempted. The drug's market performance declined as generics became available, though it remained a significant product due to brand loyalty and formulary positioning.

The broader impact was that this high-profile case accelerated policy scrutiny. The maneuver generated widespread negative publicity and Congressional attention, contributing to ongoing debates about pharmaceutical patent strategies and drug pricing. However, no immediate legislative changes specifically targeting this tactic were enacted, as the courts had effectively resolved the issue by rejecting the immunity defense.

Allergan continued pursuing other strategies to protect its intellectual property portfolio, but the negative publicity from this episode contributed to the company's reputation challenges. The case became a frequently cited example in discussions about pharmaceutical patent evergreening and defensive legal strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: The sovereign immunity strategy would likely hold up legally**
- **Outcome**: **Incorrect**. Multiple courts, including the Federal Circuit, rejected the sovereign immunity defense in IPR proceedings. The legal precedent established that tribal sovereign immunity does not apply to administrative patent challenges.

**Prediction: This would become a widespread strategy, with many other tribes and companies pursuing similar deals**
- **Outcome**: **Incorrect**. The swift legal rejection of this strategy prevented widespread adoption. While the tribe's lawyer had expressed enthusiasm for more deals, the courts' clear stance made this an unviable business model.

**Prediction: The tactic would make the pharmaceutical industry look bad and draw Congressional attention to drug patents and pricing**
- **Outcome**: **Partially correct**. The maneuver did generate significant negative publicity and contributed to ongoing policy discussions about drug patents. However, it did not lead to immediate Congressional action or major legislative changes, as the court decisions resolved the specific legal issue. The broader concerns about drug pricing continued independently of this specific incident.

**Prediction: This would undermine the Hatch-Waxman framework for generic drug approval**
- **Outcome**: **Incorrect**. The Hatch-Waxman framework remained intact. The courts' rejection of sovereign immunity preserved the IPR system's role in balancing patent protection with generic competition access.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article describes a genuinely novel legal maneuver that captured industry and policy attention, though its practical impact was limited by swift judicial rejection. The case remains instructive for understanding patent strategy innovation and its limitations.
