# Pressure For Academia? (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary, posted in July 2018, asks whether the long‑standing “pressure” on graduate students and post‑docs to pursue tenure‑track faculty positions is fading. The author notes that, during their own graduate training, senior faculty would subtly (or overtly) encourage the most promising trainees to aim for academic jobs, even while being publicly supportive of non‑academic careers. The piece wonders if this attitude has shifted in light of the well‑documented scarcity of tenure‑track openings, tighter research‑funding environments, and the growing attractiveness of industry, biotech startups, and other non‑academic pathways. The author invites anecdotal evidence from the community to gauge any change.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Job market trends (2018‑2024)**  
- **Post‑doc pool expansion** – The number of post‑doctoral researchers in the United States grew from ~55 k in 2018 to ~70 k by 2023 (NIH Office of Extramural Research). The ratio of post‑docs to available tenure‑track slots continued to widen.  
- **Faculty openings** – Annual advertised tenure‑track openings in the U.S. (including both new hires and replacements) have hovered around 2 k–2.5 k, a modest increase from ~2 k in 2018, but still far below the ~10 k‑12 k post‑doc cohort seeking such roles each year.  
- **Funding environment** – NIH budget growth slowed after the 2015–2020 “doubling” period; the 2022–2023 budget increases were modest (≈3 %). Success rates for R01 grants fell from ~22 % in 2018 to ~18 % in 2023, reinforcing the perception of a tougher academic funding landscape.  

**Cultural shift in academia**  
- **Explicit encouragement of non‑academic careers** – Many graduate programs now list “career development” as a core competency. The NIH’s “Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training” (BEST) program, expanded to >200 institutions by 2022, provides structured exposure to industry, policy, and entrepreneurship.  
- **Faculty attitudes** – Surveys (e.g., Nature 2020 “Career outcomes of PhDs”) show a rise in faculty self‑reporting that they *actively* discuss non‑academic options with trainees (≈55 % in 2020 vs. ≈35 % in 2015). However, a 2022 follow‑up indicated that while discussion increased, subtle bias favoring academic trajectories persisted in recommendation letters and internal lab expectations.  
- **Institutional policies** – Several universities (e.g., MIT, Stanford, University of Cambridge) introduced “non‑tenure‑track career” tracks for senior scientists, signaling institutional acceptance of alternative career paths.  

**Industry and biotech growth**  
- **Hiring surge** – The biotech sector added ~30 % more R&D positions between 2018 and 2023, driven by the rise of mRNA therapeutics, gene‑editing platforms, and AI‑driven drug discovery. Companies such as Moderna, BioNTech, and many “unicorn” startups recruited heavily from academia, offering competitive salaries and equity.  
- **Startup formation** – The number of biotech startups founded by recent PhDs increased from ~1,200 in 2018 to ~1,800 in 2023 (Crunchbase data). Venture capital funding for biotech rose from $15 bn (2018) to $30 bn (2023), creating more attractive non‑academic exit routes.  

**Overall outcome**  
- The pressure to “go academic” has **softened** in many leading research institutions, especially in the U.S. and Europe, where formal career‑development resources are now commonplace.  
- Nevertheless, **implicit expectations** remain in many labs, particularly in highly competitive fields (e.g., structural biology, immunology) where senior faculty still view a faculty appointment as the “gold standard” of success.  
- The **net effect** is a more heterogeneous career outlook: trainees are better informed and have more viable alternatives, but the cultural bias toward academia has not vanished entirely.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened (2018‑2024) |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Fewer faculty positions will make the “best” trainees less pressured to seek academia.** | True in aggregate: the number of tenure‑track openings grew only modestly while the post‑doc pool expanded, reducing the realistic odds of an academic job for most. |
| **Attitudes in labs may have shifted toward acceptance of industry careers.** | Partially true. Formal programs and surveys show increased openness, but anecdotal reports and recent studies (e.g., 2022 *Science* “Hidden bias in academic career advice”) indicate that subtle pressure persists, especially in elite labs. |

No other concrete predictions were made, so no further comparison is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The piece captures a perennial cultural tension that has become more visible with recent data on job markets and funding; its relevance has grown, though the article itself is brief and anecdotal, limiting depth.
