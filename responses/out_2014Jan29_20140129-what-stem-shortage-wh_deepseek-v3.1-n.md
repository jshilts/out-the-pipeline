# Analysis of "What STEM Shortage? Where? How?" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine article presents a contrarian view challenging the widespread narrative of a STEM worker shortage in the United States. The author cites data showing declining employment for electrical engineers (down 10% in the previous year) and modest growth for software developers (only 1.75% increase), arguing that these numbers contradict claims of a crippling shortage. 

The article highlights the disconnect between industry leaders (PhRMA, Eli Lilly, Bayer, Mark Zuckerberg) and government advisors who consistently advocate for more STEM education and immigration, versus the employment reality on the ground. The piece raises the provocative question of whether the alleged shortage is actually a shortage of *cheap* skilled labor rather than skilled labor itself, pointing to H-1B visa usage and industry profit motives as potential drivers of the shortage narrative.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) revealed a much more complex and cyclical reality than either side initially presented:

**The Tech Boom (2014-2021):** Beginning around 2015, the technology sector experienced an unprecedented hiring surge. Software engineering salaries skyrocketed, with entry-level positions at major tech companies often exceeding \$150,000 in total compensation. The "shortage" narrative appeared validated as tech companies competed fiercely for talent, offering signing bonuses, stock options, and increasingly generous benefits.

**The Pandemic Acceleration (2020-2021):** COVID-19 accelerated digital transformation across all sectors, creating massive demand for software engineers, data scientists, and cybersecurity professionals. Remote work expanded the talent pool geographically but also intensified competition, with salaries reaching unprecedented levels.

**The Correction (2022-2023):** The tech sector experienced significant layoffs, with over 260,000 tech workers losing jobs in 2022-2023. Major companies including Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. Unemployment rates for software developers, while still relatively low compared to other fields, became less exceptional.

**The AI Revolution (2023-2024):** The emergence of large language models and generative AI created a new dimension to the STEM workforce conversation, potentially affecting both demand for certain skills and the nature of programming work itself.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**
- The article correctly identified that the "shortage" narrative was often self-serving for companies seeking to depress wages or access cheaper labor through visa programs
- It accurately noted that STEM employment conditions vary dramatically by field, with some specialties facing genuine shortages while others experienced oversupply
- The skepticism toward industry claims of shortage was prescient, particularly given the subsequent tech boom-and-bust cycles

**What the Article Got Wrong:**
- The piece significantly underestimated the tech hiring boom that began just 1-2 years after publication
- The argument that there was "no STEM shortage" was too absolute and didn't account for the dynamic, cyclical nature of tech labor markets
- The focus on electrical engineering's decline missed that software engineering was on the cusp of a historic expansion
- The implicit suggestion that the shortage was entirely fabricated overlooked genuine skill gaps that emerged in areas like cybersecurity, data science, and AI/ML

**More Nuanced Reality:** The truth was neither the industry's "crippling shortage" narrative nor the article's "no shortage whatsoever" position. Instead, the market proved to be highly cyclical, geographically uneven, and specialized by skill set, with genuine shortages in some areas coinciding with oversupply in others.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 8/9**

This article merits a high interest score (90-99th percentile) for several reasons:

The piece represents excellent contrarian journalism that challenged powerful narratives backed by industry and government interests. It asked exactly the right critical questions at exactly the right time, during a period when the STEM shortage narrative was largely unquestioned.

The article's central framing—"shortage of skilled labor vs. shortage of really cheap skilled labor"—has proven remarkably durable and relevant across multiple boom-bust cycles in tech. This economic lens on workforce discussions remains crucial for understanding contemporary debates about AI's impact on jobs, remote work, and immigration policy.

The 2014-2024 period it captured turned out to be one of the most dramatic in tech labor history, including an unprecedented boom, a global pandemic's acceleration of digital transformation, major layoffs, and now an AI revolution. The article serves as an excellent historical marker for a prescient skepticism that was both partially wrong in the short term but remarkably insightful in its deeper analysis of economic incentives driving workforce narratives.

The piece's methodology—combining employment data with skepticism toward industry motives—provides a template for critically examining current discussions about AI's impact on employment, where similar dynamics of corporate interest, political posturing, and genuine technological disruption are at play.
