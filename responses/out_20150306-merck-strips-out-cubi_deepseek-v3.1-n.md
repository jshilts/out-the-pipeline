# Merck Strips Out Cubist (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Merck's decision to eliminate Cubist Pharmaceuticals' entire early-stage drug discovery staff (120 employees) shortly after acquiring the antibiotic-focused company. Merck had purchased Cubist in late 2014 for approximately $9.5 billion, with executives publicly emphasizing their commitment to antibiotics research. However, by March 2015, Merck announced it was cutting Cubist's discovery organization entirely.

The piece references commentary from David Shlaes, an antibiotics expert, who expressed mixed feelings at the time of acquisition—optimistic about large pharma showing renewed interest in antibiotics but concerned about potential "synergies" that typically result in R&D cuts. The author suggests this move indicates Merck's acquisition was primarily about obtaining Cubist's existing drugs and pipeline assets rather than building long-term antibiotic discovery capabilities, comparing it unfavorably to Pfizer's earlier M&A strategy that ultimately weakened their R&D enterprise.

## 2. HISTORY

After the March 2015 cuts, Merck's antibiotic strategy evolved with several concrete developments:

**Cubist's Key Assets:**
- **Cubicin (daptomycin)** - This was Cubist's flagship antibiotic, already FDA-approved in 2003. It remained a significant revenue generator after the acquisition.
- **Zerbaxa (ceftolozane/tazobactam)** - FDA approved in December 2014, just before the acquisition. It became an important antibiotic for complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
- **Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate)** - FDA approved in June 2014, another asset in Cubist's portfolio that Merck retained.

**Subsequent Clinical and Regulatory Outcomes:**
- The "synergies" mentioned in the article did materialize through cost-cutting, but Merck maintained Cubist's marketed products and continued some late-stage development.
- In 2019, Merck announced it would discontinue research and early development efforts in antibiotics and focus instead on vaccines and oncology, confirming the pattern the article had identified years earlier.
- By 2020-2021, several major pharmaceutical companies (including Merck) reduced or exited antibiotic research, citing poor return on investment despite growing antimicrobial resistance threats.

**Broader Industry Context:**
- The antibiotics market continued to face economic challenges due to low drug prices, appropriate use protocols that limit prescriptions, and difficulties achieving profitable volume.
- Public health concerns about antimicrobial resistance grew significantly post-2015, with WHO declaring it a global health crisis.
- The "push-pull" incentive mechanisms for antibiotic development remained inadequate, with many smaller companies taking over antibiotic R&D from large pharma.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"Anyone who thought this might be about some sort of long-term commitment to antibiotic discovery, well, think again"** - **Accurate**: Merck's 2019 announcement to exit antibiotics research confirmed this was never about building long-term discovery capabilities.

• **"I would not be feeling good about the prospects for the whole Lexington site"** - **Partially accurate**: While Merck maintained some presence, the discovery focus was indeed eliminated and jobs continued to be consolidated, though not complete site closure immediately.

• **"This is about getting Cubist's existing drugs, back to some unspecified point in development, but the discovery work gets raked off into the compost pile"** - **Accurate**: Merck retained Cubist's marketed products (Cubicin, Zerbaxa, Sivextro) and some later-stage assets but eliminated discovery research, exactly as predicted.

• **"You have to wonder if Merck has decided to follow the 2000s-era Pfizer strategy of M&A... that's worked out so well for everyone"** - **Predictive insight**: The reference to Pfizer's M&A strategy that weakened their R&D capabilities proved prescient. Merck's later struggles with pipeline productivity and their eventual exit from antibiotics research in 2019 echoed this concern, though attributing causation is complex.

• **Implicit prediction that large pharma commitment to antibiotics would remain fragile** - **Accurate**: The broader trend of large pharma exiting antibiotics research continued through the late 2010s and 2020s, validating concerns about long-term commitment versus asset-stripping motives.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates strong analytical insight into pharmaceutical M&A dynamics and antibiotic R&D challenges, correctly identifying that the acquisition was about existing assets rather than discovery commitment. Its predictions about Merck's true motivations and the fate of antibiotic research programs proved largely accurate, making it a relevant historical case study in pharmaceutical industry consolidation and the structural problems facing antibiotic development.
