# Are Things Really Picking Up? (June 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes whether the pharmaceutical industry's recent increase in drug approvals represented a genuine turnaround from years of declining productivity. It examines a Nature Reviews Drug Discovery study that introduced the "vintage index"—measuring the ratio of first seven years' revenue from innovative drug launches to the corresponding R&D investment over the previous seven years. This metric showed drug approvals peaked in the mid-to-late 1990s, declined steadily, bottomed out around 2009-2011, then experienced a slight rise.

The study attributed roughly 45% of productivity improvement to slower growth and rationalization of R&D spending, with 55% coming from higher expected revenue from new launches. However, the authors cautioned that 70-90% of the revenue impact might stem from "forecast exuberance" rather than actual increases in drug launches. The recent uptick was also noted to be driven significantly by successes in anti-infectives (particularly HCV treatments). While acknowledging improvement, the article emphasized this only brought productivity back to levels that would have been considered poor before 2003, suggesting cautious optimism was warranted rather than celebration of a major turnaround.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated the article's cautious stance and provided more definitive answers to whether things were "really picking up."

**Continued Oncology Success:** The article's mention that "if recent clinical successes in oncology translate as they should" proved prescient. The period following 2015 saw substantial growth in oncology drug approvals, particularly with immunotherapies (checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab, nivolumab), CAR-T therapies, and targeted therapies showing continued clinical success and regulatory approval momentum.

**HCV Market Evolution:** The article's recognition of HCV drugs as drivers of the uptick was accurate but missed the market dynamics that followed. While HCV treatments like Harvoni and Sovaldi achieved massive revenue peaks shortly after 2015, the market quickly became saturated as patients were cured, leading to a revenue plateau and decline by 2017-2018, demonstrating that such blockbuster-driven booms can be transient.

**Regulatory Efficiency vs. Innovation:** The period 2015-2020 did see sustained higher FDA approval rates compared to the 2009-2011 trough, with 2018 and 2019 setting records for novel drug approvals. However, this coincided with ongoing industry consolidation and R&D restructuring, suggesting the efficiency gains mentioned in the article continued.

**Real R&D Productivity Debate:** The central question raised about whether improvements were "real" or driven by "forecast exuberance" remained relevant. While revenue forecasts for new launches continued to be optimistic, the actual number of innovative drug approvals did increase, though the debate continued about whether this represented genuine scientific advancement versus better project selection and regulatory optimization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction:** "If the recent clinical successes in oncology translate as they should, the industry may well see the sort of turnaround that can't be explained away."
**Outcome:** This prediction was largely accurate. Oncology did drive sustained industry growth post-2015 with immunotherapy breakthrough therapies like Keytruda (pembrolizumab) generating over $20 billion annually by the early 2020s, and CAR-T treatments achieving clinical and commercial success. The sector saw numerous FDA approvals and substantial revenue growth that contributed significantly to pharmaceutical industry performance.

**• Implicit Prediction:** The article questioned whether the vintage index rise represented real productivity gains versus "forecast exuberance" and temporary factors.
**Outcome:** Mixed results. While drug approval numbers remained elevated compared to the 2009-2011 trough, analysis of pharmaceutical industry R&D productivity continued to show complexity in measurement. Some studies confirmed genuine efficiency improvements while others noted that success rates and cost-effectiveness gains were more modest than hoped, with drug development costs still running $1-2+ billion per approved drug.

**• Implicit Concern:** The article noted that much of the apparent improvement could be attributed to HCV successes, which might be temporary.
**Outcome:** Accurate concern. The HCV market boom proved temporary as mentioned earlier, with revenue declines setting in by 2017-2018 as patient populations were treated and cured, validating the article's caution about celebrating a single therapeutic area's success as representing broad-based industry turnaround.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates strong analytical rigor in questioning pharmaceutical industry narratives at a pivotal moment, correctly identifying the need to distinguish between temporary market factors and genuine R&D productivity improvements. Its cautious, evidence-based approach and focus on methodology over hype makes it a valuable historical case study in industry trend analysis.
