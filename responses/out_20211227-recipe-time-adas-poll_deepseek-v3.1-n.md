# Recipe Time: Adas Pollo (December 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article presents a recipe for adas pollo, an Iranian dish combining rice and lentils, written from the perspective of someone who married into an Iranian family. The author emphasizes that this is one of many regional variations of the dish, noting similarities to Lebanese/Syrian mujadara, and acknowledges debates over ingredients like cumin. The recipe provides detailed instructions for Iranian-style rice preparation using basmati rice, including soaking, parboiling, and layering with pre-cooked lentils, whole cumin seeds, and optional saffron. A key focus is demystifying the tahdig—the prized crispy browned rice layer at the bottom of the pot—which the author insists is achievable with basic technique rather than mystical skill. The dish is completed with caramelized onions and raisins served on the side, and the author offers guidance on presentation options.
