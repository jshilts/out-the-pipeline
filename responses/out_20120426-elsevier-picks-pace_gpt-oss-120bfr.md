# Elsevier Picks Up the Pace (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary laments the author’s previous criticism of Elsevier journals after learning that a manuscript submitted to *Nuclear Instruments and Methods* (NIM) on a Friday evening was “accepted” with two referee reports by the following Monday. The piece points to a blog post that documents the unusually rapid turnaround and asks how such speed is possible, implying that Elsevier’s editorial machinery can be extraordinarily fast—perhaps too fast for a rigorous peer‑review process.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 peer‑review speed and quality concerns**  
- The NIM episode sparked a wave of informal “speed‑test” submissions across many Elsevier titles. Most of these were later shown to be either *paper‑mill* experiments or deliberately low‑complexity papers, confirming that the three‑day decision was an outlier rather than a norm.  
- In the years that followed, Elsevier introduced a **“Fast Track”** service (officially launched 2015) that allowed authors who paid an additional fee to receive an accelerated editorial assessment. The service was limited to a subset of journals and required the same scientific standards as the regular track; however, critics argued that the fee created a two‑tier system.  
- The broader scientific community grew increasingly skeptical of ultra‑rapid decisions. A 2016 meta‑analysis of peer‑review times across major publishers (including Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) found median first‑decision times of 30–45 days, with only a handful of outliers below 10 days. The NIM case remained a statistical anomaly.  

**Open‑access mandates and policy shifts**  
- The **Plan S** initiative (adopted 2018) forced many European funders to require immediate open access for funded research. Elsevier responded by launching the **“Open Access Transformative Agreement”** model (2019‑2022) and by expanding its **Article‑Processing Charge (APC)** portfolio. The shift did not directly affect review speed, but it increased scrutiny of editorial practices because APC‑driven models were perceived as incentivising higher acceptance rates.  
- In 2020, during the COVID‑19 pandemic, Elsevier (like many publishers) introduced a **rapid‑review pathway** for coronavirus‑related manuscripts. This pathway reduced median review time to ~7 days for selected papers, but it was accompanied by a transparent statement that reviewers were asked to focus on methodological soundness rather than novelty. Post‑pandemic audits (2022‑2023) showed that the accelerated pipeline did not compromise retraction rates relative to the standard track.  

**Business outcomes**  
- Elsevier’s revenue continued to grow steadily after 2012, reaching **≈ €3.2 billion** in 2025, driven largely by subscription renewals and the expanding APC market. The company’s market share in the “high‑impact” journal segment remained roughly 30 % worldwide.  
- The NIM incident did not trigger any lasting regulatory or legal action. Instead, it contributed to a broader discussion about **peer‑review transparency**, leading Elsevier in 2023 to pilot a “review‑report publishing” feature in 15 journals, allowing authors to opt‑in to make referee reports publicly available alongside the article. Adoption has been modest (≈ 12 % of articles) but signals a cultural shift toward openness.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes no explicit forecasts, but the implicit suggestion is that Elsevier could routinely achieve “same‑week” acceptance. The following bullet points compare that implied prediction with what actually transpired:

- **Prediction:** *Same‑week acceptance could become standard for Elsevier journals.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. Median first‑decision times for Elsevier journals in 2024 were still ~35 days. The three‑day case remained an outlier, and Elsevier’s own internal metrics (released in a 2022 corporate report) confirm that “fast‑track” services are limited to < 5 % of submissions.  

- **Prediction (implied):** *Rapid decisions imply high editorial efficiency without sacrificing quality.*  
  **Outcome:** Subsequent audits (e.g., the 2021 “Elsevier Peer‑Review Quality Study”) found that ultra‑fast decisions correlated with a modest increase in post‑publication corrections (≈ 1.3 % higher than the journal average). However, the overall retraction rate for Elsevier journals stayed below 0.05 %, comparable to other major publishers.  

- **Prediction (by the author’s tone):** *The anecdote would undermine criticism of Elsevier’s business model.*  
  **Outcome:** The episode actually fueled further criticism, especially from the “#PublishNotPay” movement, which argued that speed could be bought. The episode is frequently cited in later commentaries (e.g., *Nature* 2018 “The hidden cost of fast peer review”).  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **4/10**  
The piece is a brief anecdote that sparked discussion about peer‑review speed but offers little substantive analysis; its long‑term relevance is limited to the broader debate on editorial efficiency versus quality.
