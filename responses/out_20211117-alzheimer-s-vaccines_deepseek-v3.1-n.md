# Alzheimer's Vaccines? (Nov 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines two Alzheimer's vaccine candidates making news in late 2021. The author provides context about the long history of failed amyloid-targeting approaches in Alzheimer's treatment, noting that while several antibodies successfully cleared amyloid plaques from brains, none meaningfully improved patient outcomes, casting doubt on the amyloid hypothesis itself. 

The first candidate discussed uses a stabilized, truncated form of beta-amyloid targeting a pseudo-beta-hairpin structure, with promising mouse model results. The author cautiously supports trials while expressing deep skepticism. The second approach is a nasal vaccine called Protollin, derived from bacterial cell wall proteins, which works through innate immune system stimulation rather than direct amyloid targeting, offering potential advantages in avoiding antibody-related side effects. 

Both approaches represent rational long-shot attempts to finally succeed where decades of research and billions of dollars have failed, reflecting the desperate need for effective Alzheimer's treatments despite theoretical uncertainties.

## 2. HISTORY

**Lecanemab and Donanemab Breakthrough:** Several months after this article, in January 2023, Eisai/Biogen's lecanemab became the first amyloid-targeting antibody to demonstrate statistically significant cognitive benefits in a Phase 3 trial, with 27% slower decline over 18 months. In 2024, Eli Lilly's donanemab showed similar efficacy (35% slower decline in early-stage patients) and received FDA approval. These were the first drugs to definitively prove cognitive benefits through amyloid clearance.

**Treatment in Practice:** Following FDA approvals, both drugs entered clinical use but with significant limitations. They require frequent IV infusions, carry risks of brain swelling/bleeding (ARIA side effects), and demand extensive monitoring with MRI scans. Cost and access remain barriers, with insurers imposing restrictions. Generally, their modest benefits (slowing rather than reversing decline) have led to cautious adoption, with significant infrastructure requirements limiting widespread use.

**Vaccine Development:** None of the vaccine approaches discussed in the 2021 article have progressed to widespread clinical use or even late-stage trials. While some vaccine candidates likely remain in preclinical development, they have been overshadowed by the breakthrough success of monoclonal antibodies.

**Amyloid Hypothesis Status:** This 2021 article expressed deep skepticism about the amyloid hypothesis, reflecting widespread research community sentiment after decades of failures. The eventual success of lecanemab and donanemab somewhat vindicated targeting amyloid - but only partially, as the modest clinical benefits even while clearing large amounts of amyloid suggest amyloid is just one factor in Alzheimer's complex pathology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"If this one indeed doesn't work, that will be an especially heavy shovelful of dirt landing on the amyloid hypothesis"** - Partially accurate but complicated. Neither vaccine succeeded spectacularly or entered widespread use to our knowledge. However, the amyloid hypothesis received partial vindication in 2023-2024 when lecanemab and donanemab finally worked, albeit modestly. The prediction correctly identified that the field was approaching a critical test - what happened was the last conventional antibody attempts succeeded slightly, while vaccines stalled.

• **Implicit prediction of "we're in the dark about etiology" continuing** - Correct. Despite anti-amyloid drugs showing modest success, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, and the modest nature of benefits suggests amyloid is not the whole story.

• **Implicit prediction that current methods couldn't improve patient outcomes meaningfully** - Exceeded expectations. The 2021 article accurately captured the pessimistic consensus that amyloid approaches were futile based on all previous evidence. The eventual 27-35% slowing effects in 2023-2024, while modest, exceeded the "nothing works" baseline that had persisted for decades and represented real clinical progress.

• **General prediction about research direction maintaining same trajectories** - Partially accurate. The confidence that proper amyloid targeting would eventually work drove continued research, though vaccines weren't where success emerged - conventional monoclonal antibodies broke through instead.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This captures a moment of peak skepticism just before amyloid-targeting finally showed benefits, while vaccine approaches stalled as expected - moderately historically interesting for marking the field's last pessimistic phase before success arrived.
