# Easy Aziridines (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article celebrates a breakthrough in organic synthesis published in *Science* from researchers at UT-Southwestern and Brigham Young University. The authors reported a new rhodium-catalyzed method to synthesize aziridines—including the challenging NH-aziridines—in one step under mild conditions. The piece emphasizes that while synthetic chemistry can theoretically make almost any compound given unlimited resources (time, postdocs, money), practical constraints often hinder the development of broadly applicable, efficient routes. Before this work, most aziridine synthesis methods produced N-substituted variants (e.g., N-Boc, N-tosyl), with direct NH-aziridine formation remaining rare. The new method promised generality, mild conditions, and simplified access to this three-membered nitrogen heterocycle, potentially streamlining routes to natural products and enabling new chemistry around the aziridine motif.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2014 publication, the rhodium-catalyzed aziridination of alkenes sparked substantial follow-up research and practical adoption. The method was validated across diverse alkene substrates and applied in natural-product synthesis, enabling streamlined routes to compounds containing the aziridine ring. Academic groups expanded the substrate scope and explored mechanistic details, while industrial labs evaluated it for process chemistry. The reaction was integrated into medicinal-chemistry workflows to introduce the aziridine pharmacophore and as a synthetic handle for ring-opening chemistry.

The direct access to NH-aziridines also prompted new chemical explorations, including ring-opening reactions to generate diamines and amino alcohols, late-stage functionalizations, and cycloadditions. Broader advances followed in catalytic C–H amination and asymmetric aziridination, improving generality and selectivity. By the late 2010s, aziridine-forming reactions were routinely considered for retrosynthetic planning when that motif was present, and NH-aziridines became more commonly incorporated in screening libraries and lead-optimization campaigns.

A number of aziridine-containing drug candidates advanced into preclinical and clinical development, and approved aziridine-based oncology drugs already existed and continued to be used. The new method contributed to a wider appreciation of aziridines as versatile, drug-like building blocks and streamlined the synthesis of potential therapeutics, though attrition in drug development makes direct attribution of approvals to any single synthetic method difficult.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- The article predicted the method would simplify routes to natural products containing the aziridine motif.
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate. Several academic and industrial groups used variants of catalytic aziridination to streamline natural-product syntheses and medicinal-chemistry routes.

- It predicted that easier access to the aziridine functional group would prompt new chemistry.
  - **Outcome**: Correct. The wider availability of NH-aziridines fueled research into ring-opening reactions, cycloadditions, and late-stage functionalizations, expanding the synthetic toolbox.

- The piece anticipated the development of a mild, general method akin to epoxidation but for NH-aziridines.
  - **Outcome**: The Science paper largely delivered this, and follow-up efforts further broadened substrate scope and improved enantioselectivity, establishing catalytic aziridination as a more general and practical approach.

- No explicit timeline was given for widespread industrial adoption.
  - **Outcome**: Uptake evolved steadily in medicinal-chemistry settings, though process robustness and cost considerations led many industrial teams to weigh alternative methods where appropriate—consistent with typical technology adoption in synthetic chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**
This post highlighted a genuinely enabling synthetic method that expanded accessible chemical space and was widely validated in subsequent chemistry and medicinal chemistry. It addressed a practical bottleneck and led to measurable impact in synthesis planning and drug-discovery workflows.
