# Another Alzheimer's Antibody Fails. There Will Be More. (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY
This January 2019 commentary discusses the failure of another amyloid-targeting antibody for Alzheimer's disease. Roche announced it was discontinuing Phase III trials of crenezumab after an interim analysis showed futility, despite the drug having failed previously and being advanced based on subgroup analyses with higher doses in earlier-stage patients. The article notes that Roche was continuing with gantenerumab, another amyloid antibody that had also failed earlier trials, and mentions Biogen's similar predicament with aducanumab and BAN-2401. 

The author expresses strong skepticism about the amyloid hypothesis, noting the long history of anti-amyloid therapy failures despite various rationalizations about patient selection, dosing, and targeting specific amyloid forms. The piece also discusses AC Immune's amyloid vaccine work and tau-targeting programs as alternatives, and includes a reflection on how even excellent drug development (referencing Lilly's gamma-secretase inhibitor) cannot overcome an invalid biological hypothesis.

## 2. HISTORY

**What actually happened after this article was published:**

**Aducanumab (Biogen):** In March 2019, Biogen announced it was discontinuing two Phase III trials (ENGAGE and EMERGE) of aducanumab after futility analysis—directly validating the author's prediction. However, in a controversial reversal in October 2019, Biogen announced it would seek FDA approval after all, claiming a new analysis of a larger dataset showed efficacy in one trial. The FDA approved aducanumab (Aduhelm) in June 2021 under the accelerated approval pathway despite strong opposition from its advisory committee, where 10 of 11 members voted against approval, citing insufficient evidence of efficacy. The approval was highly controversial and led to resignations from the advisory committee. Medicare severely restricted coverage in 2022, requiring patients to be in clinical trials, effectively limiting access and commercial uptake of the drug.

**Lecanemab (BAN-2401):** The antibody mentioned by its research code BAN-2401 was developed by Eisai and Biogen under the accelerated approval pathway (as required by the FDA's Office of Inspector General). It received FDA accelerated approval in January 2023 and full approval in July 2023 based on the CLARITY AD trial showing modest cognitive benefit in early Alzheimer's patients. Unlike aducanumab, lecanemab showed clearer evidence of efficacy in its Phase III trial, though the clinical meaningfulness of its effects remains debated. By 2024, it had achieved significant patient uptake and broader insurance coverage compared to Aduhelm.

**Gantenerumab (Roche):** The article's skepticism about gantenerumab proved correct. In November 2022, Roche announced that two Phase III trials (GRADUATE I and II) of gantenerumab failed to meet their primary endpoints, showing no significant slowing of clinical decline, despite successfully reducing amyloid plaques. This marked another major failure for the amyloid hypothesis approach.

**Tau-Targeting Therapies:** The tau-targeting approaches mentioned (RG-6100 and others) have generally struggled. Multiple tau-targeting programs, including those by Biogen, Roche, and other companies, have failed in clinical trials or been discontinued, suggesting that tau hypothesis faces similar challenges to the amyloid approach.

**Donanemab:** In July 2024, Eli Lilly's donanemab received FDA approval, showing somewhat stronger efficacy than lecanemab but with concerning safety signals including brain swelling, microhemorrhages, and three treatment-related deaths in the trial. It represents another monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid, but questions remain about the magnitude of clinical benefit versus risks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several specific predictions:

• **Prediction 1:** "I don't think that aducanumab is going to work" - **Mostly accurate, with complications.** The drug failed its initial Phase III trials as predicted, but Biogen controversially resurrected it and obtained FDA approval. However, the clinical benefit remains questionable, Medicare coverage is severely restricted, and it has not achieved meaningful patient benefit in practice.

• **Prediction 2:** "I don't think that BAN-2401 is going to work, either" - **Partially inaccurate.** Lecanemab (BAN-2401) demonstrated modest but statistically significant efficacy in its Phase III trial, leading to full FDA approval and becoming a more accepted treatment than Aduhelm, though the clinical meaningfulness is still debated.

• **Prediction 3:** Implied prediction that gantenerumab would fail - **Correct.** Roche's gantenerumab failed both Phase III trials in 2022, exactly as the author's skepticism suggested.

• **Prediction 4:** General skepticism about anti-amyloid antibodies and the amyloid hypothesis - **Mixed accuracy.** While most anti-amyloid approaches have indeed failed (validating the general skepticism), lecanemab and donanemab have shown some efficacy, suggesting that the hypothesis isn't entirely wrong but yields modest benefits that don't fundamentally alter disease course.

• **Broader assessment:** The author's fundamental point that "Hey, you never know!' is not a business plan" proved prescient—even the "successful" anti-amyloid drugs have marginal clinical effects and significant safety concerns, supporting the argument that decades of investment in this approach haven't produced transformative treatments.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about the continued failures of anti-amyloid therapies while highlighting the persistent challenges facing Alzheimer's drug development. The predictions about specific drugs and the broader issues with the amyloid hypothesis make it a valuable case study in therapeutic development challenges.
