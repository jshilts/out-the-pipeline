# 2014 Chemistry Nobel Predictions (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's "2014 Chemistry Nobel Predictions" is a yearly speculation piece published as the Nobel season approaches. The article summarizes Thomson Reuters' official predictions for the Chemistry Prize: Tan/van Slyke for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), Moad/Rizzardo/Thang for RAFT (reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer) polymerization, and Kresge/Ryoo/Stucky for mesoporous materials. The author notes a materials-science emphasis in these picks, suggesting an intentional avoidance of biological topics for the Chemistry Prize. The article identifies several biological techniques likely to win Nobels but possibly awarded in Physiology/Medicine: nuclear receptors, CRISPR gene editing, optogenetics, contributions from Craig Venter for gene sequencing, and Bruce Ames for the Ames test. Other possibilities include single-molecule spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and a click-chemistry prize involving K. Barry Sharpless.

## 2. HISTORY

**2014 Chemistry Nobel**: The actual 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to **Eric Betzig**, **Stefan Hell**, and **William E. Moerner** "for the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy."

**Other predictions evaluated**:
We can trace subsequent developments for several candidates mentioned:

*   **CRISPR**: Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier received the **2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry** "for the development of a method for genome editing."
*   **Optogenetics**: The 2021 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award went to Karl Deisseroth, Peter Hegemann, and Dieter Oesterhelt "for the discovery of light-sensitive microbial proteins and their use in optogenetics."
*   **Click Chemistry**: K. Barry Sharpless, along with Carolyn R. Bertozzi and Morten Meldal, received the **2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry** "for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry."
*   **Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)**: While OLED technology has become enormously successful commercially (used in smartphones, TVs), no Nobel Prize has yet been awarded specifically for OLEDs.
*   **RAFT Polymerization**: This technique remains widely used in polymer chemistry but has not received a Nobel Prize.
*   **Gene Sequencing/Gene Synthesis/Venter**: While transformative, Venter's work on sequencing did not receive a Nobel.
*   **The Ames Test**: Despite its widespread adoption and utility in toxicology, the Ames test has not received a Nobel Prize.
*   **Single-Molecule Spectroscopy**: Super-resolution microscopy (Nobel 2014) is related but not identical to this broader field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article presents several predictions, both direct and implied:

*   **Prediction: The 2014 Chemistry Nobel Prize itself.** The article highlights predictions from an official source (Thomson Reuters) and adds its own speculation. **Outcome**: The actual winners for super-resolved fluorescence microscopy were not on the list of major contenders discussed in the article. The Thomson Reuters picks (OLEDs, RAFT, mesoporous materials) were incorrect for 2014.
*   **Prediction: "CRISPR gene editing technology is surely in line for one [Nobel]." Outcome: Accurate.** CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020, awarded to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier.
*   **Prediction: "Another surely-that-will-win technique is optogenetics, the photoswitchable gene regulation method that's being used all over biology." Outcome: Highly likely, but not yet confirmed.** While optogenetics has not won a Nobel Prize as of now (late 2024), its foundational importance was recognized by the 2021 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, a common precursor to the Nobel.
*   **Prediction: "Sharpless is still plausible as part of a click-chemistry/chemical biology sort of award." Outcome: Accurate.** K. Barry Sharpless was part of the trio awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2022 for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry.
*   **Implicit Prediction: A "materials-science drift" would mean no "that's-not-chemistry-that's-biology award." Outcome: This prediction for 2014 was mostly accurate in spirit.** The 2014 prize for super-resolved fluorescence microscopy was a method with physics and chemistry roots but with immense biological applications, occupying a similar interdisciplinary space. The specific biological targets (nuclear receptors, gene sequencing) were not recognized in chemistry in 2014, though.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article is moderately interesting. Its primary value lies in capturing a snapshot of scientific sentiment in 2014, correctly identifying several technologies (CRISPR, optogenetics, click chemistry) that were on a clear trajectory to become Nobel-worthy. However, its immediate predictions for the upcoming 2014 prize were incorrect, and as a yearly speculative piece, its long-term importance is limited.
