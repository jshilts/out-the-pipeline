# Pfizer Part Two: Cuts at Groton (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from February 2011 reported that Pfizer was cutting 1,100 jobs at its Groton, Connecticut headquarters while simultaneously shifting some therapeutic focus toward Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company announced it was completely exiting several therapeutic areas: allergy, urology, and respiratory diseases. The post questioned whether this would be the end of Pfizer's restructuring process, implying further cuts were likely to come.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2011 cuts at Groton were part of a broader, multi-year restructuring at Pfizer that accelerated significantly under CEO Ian Read, who took over in December 2010. The strategic shifts mentioned in the article proved part of a fundamental transformation that continued intensively over the next decade:

- In August 2011, Pfizer announced it would **shut down the entire Groton research site** (originally the headquarters mentioned in the article) completely, a far more drastic outcome than the initial 1,100 job cuts suggested. The company eventually sold the Groton campus in 2019, ending its decades-long presence there.

- Pfizer pursued an aggressive strategy of **disposing of non-core assets**. In 2013, they spun off their animal health business as Zoetis. In 2015, they acquired Hospira for $17 billion while simultaneously announcing a $11.85 billion deal to combine their generics business with Mylan (which created Viatris in 2020). In 2016, they sold their infusion systems business.

- The company **doubled down on oncology, inflammation/immunology, vaccines, and rare diseases** - the opposite direction from the discontinued areas mentioned in the article. Notable oncology successes included Ibrance (palbociclib), approved in 2015 for breast cancer, which became a blockbuster drug.

- Cambridge did indeed become "more Pfizer-y" as predicted. Pfizer established major research facilities in Cambridge's Kendall Square, making it their **global research headquarters** by 2014, employing over 1,200 people there.

- In **November 2020**, Pfizer (partnering with BioNTech) developed one of the first **COVID-19 vaccines**, which received FDA emergency use authorization and later full approval. This became one of the most widely-used vaccines globally and generated $81.3 billion in revenue for Pfizer in 2021-2022 combined.

- By 2021, Pfizer had successfully transformed into a more focused biopharmaceutical company, with a dramatically different therapeutic portfolio than in 2011.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: "Who out there can imagine that this is the end of the process?" - The author correctly predicted that the 2011 cuts were not the end.

- **Reality**: This prediction was remarkably accurate. The cuts were merely the beginning of a much larger restructuring that continued for years, including the complete closure of the Groton site mentioned in the article. The 2011 actions initiated a fundamental transformation of Pfizer's research operations and therapeutic focus that evolved through 2020 and beyond.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While this was a brief blog post rather than a detailed analysis, it captured the beginning of a major pharmaceutical industry transformation that proved highly consequential over the subsequent decade, including Pfizer's role in COVID-19 vaccine development. The skeptical question about whether cuts would continue demonstrated prescient insight.
