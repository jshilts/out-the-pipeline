# Health Care Reform and the Drug Industry: How Goes It? (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2011 commentary from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses the pharmaceutical industry's deal-making during the Affordable Care Act (ACA) negotiations and questions whether PhRMA (the industry trade group) was "thoroughly snookered." The article highlights concerns about the Obama administration's 2012 budget proposal to reduce biologics exclusivity from 12 years to 7 years—contrary to what the industry believed it had secured—and argues this revealed either bad faith or poor deal-making. It also emphasizes structural concerns: that ACA would expand Medicaid (which the author characterizes as having poor pricing and innovation incentives) while potentially degrading more profitable market segments. The piece quotes a National Review article by a former Pfizer VP and expresses worry that the drug industry had committed significant resources to support ACA's passage while getting unfavorable terms that might quickly unravel.

## 2. HISTORY

**Biologics Exclusivity Outcome:** The 12-year exclusivity provision for biologics survived. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted as part of the ACA, established 12 years of data exclusivity for biologics. Despite the 2011 budget proposal to reduce it to 7 years, the 12-year period remained law. The first biosimilars (generic biologics) faced delays in approval and market entry; the FDA approved the first biosimilar (Zarxio, a version of Neupogen) in 2015, but uptake was initially slow due to regulatory uncertainty and physician/patient reluctance.

**Medicaid Expansion:** The ACA expanded Medicaid to cover millions more Americans, which did increase government-mediated drug purchasing. However, Medicaid drug spending grew substantially post-ACA, and the program did cover some new therapies, though often subject to utilization management and prior authorization.

**Industry Performance Post-ACA:** The drug industry thrived in the years following ACA passage. Pharmaceutical revenues grew significantly from 2010–2020. The Medicare Part D "donut hole" closure—another ACA provision—increased drug utilization and manufacturer revenues in the program. Industry concerns about Medicaid pricing didn't prevent companies from launching drugs at historically high prices, leading to concerns about affordability nationwide.

**Supreme Court Challenges:** The ACA faced multiple Supreme Court challenges but largely survived, contrary to the author's speculation that commerce-clause arguments might void the law. However, the individual mandate was later effectively eliminated by Congress (2017), and some aspects of ACA implementation faced continued political opposition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction**: That 12-year biologics exclusivity would be reduced to 7 years via budget negotiations, constituting a "rather short time to be about-facing on this provision."

**Outcome**: Incorrect. The 12-year exclusivity remained intact and was codified in FDA practice.

**• Prediction**: The ACA would be "a loser for the drug industry" as it expanded Medicaid, which has the "worst pricing structure and the worst track record in paying for innovation."

**Outcome**: Partially incorrect. While Medicaid grew, drug industry revenues and profits rose substantially after ACA implementation, and the program did not halt innovation or reimbursement. Many expensive drugs were still developed and marketed despite Medicaid coverage.

**• Prediction**: "The whole health care reform bill is going to end up in the Supreme Court anyway, on commerce-clause grounds, so arguing about specific language may turn out to be a waste of time."

**Outcome**: Partially accurate. The ACA did go to the Supreme Court multiple times and faced legal challenges, but the law largely survived, and the biologics exclusivity provisions remained intact, so arguing specifics wasn't wasted effort.

**• Implicit Prediction**: That PhRMA made a "serious mistake" by supporting ACA; that a "backslapping deal-maker" (Billy Tauzin) wasn't the right negotiator because terms would quickly unravel.

**Outcome**: Largely incorrect. PhRMA's strategy—while drawing criticism—didn't produce disastrous outcomes for the industry. In many respects, ACA expanded drug market access and sales.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

The article captures real anxieties during the ACA implementation, and scrutinizing whether the biologics-exclusivity deal would hold is historically and policy-relevant. Many concerns voiced proved overstated, but the piece documents a consequential period in health policy and drug-industry relations that shaped subsequent biosimilar development and market dynamics.
