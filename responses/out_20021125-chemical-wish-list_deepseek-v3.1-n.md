# A Chemical Wish List (Nov 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a whimsical commentary by a drug discovery chemist lamenting the limitations of the periodic table. The author argues that while fluorine is invaluable in medicinal chemistry due to its small size and unique electronic properties (strong C-F bonds, metabolic stability, electron-withdrawing character), there are situations where an element with fluorine's compact dimensions but opposite, electron-donating behavior would be highly desirable. The piece explains that fluorine's electron-withdrawing nature drastically changes molecular properties—preventing metabolic breakdown by the liver, altering reactivity, and affecting protein binding. The author playfully suggests that if such a hypothetical small, electron-donating element existed, medicinal chemists would have powerful new tools to modulate drug-target interactions, particularly for compounds that failed when fluorinated.

## 2. HISTORY

The field has indeed pushed beyond simple fluorination strategies in the decades since 2002, though not through discovering new elements. Several developments addressed the author's underlying goal of fine-tuning molecular electronics:

**Isotopic and bioisosteric strategies evolved significantly.** Deuterium (²H) labeling gained traction as an approximately isosteric replacement for hydrogen that offers kinetic isotope effects—slowing metabolic oxidation at specific positions while maintaining overall size and shape. Deutetrabenazine (Austedo), approved in 2017 for Huntington's disease chorea, represents a clinical success of this approach. While deuterium is less electron-donating than hydrogen, it demonstrates the value of subtle atomic substitutions for metabolic stabilization.

**Heavier halogens and bioisosteres proliferated.** Bromine and iodine, though larger, served as more polarizable, electronically distinct alternatives. More importantly, chlorine emerged as a frequently used intermediate—smaller than fluorine with different electronic character, though still electron-withdrawing. Trifluoromethyl (–CF₃) and difluoromethoxy (–OCF₂H) groups became standard substructures in drug design, offering graduated electronic effects.

**The fluorination toolkit expanded dramatically.** Instead of new elements, chemists developed diverse fluorination reagents and late-stage functionalization methods, including electrochemical fluorination, photoredox-mediated C–F bond formation, and transition-metal-catalyzed processes. These innovations allowed more selective, practical installation of fluorine and fluorinated groups.

**Metabolic stability optimization through fluorination became widespread.** Hundreds of FDA-approved drugs now incorporate fluorine atoms strategically—examples include sofosbuvir (hepatitis C, 2013), sitagliptin (diabetes, 2006), and numerous kinase inhibitors. Fluorine's role in blocking oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes is routine in medicinal chemistry.

**No stable element smaller than fluorine with electron-donating character exists.** The hypothetical element described would violate quantum mechanical principles governing atomic structure. However, the pharmaceutical industry adapted by combining fluorination with other strategies: chiral centers, heterocycles, and conformational constraints that collectively tune electronic properties.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1**: Medicinal chemists would put this hypothetical element "on everything" and create compounds that would "puzzle enzymes and receptor binding sites."

**Outcome**: While no such element was discovered or created, medicinal chemists did develop diverse strategies to modulate protein-ligand interactions through other means: rational design of allosteric modulators, covalent inhibitors, molecular glues, and PROTACs. Fluorine itself, once exotic, became ubiquitous in drug discovery.

**Prediction 2**: "We spend a lot of time adjusting polar groups on our molecules to make them tuck into binding pockets more tightly - something like this would give us work to do for many years."

**Outcome**: Chemists spent those years developing other polarity-modulating tools: hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, halogen bonding interactions, ionic interactions, and sophisticated computational methods (free energy perturbation, quantum mechanical calculations). Structure-based drug design matured significantly, enabling precise electrostatic optimization.

**Prediction 3**: "For starters, I'd take all the compounds that got worse when I fluorinated them, and put this stuff on instead."

**Outcome**: The insight that fluorination can have detrimental effects led to nuanced understanding. Compounds fail due to poor pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or off-target binding—not just electronic mismatches. Deuterium, chlorine, and strategic de-fluorination became real-world alternatives.

**Prediction 4**: "Wouldn't it be good to have something that pours charge back into the system, but keeps that handy fluorine size?"

**Outcome**: No stable nucleophilic element of fluorine's size exists. However, the concept influenced research into hypervalent iodine compounds, temporary protecting groups, and reversible covalent chemistry as alternative strategies to modulate electronics.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article articulates a genuine medicinal chemistry challenge with wit and technical accuracy, correctly anticipating that fine control over molecular electronics matters critically for drug design. However, the wish for a new element was fundamentally quixotic given physical constraints.
