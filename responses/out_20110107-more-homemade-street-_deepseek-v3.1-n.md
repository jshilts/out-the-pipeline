# More On Homemade Street Drugs (January 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article responds to a follow-up piece in *Nature News* by Purdue researcher David Nichols, who expressed deep distress that his published research on CNS (central nervous system) compounds was being exploited by underground chemists in Europe to create and sell unregulated "designer drugs." Nichols emphasized that academic research compounds are never tested for human safety, and he voiced concern that widespread use of these substances could lead to delayed, irreversible toxicity—for example, kidney damage—emerging only after millions of users had been exposed. The author (Derek Lowe) supports Nichols, acknowledging the real risk of serious public harm akin to the MPTP incident (which caused permanent Parkinsonism) and condemning the "horrifying and stupid disregard for human life" shown by illicit manufacturers. The author reassures Nichols that he bears no culpability, as he is acting responsibly while others are acting as "scum."

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns expressed in this 2011 article were prescient and were substantiated by subsequent developments, most notably the **synthetic cannabinoid and cathinone ("bath salts") epidemic** that peaked in 2010–2015. The "laboratory-adept entrepreneurs" explicitly targeting the legal gray area by modifying molecules faster than laws could keep up led to widespread public health crises.

In response, concrete policy actions were taken. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began aggressively using **emergency scheduling powers** to temporarily control new substances (e.g., numerous JWH-series synthetic cannabinoids and mephedrone). This culminated in the landmark **Federal Analog Act amendments** through the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act (part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012), which explicitly banned whole classes of synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones. Many U.S. states and European countries enacted similar or even stricter blanket bans on entire chemical families.

The prediction of delayed, severe toxicity came true. The period saw thousands of documented emergency-room visits and numerous deaths attributed to acute toxicity, hyperthermia, psychosis, and violent behavior induced by these substances. Critically, a pattern of **chronic kidney injury** was reported among long-term users of synthetic cannabinoids, validating Nichols' fear of irreversible organ damage. Other long-term sequelae included cardiovascular events, seizures, and a growing recognition of severe withdrawal syndromes and dependency. The "Spice" and "K2" products became notorious, and despite legal crackdowns, manufacturers continued to innovate, creating an ongoing cat-and-mouse game with regulators that persists to this day.

The business model for these street drugs shifted towards international supply chains, often originating from labs in China, and evolved to include highly potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl analogs, leading to a new, even more devastating wave of the overdose crisis. David Nichols remained a prominent voice in the ethics and policy debates surrounding academic chemistry's unintended consequences.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article and Nichols' commentary contained several explicit or implicit predictions:

-   **Prediction:** "What if a substance ... marketed and becomes wildly popular ... but then millions of users develop an unusual type of kidney damage that proves irreversible..."
    -   **Outcome:** **Accurate.** Widespread kidney injury, among other chronic health problems, was documented in users of the very types of synthetic cannabinoids that became prevalent after this article was published.


-   **Prediction (Explicit):** "All we need is a side effect like that [MPTP], which comes on a bit more slowly, and there you'd have it."
    -   **Outcome:** **Accurate.** While no catastrophe on the exact scale of MPTP occurred, the principle was proven correct: significant delayed and chronic harms (kidney damage, severe psychiatric sequelae, dependency) emerged from mass consumption of these poorly characterized compounds.


-   **Prediction (Implicit):** The legal and ethical framework around new psychoactive substances was (and would remain) a significant problem.
    -   **Outcome:** **Accurate.** This initiated a global legislative and regulatory struggle. While laws were passed to curb the sale of specific compounds and classes, the core issue of rapid molecular innovation outpacing legal schedules has continued, evolving into the current crisis with nitazene opioids and other novel synthetic drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article is of high interest because it captured a prescient and well-reasoned expert concern at the outset of a major public health crisis, accurately predicting the specific type of delayed, irreversible harm that would later become clinically and epidemiologically significant. Its interest is amplified by its direct personal testimony from a key researcher and its concise summary of a complex collision between academic freedom, law, and corporate/illicit enterprise.
