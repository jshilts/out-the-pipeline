# It Doesn't Repeat? Who's Interested? (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a failed replication study challenging a controversial 2012 Cell Research paper by Chen-Yu Zhang's group at Nanjing University. The original study claimed that micro-RNAs (miRNAs) from ingested rice could be absorbed into rodent circulation and regulate gene expression in the animals - a potentially groundbreaking finding that would open possibilities for oral RNA therapies and have significant implications for both nutrition and transgenic crops.

The replication attempt, conducted by researchers from miRagen Therapeutics and Monsanto and published in Nature Biotechnology, found no evidence supporting the original claims. They could not detect rice miRNAs in mouse tissues and concluded that gene expression changes observed in the original study were likely due to dietary changes rather than miRNA uptake.

Lowe also criticizes publishing practices, noting that Cell Research (part of Nature Publishing Group) initially rejected the negative replication study because it was "hard to publish negative results." He praises Nature Biotechnology for being willing to publish replication studies and emphasizes the fundamental importance of reproducibility in science.

## 2. HISTORY

The controversy around cross-kingdom miRNA uptake and dietary RNA effects played out over several years with mostly negative outcomes:

**Scientific Replication Attempts**: Multiple research groups attempted to replicate Zhang's findings between 2013-2016. The vast majority of these attempts failed to detect any significant uptake of plant miRNAs in mammalian tissues or evidence of cross-kingdom gene regulation.

**miRagen Therapeutics Status**: The company remained active in RNA therapeutics but shifted its focus. miRagen went public in 2016 and continued development of microRNA-targeting therapies, including treatments for fibrosis and cardiovascular disease. However, the company faced clinical setbacks and was acquired by Viridian Therapeutics in 2020 for approximately $23 million - a modest outcome that reflected the challenging path for RNA therapeutics development.

**Research Trend**: The broader scientific consensus moved strongly against the cross-kingdom miRNA hypothesis. Most subsequent reviews and meta-analyses concluded that plant miRNAs are either not absorbed or present at biologically insignificant levels in mammals.

**No Therapeutic Applications**: Despite the initial excitement about oral RNA delivery, no therapeutic applications based on cross-kingdom miRNA uptake emerged from this research area. RNA therapeutics development proceeded along other pathways (modified oligonucleotides, lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery).

**GMO Debate Impact**: The findings had minimal concrete impact on GMO policy debates. Regulatory frameworks for transgenic crops continued to focus on protein safety rather than potential RNA effects. No new regulatory requirements specifically addressing cross-kingdom RNA effects were implemented.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions about future events were made in the article. The author did express strong opinions about publishing practices and the importance of reproducibility, but these were normative statements about scientific practice rather than predictions about specific future outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6**

This article addresses an important topic in scientific reproducibility and a controversial area of research, though the specific cross-kingdom miRNA hypothesis proved to be a scientific dead end. The broader themes - challenges in publishing negative results and maintaining rigorous replication standards - remain highly relevant to scientific practice.
