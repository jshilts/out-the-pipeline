# Sticking It to Proteins (Nov 2008)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2008 commentary discusses covalent enzyme inhibitors—drugs that form permanent chemical bonds with their protein targets rather than just binding reversibly. The author explains that while nanomolar potency is desirable for most drugs, covalent inhibitors can achieve far tighter binding through irreversible bond formation, often showing time-dependent inhibition where binding improves over time. 

The article notes that covalent drugs already existed but were viewed cautiously, falling into three categories: antibiotics like penicillins (which target bacterial enzymes), gut-restricted drugs like the obesity drug Alli (orlistat), and toxic oncology drugs used as last resorts. The nervousness around covalent inhibitors stemmed from fears that reactive functional groups might damage non-target proteins or that drug-protein adducts might trigger immune responses. However, the author suggests that as understanding of selective covalent chemistry improves—such as work by the Cravatt lab at Scripps on which functional groups react with specific proteins—covalent inhibitors might make a "comeback" through selective compounds that only react when perfectly positioned in the target active site.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this article's publication in 2008, covalent inhibitors did indeed make a significant comeback in drug discovery, particularly in oncology and inflammation. Three major FDA approvals demonstrated this shift:

**Ibrutinib (Imbruvica)** - Approved in 2013 for various B-cell malignancies, this Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor uses a covalent Michael acceptor to target a specific cysteine residue. Unlike the older "last resort" covalent cancer drugs mentioned in the article, ibrutinib shows good selectivity and became widely used, generating billions in annual revenue.

**Afatinib (Gilotrif)** - Approved in 2013 for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, this covalent inhibitor targets specific EGFR mutations more effectively than earlier reversible inhibitors like gefitinib, addressing resistance mechanisms.

**Osimertinib (Tagrisso)** - Approved in 2015 for EGFR T790M-mutant lung cancer, this third-generation covalent EGFR inhibitor successfully overcame resistance to earlier therapies and became a first-line treatment option.

The strategic evolution was significant: rather than avoiding covalency, companies began designing selective covalent inhibitors that target specific cysteine residues unique to the intended protein, minimizing off-target effects. This represented a fundamental shift in drug discovery philosophy from the cautious tone of 2008.

However, the broader success was most pronounced in kinase inhibitors and oncology—the Cravatt lab's activity-based protein profiling work did advance, but covalent drug development concentrated primarily in therapeutic areas where high potency and overcoming drug resistance were paramount.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Covalency could make a comeback"** ✓ **CORRECT** - This prediction proved accurate. Starting around 2010-2012, major pharmaceutical companies actively pursued covalent inhibitors, leading to multiple FDA approvals (ibrutinib, afatinib, osimertinib, acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, neratinib) that achieved widespread patient use and significant market success, particularly in oncology.

• **"As we get a better handle on this sort of thing" regarding selectivity** ✓ **CORRECT** - The mechanism-based selectivity approach succeeded. Drug developers learned to target specific cysteine residues found only in the intended proteins, enabling covalent inhibitor design with acceptable safety profiles rather than the broad reactivity feared in 2008.

• **Concerns about immune responses from protein-drug adducts** ⚠️ **MIXED** - While immunogenicity remains a theoretical concern for covalent drugs, in practice this has not proven to be a major barrier for the approved covalent kinase inhibitors, which have achieved widespread clinical use without triggering significant immune responses in most patients.

• **The article's cautionary tone about toxicity** ✗ **OVERSTATED** - The prediction that covalent inhibitors might remain limited to last-resort toxic drugs proved too pessimistic. Instead, selective covalent inhibitors entered first-line therapy and achieved good safety profiles, representing a more optimistic outcome than suggested.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a turning point in drug discovery philosophy just before covalent inhibitors achieved major therapeutic breakthroughs, making it historically significant for understanding the evolution from avoidance to strategic adoption of covalent mechanisms in pharmaceuticals.
