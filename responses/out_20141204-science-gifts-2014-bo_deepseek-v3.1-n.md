# Science Gifts 2014: Books on Drug Discovery and Medicinal Chemistry (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief holiday gift guide from December 2014 offers a curated list of books for medicinal chemists and drug discovery scientists. It categorizes 25+ recommended titles across several subfields: general histories of the field; broad medicinal chemistry; process chemistry and scale-up; case histories of successful drug projects; specialized topics including enzyme inhibitors, bioisosteres, scaffold hopping, and protein-protein interactions; resources for chemists learning biology and pharmacology; pharmacokinetics/ADME and toxicology; and career guidance for academics moving into industry. The recommendations build on a prior year's list and incorporate reader suggestions.

## 2. HISTORY

Between 2015 and the present, drug discovery and medicinal chemistry continued to evolve at a rapid pace, with notable shifts toward targeted therapies, biologics, immuno-oncology, and later mRNA vaccines; however, small-molecule drug discovery remains central to the industry.

- The core principles these books described—lead optimization, ADME/Tox assessment, structure–activity relationships, and process chemistry—remain foundational. The scientific practices have since incorporated generative chemistry/AI tools (e.g., AlphaFold, generative models), new modalities (PROTACs, molecular glues, antibody–drug conjugates), and broader adoption of structure-based and fragment-based design.
- In drug approvals after 2014, small molecules still comprised a majority of new drugs. For example, kinase inhibitors continued to be approved in oncology, and treatments for rare diseases and CNS conditions often rely on small molecules (e.g., entrectinib, cenobamate, risdiplam). Immuno-oncology drugs (largely biologics) became dominant in oncology starting around 2015–2016.
- Real-world uptake: Oral small-molecule kinase inhibitors (e.g., ibrutinib, osimertinib) achieved broad clinical adoption and remain standard of care. CAR-T and antibody drug conjugate approvals expanded in the late 2010s. Process chemistry advancements enabled commercial-scale production of complex small molecules.
- Business trends included consolidation among publishers of scientific texts (e.g., Wiley, Elsevier, Springer imprints continued these titles). Open access and preprint servers grew, but specialized reference books remained relevant for training and rapid lookup, including many of the titles highlighted.
- Many recommended authors continued publishing new editions and related works after 2014. For example, Corey co-authored further methodological texts, Kerns and Di released a follow-up ADME book, and practitioners continued citing Wermuth, Silverman, and Patrick for training new medicinal chemists.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- The article made no explicit predictions about the future of drug discovery. It was a curated gift list offering recommendations across subfields without forecasting new technologies or clinical outcomes. Some titles pointed to ongoing challenges (e.g., CNS drugs, ADME optimization, protein–protein interactions), which remained active research areas, but the blog post itself did not make forward-looking claims.

## 4. INTEREST

2 (20–29th percentile)

This is a practical gift guide rather than a commentary on the biotech industry's trajectory. It provides a useful snapshot of reference texts valued by medicinal chemists in 2014 but does not offer substantive claims, predictions, or analysis suitable for hindsight evaluation.
