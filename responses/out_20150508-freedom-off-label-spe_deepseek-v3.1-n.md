# Freedom of Off-Label Speech (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This May 2015 article discusses the legal landscape surrounding pharmaceutical companies' ability to promote drugs for off-label uses (uses not approved by the FDA). Three years prior, a Federal appeals court had ruled that restricting off-label promotion violated free speech protections under the Constitution. The FDA did not challenge this decision, and the pharmaceutical industry subsequently lobbied for revised guidelines since the ruling only applied to three states. At the time of writing, Amarin had just filed a lawsuit seeking to establish that FDA prohibitions on off-label promotion violated the company's First Amendment rights, specifically for conveying "truthful and non-misleading" information to physicians. The author predicted the FDA would likely lose this legal battle, which would fundamentally shift the regulatory landscape.

## 2. HISTORY

The legal developments following this article fundamentally transformed pharmaceutical marketing regulations:

**Amarin Lawsuit Outcome (2015-2016):** In August 2015, just months after this article, a federal judge granted Amarin a preliminary injunction, allowing the company to engage in off-label promotion of its fish-oil drug Vascepa. The court ruled that the company could present truthful, non-misleading information about off-label uses to physicians. This was a significant victory for the pharmaceutical industry.

**FDA Policy Evolution (2016-2020s):** Rather than continuing to fight through the courts, the FDA shifted its regulatory approach. In 2017, the agency issued guidance documents acknowledging that certain types of off-label communications could be permissible under specific circumstances. The Biden administration later withdrew some Trump-era rules that had further relaxed these restrictions, creating a more nuanced regulatory framework.

**Practical Impact:** The Amarin decision and subsequent FDA guidance created a pathway for pharmaceutical companies to engage in off-label promotion when information is truthful and non-misleading. Many companies adopted internal compliance programs to navigate these regulations. However, the actual permissible scope remains legally complex and context-dependent.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "the FDA seems to have lost a few decisions in this area already, and I'm betting that they'll lose this one, too"**
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Correct.** The FDA did lose the Amarin case in 2015 when the court granted the preliminary injunction.

**Prediction: "If they do, then we'll have a pretty lively time of it, sorting out what can and can't be said, but the 'can' side will be on top"**
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Partially correct.** The "can" side did achieve significant legal victories, fundamentally altering the regulatory landscape. The legal framework did become more complex, but the overall trend moved toward greater freedom of off-label communication under specific conditions.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical regulation that has had lasting legal and commercial implications. The intersection of constitutional law, regulatory policy, and medical practice makes this historically significant.
