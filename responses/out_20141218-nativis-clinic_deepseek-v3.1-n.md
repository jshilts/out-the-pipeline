# Nativis In the Clinic (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
Science magazine writer Derek Lowe reported that Nativis Pharmaceuticals was advancing to human clinical trials for glioblastoma using a device called "Voyager." The company claimed this device could record and play back radio signatures of drug solutions to produce therapeutic effects without administering the actual drug. Nativis had previously developed the technology for veterinary use and had sent Lowe a legal threat letter years earlier regarding his critical coverage. The company had recently published a paper claiming successful effects on tubulin polymerization assays using radio signatures of taxane solutions, though Lowe noted this appeared in a questionable open-access journal (SCIRP) with a poor reputation for scientific quality. Nativis was reportedly raising private investment ahead of the clinical trial.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent years revealed a story of regulatory failure and ultimate collapse. Nativis proceeded with their Phase I glioblastoma trial (NCT02296580) but terminated it prematurely—the trial was officially stopped, and when the FDA later audited Nativis's records, they found serious violations that prevented any reliable conclusions from being drawn.

The company faced escalating scrutiny. In 2016, the FDA issued a Warning Letter documenting that Nativis had violated clinical trial protocols and failed to maintain proper records. The agency also placed clinical holds on their studies. Importantly, the FDA explicitly informed Nativis that the "Voyager" device required formal FDA approval as a medical device, which the company did not have.

By 2018, the story reached its conclusion when the SEC charged Nativis and its CEO with fraud. The SEC's complaint detailed that the company had raised money by telling investors their device was FDA-approved for clinical trials, when in fact it was not. The regulator documented millions raised from investors based on false claims about FDA approval and about having human trial data showing tumor reduction—data that did not exist. Federal courts ultimately ruled against the company in investor lawsuits, and Nativis effectively ceased operations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Trial completion and results**: Lowe expressed interest in seeing if the trial would get off the ground and awaited results with "more than average interest." The trial did proceed but was terminated early, and no valid therapeutic results were obtained.
- **Scientific validation**: Implicit skepticism about the underlying radio-signature technology was warranted—no peer-reviewed validation emerged, and the approach was never adopted scientifically.
- **Commercial viability**: Though Lowe didn't make explicit predictions, the company's investor fraud suggests the business model was fundamentally flawed and unsustainable.

## 4. INTEREST
Score: 7

This case represents an important real-world example of how implausible medical claims can advance into human trials, particularly when oversight gaps exist. It illustrates the system's vulnerability to pseudoscientific claims and demonstrates the critical role of regulatory enforcement in protecting patients and investors.
