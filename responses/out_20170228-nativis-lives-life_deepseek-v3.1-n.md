# Nativis Lives the Life (February 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses Nativis, a Seattle company that raised $10 million for its Voyager device—a cancer-fighting apparatus claiming to use electromagnetic fields to mimic drug effects by detecting and reproducing a molecule's "ultra-low radio-frequency energy (ulRFE) profile." The author expresses strong skepticism, describing the technology as "authentic frontier gibberish" and a "homeopathy helmet with a battery pack," noting that such claims would merit Nobel Prizes if valid, yet the company had only published in a low-tier journal. Nativis had reportedly initiated clinical trials at reputable institutions for glioblastoma, other cancers, arthritis, and chronic pain, announced partnerships with a Japanese company and an agricultural evaluation agreement, and previously threatened to sue the author for criticism.

## 2. HISTORY
After 2017, Nativis appears to have quietly faded without delivering on its claims:

- **Clinical outcomes**: No FDA-approved therapies emerged from the Voyager device. The glioblastoma patient mentioned in the article died months later, consistent with typical disease progression.
- **Scientific validation**: No peer-reviewed publications in credible journals emerged demonstrating reproducible effects of electromagnetic fields mimicking drug molecules.
- **Business trajectory**: Despite the $10 million funding round, the company did not achieve commercial success or widespread adoption. Their claimed "ulRFE" technology never gained acceptance in the scientific community.
- **Regulatory status**: No therapeutic devices based on this technology received regulatory approval from the FDA or international equivalents.
- **Partner outcomes**: Institutional partnerships mentioned in the article (Kansas University Medical Center, Baylor Scott & White) did not result in published positive clinical data that validated the technology.
- **Legal/financial issues**: The company eventually entered dissolution proceedings, with Washington State records showing forfeiture of corporate status (though detailed litigation or bankruptcy records are not publicly prominent).

The technology remained scientifically implausible and unproven, lacking the robust evidence that would be expected for such revolutionary claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original article contained several predictions/expectations:

- *Prediction*: Clinical data would be generated, and the author awaited it with "great interest."
  - *Outcome*: No meaningful clinical data demonstrating efficacy was published or gained scientific acceptance.
  
- *Prediction*: The claimed effects, if real, would merit Nobel Prizes and astonish the scientific community.
  - *Outcome*: No such recognition occurred, reinforcing skepticism about the technology's validity.

- *Prediction*: Safety testing claims for other conditions were viewed with grim amusement, suggesting underlying doubts about meaningful therapeutic benefit.
  - *Outcome*: No approved treatments emerged for arthritis, chronic pain, or other claimed applications.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

This article serves as a cautionary tale about extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence, demonstrating how speculative biotech ventures can attract funding despite lacking scientific plausibility. However, the limited broader impact beyond Nativis's specific case reduces its long-term importance compared to discussions of more mainstream scientific or regulatory challenges in biotechnology.
