# Gonna Focus on Re-Engineering the Tools for the Process (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2011 blog post criticizes an interview with NIH Director Francis Collins published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. The article summarizes Collins' concern about a central paradox: while scientific discoveries about the molecular basis of disease were accelerating, the pharmaceutical industry was experiencing declining R&D productivity, with fewer new molecular entities being approved despite increased private investment. Pharmaceutical companies were cutting back on research investments due to high costs and failure rates, while the biotech sector faced reduced venture capital funding.

Collins proposed that the NIH should increase its involvement in the drug development pipeline through "non-traditional ways," emphasizing the need to "re-engineer the process" with "more focus on the front end." The blog author finds Collins' language vague and lacking concrete details, comparing his statements to "wobbling gelatin" and noting the absence of a clear action plan, despite Collins' promise to identify ways to create a "more seamless enterprise" over the following year. The post concludes by acknowledging the interview predated the official announcement of NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences).

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2011 article, Francis Collins did indeed establish the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) in 2011, which became operational in 2012. NCATS was created specifically to address the "translational gap" between basic scientific discoveries and effective medicines that Collins had alluded to.

**Concrete developments include:**

- **NCATS programs launched**: The center initiated several programs including the **Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA)** program, **Tissue Chip for Drug Screening** program (partnering with DARPA and FDA), and **Discovering New Therapeutic Uses for Existing Molecules** program (working with pharmaceutical companies to repurpose shelved compounds).

- **Mixed results on drug development impact**: While NCATS has funded numerous translational projects, independent analyses show limited evidence of substantially increased drug approval rates attributable to NCATS programs. The CTSA program has supported clinical research infrastructure at academic medical centers, but the return on investment for specific drug development remains debated.

- **Pharmaceutical industry trends continued**: The decline in pharmaceutical R&D productivity that Collins cited persisted through the early 2010s, with the number of FDA novel drug approvals remaining relatively flat from 2011-2015 (typically 20-30 per year), though approvals increased significantly after 2015 (peaking at 59 in 2018).

- **Venture capital landscape**: Biotech venture funding recovered substantially after 2011, with investments growing from approximately $4 billion annually in 2011-2012 to over $15 billion by 2018, though this growth occurred largely independent of NIH initiatives.

- **No major policy transformations**: The fundamental structure of drug development did not undergo the radical "re-engineering" Collins suggested, though NCATS did create new funding mechanisms for translational research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained minimal explicit predictions, focusing instead on critiquing Collins' vague language:

- **Implied prediction by Collins**: That a "non-traditional" NIH role would improve drug development success rates and create a "seamless enterprise" for translation.

**Actual outcomes**:
- NCATS was indeed created as the non-traditional NIH approach, but its impact on drug approval rates remains unclear and debated within the research community.

- **Author's implicit prediction**: That Collins' vague statements lacked concrete substance and meaningful content.

**Actual outcomes**:
- Collins did eventually launch a concrete initiative (NCATS), but the center's programs have faced ongoing criticism for similar "soft-focus" strategic ambiguity that the original blog post identified.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 3/10**

This article represents a sector-specific critique of NIH translational medicine policy, with modest long-term importance as it captured early skepticism toward what became NCATS, but it lacks broader scientific or societal impact.
