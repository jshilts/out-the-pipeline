# Not On the Same Page (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques a ChemBioChem paper from six German academic groups studying phosphatase inhibitors. The researchers investigated synthetic analogs of natural products (stevastelins, roseophilin, prodigiosin) and screened a 20,000-compound library against several phosphatases including Cdc25a, PTP1B, and MptpA—all mentioned as legitimate drug targets.

The author's core complaint is that the paper presents weak micromolar potency compounds (10-30 μM) as "pronounced selectivity" and viable drug development starting points, when such results would be discarded in pharmaceutical industry screening. The academic researchers suggest that evolutionarily selected natural products are "biologically prevalidated" starting points, but the author argues that 100 million years of evolution yielding only micromolar activity suggests poor prospects for improvement through limited analog synthesis. The author sees this as emblematic of a disconnect between academic research and the practical realities of drug discovery, where such modest results wouldn't justify project initiation.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments have largely validated the author's skepticism about phosphatase inhibitor drug development, though perhaps not entirely in the way envisioned in 2005.

**PTP1B inhibitors**: Despite being a highly pursued target for diabetes and obesity, PTP1B inhibitor development has faced significant challenges. The difficulty stemmed from achieving both potency and selectivity while addressing the charged active site. After 2005, multiple companies advanced PTP1B inhibitors into clinical trials, but most failed due to lack of efficacy or toxicity. No PTP1B inhibitor has received FDA approval as of 2024. Several programs were discontinued after Phase II trials, validating concerns about translating biochemical activity into viable drugs.

**Cdc25 phosphatases**: Cdc25 remains an oncology target, but inhibitor development has been challenging due to selectivity issues and the complex role of these phosphatases in cell cycle regulation. While academic research continued, no Cdc25-targeting drugs reached FDA approval, though some remained in early clinical development.

**Natural product drug discovery**: The broader trend in drug discovery moved away from natural product screening toward more rational design approaches, fragment-based drug discovery, and DNA-encoded libraries. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries increasingly recognized that "druggability" required more stringent criteria than academic publications sometimes acknowledged.

**Industry-academic collaboration evolution**: The gap identified in the article led to more structured partnerships, with pharmaceutical companies establishing more explicit criteria for academic drug discovery collaborations, often involving milestone-based funding tied to achieving specific potency, selectivity, and ADME criteria.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**The author's implicit predictions about the paper's drug discovery prospects:**

• **Prediction**: That the micromolar compounds (10-15 μM) were too weak to be viable starting points and would fail to progress to useful drugs.
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. No drugs emerged from this specific work, and the general field of phosphatase inhibitor drug discovery struggled for years, with most programs never reaching approval.

• **Prediction**: That the "evolutionarily selected" natural products argument was misguided when the compounds showed only micromolar activity.
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. The broader natural product drug discovery field evolved to recognize that while natural products provide privileged scaffolds, evolutionary selection doesn't guarantee druggable potency or properties.

• **Prediction**: That academic labs fundamentally misunderstood industrial drug discovery requirements.
  - **Outcome**: **Partially correct**. While industry standards did prove more stringent, the subsequent two decades saw significant evolution in academic drug discovery, with many universities developing more pharmaceutical-like screening infrastructure and criteria. However, the core disconnect identified remains relevant, with ongoing debates about academic versus industrial drug discovery approaches and criteria for progression.

• **Prediction**: That getting from micromolar to nanomolar potency while maintaining selectivity would be extremely difficult.
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. This proved true not just for phosphatase inhibitors but for many drug target classes, where achieving both potent inhibition and appropriate drug-like properties remained a major challenge throughout drug discovery.

• **Prediction**: That the attitude "medicinal chemistry should be able to sort things out" was naive given the poor starting points.
  - **Outcome**: **Correct**. The pharmaceutical industry's experience confirmed that starting with poor initial hits rarely leads to success, no matter how skilled the medicinal chemistry team.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article demonstrated prescient understanding of drug discovery challenges and highlighted the important but often underappreciated gap between academic and industrial research standards in biotechnology. The phosphatase inhibitor field's subsequent struggles validate its insights, though the specific targets discussed did continue to attract research investment despite the difficulties.
