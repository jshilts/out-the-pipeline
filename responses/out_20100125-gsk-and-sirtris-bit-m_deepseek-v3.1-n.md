# GSK and Sirtris: A Bit More (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY  

This January 2010 commentary responds to emerging concerns about Sirtris Pharmaceuticals' sirtuin research following a Pfizer paper that questioned the reproducibility of key findings. The article discusses potential explanations for why Pfizer was unable to reproduce some in vivo effects of Sirtris compounds, including SIRT1 activators like resveratrol-based molecules.

Key voices cited include MIT's Leonard Guarente (a sirtuin field pioneer) who argued that compounds might only work in cellular environments rather than in vitro, and Sirtris co-founder David Sinclair who suggested Pfizer's compound purity might explain the discrepancies. The author expresses concern about the irreproducibility issues while noting that animal studies have many variables, and criticizes Sinclair's response as "insulting" for questioning Pfizer scientists' competence.

The broader context is GSK's 2008 acquisition of Sirtris for $720 million, with high hopes that sirtuin activation could treat age-related diseases. The Pfizer reproducibility challenges threatened this narrative and investment.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Clinical Development Outcomes:**
- **SRT2104 (SIRT1 activator)**: Failed Phase 2 trials for type 2 diabetes (2015) and cardiovascular disease endpoints. A Phase 2 trial for plaque psoriasis showed some efficacy but narrow applications.
- **SRT2379**: Development discontinued around 2011-2012 after failing to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefits.
- **Resveratrol-based compounds**: Despite extensive research, no Sirtris-developed resveratrol analogues received FDA approval for age-related diseases.

**Corporate Fate:**
- GSK shut down Sirtris as a separate unit in 2013, absorbing it into their broader R&D operations
- By 2018, most sirtuin activator programs had been deprioritized or terminated
- No sirtuin-activating drugs from Sirtris reached FDA approval or significant patient uptake

**Scientific Developments:**
- Continued research revealed that sirtuin activators showed inconsistent effects across different experimental systems
- Many early claims about resveratrol's anti-aging effects faced significant challenges in rigorous clinical testing
- The field shifted toward more nuanced understanding of sirtuins' complex roles rather than viewing them as simple "anti-aging" targets

**Market Impact:**
- The hyped valuation of Sirtris ($720M acquisition) significantly exceeded eventual clinical outcomes
- Public policy did not change substantially, though the case became emblematic of challenges in translating basic aging research to therapeutics

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

• **Implicit prediction that sirtuin activators would succeed as therapies**: The article's concern about reproducibility issues suggested recognition that the therapeutic promise might not be realized. While not explicitly pessimistic, the skepticism about handling the data was warranted - no approved drugs emerged.

• **Concern that animal study variability could explain discrepancies**: This was reasonable, but the eventual outcomes showed that the fundamental therapeutic approach had limited viability rather than just technical reproducibility issues.

• **Suggestion that Pfizer's scientists were competent**: Validated - subsequent research confirmed genuine challenges with sirtuin activator development rather than simple technical errors.

## 4. INTEREST  

Rating: **8/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment when highly-publicized anti-aging research faced serious scientific challenges, exemplifying the gap between biotechnology hype and clinical reality. The GSK-Sirtris case became a cautionary tale about major pharmaceutical acquisitions based on early-stage science.
