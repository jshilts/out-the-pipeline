# Article Title (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the emergence of pseudokinases and other pseudoenzymes as potential drug discovery targets. Around 2002-2012, genome analysis revealed that approximately 10% of kinases lacked key catalytic residues required for enzymatic activity, yet these "pseudokinases" appeared to be under evolutionary selection pressure, suggesting they served important functions despite being catalytically inactive. Similar patterns were found in other enzyme families like sulfotransferases.

Research was beginning to reveal that these pseudoenzymes often serve regulatory functions, particularly modulating their catalytically active counterparts. Many retain substrate-binding capabilities, and these binding events may trigger regulatory cascades in downstream protein interactions. The article argues that pseudoenzymes represent an underexplored class of potential drug targets, possibly already being hit unintentionally by existing ligands, and recommends that drug discovery efforts should begin systematically screening against them.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to the 2013 article, the field of pseudoenzyme research has seen significant maturation with concrete implications for drug discovery:

**Scientific Advancement**: The pseudoenzyme field has evolved from curiosity to an established research area. By 2015-2020, systematic cataloging identified pseudoenzymes across multiple enzyme families beyond kinases, including pseudoproteases, pseudophosphatases, and others. High-profile publications and dedicated conferences have legitimized the field.

**Regulatory Functions Elucidated**: Research has confirmed that many pseudoenzymes act as allosteric regulators, scaffolds for protein complexes, competitors for substrate binding, or signal integrators. For example, pseudokinases like KSR (Kinase Suppressor of Ras) and HER3 (ERBB3) have been shown to regulate their active kinase partners through complex formation and allosteric mechanisms.

**Drug Discovery Applications**: The prediction about pseudoenzymes as drug targets has materialized, though not as broadly as initially speculated. Several pharmaceutical companies have explored pseudokinases as targets, particularly in oncology. HER3 (ERBB3), a pseudokinase receptor tyrosine kinase, has been targeted with antibodies and small molecule inhibitors in clinical trials for various cancers, though with mixed results in terms of FDA approval and clinical adoption. Other pseudokinases like JAK2 pseudokinase domain have been investigated, but widespread commercial success remains limited compared to traditional enzyme targets.

**Academic/Industrial Adoption**: While awareness has increased, pseudoenzymes have not become mainstream screening targets in most drug discovery pipelines. The complexity of their allosteric mechanisms and regulatory networks makes them challenging targets compared to active enzymes. However, selective academic labs and specialized biotechnology companies continue to explore these targets, particularly for hard-to-drug pathways.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Pseudoenzymes would represent "a whole class of drug targets" that the pharmaceutical industry should systematically screen.
  
• **Reality**: Limited validation. While some pseudoenzymes (notably HER3/ERBB3) have entered clinical development as drug targets, they have not become a broad, systematic screening class across the industry. Most drug discovery still focuses on traditional enzymatically active targets. The complexity of pseudoenzyme mechanisms and limited druggability have constrained widespread adoption.

• **Prediction**: Existing drugs and ligands might be unintentionally hitting pseudoenzymes, and counterscreening should be implemented.
  
• **Reality**: Partially validated. Drug repurposing studies have identified off-target effects on some pseudoenzymes, but systematic counterscreening has not become standard practice in most pharmaceutical pipelines, partly due to assay development challenges and unclear clinical relevance of such off-target effects.

• **Prediction**: Selection pressure on pseudoenzymes implies important biological function worth targeting for therapy.
  
• **Reality**: Strongly validated. Research has consistently shown that catalytically inactive enzyme variants serve crucial regulatory roles in signaling pathways, cellular metabolism, and disease pathogenesis. However, translating this biological significance into successful drugs has proven challenging, with regulatory mechanisms often proving more difficult to target therapeutically than catalytic inhibition.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

The article correctly identified an emerging area of biology with potential therapeutic relevance and demonstrated foresight about regulatory pseudoenzymes before the field matured. However, the clinical translation has been more limited than anticipated, and while scientifically interesting, the impact on drug discovery has been narrower than predicted.
