# Nothing Says (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article critiques a University of Ottawa recruitment photo that contains stereotypical and nonsensical elements often found in science marketing materials. The author points out several common problems: colored solutions in test tubes (which real chemists rarely use), posed "thoughtful young scientists" staring at equipment, and most notably, fake chemical structures on a whiteboard in the background that are "nonsensical" and scientifically meaningless. The piece references similar criticism of Georgia Tech for inaccurate chemical drawings and mocks the theatrical presentation of scientific research with references to "purple spotlights" that create an artificially glamorous image of laboratory work.

## 2. HISTORY
The underlying issue identified in this article—misleading and scientifically inaccurate science communication materials—has remained a persistent problem in academia and industry. The specific University of Ottawa incident was part of a broader pattern of institutions using staged, unrealistic imagery for marketing purposes. While this particular case faded from attention, the problem of scientific institutions using "stock photo" tropes continued. 

In subsequent years, social media amplified criticism of such practices, with platforms like Twitter becoming venues for scientists to call out inaccurate representations. The chemical structure errors specifically tie into ongoing concerns about scientific literacy in public communication. However, there is little evidence that this specific critique led to concrete policy changes at University of Ottawa or broader systemic reforms in academic marketing practices. The use of purple lighting and dramatic laboratory imagery persists in scientific advertising, suggesting the aesthetic criticized here remained effective for recruitment purposes despite scientific inaccuracy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **No specific predictions** - The article is primarily satirical commentary rather than predictive analysis about scientific communication or the biotechnology industry. It focuses on mocking current practices rather than forecasting future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2/9**

This is a light post about marketing tropes rather than substantive biotechnology developments, with limited long-term importance despite touching on valid issues in science communication.
