# Check Out These Molecules (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 article discusses a landmark *Science* paper that demonstrated atomic force microscopy (AFM) for directly imaging small molecules at the atomic level. Researchers used a carbon monoxide molecule as the AFM tip to visualize the cyclization products of a polyphenylacetylene compound on a silver crystal surface. The technique successfully distinguished between different molecular frameworks, including detecting rare species like stable diradicals.

The author notes two important limitations: the method only works well for molecules that lie flat on the surface (compound 9 failed because it curled up), and the surface conditions likely alter the product distribution compared to solution chemistry. The article concludes with a speculative proposal for developing a multi-tip AFM array—an "AFM hand"—that could potentially analyze more complex three-dimensional structures and even detect chirality directly.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2013 article, high-resolution AFM with functionalized tips became an established technique in chemical research, though its applications remained largely within specialized academic and research settings rather than routine analytical chemistry.

**Wider Adoption in Research**: The technique pioneered by groups like the one at IBM Zurich (likely the 2013 *Science* work) became more widely adopted in surface science and nanotechnology research. By the mid-to-late 2010s, several research groups worldwide were using similar AFM methods to study molecular structures, reaction mechanisms, and on-surface synthesis.

**Commercial and Industrial Impact**: While the technique demonstrated scientific value, it did not see widespread adoption in pharmaceutical or biotechnology drug development pipelines. The high cost, specialized equipment requirements, and limitations to surface-adsorbed, flat-lying molecules constrained its practical application for routine structure determination of drug candidates or biomolecules.

**Technological Evolution**: AFM technology continued advancing, with improvements in resolution, speed, and environmental control (operating in liquid, at different temperatures). However, the vision of multi-tip arrays for high-throughput molecular analysis did not materialize as a commercial reality. The technique remained primarily a research tool for fundamental studies of molecular structure and on-surface chemistry rather than a routine analytical method for pharmaceutical or biotechnology applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Prediction 1**: The author proposed that "enterprising nanotechnologists" would develop "some sort of array version of the AFM, with multiple tips splayed out from each other"
- **Outcome**: This did not materialize for molecular imaging applications. While multi-tip AFM systems exist for semiconductor metrology, the vision of multiple CO-functionalized tips for parallel molecular structure determination was not realized commercially or in widespread research practice.

**Prediction 2**: The author suggested such an "AFM hand" might be able to "deconvolute more three-dimensional structures (and perhaps sense chirality directly?)"
- **Outcome**: While AFM techniques advanced, the direct determination of complex 3D molecular structures and chirality detection did not become routine through this approach. Other techniques (X-ray crystallography, NMR, cryo-EM) remained dominant for 3D structure determination in pharmaceutical applications.

**Implicit Prediction**: That this AFM technique would find broad application in molecular structure determination
- **Outcome**: The technique found niche but important applications in surface science and nanotechnology research, but did not displace or complement traditional structural methods (X-ray, NMR) in medicinal chemistry or drug development to any significant extent.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

This article highlights an important technical milestone in molecular imaging, but the technique's limited practical impact and adoption in the subsequent decade constrains its broader significance. The speculative visions proposed did not materialize, making this more of historical interest than long-term importance.
