# Infinity's Research, From Someone Who Was There (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post is a first‑hand recollection from Keith Robison, a former Infinity Pharmaceuticals employee, about the company’s string of high‑profile clinical setbacks that became public in early‑to‑mid‑2016. Infinity’s flagship programs at the time were:  

* **IPI‑926 (saridegib)** – a Hedgehog‑pathway inhibitor being tested in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and, later, in chondrosarcoma.  
* **IPI‑504 (retaspimycin)** – an HSP90 inhibitor evaluated in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).  

Both Phase III trials were halted after interim analyses showed lack of efficacy and, in the pancreatic trial, higher mortality in the treatment arm. The author notes that pre‑clinical data had looked “excellent” and that the abrupt failures were a shock to the staff. He also describes an attempt to attribute the GIST deaths to liver toxicity, a known class effect of HSP90 inhibitors, and the company’s decision to continue pursuing other HSP90 studies despite the setback. The piece ends with a broader comment on the inherent uncertainty of biotech R&D and the gap between scientific optimism and clinical reality.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Post‑2016 corporate fate**  
* In 2014 Novartis had acquired Infinity for ≈ $1.1 billion, primarily to obtain the Hedgehog program. After the 2016 trial failures, Novartis wrote down the value of Infinity’s pipeline (≈ $1.5 billion in 2017) and folded the remaining assets into its Oncology division. Infinity ceased to exist as an independent entity; its staff and labs were absorbed or let go.  

**Hedgehog inhibitor (saridegib)**  
* The pancreatic cancer trial (IPI‑926) was stopped in March 2016; the chondrosarcoma trial was halted shortly thereafter. No further clinical development of saridegib has been reported. The failure contributed to a broader reassessment of Hedgehog inhibition in solid tumors—subsequent Hedgehog inhibitors (e.g., vismodegib, sonidegib) have remained limited to basal‑cell carcinoma, where the pathway is a primary driver.  

**HSP90 inhibitor (retaspimycin)**  
* The GIST Phase III trial was stopped in early 2016 after an interim analysis showed no survival benefit and a signal of liver toxicity. Later analyses confirmed that HSP90 inhibition carries a risk of hepatotoxicity, especially in patients with extensive liver metastases. Novartis discontinued all HSP90 programs from Infinity’s portfolio by late 2016; no HSP90 inhibitor from Infinity ever reached market.  

**PI3K‑γ/δ inhibitor (IPI‑145)**  
* Infinity’s PI3K‑γ/δ inhibitor, IPI‑145, was licensed to Verastem in 2015. Verastem continued development, and the drug was renamed **duvelisib**. The FDA approved duvelisib (Copiktra) in September 2018 for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small‑lymphocytic lymphoma and later for follicular lymphoma. This is the only Infinity‑originated molecule that ultimately achieved regulatory approval, albeit under a different company’s banner.  

**Impact on the field**  
* The high‑profile failures reinforced the cautionary view that pre‑clinical “engineered mouse models” often over‑predict human efficacy, especially for pathways like Hedgehog and HSP90 that have complex roles in tumor stroma and normal tissue.  
* Investors and analysts became more skeptical of “single‑target” oncology bets from small biotech firms, leading to tighter financing for similar programs in the years that followed.  
* Novartis’s write‑down and the subsequent restructuring of its oncology pipeline were cited in earnings calls as a catalyst for the company to shift focus toward immuno‑oncology and cell therapy rather than small‑molecule pathway inhibitors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not contain explicit forward‑looking predictions, but it implies a few expectations that can be evaluated:

| Implied expectation | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **The Hedgehog program would eventually succeed** (the author’s shock suggests he expected a positive outcome). | The Hedgehog inhibitor (saridegib) was discontinued; no Hedgehog‑targeted small molecule from Infinity reached market. |
| **Liver toxicity was the main cause of deaths in the GIST HSP90 trial** (company tried to attribute deaths to this). | Subsequent safety analyses confirmed hepatotoxicity as a class effect of HSP90 inhibitors, and the trial was terminated; the program was not revived. |
| **Infinity would continue to push other HSP90 trials despite the setback**. | No further HSP90 trials from Infinity were pursued after 2016; Novartis halted the entire HSP90 portfolio. |
| **The broader biotech environment would remain unaware of the high failure rate** (author notes public misunderstanding). | The failures were widely reported in industry media; they contributed to a more vocal discussion about the limits of pre‑clinical models. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The piece offers a rare insider’s perspective on a high‑profile biotech collapse, which is valuable for understanding the human side of drug development. However, it does not introduce new data or analysis beyond what was already public, limiting its long‑term scholarly impact.
