# Conferencing (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author recounts delivering a talk on September 13 2011, noting that it “went fine” and that the presentation incorporated ideas from Tyler Cowen’s *The Great Stagnation* along with other sources. After the talk, the author received requests for the slide deck and is considering turning the material into a YouTube video, acknowledging that doing so would require preparing a new talk for future conference invitations.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Tyler Cowen’s thesis and biotech** – *The Great Stagnation* (2011) argued that easy technological gains had largely been exhausted, prompting a debate about whether sectors such as biotechnology could sustain growth. Over the subsequent decade, biotech proved resilient: the CRISPR‑Cas9 genome‑editing system (first demonstrated in 2012) sparked a wave of new therapeutics, and the number of FDA‑approved gene‑therapy products rose from zero before 2017 to several by 2024 (e.g., Luxturna, Zolgensma, and Casgevy).  
- **The author’s talk/video** – Public records do not show a widely circulated video of this specific 2011 talk, nor a notable impact on the biotech community. The blog post appears to be a brief personal update rather than a seminal presentation.  
- **Industry trajectory** – Despite the “stagnation” narrative, biotech investment grew dramatically after 2011. Global biotech venture capital funding rose from roughly $10 billion in 2011 to over $70 billion in 2023, and the number of biotech IPOs increased accordingly. The sector’s growth has been driven more by advances in genomics, immuno‑oncology, and mRNA technology than by the macro‑economic concerns raised in Cowen’s book.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The short post does not contain explicit predictions about biotech products, market trends, or policy. Consequently, there are no specific forecasts to evaluate against later outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10**  
The piece is a personal, low‑impact update with no substantive analysis or lasting influence on biotechnology discourse. Its relevance is limited to the author’s audience rather than the broader field.
