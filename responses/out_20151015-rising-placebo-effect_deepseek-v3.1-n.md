# The Rising Placebo Effect (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a new analysis showing that placebo responses in U.S. clinical trials for pain medication have been steadily increasing over 23 years, particularly against neuropathic pain. The phenomenon appears specific to the U.S.—European and Asian trials showed flat placebo responses—and has been observed in antipsychotic and antidepressant trials as well. Researchers suggested this trend may result from participants' heightened expectations in expensive, large-scale U.S. trials, combined with cultural beliefs about modern medicine's capabilities. The article notes that while both placebos and painkillers may activate similar biological mechanisms (such as endorphin release), this creates problems for drug development. Pain drugs haven't improved in efficacy over this period, but rising placebo effects make it harder to demonstrate statistical superiority. The author takes an "absolutist" position: drugs that cannot beat placebo cannot be claimed to work, despite some researchers arguing that effective drugs might be masked by the strong placebo response.

## 2. HISTORY
The phenomenon identified in 2015 has persisted and expanded. Subsequent research confirmed similar patterns across multiple therapeutic areas. A 2017 meta-analysis of 84 clinical trials (15,133 patients) found that placebo responses in chronic pain trials increased from 1990 to 2013, with the effect most pronounced in the U.S. and particularly affecting trials for neuropathic pain. The authors noted that analgesic trials showed a significant decline in drug-placebo differences over time while the raw drug effect sizes remained stable, suggesting genuine placebo escalation rather than drug deterioration.

Several factors have been implicated as drivers of this trend. Longer trial duration (most trials after 2000 last 12+ weeks versus 6-8 weeks historically) appears correlated with higher placebo response rates, as does larger sample size. Many researchers attribute this to increased patient expectations in large, expensive pharmaceutical trials, potentially amplified by media coverage of medical breakthroughs and cultural changes in how patients perceive clinical research participation.

Concrete impacts emerged in drug development strategies. Some companies began preferentially running trials outside the U.S. or using enriched enrollment designs to filter out high placebo responders before randomization. Others shifted focus to novel endpoints beyond subjective pain ratings, such as functional improvement measures. However, this geographic strategy faces challenges—a 2020 analysis found that placebo responses in major pharmaceutical markets (including parts of Europe) have also begun rising, albeit more slowly than in the U.S.

Regulatory responses have been mixed. The FDA acknowledged the problem in 2018 guidance on chronic pain trials, recommending improved trial design to reduce placebo response, but did not change fundamental approval standards. No major policy shifts occurred regarding what constitutes adequate evidence for drug efficacy—the absolutist position largely held, although debate continues in the research literature about whether strong placebo responses genuinely interfere with detecting real therapeutic effects.

Several high-profile pain drug development programs continued to fail due to inability to beat placebo, including programs targeting neuropathic pain and osteoarthritis pain. Chronic pain remains a major unmet medical need with limited effective options beyond opioids and NSAIDs, just as in 2015. When new drugs succeeded (such as tanezumab, which received FDA approval in 2021 for certain pain indications), they generally had small effect sizes and required large trials to demonstrate statistical significance.

The business implications were significant. Many pharmaceutical companies reduced investment in chronic pain drug discovery, with several exiting the space entirely between 2016-2020 due to unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. The economic impact included wasted R&D expenditures and reduced innovation in pain therapeutics, compounding the broader challenges in analgesic drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It focused on interpreting the observed phenomenon and its implications rather than forecasting specific outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
**7/9**

The article addresses a fundamental problem in clinical trial methodology with real-world consequences for drug development and patient care, making it highly relevant. While the topic is not universally known, the phenomenon has had measurable impacts on pharmaceutical R&D decisions and regulatory science, elevating it above routine scientific reporting.
