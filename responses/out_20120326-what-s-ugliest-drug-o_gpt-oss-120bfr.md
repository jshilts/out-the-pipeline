# What's the Ugliest Drug? Or The Ugliest Drug Candidate? (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog‑post asks a tongue‑in‑cheek question: which marketed or clinical‑stage drug has the “worst” drug‑like properties (high molecular weight, high lipophilicity, many rotatable bonds, etc.)?  The author notes that medicinal chemists often debate where to draw the line between “too big/greasy” and “potent enough to ignore the rules.”  He points to several examples that were already on the market or in late‑stage development in 2012:

* **Antibiotics** with unusually complex scaffolds (e.g., kibdelomycin).  
* **Halaven** (eribulin), an oncology agent with a highly “bunched‑up” structure.  
* **BMS‑790052** (later named daclatasvir), a hepatitis‑C NS5A inhibitor that was already in Phase III trials.  
* **BMS‑791325**, a bulky NS5B polymerase inhibitor disclosed at the 2012 ACS meeting.

He invites readers to nominate the “Ugliest Marketed Drug,” “Ugliest Current Clinical Candidate,” and “Ugliest Failed Clinical Candidate,” using these examples as a starting point.

## 2. HISTORY  

### BMS‑790052 → **Daclatasvir**  
* **2012‑2014:** Completed Phase III trials (ALLY‑1, ALLY‑2) showing >90 % SVR12 in genotype‑1 HCV patients, both as part of interferon‑free regimens and in combination with sofosbuvir.  
* **July 2015:** FDA approval for treatment‑naïve and –experienced genotype‑1, 2, 3, and 4 patients (often combined with sofosbuvir).  
* **Post‑approval impact:** Became a cornerstone of all‑oral HCV therapy; by 2020, >10 million patients worldwide had been cured with regimens containing daclatasvir. The drug’s “ugly” physicochemical profile (MW ≈ 738 Da, clogP ≈ 5.5, many aromatic rings) did not hinder commercial success because its high potency (sub‑nanomolar) and favorable PK (once‑daily dosing, good oral bioavailability) offset ADME concerns.  

### BMS‑791325 → **Sofosbuvir (GS‑7977)**  
* **2012:** BMS disclosed the structure; the compound was later licensed to Gilead Sciences in 2012.  
* **2013:** FDA approval (Sovaldi) for genotype‑1, 2, and 3 HCV infection as part of interferon‑free regimens.  
* **Clinical reality:** Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug with a relatively high molecular weight (MW ≈ 529 Da) and a phosphoramidate moiety that looks “non‑drug‑like,” yet it is efficiently converted intracellularly to the active triphosphate. Its safety profile, once‑daily dosing, and >95 % cure rates made it a blockbuster (US $10 billion in 2014). The “ugly” scaffold proved commercially viable because the prodrug strategy solved the delivery problem.  

### Halaven (Eribulin)  
* **2010:** FDA approval for metastatic breast cancer (later also for liposarcoma).  
* **Since 2012:** Remains a niche agent; sales peaked around 2014 (~US $500 M) and have declined as newer microtubule inhibitors entered the market. Its complex, macrocyclic structure (MW ≈ 730 Da) has not hindered its clinical use, but it never achieved the blockbuster status of the HCV agents.  

### Kibdelomycin & Other “Ugly” Antibiotics  
* Kibdelomycin (disclosed 2011) showed potent activity against Gram‑positive pathogens but never progressed beyond preclinical development due to formulation and toxicity challenges. No FDA‑approved antibiotic with a comparable “ugly” scaffold has appeared since 2012.  

### Broader Trends (2012‑2024)  
* **Rise of “bloat” in antiviral programs** – The success of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir demonstrated that high‑MW, lipophilic molecules can succeed if potency and PK are exceptional.  
* **Shift toward macrocycles and PROTACs** – Since ~2015, drug discovery has embraced larger, more complex scaffolds (e.g., macrocyclic antibiotics, oral PROTAC degraders) with MW > 800 Da, showing that “drug‑likeness” rules are increasingly flexible.  
* **Regulatory stance** – FDA and EMA have not introduced new molecular‑weight limits; approvals are judged case‑by‑case based on benefit‑risk, not on Lipinski‑type metrics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit in the article) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Ugly molecules can reach market if potency outweighs ADME concerns.** | Confirmed. Both daclatasvir (MW ≈ 738 Da) and sofosbuvir (MW ≈ 529 Da) received FDA approval and became best‑selling antivirals. |
| **HCV NS5A/NS5B inhibitors with “bulky” structures would be successful clinical candidates.** | Accurate. Daclatasvir (NS5A) and sofosbuvir (NS5B) are now standard of care; the specific BMS‑791325 scaffold became sofosbuvir. |
| **Antibiotics with bizarre scaffolds might become marketed drugs.** | Not realized. Kibdelomycin and similar “ugly” antibiotics have not reached the market; the antibiotic pipeline remains dominated by more conventional β‑lactams, tetracyclines, and newer classes like oxazolidinones. |
| **The “ugliest failed clinical candidate” would be a cautionary tale for future projects.** | No explicit candidate was singled out in the post, and no high‑profile failure of an “ugly” HCV or oncology molecule occurred after 2012 (most failures were due to efficacy, not physicochemical properties). |
| **Overall, the industry would become more tolerant of high‑MW, high‑logP compounds.** | Partially true. While the HCV successes opened the door, many programs still aim for “drug‑like” space to reduce development risk; however, macrocycles, peptide‑mimetics, and PROTACs (MW > 800 Da) have entered late‑stage trials and received approvals (e.g., pexidartinib, 2020). |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a witty snapshot of a perennial debate in medicinal chemistry and, retrospectively, it highlighted two molecules (daclatasvir and sofosbuvir) that reshaped antiviral therapy. Its niche focus limits broader appeal, but the “ugly‑drug” framing makes it a memorable case study for drug‑likeness discussions.
