# Another Use for Xenon (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the emerging use of xenon gas as a performance-enhancing aid in athletics. Russian athletic federations had been recommending xenon, and documentation showed the Russian Olympic committee used it to prepare for the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics. The proposed mechanism involves xenon triggering production of HIF-1-alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor), which stimulates erythropoietin (EPO) production - mimicking the body's natural response to low oxygen conditions and potentially boosting endurance.

The article notes that while animal studies support this mechanism, reliable human clinical data was lacking in 2014. Notably, xenon was not yet banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), making its use technically legal in competition. The author speculates that xenon's lipid solubility might explain its long-lasting effects, and suggests the gas would continue being relevant due to medical applications in preventing hypoxia-related injuries.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article, several important developments occurred:

**Regulatory Action:** WADA added xenon and argon to its prohibited list in 2014, shortly after this article was published, banning their use by athletes.

**Scientific Research:** The HIF pathway became a major therapeutic target in medicine, but primarily through pharmaceutical approaches (HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors) rather than xenon gas. Drugs like roxadustat and vadadustat were developed for treating anemia in chronic kidney disease.

**Medical Xenon Applications:** Research continued on xenon's neuroprotective properties in anesthesia and its potential for treating brain injury, though it remains expensive and not widely adopted in routine clinical practice.

**Russian Doping Revelations:** The 2016 McLaren Report and subsequent investigations revealed systematic doping in Russian sports, though xenon specifically played a minor role compared to other substances like meldonium.

**Commercial Impact:** Despite early enthusiasm, xenon gas did not become widely adopted in legitimate medical hypoxia-related treatments due to cost and the development of more practical pharmaceutical alternatives.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **Prediction:** Xenon would "not be going away any time soon" due to medical interest in preventing hypoxia-related injury.
- **Outcome:** Partially accurate. Research on xenon's medical applications continued, particularly in neuroprotection, but it did not achieve widespread clinical adoption due to practical limitations.

- **Prediction:** That the HIF pathway would remain medically relevant.
- **Outcome:** Accurate. The HIF pathway became a major drug target, with multiple pharmaceutical companies developing HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors for treating anemia.

- **Prediction:** More human data would be needed on xenon's effects.
- **Outcome:** Accurate direction, but the regulatory ban shifted research focus away from athletic applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captured an interesting intersection of sports doping, pharmacology, and regulatory policy at a transitional moment. While xenon itself proved less important than expected, it correctly identified the HIF pathway as biologically significant. The timing just before WADA's ban adds historical interest, showing how quickly sports authorities respond to emerging enhancement methods.
