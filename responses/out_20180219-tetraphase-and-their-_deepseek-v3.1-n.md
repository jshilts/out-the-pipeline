# Tetraphase and Their Troubles (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article provides an update on Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, an antibiotics company founded by Harvard chemistry professor Andy Myers based on his group's synthetic chemistry work. The piece revisits a lawsuit brought by Mark Charest (a former group member) against Harvard over Tetraphase patent royalties, which had been settled out of court.

The main focus is on Tetraphase's lead antibiotic candidate eravacycline, a fluorinated tetracycline synthesized through total synthesis. The article details clinical setbacks: eravacycline failed two Phase 3 trials in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) - one in 2015 against levofloxacin and another in 2018 against ertapenem. Both trials aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority but failed to meet primary endpoints. However, the drug did show success in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), demonstrating non-inferiority against meropenem, with Tetraphase planning an NDA submission for that indication.

The article also explains that Tetraphase's stock had plummeted from ~$50/share before the first trial failure to just over $2/share in February 2018, despite occurring during a biopharma bull market.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the clinical and commercial trajectory of eravacycline has been rocky. According to publicly available information, while eravacycline (brand name Xerava) did receive FDA approval for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) later in 2018, subsequent commercial performance has been disappointing relative to initial expectations, and Tetraphase's corporate fate underscores broader challenges in antibiotic development. The company substantially underperformed commercially after approval, and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals was ultimately acquired by La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company in 2020 for approximately $47 million, well below earlier valuations. Xerava saw limited adoption and market uptake, consistent with systemic headwinds affecting new antibiotics even after successful development, including difficulties with hospital formulary adoption and reimbursement. The results reflect the broader industry pattern of struggling to commercialize new antibiotics without robust economic incentives, despite demonstrated medical need.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains implicit and explicit assessments about the challenges facing antibiotic development and Tetraphase's prospects:

• **Implicit assessment that eravacycline might still succeed**: The article notes the drug's demonstrated non-inferiority in cIAI and submission plans, while highlighting challenges. *Outcome*: The drug did gain FDA approval for cIAI as anticipated.

• **Assessment about the difficulty of antibiotic development**: The article emphasizes that finding compounds that work in actual bacterial cells, overcoming resistance mechanisms, and achieving clinical success is "extraordinarily frustrating" and "a hard business." *Outcome*: This proved accurate, and Tetraphase's struggles continued post-approval with limited commercial adoption.

• **Assessment about the non-inferiority pathway**: The article explains this regulatory strategy for antibiotics and its rationale in addressing drug resistance. *Outcome*: This approach remained relevant and correct as a viable regulatory pathway for antibiotics.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides important, reality-grounded insights into the antibiotic development sector and the challenges that persist even after technical success. The Tetraphase case illustrates systemic issues in antibiotic commercialization that remain highly relevant.
