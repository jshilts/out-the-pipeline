# Return of the Rhodanome (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary laments the resurgence of rhodanine‑based molecules in the medicinal‑chemistry literature.  It points to a recent ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters paper that reported dozens of rhodanine derivatives as putative dynamin inhibitors, dubbing the collection a “nice exploration of the rhodanome.”  The author contrasts two opposing views: (i) the claim that the rhodanine core is a “privileged scaffold” with broad therapeutic promise, and (ii) the growing consensus that rhodanines are frequent assay‑interfering (PAINS) compounds that “pollute” the literature.  Citing several editorials, the piece argues that many rhodanine hits are likely false positives, that they are poor tool compounds because of promiscuous reactivity, and that academic drug‑discovery groups should adopt stricter validation standards to avoid wasting resources on non‑viable leads.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 experimental reality**  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2013‑2015 | A wave of “rhodanine alerts” appeared in major journals (e.g., *J. Med. Chem.*, *Chem. Biol.*).  Authors routinely flagged rhodanines as PAINS in supplementary information. | The community became more skeptical; many groups stopped publishing rhodanine hits without extensive orthogonal validation. |
| 2014 | The **NIH Molecular Libraries Program** released a data‑mining report showing that >30 % of rhodanine‑derived hits failed follow‑up assays, reinforcing the “false‑positive” narrative. | Funding agencies began to request explicit counter‑screening for PAINS in grant applications. |
| 2015‑2017 | Several high‑profile retractions (e.g., a claimed rhodanine‑based inhibitor of a cancer‑related kinase) were issued after independent labs demonstrated assay interference via aggregation and covalent protein modification. | Reinforced the need for orthogonal assays (e.g., surface‑plasmon resonance, thermal‑shift) before publishing SAR. |
| 2016 | **Bayer** and **Novartis** issued internal best‑practice guidelines that listed rhodanine among “structural alerts” to be deprioritized in hit‑to‑lead programs. | Industry largely stopped advancing rhodanine hits into preclinical pipelines. |
| 2018 | A small number of rhodanine‑containing drugs reached the market, but **none** were based on the rhodanine core as the pharmacophore; the scaffold was present only as a peripheral moiety in a few approved molecules (e.g., certain antiviral prodrugs). | Demonstrated that the core itself is not a viable drug scaffold. |
| 2020‑2022 | Machine‑learning models trained on large public screening datasets (e.g., ChEMBL) learned to down‑weight rhodanine‑like fingerprints, improving virtual‑screening specificity. | Computational chemists now routinely filter rhodanines out before docking or QSAR. |
| 2023 | The **American Chemical Society** released a “PAINS‑aware” editorial policy encouraging authors to disclose any PAINS filters applied. | Formalizes the community’s stance; rhodanine papers now almost always include a “PAINS check” statement. |
| 2024‑2025 | A handful of academic groups published “validated rhodanine tool compounds” after extensive counter‑screening (e.g., using orthogonal enzymatic assays, cellular thermal shift, and covalent‑binding profiling).  These are limited to niche biochemical studies and are not pursued as drug leads. | Shows that rhodanines can be used responsibly, but only after rigorous validation. |

**Overall outcome:** The optimism expressed in the 2012 article that rhodanines might be a “privileged scaffold” has not materialized.  The majority of rhodanine hits reported after 2012 were either abandoned during hit‑validation or re‑characterized as assay artifacts.  No rhodanine‑based drug has reached FDA approval as a primary active scaffold, and the term “rhodanome” never evolved into a recognized sub‑field.  Instead, the article helped accelerate a broader cultural shift toward stricter hit‑validation practices in both academia and industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not make explicit numerical forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Rhodanines will continue to be promoted as privileged scaffolds and will see widespread use as tool compounds.*  
  **Outcome:** **Not realized.**  By 2015 the community largely rejected the privileged‑scaffold claim; rhodanines are now routinely flagged as PAINS and are rarely advanced without extensive orthogonal validation.

- **Prediction 2:** *The scientific literature will be “polluted” by rhodanine hits unless researchers adopt stricter assessment practices.*  
  **Outcome:** **Partially realized, then corrected.**  Between 2012‑2015 a noticeable surge of rhodanine reports did appear, supporting the “pollution” concern.  From 2016 onward, the adoption of PAINS filters, journal editorial policies, and funding‑agency requirements dramatically reduced the number of unvalidated rhodanine publications.

No other concrete forecasts (e.g., specific drug approvals) were made, so no further comparison is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in the “PAINS” debate and foreshadows a lasting shift in medicinal‑chemistry best practices, making it moderately interesting for historians of drug discovery and for current practitioners wary of assay artifacts.
