# Life Is Too Short For Some Journal Feeds (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a commentary on the challenges of keeping up with scientific literature through journal RSS feeds. The author, likely a medicinal chemist, describes the "signal-to-noise" problem when trying to follow multiple journals in real-time. 

The author notes that Elsevier's RSS feeds are perpetually broken, leading them to abandon following *Tetrahedron Letters* and *Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters*, even though these occasionally publish interesting work. *ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters* is followed more regularly due to its working RSS feed. The author questions whether broad-coverage "Letters/Communications" journals like *Chemical Communications* are worth following at all, given the vast volume of papers across all chemistry disciplines and the low percentage relevant to any particular researcher. In contrast, *Organic Letters* is considered more manageable because it focuses specifically on organic chemistry. The author ultimately concludes that only a limited number of journals can realistically be followed in real-time, with others needing to be accessed through targeted literature searches when needed.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends described in this 2014 article have intensified significantly in the subsequent decade:

**Journal proliferation and information overload**: The number of scientific publications has continued to grow dramatically. By 2020, over 5 million scientific articles were published annually, compared to approximately 2.5 million in 2014. This has exacerbated the "signal-to-noise" problem the author described.

**RSS feed decline**: RSS technology has largely fallen out of favor for journal monitoring. The broken Elsevier feeds the author complained about were symptoms of a broader shift away from RSS as a primary content distribution method. By the late 2010s, many researchers had moved to email alerts, social media platforms like Twitter/X, and specialized services like Google Scholar alerts.

**Publishing model evolution**: The traditional "Letters/Communications" model has faced competition from preprint servers like bioRxiv (founded 2013) and chemRxiv (founded 2017), which the author didn't mention. Many researchers now prioritize preprints over traditional rapid-communication journals for real-time updates.

**Journal consolidation and specialization**: The author's observation that specialized journals (*Organic Letters*) are more useful than broad ones (*Chemical Communications*) has proven prescient. Many researchers have shifted to following specific "micro-communities" rather than broad journals.

**New discovery tools**: Since 2014, semantic search tools, AI-powered literature discovery platforms, and improved PubMed/Scopus filtering have emerged, making the author's approach of targeted literature searches more sophisticated than real-time feed monitoring.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article was more observational than predictive, but several implicit predictions and assumptions can be evaluated:

- **"I don't have them in the feed. Synthesis, Syn Comm, Synlett - writing this prompts me to go in and add them, but we'll see over the next couple of months if I regret it."**
  - Outcome: The author likely did regret this decision, as the information overload problem only worsened. The fundamental challenge wasn't solved by adding more feeds.

- **Implicit prediction that RSS feeds would remain a primary literature monitoring tool**
  - Outcome: This was incorrect. RSS usage declined significantly in favor of email alerts, social media, and automated recommendation systems.

- **Implicit assumption that the "signal-to-noise" problem would remain manageable**
  - Outcome: The problem became dramatically worse, leading to new solutions like automated literature screening, curation services, and semantic filtering.

- **Implicit prediction that specialized journals would retain value over broad journals**
  - Outcome: This trend continued and intensified, with many researchers relying on field-specific journals and abandoning broad multidisciplinary publications for routine monitoring.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article is primarily of historical interest, documenting information overload challenges before the widespread adoption of AI-assisted literature discovery tools. While it captures an authentic researcher perspective on scientific communication in 2014, it hasn't aged into a particularly important or insightful commentary due to the rapid evolution of scientific publishing and discovery tools. The observations were accurate for their time but have been superseded by larger changes in the digital research ecosystem.
