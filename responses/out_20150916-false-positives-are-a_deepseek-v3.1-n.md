# False Positives Are Always Waiting (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This Derek Lowe commentary discusses a *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* paper from University of Minnesota researchers who identified furylquinolines as hits in a drug screening assay. The initial excitement about potential structure-activity relationships (SAR) was dashed when the research team discovered that the furan ring in these compounds was undergoing oxidative degradation. Freshly synthesized material was inactive, but activity mysteriously appeared over time as the compounds decomposed in DMSO solution.

The furan ring was found to undergo a 4+2 cycloaddition with oxygen, creating a secondary ozonide intermediate that decomposed via various pathways including Baeyer-Villager oxidation reactions. This produced breakdown products including acids, aldehydes, lactams, and Michael acceptors. The apparent "SAR" was merely an artifact of all compounds in the series degrading into similar mixtures of decomposition products.

Lowe uses this case study to discuss the broader challenge medicinal chemists face in distinguishing genuine hits from false positives in screening data, highlighting the delicate balance between being appropriately skeptical and staying open to unexpected discoveries.

## 2. HISTORY

The fundamental problem of false positives in drug screening that Lowe highlighted in 2015 remains a persistent and significant challenge in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. However, several important developments have occurred since this article's publication:

**Continued Research on PAINS and False Positives:** Research into Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) and promiscuous inhibitors has expanded significantly. The issue Lowe described - reactive functional groups creating apparent activity through decomposition or aggregation - has been extensively documented across multiple compound classes beyond just furans.

**Improved Screening Practices:** The pharmaceutical industry has largely incorporated lessons from such experiences into standard screening protocols. Most drug discovery programs now routinely include:
- Hit validation through rapid follow-up synthesis
- Counter-screening against common interference mechanisms
- Stability testing under assay conditions
- Aggregation detection assays

**Furan-Containing Drugs:** Despite the reactivity concerns Lowe highlighted, some furan-containing drugs have reached the market or advanced in development, though typically with careful attention to stability and metabolism. The presence of furan rings in drugs like ranitidine (before its withdrawal) and various antiparasitic agents demonstrates that furan rings aren't automatically disqualifying, but require careful evaluation.

**Publication of Additional Case Studies:** Numerous similar cases have been published since 2015, documenting how various chemical functionalities can produce misleading screening results. This includes detailed mechanistic studies of how different heterocyclic systems can interfere with assays.

**Assay Technology Improvements:** Modern screening platforms increasingly incorporate built-in counterscreens and orthogonal assay formats to detect common interference mechanisms earlier in the screening process.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific testable predictions about future events. Rather, it articulated general principles about drug discovery challenges that have proven enduringly relevant.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a fundamental and persistent challenge in drug discovery that remains highly relevant. While focused on a specific chemical case, it illustrates broader principles about scientific skepticism and validation that apply across many areas of biomedical research. The insights about avoiding false positive traps continue to inform best practices in pharmaceutical screening today.
