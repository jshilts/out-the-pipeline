# More Fake Journal Sleaze (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post exposed a fraudulent scientific journal called the "Journal of Spectroscopy and Molecular Physics." The article revealed that the journal's entire editorial board was fake - it listed real academics' names alongside mismatched photographs, including a deceased epidemiologist (Sir Richard Doll) and the head of Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Mario Pinto) who had no knowledge of the journal. The journal's website also displayed counterfeit logos from Thomson Reuters and Elsevier, and cited a fake impact factor from a dubious rating website. When confronted, the journal claimed their site had been "hacked," an excuse the author found implausible given the systematic nature of the fraud.

## 2. HISTORY
The exposure of "Journal of Spectroscopy and Molecular Physics" represented a snapshot of a broader predatory publishing crisis that accelerated in the 2010s. This article was published during a period when organizations like Jeffrey Beall's "Beall's List" of predatory publishers were actively tracking such journals. In subsequent years, the problem grew substantially - estimates suggest over 10,000 predatory journals were operating by 2017, publishing hundreds of thousands of articles annually.

The Federal Trade Commission took action against major predatory publisher OMICS in 2016, filing a lawsuit that resulted in a $50.1 million judgment in 2019 for deceptive practices. However, many smaller operations like this one continued operating. Scientific organizations responded with initiatives like the ThinkCheckSubmit campaign to help researchers identify legitimate journals. Universities and funding agencies began implementing stricter publication requirements and blacklisting known predatory outlets, though enforcement remained challenging due to the constantly changing names and operations of these journals. The COVID-19 pandemic created new opportunities for predatory publishers to exploit rapid publication demands, leading to increased scrutiny of preprint servers and emergency peer review processes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this article.

## 4. INTEREST
**6/10**

This article addresses an important and persistent problem in scientific publishing, but focuses on a single fraudulent journal rather than the broader systemic issues. The topic remains highly relevant as predatory publishing has continued to evolve and expand.
