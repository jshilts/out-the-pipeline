# Upside Down Activity (January 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses the problem of "inverted screening cascades" in drug discovery, where compounds that perform poorly in cell-based assays sometimes show unexpected efficacy in animal models. The author notes that discovery programs rarely test compounds that fail early-stage screens in animals due to cost and ethical constraints, creating potential for false negatives—promising drugs being abandoned prematurely. 

The piece describes a real example from Schering-Plough, where a cholesterol absorption inhibitor emerged from a compound that performed poorly against its original target in vitro but worked effectively in animals. The author argues against over-optimizing compounds based solely on in vitro data and advocates for moving compounds into more clinically relevant models sooner. A key concern raised is the unknown number of compounds that might work in humans despite poor animal model performance, as well as the uncertain translation of animal successes to human efficacy.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2007 article, the pharmaceutical industry continued grappling with the fundamental challenge described—the imperfect correlation between assay systems and clinical outcomes. However, several important developments emerged:

**Cholesterol Drug Landscape**: The drug referenced in the Schering-Plough example was likely ezetimibe (Zetia), which Merck acquired after merging with Schering-Plough in 2009. Ezetimibe was FDA-approved in 2002 and generated significant revenue, but subsequent large clinical trials showed more modest cardiovascular benefits than initially hoped, particularly when questions arose about its IMPROVE-IT trial results in 2014-2015. While the drug achieved commercial success, it didn't revolutionize cardiovascular treatment as some had anticipated.

**Translational Medicine Movement**: The late 2000s and 2010s saw the formalization of "translational medicine" as a discipline, with dedicated institutes, journals, and funding programs aiming to bridge the gap between preclinical findings and clinical applications. This included greater emphasis on human biomarkers and genomic approaches to improve prediction.

**Industry Productivity Crisis**: The period 2007-2015 was marked by ongoing concerns about pharmaceutical R&D productivity, with high failure rates despite increased investment. This led to greater scrutiny of target validation and preclinical models.

**Alternative Approaches**: Companies increasingly explored microdosing studies, organ-on-a-chip technologies, and humanized mouse models to better predict human outcomes. However, animal models remained the standard regulatory requirement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Human biomarkers leading companies to advance compounds despite poor animal data**: This prediction partially materialized. The use of biomarkers increased substantially across drug development, particularly in oncology and rare diseases. However, most companies remained extremely cautious about advancing compounds with poor animal data, as regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) still required extensive animal safety testing. The biomarker revolution helped select which good compounds to prioritize rather than rescue bad ones.

• **Many useful drugs being abandoned as false negatives**: This concern remains largely unquantified and unresolved. While the industry acknowledged the likelihood of false negatives, systematic efforts to rescue abandoned compounds remained limited due to practical and commercial constraints. Some academic efforts attempted to "repurpose" failed drugs, but these rarely involved compounds that failed early-stage assays.

• **The fundamental approach remaining unchanged**: This prediction proved accurate. Despite advances in technology, pharmaceutical drug discovery in 2024-2025 still relies heavily on animal models for regulatory submissions and decision-making, though with better characterization of model limitations and increasing use of complementary approaches like organoids and computational predictions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

While prescient about ongoing challenges in drug development, the article focuses on well-known limitations already familiar to the field rather than breakthrough insights, limiting its long-term importance. The specific Schering-Plough example provides some historical interest, but the overall themes remained standard industry concerns rather than novel predictions.
