# Drisapersen at the FDA Today (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the FDA hearing for Biomarin's drug drisapersen, a proposed treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It notes that the drug had experienced a very difficult development path, with questionable efficacy and significant safety concerns at the time of the hearing. However, drisapersen represented the first potential treatment ever to be approved for DMD, creating a difficult regulatory decision for the FDA panel between approving a drug with uncertain benefits and real risks versus providing no treatment option at all for this devastating disease.

## 2. HISTORY
The FDA advisory panel voted against recommending approval of drisapersen in November 2015, citing insufficient evidence of efficacy and significant safety concerns including kidney toxicity and thrombocytopenia. In January 2016, the FDA formally rejected drisapersen, requiring additional clinical trials to demonstrate effectiveness. Biomarin subsequently terminated the drisapersen program and withdrew its marketing applications globally. This was the second major failure for exon-skipping DMD drugs, following Prosensa's earlier setback. However, the regulatory precedent and patient advocacy momentum from these hearings contributed to the FDA's later approval of another exon-skipping drug, Sarepta's eteplirsen, in September 2016 under accelerated approval despite continued controversy about its efficacy data. The DMD treatment landscape has since evolved with additional exon-skipping drugs and gene therapy approaches entering the market, with varying levels of evidence for clinical benefit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain specific predictions about future outcomes, instead focusing on the immediate regulatory decision facing the FDA panel regarding drisapersen's approval.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: 7/10

This article captures a pivotal moment in rare disease drug development and regulatory decision-making, illustrating the tension between evidence-based medicine and patient demand for treatments when no alternatives exist.
