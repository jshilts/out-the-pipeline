# Chemistry Incident in Manchester (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a laboratory incident at the University of Manchester that occurred in March 2015, which led to the evacuation of a chemistry building and the response of hazmat teams. Initial press reports indicated that the incident involved a peroxide-acetone mixture that had crystallized, potentially forming triacetone triperoxide (TATP) - an explosive compound. The incident was later clarified to have occurred in the Pariser engineering building rather than the chemistry department, involving a researcher working on sustainable plastics research who combined acetone and peroxide. The researcher left the mixture sitting for some time, after which crystalline precipitate formed, triggering the emergency response.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 Manchester incident highlighted ongoing laboratory safety challenges in academic research settings. In subsequent years, laboratory safety protocols at UK universities underwent increased scrutiny and strengthening, with institutions implementing more rigorous training programs for researchers working with potentially hazardous materials. The incident served as a cautionary example in laboratory safety training materials. However, the sustainable plastics research area mentioned in the article continued to develop independently of this specific incident. The broader field of green chemistry and sustainable materials research expanded significantly in the years following 2015, with numerous academic and industrial research programs advancing biodegradable polymers and environmentally friendly plastic alternatives.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit concern about laboratory safety**: The article expressed concern about laboratory safety practices and the potential for dangerous incidents. Subsequent developments saw increased attention to laboratory safety in academic settings, with universities implementing more stringent protocols and training requirements.

• **Assumption about chemistry department safety awareness**: The article suggested that chemistry department personnel would be aware of the hazards of peroxide-acetone mixtures. The actual incident occurring in an engineering building highlighted the need for interdisciplinary safety training across all departments handling chemicals.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The incident served as an important safety reminder for the research community, but represents a relatively routine type of laboratory safety incident that occurs periodically at academic institutions rather than a landmark event with significant long-term implications.
