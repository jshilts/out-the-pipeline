# The Current Kudzu of Chemistry? (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This short commentary by Derek Lowe reflects on periodic "fads" in chemistry research—topics that temporarily dominate publication volume, sometimes with marginal scientific value. Lowe uses the metaphor of kudzu (an invasive vine) to describe fields that overtake the literature, noting past examples: cis-jasmone synthesis (1970s), triquinane synthesis, and ionic liquids. He then asks what the current "kudzu" is, citing a colleague's nomination of BODIPY—a class of fluorescent dyes—for which "you can apparently get anything published." Lowe also mentions nanostructures as a past candidate that has become somewhat harder to publish, though glowing fluorescent vials remain common, especially when they contain BODIPY compounds. The piece frames the problem as "chemistry, like any other human-run endeavor, goes through cycles and fads."

## 2. HISTORY

BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) fluorophores have remained a persistent, though more normalized, research area since 2013. They solidified their role as workhorse dyes in cell imaging, sensing, and labeling due to their high fluorescence quantum yields, photostability, and tunable emission across the visible spectrum. Major applications have included probes for reactive oxygen species, metal ions, biomolecules, and organelle-specific imaging in live cells. BODIPY scaffolds are also used in light-harvesting arrays, OLEDs, fluorescent tags for flow cytometry and super-resolution microscopy, laser dyes, and photocatalysis. While the "kudzu" rush subsided, the field matured and diversified into genuinely useful applications—BODIPY fluorophores are now standard tools in chemical biology and materials science rather than novelty topics. Nanostructure papers also evolved away from simply reporting new nanomaterials toward functional devices, biomedical applications, and mechanistic studies, with greater emphasis on reproducibility.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **BODIPY as the current kudzu**: The article's tone suggests BODIPY publications were seen as opportunistic/low-bar contributions, resembling prior fads like ionic liquids.
  - **Outcome**: BODIPY research did not disappear but matured. The publication surge tapered rather than crashed, and the focus shifted toward practical uses in bioimaging, sensors, photovoltaics, and optoelectronics. The field now blends synthesis with applications, making it less of a "kudzu" and more of a stable toolset.
- **Nanostructure papers easing off**: Lowe notes it was becoming harder to publish any nanostructure result, implying a moderation of the boom.
  - **Outcome**: Nanostructure research persisted but became more selective and application-driven. Funding and publication priorities moved toward functional performance, scalability, and safety/toxicity, reducing the earlier flood of structure-only reports.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

Lightweight blog commentary with limited lasting insight; primarily captures fleeting publication trends through a cynical metaphor. It offers no substantive critique of methodology, funding, or reproducibility, and has no bearing on clinical outcomes or policy.
