# Acorda and Ampyra (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses Acorda Therapeutics' newly approved multiple sclerosis drug Ampyra (fampridine), which is indicated to improve gait and walking speed in MS patients. The article notes divided opinions on the drug's potential market success. What makes Ampyra particularly interesting is its chemical structure: it's simply 4-aminopyridine, an old, simple, low-molecular-weight compound that had been known for decades as a ligand for neuronal voltage-gated potassium channels and was previously even used as a bird-control poison. The compound itself couldn't be patented due to its age and prior art, so Acorda's intellectual property hinged instead on developing a proprietary timed-release formulation and conducting the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy. The article explores the business and regulatory implications of turning a known chemical into a pharmaceutical product through formulation innovation.

## 2. HISTORY

Ampyra (fampridine) was approved by the FDA on January 22, 2010, based on clinical trials showing modest benefits in walking speed for some MS patients. The drug did find commercial success despite its simplicity—Acorda generated substantial revenue, with Ampyra sales reaching approximately $\$$257 million in 2015 and remaining a significant product. However, this success proved finite: in 2017–2018, Acorda faced patent challenges and lost key formulation patents, leading to generic competition. On January 31, 2020, Apotex launched a generic version, and additional generic approvals (including Teva in 2021) drove down pricing. Sales declined steeply, falling to about $\$$88 million in 2019 and continuing to drop. Acorda struggled financially in subsequent years, selling its headquarters and undergoing multiple rounds of layoffs. Amid these pressures, in March 2024 Acorda announced it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, making Ampyra an example of how formulation-based exclusivity can launch a lucrative therapy but leave the company vulnerable when that protection expires.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction: The drug's market success would be decided soon, with opinion divided on how efficacious it would be.**  
  - **Outcome**: Ampyra did achieve meaningful commercial success for nearly a decade, with peak annual sales around $\$$257 million. The skepticism around efficacy mirrored broader clinical experience: benefits were modest and limited to a subset of patients.

- **Prediction: It would be surprising if an even simpler, lower molecular weight oral drug were approved in the next few years.**  
  - **Outcome**: This prediction held reasonably well. Small-molecule repurposing continued, but 4-aminopyridine remained a poster child for minimal, repurposed pharmacophores, and few newer oral drugs were notably simpler.

- **Prediction: Acorda would "reap the fruits of their labors, if fruits there are."**  
  - **Outcome**: Initially correct. Acorda profited significantly from its formulation-and-clinical-trial strategy, but those fruits proved temporary once formulation patents were overturned and generics entered the market.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**  
Ampyra became a canonical case study in pharmaceutical repurposing, formulation-driven IP, and the market lifecycle of a niche neurology product—an illuminating real-world test of the strategy described in the article.
