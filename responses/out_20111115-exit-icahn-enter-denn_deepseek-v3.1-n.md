# Exit Icahn, Enter Denner? (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports that Carl Icahn's chief biotech strategist Alex Denner had left Icahn's employ after five years, with speculation that Icahn himself might be reducing his involvement in biotech investments. However, the article notes that Denner appeared to be starting his own hedge fund, suggesting he might continue similar biotech investment strategies independently.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2011 article, Alex Denner did indeed launch his own healthcare hedge fund called Sarissa Capital Management in 2012. The fund focused on activist investments in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, following a similar playbook to what had been used during his time with Icahn. Sarissa became known for taking significant stakes in companies like Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Biogen, and Viking Therapeutics, often pushing for changes in management, strategic direction, or acquisitions. Denner took board seats at multiple companies and was involved in several high-profile biotech deals. Carl Icahn did continue some biotech and healthcare investments but at a reduced frequency compared to the aggressive period when Denner worked for him. The trend of activist investors targeting biotech companies continued beyond both Icahn and Denner, with firms like Starboard Value, Elliott Management, and others becoming increasingly active in the sector.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained no explicit predictions about future events or outcomes. It was primarily observational reporting about personnel changes and potential implications for biotech investment activity.

## 4. INTEREST
**6/9** - The article marked a notable transition point in biotech activist investing, with a key player moving from one influential fund to establishing their own firm, but it was primarily of interest to those following financial dynamics rather than scientific or clinical developments in biotechnology.
