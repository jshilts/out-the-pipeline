# When Reagents Attack! (Feb 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post by Derek Lowe describes dangerous incidents involving chemical reagents that behaved unexpectedly or violently. The author shares a personal experience where para-methoxybenzyl chloride, prepared from benzyl alcohol and concentrated HCl, exploded in his laboratory hood during storage. He also references a previous incident involving sulfenyl chlorides where he "came down counting fingers" - a severe safety incident. The post serves as a solicitation for other chemists to share their own experiences with unexpectedly dangerous compounds, framing it within the context of understanding reagent hazards in chemical and biotechnology research.

## 2. HISTORY
This 2012 blog post represents one entry in Derek Lowe's long-running "In the Pipeline" blog, which began at Corante in 2002, moved to Science Translational Medicine in 2010, and continues today. The blog has become one of the most widely read sources in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical industry commentary, known for its frank discussions of both scientific challenges and safety issues in drug discovery.

The incident Lowe references involving sulfenyl chlorides (linked from 2004) became a well-known cautionary tale in chemical safety education. Subsequent developments in laboratory safety have emphasized the importance of:
- Proper risk assessment for hazardous reagents
- Improved chemical storage protocols
- Better training on reactive chemical hazards
- Implementation of Process Safety Management (PSM) in industrial settings

However, laboratory accidents have continued to occur. Notable incidents included the 2016 death of a research assistant at UCLA from burns caused by tert-butyllithium, and various other fire and explosion incidents in research settings, many involving similar unexpectedly reactive compounds.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. It was retrospective in nature, documenting past safety incidents with the goal of sharing lessons learned with the broader chemical community.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **5/10**

This ranks as moderately interesting - while it highlights important safety issues relevant to chemical and biotechnology research, it's primarily anecdotal rather than focusing on major scientific breakthroughs or long-term industrial developments that would have lasting impact on the field.
