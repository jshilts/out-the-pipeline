# More Movements at the Top of GSK (Nov 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a period of significant management turmoil and strategic shifts at GlaxoSmithKline between roughly 2014-2017. In 2014, GSK moved assets out of oncology toward higher-volume, lower-cost areas, including cutting back R&D operations. CEO Andrew Witty faced investor criticism and stepped down in March 2016. Key leadership departures included vaccines head Moncef Slaoui and later R&D chair Patrick Vallance. Emma Walmsley, coming from GSK's consumer healthcare division, became the new CEO in 2017. The company underwent multiple R&D reorganizations and was described as having experienced a "lost decade" with fewer successes than expected. The article particularly notes Hal Barron's appointment as the new R&D head in late 2017, leaving his position at Google's anti-aging startup Calico.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication in November 2017, GSK indeed pursued a return to focusing on pharmaceuticals under Emma Walmsley's leadership. Walter's major moves included divesting GSK's consumer healthcare business, which became Haleon in 2022. The company heavily invested in oncology again, through acquisitions and internal development. The 2017 timelines have proved to have mixed outcomes: Walter remained CEO until the announced separation of the company into New GSK and Haleon (consumer brands). Hal Barron left his R&D head role in August 2022 to become CEO of Altos Labs; his tenure at GSK was around five years. Vaccines was strengthened and became a core pillar. After the article's cutoff, GSK moved robustly back into oncology and immunology, but the delayed pivot likely weakened its competitive position compared to peers. The "lost decade" characterization captures the 2010-2020 period well, before reorganization sharpened focus on innovative medicines and vaccines. The Calico initiative continued quietly but its high profile faded after key personnel departures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction (implied):** Emma Walmsley's consumer background might not mesh with a renewed pharma focus. → **Outcome:** Walter did pivot GSK toward a stronger pharma focus, divesting the consumer unit and rebuilding oncology. This proved aligned with strategy, though the transition took several years.
- **Prediction (implied):** Hal Barron's move signaled continued turbulence at Calico/Google. → **Outcome:** Calico became lower profile; Barron later left GSK R&D to lead Altos Labs, reinforcing the trend of star R&D leaders cycling between industry and high-profile biotech ventures.
- **Prediction (implied):** The unwinding of prior R&D ideas suggests lingering "lost decade" impacts. → **Outcome:** GSK did rebuild momentum in key therapeutic areas (e.g., immuno-oncology, HIV, vaccines) after 2017, but had been substantially underperforming for years.
- **Prediction (implied):** The succession of leadership changes could compound R&D instability. → **Outcome:** R&D leadership churn did continue; Barron's departure in 2022 meant another transition, reflecting broader industry turnover patterns.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**
It captures a specific moment of leadership musical chairs and strategic zigzags at a major pharma, which is moderately interesting industrially but not pivotal for biotech science or patient outcomes.
