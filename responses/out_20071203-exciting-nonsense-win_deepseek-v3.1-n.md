# Exciting Nonsense Wins Another One (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on the "pyridinium follies" - recent retracted scientific papers involving pyridinium compounds - as a cautionary tale about scientific discovery. The author identifies two opposing errors that scientists commonly face when evaluating new ideas. The first error is becoming too enamored with one's own ideas, leading to what the author calls "intellectual excitement" akin to sexual arousal, where legitimate objections are dismissed and proper due diligence (like checking known chemistry or obtaining X-ray structures) is skipped in the rush of discovery. 

The second error is excessive pessimism - assuming any truly good idea would already be known, leading scientists to discard unusual experimental results and avoid pursuing novel concepts altogether. The author argues that great scientific ideas naturally induce this excited state, making it difficult to maintain objectivity. The article uses the recent pyridinium retractions as a springboard to discuss the broader challenge of navigating between reckless enthusiasm and paralyzing skepticism in scientific research.

## 2. HISTORY

The article itself has proven prescient rather than outdated. The specific "pyridinium follies" referenced were likely retracted papers that failed to properly validate their chemical claims, but the broader pattern described has repeated numerous times since 2007.

The issue of scientific retractions has become more prominent in the intervening years, with high-profile cases like the STAP stem cell controversy (2014), various psychology replication crises, and numerous biomedical retractions. The tension between innovation and rigorous validation that the author identified remains central to scientific practice today. Notably, the rise of preprint servers and open science movements represent institutional responses to these challenges, aiming to catch errors earlier while still allowing novel ideas to circulate.

Interestingly, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have since developed more systematic approaches to the "two errors" problem through portfolio management strategies that balance high-risk innovative projects with more conservative development programs, and through enhanced gatekeeping processes in drug discovery pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article makes one explicit prediction:
• **"We're going to have to relearn them again and again – doomed, if like"** and "We'll have these problems with us always" - **ACCURATE**: The fundamental tension between scientific innovation and rigorous validation has persisted. High-profile retractions and scientific misconduct cases have continued occurring regularly since 2007.

The implicit predictions embedded in the argument:
• **The described psychological dynamics will remain inherent to scientific discovery** - **ACCURATE**: The cognitive biases the author identifies (excitement over new ideas, fear of being wrong) continue to be documented in studies of scientific behavior and have not been eliminated by better institutional processes.

• **The specific error pattern (dismissing objections during exciting discoveries) will recur** - **ACCURATE**: Numerous subsequent cases, from the arsenic-based life controversy to various cancer research retractions, have shown similar patterns where researchers became too committed to exciting but ultimately incorrect findings.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

This is an above-average blog post that captures an important tension in scientific practice. The writing is engaging and the psychological insights remain relevant. However, it lacks the broad significance or systematic analysis that would warrant a higher score - it's essentially a thoughtful meditation on a recurring problem rather than a comprehensive analysis or groundbreaking insight.
