# Trifluoromethylation, The Easy Way? (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights a Nature paper from the MacMillan lab presenting a novel trifluoromethylation method using visible-light photoredox catalysis. The technique employs ruthenium or iridium catalysts with blue LEDs or fluorescent light to incorporate CF₃ groups into organic molecules—a valuable transformation for medicinal chemistry, though requiring judicious use. The piece notes that photochemistry had been relatively neglected, especially UV-based approaches, and identifies the MacMillan, Stephenson, and Yoon labs as leaders in this emerging area. The author positions visible-light photoredox as a promising route to revive photochemistry and expand the synthetic toolkit for creating useful CF₃-bearing molecules.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2011 Nature paper, visible-light photoredox catalysis rapidly expanded into a mainstream synthetic methodology. The MacMillan, Stephenson, and Yoon groups continued leading development, alongside many others (e.g., Doyle, Rovis, Nicewicz, Molander), establishing Ru(bpy)₃²⁺ and fac-Ir(ppy)₃ as workhorse catalysts and moving beyond CF₃ to diverse radical-mediated couplings. The field prioritized mild conditions (room temperature, visible light) and tolerated a wide range of functional groups, streamlining fragment coupling in medicinal chemistry and enabling late-stage functionalization.

Several photoredox-enabled transformations entered drug-discovery workflows, reducing reliance on traditional stoichiometric reagents and cryogenic or high-temperature conditions. In parallel, continuous-flow photoreactors and LED light sources became routine in synthesis labs, improving reproducibility and scalability. Catalyst classes broadened to include organic dyes, acridinium salts, and dual catalytic systems combining photoredox with nickel, copper, or cobalt for cross-coupling. By the late 2010s, photoredox was regularly used in route-scouting and library synthesis at pharmaceutical companies and CROs.

Methodologies from this period have contributed to routes of FDA-approved drugs and candidate pipelines—examples include late-stage CH functionalization in complex molecules and streamlined access to CF₃-containing building blocks—though the impact typically appears via faster lead optimization rather than a single "photoredox drug." The ease of CF₃ installation improved, but many practical routes still combine multiple approaches depending on substrate. Overall, photoredox catalysis became a standard part of the synthetic toolbox, widely adopted alongside traditional methods rather than replacing them, and continued to evolve with machine learning-guided reaction discovery and improved reactor design.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Visible-light photoredox would expand the synthetic toolkit and help revive photochemistry.** This largely came true: photoredox grew from a niche to a mainstream methodology used in academic and industrial labs; continuous-flow photoreactors and LED arrays became common tools; the approach enabled many new bond-forming reactions under mild conditions.
- **Labs to watch: MacMillan (Princeton), Corey Stephenson (BU), and Tehshik Yoon (Wisconsin) would be central.** This was accurate. Each group produced foundational papers and trained many students in photoredox catalysis, and their labs remained highly influential.
- **An "easy" trifluoromethylation would be useful, though restraint in drug design would still be needed.** The method simplified CF₃ incorporation in many contexts, but ease remains substrate-dependent and multiple other CF₃ sources and catalysts coexist in practice; the medicinal chemistry community continued to weigh lipophilicity and metabolic stability trade-offs for any perfluoroalkyl group.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article captured the early momentum of visible-light photoredox and accurately identified the labs and trends that defined the next decade of synthetic methodology, with broad industrial adoption and lasting impact on chemical synthesis.
