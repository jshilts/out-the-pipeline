# How Many Elements Have You Used, As Elements? (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a personal reflection by a chemist who tallies how many chemical elements they have used in their **elemental form** throughout their career. The author lists 24 elements (later updated to 26 in the comments): Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sodium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Argon, Potassium, Iron, Nickel, Copper, Zinc, Selenium, Bromine, Ruthenium, Rhodium, Palladium, Silver, Tin, Iodine, Platinum, and Mercury. For each element, the author briefly describes the specific chemical application or experiment, ranging from hydrogenations and inert atmospheres (Helium, Argon) to reductions (Tin, Zinc) and catalysis (Palladium, Platinum). The article is framed as a lighthearted, introspective exercise prompted by a blog post, rather than a formal scientific analysis.

## 2. HISTORY

The original **Corante blogs**, including Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline," were discontinued by Corante in 2015. Lowe's blog was subsequently moved to **Science Translational Medicine** under the AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) and later became an independent blog hosted at **Science Magazine**.

The article itself is a commentary on a chemist's personal history and does not make claims about future developments in chemistry. As such, there are no direct real-world implications to track regarding drug approvals, policy changes, or business growth based on its content. The post remains a well-read example of the "elemental count" thought experiment within the chemistry community.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author does not make any predictions about the future of biotechnology or chemistry in this article. This is a count of past laboratory experiences, not a forecast of future trends.

*   **Subsequent relevance:** The thought experiment itself has remained a recurring topic of discussion on chemistry blogs and forums. Lowe's article is often cited as a starting point for these discussions. No specific predictions were made to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating:** **2/10**

This is an engaging piece of scientific trivia and personal history that provides a valuable human-scale perspective on laboratory work. However, it's a narrow, self-contained anecdote with no broader scientific, technological, or industrial impact, making it of low general interest in the context of significant biotech developments.
