# Learning Some Science, At Last (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary article reflecting on a Financial Times piece by Rupert Pennant-Rea, a well-educated British establishment figure (former editor of The Economist and deputy governor of the Bank of England) who at age 70 decided to finally learn basic science. The article highlights Pennant-Rea's astonishing admission that he had never heard of the periodic table until age 70, despite his elite education and distinguished career. The author (a scientist) expresses shock at this educational gap while applauding Pennant-Rea's late-life effort to remedy it, framing it as a real-world example of C.P. Snow's "Two Cultures" divide between the sciences and humanities.

Pennant-Rea's journey began with basic chemistry, physics, and biology—topics completely foreign to him despite his classical education focused on ancient Greek. The article emphasizes how Pennant-Rea found chemistry especially revelatory, describing the periodic table as resembling "a great painting or symphony" and finding wonder in simple kitchen experiments with acids and alkalis.

## 2. HISTORY

The immediate year following this article (2019-2020) saw multiple related developments:

- **Public engagement momentum**: The "Two Cultures" discussion gained renewed traction in educational circles, with several UK publications running follow-up pieces on scientific literacy gaps among humanities-educated elites.

- **COVID-19 impact (2020-onward)**: The pandemic dramatically elevated public awareness of scientific concepts—from R0 values and exponential growth to mRNA technology and clinical trial phases. This created an unprecedented moment where scientific literacy became urgent for policymakers and the public alike, making Pennant-Rea's 2019 decision particularly prescient.

- **Educational policy discussions**: While no major structural reforms immediately resulted, the pandemic years (2020-2023) intensified debates about STEM education requirements and interdisciplinary literacy in higher education.

- **Public health communication challenges**: The crisis highlighted the real-world consequences of scientific illiteracy among decision-makers and media figures, amplifying the urgency of the educational gap Pennant-Rea had highlighted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No specific explicit predictions appear in the article. Pennant-Rea's story is presented as a personal educational journey rather than a call for systemic change. The author's commentary is primarily reflective rather than predictive.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

While the article addresses an important topic about educational gaps between the sciences and humanities, it serves primarily as commentary on a personal story rather than offering novel analysis or directly actionable insights. The case study is interesting but the discussion remains at the anecdotal level, scoring in the middle decile of interest for readers seeking insight into the biotechnology sector or substantive policy discussions.
