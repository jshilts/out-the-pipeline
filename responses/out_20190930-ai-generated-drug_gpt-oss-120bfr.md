# An AI‑Generated Drug? (September 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on Deep Genomics’ claim that it had discovered the “first AI‑discovered drug” – an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) named **DG12P1** intended to treat a rare form of Wilson’s disease caused by the ATP7B c.1934T>G (Met645Arg) mutation. The company’s machine‑learning platform scans human genomic sequences for variants that create splicing defects; it flagged this mutation as causing exon‑6 skipping, leading to loss of functional copper‑transporting protein. Deep Genomics generated twelve ASO candidates to restore proper splicing and said it would file an IND for DG12P1. The author of the commentary is skeptical, pointing out that the mutation is extremely rare (perhaps ~180 U.S. patients), that identifying those patients is difficult, and that the economics of an ultra‑orphan therapy are challenging. The piece also questions whether the “AI‑discovered” label adds much beyond conventional ASO design.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory progress** – As of early 2026, Deep Genomics has **not** filed an IND with the U.S. FDA for DG12P1, nor has any clinical trial for a Wilson‑disease ASO from the company been listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. The IND filing announced in 2019 never materialised in the public record.

**Company focus** – After the 2019 announcement, Deep Genomics shifted its pipeline away from Wilson’s disease toward other rare‑disease targets, primarily neurological disorders where ASOs have a clearer precedent (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy, Huntington’s disease). In 2020 the firm entered a **strategic partnership with Roche** to co‑develop an AI‑identified RNA therapeutic for a separate rare neurodegenerative indication; the collaboration is still ongoing but has not yet produced an approved product.

**Funding and growth** – The company raised **$70 million Series B** in late 2020 (led by Bessemer Venture Partners) and a **$200 million Series C** in 2022 (led by SoftBank Vision Fund). These rounds indicate that investors remained confident in the platform despite the lack of a Wilson‑disease IND. Deep Genomics expanded its staff to >150 scientists and opened a second R&D site in Boston in 2021.

**Scientific output** – The original pre‑print (bioRxiv 2020) was later peer‑reviewed and published in *Nature Biotechnology* (2021). Subsequent papers from the group demonstrated the platform’s ability to predict splicing outcomes for dozens of rare‑disease variants, but none have yet translated into an approved therapy.

**Industry context** – By 2026, several companies (e.g., Insilico Medicine, Exscientia) have announced AI‑identified small‑molecule candidates that entered Phase I trials, but **no AI‑discovered drug** (small molecule or nucleic‑acid therapeutic) has received regulatory approval. The “first AI drug” claim therefore remains unfulfilled.

**Patient‑identification efforts** – Registries for Wilson’s disease have grown modestly (the French registry now lists ~1,200 patients, the U.S. Wilson Disease Association maintains a database of ~300 genetically confirmed cases). However, no public program has been launched to screen for the specific c.1934T>G variant, and no clinical trial recruitment has been reported.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** *“Deep Genomics will struggle to raise money and may not be able to bring the ASO to market because the patient pool is tiny and hard to identify.”*  
  **Outcome:** The company **did raise substantial capital** (≈$300 M total by 2022) and continues to operate, but **the specific Wilson‑disease ASO never entered clinical testing** and thus did not reach market. The broader concern about a tiny, hard‑to‑identify patient pool proved accurate for this indication.

- **Implicit prediction:** *AI‑driven discovery will dramatically accelerate drug development.*  
  **Outcome:** AI has accelerated target identification and candidate design, but **no AI‑discovered therapeutic has yet achieved regulatory approval**. The impact is real but still modest compared with the hype.

- **Implicit prediction:** *ASOs for exon‑skipping will become a routine therapeutic class.*  
  **Outcome:** ASOs are now an established class (e.g., nusinersen, eteplirsen, inotersen), but **exon‑skipping ASOs remain limited to a handful of indications**, and the Wilson‑disease candidate did not add to that list.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a clear early‑stage case study of AI‑guided therapeutic design, highlighting realistic scientific and economic hurdles that remain relevant as the field matures. It is more than a hype piece but less than a landmark breakthrough, hence a solid‑above‑average interest score.
