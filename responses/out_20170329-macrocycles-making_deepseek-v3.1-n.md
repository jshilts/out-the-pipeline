# Macrocycles For the Making (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 article by Derek Lowe discusses a Nature Chemistry paper from a University of Toronto group reporting a novel method for synthesizing macrocycles. The technique uses an isonitrile phosphorane reagent to cyclize compounds containing an amine and a carboxylic acid, forming oxadiazole macrocycles. The method adds two carbons from an aldehyde, converting an X-atom chain into an X+2-sized ring structure.

The paper demonstrated the approach with oligopeptides, creating 15- to 24-membered ring macrocycles with yields ranging from roughly 30-60%. The authors noted enhanced cell permeability in PAMPA assays compared to open-chain precursors. Lowe speculated the method could extend beyond peptides to any structures with appropriately positioned amine and carboxylic acid groups. He also mentioned that the researchers behind this work were founders of Encycle Therapeutics, suggesting commercial interest in the technology.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2017 publication, macrocycle drug development continued to evolve, though specific outcomes for this particular oxadiazole macrocycle technology remain unclear without access to detailed drug pipeline data. The field of macrocyclic drugs saw several notable developments in subsequent years.

Macrocyclic compounds maintained interest due to their potential to target challenging protein-protein interactions and their cell permeability advantages mentioned in the article. However, the pharmaceutical industry continued facing synthetic challenges that the Toronto group's method aimed to address. The drug development timeline from discovery to approval typically takes 10-15 years, so any drugs originating from this 2017 technology would likely still be in development phases. Without specific details about Encycle Therapeutics' pipeline progress, clinical trial data, or FDA approvals, I cannot provide concrete outcomes for this particular synthetic methodology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions and speculations:

• **Method applicability beyond peptides**: Lowe predicted the oxadiazole macrocycle synthesis would work on non-peptide structures with amines and carboxylic acids. This appears chemically plausible, though I cannot verify specific synthetic achievements or publications demonstrating this extension without current research database access.

• **Commercial development through Encycle Therapeutics**: The article noted the researchers founded Encycle Therapeutics, implying commercial potential. Without current information on the company's status, pipeline drugs, clinical trials, or business outcomes, I cannot evaluate the commercial success of this specific technology platform.

• **Enhanced cell permeability utility**: The PAMPA assay results suggested these macrocycles could overcome cell membrane permeability challenges. Whether this translated to actual drug candidates with improved bioavailability in vivo or clinical success remains unknown without access to later development data.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article describes a specific chemical synthesis technique with potential pharmaceutical applications, but given limited information about subsequent developments, real-world impact, drug approvals, or commercial success, it ranks relatively modestly. Without demonstrated clinical or commercial outcomes from the technology, it represents a potentially useful method rather than a transformative breakthrough.
