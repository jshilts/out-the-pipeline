# Biogen's Bad Week (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on Biogen's challenging week in July 2015, triggered by disappointing Alzheimer's antibody clinical trial results and downward revisions to the company's 2015 earnings forecast. The article provides context by noting Biogen's stock dropped approximately 18% (about $70 per share) following these developments, creating concern among shareholders about the company's pipeline and future prospects.

Despite the short-term setback, the author emphasizes perspective: while Biogen faced immediate challenges, the company had delivered exceptional 485% returns over the preceding five-year period, dramatically outperforming major indices. The piece acknowledges the inherent volatility and high failure rate of drug development (approximately 10% clinical trial success rate) while suggesting that long-term Biogen investors had little reason for serious complaint given the company's historical performance.

## 2. HISTORY

The Alzheimer's antibody referenced in the 2015 article was aducanumab (later branded Aduhelm), Biogen's amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibody. This drug would follow a remarkably controversial path in subsequent years:

**Clinical Development and FDA Approval:**
- In March 2019, Biogen announced it was halting two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab (ENGAGE and EMERGE) after an independent committee determined the drug was unlikely to meet primary endpoints
- However, after post-hoc analysis of one trial showed some positive signals, Biogen reversed course and pursued FDA approval
- In June 2021, the FDA approved aducanumab under the accelerated approval pathway despite significant controversy, as the agency's independent advisory committee had voted against approval and many experts questioned the evidence of clinical benefit

**Post-Approval Experience:**
- Aduhelm's launch was exceptionally poor, with very limited patient uptake due to lack of insurance coverage, physician skepticism, and questions about efficacy
- The drug faced numerous challenges including limited Medicare coverage decisions and institutional reluctance to prescribe
- Biogen subsequently discontinued development and commercialization efforts, marking one of the most controversial drug approvals in recent FDA history

**Financial and Strategic Impact:**
- Biogen's stock performance remained volatile, with the company facing ongoing pipeline challenges beyond Alzheimer's
- The company pursued various strategic initiatives including acquisitions (though the mentioned Isis Pharmaceuticals rumors did not result in Biogen acquisition)
- The experience highlighted the broader challenges in Alzheimer's drug development, where numerous amyloid-targeting approaches failed despite billions in investment

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make specific explicit predictions about future outcomes, but rather provided commentary on the immediate situation and broader context about drug development risks. However, the piece implicitly addressed several themes:

• **Investment Risk/Reward Dynamics**: The observation that "hardly anything ever goes that well in this business for that long" proved prescient, as Biogen's exceptional five-year run (485% gains) was indeed unsustainable, and the company faced ongoing volatility in subsequent years

• **Alzheimer's Drug Development Challenges**: While not explicitly predicting failure, the article's emphasis on the 10% clinical trial success rate and inherent drug development risks accurately foreshadowed the difficulties Biogen would face with aducanumab, which ultimately had weak evidence and poor market acceptance despite FDA approval

• **Pipeline and Strategic Concerns**: The questions raised about Biogen's pipeline and potential acquisitions reflected valid ongoing challenges the company would continue to face in subsequent years

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides valuable perspective on the intersection of drug development science, business performance, and investor expectations, with particular significance given what would unfold with Biogen's controversial Alzheimer's drug in subsequent years. The timing captures Biogen at a pivotal moment before major regulatory and commercialization challenges that would prove highly instructive about drug development realities.
