The purported advantage of secnidazole for treating bacterial vaginosis was its single-dose administration compared to longer treatment courses of existing alternatives like metronidazole. The author notes that the Phase III trial is essentially a formality since the drug's safety and efficacy were already well-established through decades of international use. The key business challenge identified is whether payers will view the convenience advantage as worth the premium pricing for what is essentially a repurposed generic drug.
