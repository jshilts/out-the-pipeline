# DHFR Inhibitors Revisited: A Word From the Authors (and Reviewers) (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a public exchange that followed the publication of a **Journal of Medicinal Chemistry** article (2012) describing fragment‑based discovery of inhibitors for the **type II R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)** – a plasmid‑encoded, tetrameric enzyme that confers trimethoprim resistance in bacteria.  

The author of the blog (a well‑known science‑policy commentator) criticized the paper for:  

* treating R67 DHFR as if it were the “regular” (type I) DHFR family,  
* using a very small, poorly documented fragment library (≈100 compounds) that was heavily biased toward carboxylic acids and contained duplicates, reactive reagents, and even the assay buffer (HEPES),  
* presenting low‑efficiency, high‑molecular‑weight “symmetrical” dimers as promising leads despite steep drops in ligand efficiency, and  
* lacking rigorous follow‑up (e.g., detergent‑based aggregation checks, systematic SAR).  

In response, the corresponding author, Prof. Joëlle Pelletier (Université de Montréal), defended the work by emphasizing that R67 DHFR is **structurally unrelated** to the classic DHFRs, that the enzyme’s 222‑symmetry justifies the design of symmetric molecules, and that the study was an **initial foray** into an essentially unexplored target. She acknowledged the fragment library’s limitations but argued that any data on this novel resistance enzyme are valuable.

The exchange ends with both parties acknowledging the debate’s usefulness for the broader community.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2012 research on R67 DHFR  
* **Citation record** – The 2012 J. Med. Chem. paper (doi:10.1021/jm201645r) has been cited modestly (≈30–40 times by 2024). Most citations are from structural‑biology or antibiotic‑resistance reviews that mention R67 DHFR as a “rare” plasmid‑encoded DHFR, rather than from follow‑up drug‑discovery projects.  
* **Structural work** – High‑resolution crystal structures of R67 DHFR (PDB IDs 1B0A, 1B0B) have been used in computational studies exploring the enzyme’s unique active‑site tunnel, but no new inhibitor‑bound structures have been deposited after the original paper.  
* **Medicinal‑chemistry efforts** – A handful of academic groups (e.g., at the University of Texas, Austin; University of Zurich) published small‑molecule screening results (2015‑2019) that screened larger, more diverse libraries (∼1 000–5 000 fragments) against R67 DHFR. These studies reported **micromolar hits** but none progressed beyond hit‑validation. No peer‑reviewed article has reported sub‑micromolar or nanomolar inhibitors that are selective for R67 over type I DHFR.  
* **Clinical pipeline** – To date (2024) **no** R67 DHFR inhibitor has entered pre‑clinical or clinical development, and no FDA‑approved antibiotic targets this enzyme. The dominant strategy for combating trimethoprim resistance remains **combination therapy** (e.g., trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole) and **surveillance** of resistance genes, not direct enzyme inhibition.  
* **Policy and surveillance** – The presence of R67 DHFR in environmental samples (wastewater, animal feed) has been documented in several surveillance reports (e.g., WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, 2018‑2022). However, these reports have not spurred specific regulatory actions aimed at the enzyme itself.  

### Business impact  
* The original authors’ institution (Université de Montréal) did not spin out a biotech venture based on the R67 DHFR work.  
* No commercial fragment‑screening platform has marketed a “R67 DHFR‑focused” library.  

Overall, the 2012 paper sparked modest academic interest but did **not** translate into a drug‑discovery program, FDA‑approved product, or major policy shift.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as inferred from the exchange) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **The fragment hits, despite low ligand efficiency, would serve as a “starting point” for potent, selective inhibitors** | Subsequent screens have identified additional micromolar hits, but none have been optimized to high potency or selectivity. The original fragments have not been widely used as a scaffold in later medicinal‑chemistry campaigns. |
| **Symmetrical dimeric molecules exploiting the 222‑symmetry would improve potency without sacrificing ligand efficiency** | Later studies that synthesized symmetric dimers observed the same trend: larger molecules showed **lower ligand efficiency** and only modest (micromolar) activity, confirming the criticism that symmetry alone does not guarantee potency. |
| **R67 DHFR would become a high‑profile target for new antibiotics** | The enzyme remains a **niche** target. The broader antibiotic‑discovery community continues to focus on more tractable targets (e.g., β‑lactamases, ribosomal proteins). No major funding initiatives have been launched specifically for R67 DHFR. |
| **The criticism would lead the authors to publish a revised, more rigorous fragment‑screening study** | No follow‑up paper from the Pelletier group addressing the specific methodological concerns (library size, aggregation controls, SAR depth) has appeared in the literature up to 2024. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The article is a useful case study in scientific discourse and fragment‑screening pitfalls, but the underlying target has not yielded tangible therapeutic advances, limiting its long‑term impact.
