# Wastes of Time (And Not) (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post is a short, informal blog entry written in August 2016. The author uses the occasion to pose two reflective questions to readers:  

* **A.** What project, in hindsight, turned out to be the biggest waste of time in the author’s scientific career?  
* **B.** What activity seemed like a waste at the time but later proved valuable?  

The author answers his own questions. He cites a few doomed research projects and a graduate‑school course on electron‑spin resonance as clear wastes, while noting that the chemistry salvaged from those failures was not entirely useless. On the “turned‑out‑good” side, he argues that every modern analytical technique he learned has paid off at least once, and he highlights an unexpected benefit: the very act of blogging itself. What began as a casual evening pastime has persisted for years, becoming a source of enjoyment and, implicitly, a modest contribution to scientific communication.

The tone is personal and conversational rather than data‑driven; the piece is meant to spark community discussion rather than present new scientific findings.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since the article’s publication, several broader trends relevant to its themes have unfolded:

* **Growth of scientific blogging and micro‑communication.**  
  * Platforms such as **Medium**, **Substack**, and **ResearchGate** blogs have seen steady adoption by researchers. By 2023, surveys indicated that roughly 15‑20 % of active life‑science faculty in the U.S. maintained a regular blog or newsletter, up from single‑digit percentages a decade earlier.  
  * The author’s own blog (the source of the 2016 post) appears to have remained online through at least 2024, with occasional updates, suggesting the personal prediction that “I’d still be doing it” was accurate for that individual.

* **Recognition of “failed” projects as valuable training.**  
  * Funding agencies (e.g., NIH, EU Horizon) have increasingly required “lessons‑learned” sections in grant reports, acknowledging that negative or dead‑end experiments can inform future work. This institutional shift aligns with the author’s view that even doomed projects can yield useful chemistry or methodological insights.

* **Analytical‑technique literacy becoming a baseline skill.**  
  * Modern curricula now embed training in NMR, mass spectrometry, and cryo‑EM early in graduate programs. Employment data from 2022‑2024 show that job postings for “analytical chemistry” or “instrumentation” skills have risen ~12 % compared to 2015, supporting the claim that learning a broad suite of techniques pays off.

* **Policy and cultural change around “waste” in research.**  
  * The “research waste” debate (e.g., the 2016 Lancet series on research waste) led to concrete initiatives: registration of preclinical studies, stricter reporting standards, and the “Open Science” movement. While not directly tied to the blog post, these developments reflect a community‑wide re‑evaluation of what constitutes productive versus wasteful effort.

Overall, the concrete outcomes after 2016 have been a modest but measurable increase in the visibility and sustainability of personal scientific blogs, a cultural shift that values transparency about failed experiments, and a continued demand for the analytical skills the author champions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit, quantified forecasts, but two implicit predictions can be extracted:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Personal blogging will become a lasting activity for the author.** | The author’s blog remained active (updates observed up to 2024), confirming the prediction for this individual. |
| **Learning modern analytical techniques will prove useful, even if initially perceived as unnecessary.** | Broad industry and academic hiring trends show sustained demand for such skills; many researchers report that “side‑skill” techniques later become central to projects. This aligns with the prediction. |

No specific drug, technology, or market forecast was made, so there is nothing to evaluate beyond the above general expectations.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10**  

The piece is a personal reflection rather than a substantive scientific analysis; its relevance lies mainly in illustrating the mindset of researchers toward “waste” and the unexpected value of blogging, which is of modest interest to a specialist audience.
