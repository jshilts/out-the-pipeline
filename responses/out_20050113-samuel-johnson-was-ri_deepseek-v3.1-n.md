# Samuel Johnson Was Right (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post from January 2005 is a personal reflection by a medicinal chemist on the tedious process of writing scientific papers. The author contrasts the relative ease of writing blog entries and magazine columns with the painstaking work required for peer-reviewed journal articles.

The core of the article describes the frustration of scientific publication: minimal actual text but extensive effort spent on figures, tables, data verification, and resolving discrepancies. The author notes that the research being published is already about three years old, making problem resolution more difficult. He compares the process to a construction project with "more parts than you're in the mood for."

Most tellingly, the author expresses ambivalence about this output. While acknowledging that several pieces of work have reached publication stage, he'd prefer they were "reaching a sick patient in a Phase III trial somewhere, or better yet, a pharmacy shelf" rather than appearing in journals like Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology landscape between 2005 and the present has been shaped by several major developments:

**R&D Productivity Crisis**: The period after 2005 saw continued recognition of declining R&D productivity in pharma, with fewer new drugs approved per R&D dollar spent. This phenomenon, sometimes called "Eroom's Law" (Moore's Law backwards), showed that despite increased spending, the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars of R&D spending was decreasing.

**Publication Practices**: Scientific publishing evolved with the growth of preprints, open access mandates, and increased scrutiny of reproducibility. The "publish or perish" culture the author describes remained prevalent, though with growing recognition of its limitations for advancing patient care.

**Computational Approaches**: Drug discovery increasingly incorporated computational methods, AI, and machine learning, though the translation from computational hits to approved drugs remained challenging and time-consuming.

**Regulatory Landscape**: FDA approval processes underwent various reforms, with breakthrough therapy designations and accelerated approval pathways introduced to speed promising therapies to patients.

**Industry Consolidation**: The period saw continued mergers and acquisitions in pharma, with many companies restructuring R&D operations in response to patent cliffs and pipeline challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

There are no explicit predictions about future developments in this reflective piece. The article is entirely retrospective and introspective about the author's immediate publication workload rather than forecasting industry trends or scientific breakthroughs.

The implicit concern about the gap between scientific publication and patient benefit is a recurring theme that remained relevant throughout the subsequent decades, but this wasn't framed as a prediction about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article ranks in the bottom half of interest as it's primarily a personal complaint about scientific publishing with little broader analysis or forward-looking insights. While it touches on the important gap between academic output and patient outcomes, it's more diary entry than substantive commentary on the biotechnology industry.
