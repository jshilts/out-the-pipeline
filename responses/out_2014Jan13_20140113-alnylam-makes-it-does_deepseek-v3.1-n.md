# Retrospective Analysis: "Alnylam Makes It (As Does RNAi?)"

## 1. SUMMARY

The 2014 Science Magazine article celebrated a pivotal moment for both Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and RNA interference (RNAi) technology. The author—who had previously expressed doubts about the company's survival—reported that Sanofi's $700 million investment for a 12% stake in Alnylam validated the clinical promise of patisiran, an RNAi therapeutic for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR). The article positioned this deal as RNAi's emergence from "a lengthy (and often overhyped) growth phase" into potentially realizing its therapeutic promise, with Alnylam pursuing multiple RNAi programs under their "5x15" strategy.

The piece captured the cautious optimism of someone who had witnessed RNAi's boom-bust cycle, viewing the Sanofi partnership as evidence that the field might finally transition from speculative promise to clinical reality, while acknowledging the technology's history of inflated expectations.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments vindicated both the article's cautious optimism and Alnylam's persistence:

**Regulatory Success (2018)**: Patisiran (brand name Onpattro) received FDA approval in August 2018, becoming the first RNAi therapeutic approved in the United States. The drug demonstrated significant efficacy in treating hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, validating both the delivery technology and therapeutic mechanism.

**Clinical Expansion**: Alnylam's pipeline flourished far beyond the original "5x15" strategy. The company successfully developed and commercialized multiple RNAi therapies:
- Onpattro (patisiran) - ATTR amyloidosis
- Givlaari (givosiran) - acute hepatic porphyria (approved 2019)
- Oxlumo (lumasiran) - primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (approved 2020)
- Leqvio (inclisiran) - hypercholesterolemia (partnered with Novartis, approved 2021)

**Delivery Breakthrough**: The successful development of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugate technology proved crucial, enabling targeted delivery to hepatocytes and resolving one of RNAi's fundamental challenges.

**Market Evolution**: RNAi emerged as a distinct therapeutic modality alongside traditional small molecules and monoclonal antibodies. The field attracted significant investment and partnership activity, with multiple companies pursuing RNAi programs and several additional drugs gaining regulatory approval globally.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**
- The Sanofi deal indeed provided crucial validation and resources for Alnylam's clinical programs
  - Mathematics: If $700M bought 12% in 2014, implying $5.83B valuation; by 2024, Alnylam's market cap exceeded $25B
- RNAi did transition from overhyped promise to therapeutic reality
- Alnylam successfully advanced multiple programs to clinical validation
- The field's lengthy growth phase was ending and clinical delivery was beginning
- Patisiran's clinical results were indicative of broader RNAi potential

**What the Article Underestimated:**
- The speed and breadth of RNAi's clinical success: 4 approved therapies by 2021, not just for rare diseases but also for common conditions like hypercholesterolemia
- The technological advances in delivery systems (GalNAc conjugates) that would solve fundamental RNAi challenges
- The expansion of applications beyond the original rare disease focus
- The durability of Alnylam's success as an independent company (not acquired, as might have been expected)
- The broader impact of RNAi beyond Alnylam, including the rise of companies like Dicerna and Arrowhead

**What the Article Couldn't Have Predicted:**
- The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on RNA technology development and validation
- The evolution of RNAi as a platform technology applicable across multiple therapeutic areas
- The role RNAi would play in establishing the broader RNA therapeutics field that enabled mRNA vaccine development

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article represents the 70-79th percentile of interest. While focused on a specific company and technology, it captured a pivotal inflection point where a promising therapeutic modality transitioned from scientific curiosity to clinical reality. The author's informed skepticism and acknowledgment of overhyped history made the validation moment more significant. The article's importance extends beyond biotech into understanding how breakthrough technologies navigate the treacherous path from laboratory promise to clinical and commercial success. It serves as a excellent case study in technology maturation, investment timing, and scientific perseverance. While lacking the broad societal impact that would justify an 8 or 9 rating, it exemplifies careful scientific journalism that ages better than more breathless coverage.
