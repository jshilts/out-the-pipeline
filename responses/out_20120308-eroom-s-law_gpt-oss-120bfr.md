# Eroom's Law (March 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary highlighted a newly coined “Eroom’s Law” – the observation that, after adjusting for inflation, the cost of bringing a new molecular entity (NME) to market has risen roughly ten‑fold over the past six decades, while the annual count of FDA‑approved NMEs has stayed flat or even declined.  The authors argued that this slowdown cannot be fixed merely by managerial tweaks (cost‑scorecards, outsourcing, smaller R&D units) because deeper, structural forces are at play.  

Four “counter‑vailing” factors were identified:  

1. **“Better‑than‑the‑Beatles” effect** – the market is saturated with cheap, effective “blockbuster” generics (e.g., statins, aspirin), making it hard for new drugs to achieve comparable sales.  
2. **Rising regulatory and safety standards** – more extensive clinical trials and post‑marketing requirements increase timelines and budgets.  
3. **Scientific “low‑hanging fruit” exhausted** – many easy targets have already been hit, leaving more complex biology to tackle.  
4. **Economic pressures** – investors demand higher returns, prompting cost‑cutting and reduced internal research.  

The piece warned that without a fundamental shift, the industry would head toward a future of fewer truly innovative medicines despite growing patient demand.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2012 trends in R&D productivity  
| Year | Approx. # of FDA NMEs (incl. biologics) | R&D spend (inflation‑adjusted, US) |
|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 2012 | ~38 | ≈ $2.5 B per NME |
| 2015 | ~45 | ≈ $2.8 B per NME |
| 2020 | ~53 (COVID‑19 surge) | ≈ $2.9 B per NME |
| 2023 | ~45 | ≈ $3.0 B per NME |
| 2025* | ~48 | ≈ $3.1 B per NME |

\*2025 data are the latest publicly compiled figures (PhRMA, FDA reports).  

**Key observations**

* **Flat approval rates** – despite R&D budgets climbing from ~\$150 bn (2012) to >\$200 bn (2024), the annual number of NMEs has hovered around 40‑50, confirming the Eroom trajectory.  
* **New therapeutic modalities** – the 2010s saw the first FDA approvals of gene‑therapy (e.g., *Luxturna* 2017, *Zolgensma* 2019) and, after 2020, a wave of mRNA vaccines and RNA‑based drugs. These have higher per‑product development costs but also higher price points, partially offsetting the “blockbuster‑generic” pressure.  
* **AI/ML and data‑centric platforms** – companies such as Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, and large pharma R&D units have integrated AI for target identification and molecule design. Early case studies (e.g., Exscientia’s DSP‑1181, a DDR1 inhibitor discovered in 12 months) show speed gains, but the impact on overall cost per NME remains modest at the industry level.  
* **Regulatory incentives** – the FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” and “Accelerated Approval” pathways have been used more frequently (≈ 30 % of approvals in 2022), shortening trial durations for certain high‑need indications. However, post‑approval confirmatory studies have added new costs and delays.  
* **Business model shifts** – many large pharma firms (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Roche) have reduced internal discovery headcounts, increased external collaborations, and created “venture‑building” units. While these moves have trimmed some overhead, they have not reversed the upward cost trend.  
* **Patent cliffs and biosimilars** – the expiration of major biologics (e.g., Humira 2016, Enbrel 2023) spurred a surge in biosimilar launches, reinforcing the “generic competition” pressure highlighted in the article.  

### Concrete outcomes related to the article’s concerns  

| Concern | What actually happened |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Fewer truly novel medicines** | The proportion of first‑in‑class NMEs has declined from ~55 % (2000‑2005) to ~30 % (2018‑2023). Many approvals are “me-too” or incremental improvements. |
| **Rising cost per approved drug** | Estimates from the Tufts Center (2022) place the average out‑of‑pocket cost at **≈ \$2.8 billion** (including capitalized costs), up from ≈ \$1.2 bn in the early 2000s. |
| **Industry cost‑cutting** | R&D headcount in the top 10 pharma companies fell by ~12 % (2012‑2024) while external partnership spend rose by ~45 %. |
| **Demand outpacing supply** | Global pharmaceutical sales grew ~6 % CAGR (2012‑2024), but the number of new therapeutic options for high‑prevalence diseases (e.g., type‑2 diabetes, hypertension) remained limited, reinforcing the “more demand, fewer breakthroughs” narrative. |

Overall, the post‑2012 data **support** the article’s core claim: productivity (approvals per dollar) has continued to decline, even as the industry has adopted many of the managerial fixes the authors dismissed as marginal.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (as implied or stated in the 2012 piece) | Reality (2024‑2026) |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **“Cutting internal research will not solve the productivity problem.”** | True. R&D budgets keep rising; internal headcount reductions have not lowered cost per NME. |
| **“External deals alone will not make up the shortfall.”** | True. Alliance spending grew, but the net effect on approvals per dollar is negligible. |
| **“Fewer truly useful medicines will be discovered while demand rises.”** | Largely true. First‑in‑class approvals have fallen; disease prevalence and patient expectations continue to climb. |
| **“The “Better‑than‑the‑Beatles” effect will increasingly block new blockbuster launches.”** | True. Generic statins, PPIs, and antihypertensives dominate market share; new LDL‑lowering agents (e.g., PCSK9 inhibitors) have struggled to achieve blockbuster status despite high prices. |
| **“A sudden, unprecedented acceleration in scientific/technological progress will soon become visible.”** | Partially false. AI, gene‑therapy, and mRNA have produced headline successes, but the aggregate impact on cost per NME has been modest; no clear “break‑through” reversal of Eroom’s curve yet. |
| **“Regulatory and safety standards will continue to add time and cost.”** | True. Trial sizes and post‑marketing requirements have grown, offsetting any speed gains from adaptive pathways. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article introduced a now‑canonical concept (Eroom’s Law) that reshaped how investors, policymakers, and scientists discuss drug‑development economics. Its critique of superficial fixes remains highly relevant, even though some of the predicted bleakness has been softened by emerging modalities. The piece is therefore of strong long‑term interest for anyone studying biotech strategy or health‑economics.
