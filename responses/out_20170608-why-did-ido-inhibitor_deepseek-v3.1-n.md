# Why Did This IDO Inhibitor Trial Fail? (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the failure of GDC-0919 (navoximod), an IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) inhibitor being developed by NewLink Genetics in partnership with Genentech for cancer immunotherapy. The drug was being tested in combination with Genentech's anti-PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab) based on promising preclinical data showing that blocking both immune checkpoints could enhance anti-tumor responses. However, clinical trial results presented at ASCO showed only a 10% response rate across multiple tumor types, leading Genentech to return rights to the drug. The author notes that Incyte's competing IDO inhibitor (epacadostat) was showing better results when combined with Merck's Keytruda, suggesting the IDO mechanism itself might still be valid. The piece raises questions about whether the problem was with the specific drug candidate, the combination partner (atezolizumab had recent setbacks), or other factors.

## 2. HISTORY

The IDO inhibition field experienced significant developments after this 2017 article:

**Clinical Failures**: The most significant post-2017 event was the **failure of Incyte's epacadostat** in the ECHO-301 trial (announced April 2018). This Phase 3 study combining epacadostat with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in metastatic melanoma showed **no improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival** compared to pembrolizumab alone. This was a major blow to the field, as epacadostat was the most advanced IDO inhibitor and had shown promising Phase 2 results.

**Industry Impact**: Following the ECHO-301 failure, multiple companies halted or scaled back IDO inhibitor programs. Incyte discontinued epacadostat development, NewLink Genetics (now Lumos Pharma) shifted focus, and many smaller companies abandoned IDO programs. Several combination trials were terminated.

**Mechanism Reevaluation**: The failures prompted scientific re-examination of IDO biology. Researchers questioned whether IDO was the right target, whether biomarker selection was inadequate, whether dosing was optimal, or whether compensatory mechanisms (like TDO) limited efficacy. Some suggested the preclinical models had been misleading or that patient selection strategies needed refinement.

**Regulatory Outcomes**: No IDO inhibitor has received FDA approval for cancer treatment as of this analysis. The mechanism that once generated substantial excitement in immuno-oncology essentially stalled after 2018.

**Company Consequences**: Incyte's stock declined significantly after the epacadostat failure. NewLink Genetics rebranded to Lumos Pharma and pivoted to rare endocrine diseases, moving away from oncology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Article's implicit prediction that the mechanism was sound**: The author suggested Incyte's positive epacadostat data indicated "the mechanism is likely to be sound." **Reality**: The subsequent ECHO-301 failure disproved this, showing that the mechanism did not translate to clinical benefit in Phase 3.

- **Article's uncertainty about whether the antibody partner was the problem**: The author questioned whether Genentech's atezolizumab might be the issue rather than the IDO inhibitor. **Reality**: Atezolizumab went on to receive multiple FDA approvals and became an established checkpoint inhibitor, suggesting it wasn't the weak link in the combination.

- **Industry optimism about IDO combinations**: The broader field anticipated that adding IDO inhibition to checkpoint blockade would enhance responses. **Reality**: This hypothesis proved incorrect in rigorous clinical testing, representing a significant setback for combination immunotherapy strategies.

- **Investor sentiment**: The article noted analysts trying to "remain optimistic" about IDO inhibitors. **Reality**: Investor confidence collapsed after 2018, with the entire IDO inhibitor class largely abandoned for cancer therapy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article represents a prescient analysis of a major immuno-oncology disappointment before the field's definitive failure. The 2017 skepticism proved justified when IDO inhibitors ultimately failed to deliver clinical benefit, making this a historically important case study in drug development and the gap between preclinical promise and clinical reality.
