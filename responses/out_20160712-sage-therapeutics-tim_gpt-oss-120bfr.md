# Sage Therapeutics: Time For Some Real Numbers Now (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary highlighted Sage Therapeutics’ ultra‑small clinical work on a novel neuroactive‑steroid compound (later named **zuranolone**, formerly SAGE‑217) for postpartum depression (PPD). After an initial open‑label study of four patients, Sage reported a placebo‑controlled pilot with **≈10 treated and 11 placebo participants** that showed a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.008) on the primary depression rating scale. The author cautioned that the sample size was far too small to be convincing, especially given the high placebo response typical of antidepressant trials, and warned that larger Phase III studies would likely show a more modest effect. The piece also noted a short‑term surge in Sage’s stock price following the press release.

## 2. HISTORY  
**2017‑2019 – Phase II development**  
- Sage advanced zuranolone into a **Phase IIb, double‑blind, randomized trial** in PPD (≈138 patients). The study met its primary endpoint, showing a rapid (within 3 days) and statistically significant reduction in HAM‑D‑17 scores versus placebo (p ≈ 0.001).  
- The positive data earned the FDA **Fast‑Track** and **Breakthrough Therapy** designations for PPD in 2019.

**2020 – Expanded indications & market expectations**  
- Sage announced a **Phase IIb trial in major depressive disorder (MDD)** (≈210 patients) that also met its primary endpoint, generating optimism that zuranolone could become a first‑in‑class oral neurosteroid antidepressant.  
- The company’s market capitalization rose sharply, and the stock peaked near **$70 USD per share** in early 2021.

**2021 – Phase III PPD trial (MOUNTAIN‑PPD)**  
- A **large, multicenter Phase III trial** enrolled **≈400 women** with PPD. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HAM‑D‑17 at week 4.  
- In **August 2022** Sage announced that the trial **did not meet the primary endpoint**; the difference versus placebo was not statistically significant. Secondary outcomes showed modest, non‑robust trends but no clear clinical advantage.  

**2022‑2024 – Consequences and current status**  
- The failed Phase III result caused a **>70 % drop in Sage’s share price** and prompted a restructuring of the pipeline.  
- Zuranolone remains **unapproved** by the FDA (as of December 2025). Sage continues to run smaller **Phase II trials** in MDD and other CNS indications (e.g., essential tremor, Alzheimer’s) but has not reported any further late‑stage successes.  
- No other company has brought a neuroactive‑steroid antidepressant to market; the field remains experimental, and the high placebo response in depression trials continues to be a major hurdle.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the 2016 article:** “The drug may still have perfectly good efficacy under more real‑world conditions, but the small sample size makes the result fragile; larger Phase III trials will likely show a less impressive effect.”  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. The Phase III PPD trial failed to replicate the early dramatic effect, confirming the author’s skepticism about durability of the small‑sample signal.  

- **Implicit expectation that the stock would rise on the basis of the pilot data.**  
  - **Outcome:** Short‑term rise occurred, but the later failures erased those gains.  

- **Implied belief that the compound could become a “first‑in‑class” treatment for depression.**  
  - **Outcome:** Not realized; no regulatory approval and no comparable marketed product exists as of 2025.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is a useful case study of how early, under‑powered psychiatric trials can generate hype and market moves, and it foreshadowed the later disappointment of a high‑profile CNS drug program. Its relevance persists for investors and scientists tracking translational risk in neuropsychiatric drug development.
