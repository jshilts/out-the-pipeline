# A Visit To Academia (5 Nov 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a reflective blog-style post by an industry scientist who gave a talk on drug discovery at a local university. The author presents an older, discontinued project from their fifteen-year career in pharmaceutical research, noting they haven't discovered any approved drugs—a record they describe as "pretty typical" for the industry. 

The talk generated practical questions from the academic audience about project management: when to stop compound development, total personnel and cost accounting, competitive intelligence gathering, and resource allocation across support groups working on multiple projects simultaneously. The author also reflects on their career choice, having initially aimed for academia before realizing the decision was more complex than anticipated, ultimately choosing industry over academic research.

## 2. HISTORY

The pharmaceutical R&D landscape in 2004 was characterized by what would later be recognized as the end of the "blockbuster drug era" and the beginning of a productivity crisis in drug discovery. Between 2004-2015, the industry faced rising R&D costs, declining approval rates, and increasing patent cliffs. The average cost to develop a new drug rose dramatically, with estimates ranging from $1-2.6 billion per approved drug by the 2010s.

The "typical record" the author mentions—fifteen years without discovering an approved drug—reflects a systemic challenge that persisted and arguably worsened. Clinical success rates for drugs entering Phase I trials remained stubbornly low (around 10-15% across therapeutic areas), and drug development timelines averaged 10-12 years from discovery to approval.

Academic-industry partnerships became increasingly important in the 2000s-2010s as pharmaceutical companies sought to externalize early-stage research and access innovation. However, the cultural and operational gaps between academic labs (focused on publications and fundamental understanding) and industry (driven by pipelines and commercialization timelines) remained significant challenges, exactly the tensions hinted at in the author's career reflections.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article is more observational than predictive in nature. However, the author's stance implies some embedded assumptions:

• **That the high failure rate in drug discovery would continue**: ✓ **Accurate**. The fundamental economics and scientific challenges of drug discovery persisted, with success rates remaining low through the present day. The industry's response included embracing new technologies (genomics, AI/ML, biologics) but the core difficulty of translating molecular discoveries into approved therapies remained.

• **That the industrial research model was fundamentally different from academia**: ✓ **Accurate**. The divide between academic basic research and industry's product-focused development remained substantial, though bridging this gap became a major focus through academic-industry partnerships, technology transfer offices, and biotech spinouts in subsequent decades.

• **That project cost and resource allocation would remain difficult to quantify**: — **Partially accurate**. While pharmaceutical companies developed more sophisticated project management and portfolio optimization tools, the complex, collaborative nature of drug discovery continued to make precise cost accounting challenging, especially for discontinued projects.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

This article has limited long-term importance as it's primarily a personal anecdote without broader analysis or actionable insights.
