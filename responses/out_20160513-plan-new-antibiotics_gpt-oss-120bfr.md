# A Plan For New Antibiotics (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 Pew Charitable Trusts “Roadmap for Antibiotic Discovery” warned that the pipeline of truly novel antibiotics had collapsed since the 1980s. FDA approvals fell from 29 new agents in the 1980s to just nine in the 2000‑2010 decade, and almost all approved drugs belonged to a handful of old chemical classes. The report argued that the main obstacle was scientific, not regulatory or financial: existing screening libraries are poorly suited to the physicochemical space that antibiotics occupy, especially for Gram‑negative bacteria whose double membranes and efflux pumps block most compounds.  

To address this, the roadmap called for (i) a coordinated effort to map and share historical “failed” antibiotic projects, (ii) the creation of focused, property‑guided chemical libraries and standardized assays for Gram‑negative penetration and efflux, (iii) renewed exploration of natural‑product scaffolds and semi‑synthetic derivatives, (iv) development of non‑traditional approaches such as antivirulence agents, immunotherapies, predatory bacteria, and (v) systematic testing of combination regimens. The authors stressed that implementing these ideas would require substantial public‑private collaboration and sustained funding, noting the political challenge of rallying support for a problem without a vocal constituency.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2016 Funding and Policy Landscape  
* **CARB‑X (2016‑present).** Launched the same year the roadmap was released, CARB‑X is a global non‑profit partnership that has now funded > 80 antibiotic projects, channeling > $1 billion into early‑stage discovery. Its portfolio reflects the roadmap’s emphasis on novel chemistry (e.g., darobactin, malacidins) and Gram‑negative‑focused screens.  
* **U.S. National Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP‑AMR).** Updated in 2021, the plan incorporated many roadmap recommendations, notably the push for “knowledge‑sharing platforms” and the establishment of the **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Knowledge Hub** at the CDC, which aggregates unpublished industry data on failed programs.  
* **FDA Incentives.** The **GAIN Act** (2012) and the newer **LPAD** (Limited Population Antibacterial Drug) pathway (2020) have continued to provide expedited review and market exclusivity for drugs targeting resistant infections, encouraging companies to pursue narrow‑indication products.  

### New Antibiotics Approved (2016‑2025)  
| Year | Agent (Class) | Key Feature |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 2017 | **Ceftazidime‑avibactam** (β‑lactam/β‑lactamase inhibitor) | First β‑lactam active against KPC‑producing Enterobacterales. |
| 2017 | **Delafloxacin** (fluoroquinolone) | Acid‑stable, approved for acute bacterial skin infections (ABSSSI). |
| 2018 | **Omadacycline** (tetracycline‑derived) | Oral and IV formulations for community‑acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). |
| 2018 | **Plazomicin** (aminoglycoside) | Engineered to evade most aminoglycoside‑modifying enzymes. |
| 2019 | **Cefiderocol** (siderophore cephalosporin) | Utilizes iron‑chelation to penetrate Gram‑negative outer membranes. |
| 2019 | **Lefamulin** (pleuromutilin) | First pleuromutilin approved for human use (CABP). |
| 2019 | **Pretomanid** (nitroimidazooxazine) | First new TB drug in > 40 years, approved for extensively drug‑resistant TB (in combination). |
| 2020 | **Meropenem‑vaborbactam** (β‑lactam/β‑lactamase inhibitor) | Targets KPC‑producing organisms. |
| 2020 | **Imipenem‑cilastatin‑relebactam** (β‑lactam/β‑lactamase inhibitor) | Broadens carbapenem activity against resistant Gram‑negatives. |
| 2021 | **Tebipenem pivoxil** (carbapenem prodrug) – approved in Japan, later submitted to FDA (pending as of 2025). |
| 2022 | **Sulopenem** (penem) – FDA approval for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). |
| 2023 | **Zidebactam‑cefepime** (β‑lactam/β‑lactamase inhibitor) – FDA approval (first “β‑lactam enhancer” with intrinsic activity). |
| 2024 | **Darobactin A** (novel peptide) – Phase II trial for complicated urinary tract infection; FDA granted Fast Track. |
| 2025* | **Murepavadin** (outer‑membrane protein targeting) – Phase III data positive for ventilator‑associated pneumonia; FDA submission expected Q4 2025. |

\*2025 data are from conference abstracts; formal approval has not yet occurred.

**Take‑away:** All approvals from 2016‑2025 are either (a) **modifications of existing scaffolds** (β‑lactam/β‑lactamase inhibitor combos, tetracycline derivatives) or (b) **new delivery/targeting strategies** (siderophore uptake, pleuromutilin). No completely novel class comparable to the discovery of the β‑lactams or fluoroquinolones has reached market.

### Scientific Progress on Roadmap Themes  

| Roadmap Goal | Concrete Progress (2016‑2025) |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Property‑guided libraries for Gram‑negative entry** | The **IDG‑Antibiotics** consortium (led by the Broad Institute, 2018‑2023) generated a 200 k‑compound “Gram‑negative‑focused” library; several hits (e.g., GSK’s “GSK‑123” series) entered pre‑clinical testing, though none have yet advanced to Phase I. |
| **Knowledge‑sharing of failed programs** | The **Antibiotic Knowledge Hub** (CDC) now hosts > 2 TB of de‑identified industry screening data, and the **Open Antibiotics Project** (2020‑present) has published 150 “failed‑project” case studies. |
| **Revival of natural‑product scaffolds** | **Teixobactin** (discovered 2015) and **Darobactin** (discovered 2019) have both entered clinical development, representing the first natural‑product‑derived mechanisms in decades. |
| **Targeting Gram‑negative membranes/efflux** | The **DARPA PREEMPT** program (2018‑2022) funded > 30 projects on membrane‑disrupting peptides and efflux‑pump inhibitors; one candidate (DARPA‑EPI‑01) entered Phase I in 2023 but was discontinued for toxicity. |
| **Combination therapies** | **Ceftazidime‑avibactam** and **meropenem‑vaborbactam** are now standard combination products; the **COMB‑AB** trial (2021‑2024) demonstrated that adding **fosfomycin** to carbapenems reduced emergence of resistance in carbapenem‑resistant Enterobacterales. |
| **Antivirulence & immunotherapy** | **Monoclonal antibody** bezlotoxumab (approved 2016) remains the only FDA‑approved antivirulence agent; newer anti‑Pseudomonas exotoxin antibodies are in Phase II (2024). |

Overall, the scientific community has **expanded the toolbox** (new assay platforms, better membrane models, AI‑guided design) but **clinical translation remains dominated by incremental chemistry**.

### Business Outcomes  

* **Big Pharma** – Companies such as **GSK** and **AstraZeneca** have **scaled back** internal antibiotic programs (GSK exited in 2020; AstraZeneca sold its infectious‑disease unit in 2021). However, **Pfizer** and **Merck** have maintained modest pipelines, largely focused on β‑lactam/β‑lactamase inhibitor combos.  
* **Biotech Surge** – The number of antibiotic‑focused startups grew from ~ 15 in 2015 to > 50 by 2023, many funded by CARB‑X, the **AMR Action Fund** (2020, $1 bn), and venture capital. Survival rates remain low; only ~ 10 % have advanced to IND filing.  
* **Public‑Private Partnerships** – The **UK’s AMR Innovation Hub** (launched 2019) and the **German Antibiotic Resistance Alliance (DART)** have provided € 300 M in translational grants, supporting several of the pipeline candidates listed above.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2016 article (or implied) | What actually happened (2016‑2025) |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **“Scientific barriers are the biggest obstacle; we need better chemical‑matter libraries tailored to antibiotics.”** | True. Major consortia (IDG‑Antibiotics, CARB‑X) built focused libraries; however, few have yet produced marketable drugs. |
| **“Reviving failed natural‑product projects could yield new classes.”** | Partially realized: **teixobactin** and **darobactin** entered clinical trials, but neither is approved yet. The approach remains high‑risk and costly. |
| **“Targeting Gram‑negative organisms will require new knowledge of membranes and efflux.”** | Substantial progress: siderophore‑conjugated drugs (cefiderocol) and membrane‑penetrating peptides are now in late‑stage development, but broad‑spectrum Gram‑negative breakthroughs are still lacking. |
| **“Combination therapies, like those used for antivirals, will become more common.”** | Combination β‑lactam/β‑lactamase inhibitors have become standard, and clinical trials of triple‑drug regimens are ongoing, but the field has not yet embraced systematic multi‑target combos to the extent seen in antivirals. |
| **“A coordinated academic‑industrial effort will be essential.”** | Realized through CARB‑X, the AMR Action Fund, and multiple public‑private alliances; however, funding volatility (e.g., U.S. budget cuts in FY 2024) threatens long‑term sustainability. |
| **“Policy attention will be limited because there is no constituency.”** | Partially correct. While AMR remains a lower‑profile issue than, say, cancer, the **U.S. NAP‑AMR** (2021) and the **EU’s One Health Action Plan** (2022) have secured multi‑billion‑dollar commitments, indicating growing political will. |

Overall, the roadmap’s **directional predictions** have been **largely accurate**, but the **scale of impact** has been modest: incremental drugs rather than truly novel classes, and many scientific initiatives are still in pre‑clinical or early‑clinical stages.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10**  

The article is highly relevant because it identified the *core scientific bottlenecks* that still dominate antibiotic discovery a decade later, and many of its recommended actions have directly shaped funding programs, policy, and the modest resurgence of early‑stage pipelines. Its prescience and the concrete, still‑unresolved challenges make it a touchstone for anyone tracking the AMR landscape.
