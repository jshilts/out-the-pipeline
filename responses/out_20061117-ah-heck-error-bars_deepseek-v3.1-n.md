# Ah, the Heck With the Error Bars (November 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses concerns about cardiovascular side effects of anti-inflammatory medications, focusing on new data suggesting that naproxen (previously considered relatively safe) may have cardiac risks. The data comes from a prematurely halted Celebrex trial originally designed to test Alzheimer's prevention effects. When COX-2 cardiovascular risks emerged, the trial was stopped early, complicating statistical interpretation. The author contrasts two perspectives: Dr. Steven Nissen's caution about drawing firm conclusions from statistically compromised data, versus researchers who argue for publishing all safety data "regardless of the direction, magnitude, or statistical significance." The article expresses skepticism toward the latter approach, viewing it as scientifically irresponsible.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2006 article, several important developments occurred in NSAID cardiovascular safety:

**Naproxen's safety profile** remained relatively favorable compared to other NSAIDs. Large meta-analyses and observational studies generally confirmed that while some cardiovascular risk exists, naproxen has a better CV safety profile than COX-2 inhibitors and some other NSAIDs when used at appropriate doses.

**FDA regulatory actions** evolved significantly. In 2005, the FDA had already required boxed warnings for COX-2 inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs about cardiovascular and GI risks. Post-2006, these warnings were strengthened and standardized across the NSAID class, with particular attention to higher-risk populations.

**Celecoxib specifically** saw a complex trajectory. The PRECISION trial (published 2016), led by Steven Nissen as referenced in the article, finally provided clearer answers about celecoxib's cardiovascular safety relative to naproxen and ibuprofen in arthritis patients. The results suggested that celecoxib was non-inferior to naproxen and ibuprofen for cardiovascular safety when used at moderate doses in patients with established cardiovascular disease or risk factors.

**Clinical practice** shifted toward more cautious NSAID prescribing, with physicians increasingly considering individual patient cardiovascular risk profiles before NSAID selection. Naproxen became the preferred choice for patients with higher CV risk requiring anti-inflammatory therapy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions and concerns:

- **Naproxen cardiovascular risk**: The article expressed skepticism about claims of naproxen's cardiac effects. **Outcome**: While some increased CV risk exists for naproxen relative to placebo, it proved safer than COX-2 inhibitors and remains a preferred agent in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

- **"Publish everything" approach danger**: The author strongly criticized publishing data "regardless of statistical significance" as scientifically irresponsible. **Outcome**: This concern was prescient. The described approach violated fundamental epidemiological principles and risked misleading conclusions from underpowered or confounded analyses.

- **Need for definitive trials**: The reference to Nissen's planned large trial recognized the necessity of properly powered studies. **Outcome**: The PRECISION trial eventually provided this definitive evidence, taking another decade to complete but ultimately clarifying celecoxib's CV risk profile.

- **Continuing cardiovascular safety concerns**: The article correctly anticipated that cardiovascular safety would remain a dominant concern for all NSAIDs. **Outcome**: This proved accurate - NSAID cardiovascular safety became a major focus of regulatory oversight, clinical guidelines, and prescribing decisions.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**
Reasoning: The article addresses an important pharmaceutical safety topic with some forward-looking insights about research methodology, but the core controversy it discusses was already evolving rapidly in 2006, and its specific concerns were largely resolved through subsequent clinical trials and regulatory actions.
