# Kevin Trudeau Goes to Jail, At Long Last (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article celebrates the criminal contempt conviction and jailing of longtime infomercial pitchman Kevin Trudeau. The author reports that Trudeau was found guilty by a jury in under an hour for violating a 2004 federal court settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that prohibited him from misrepresenting his books in advertisements. Specifically, Trudeau had marketed "The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You To Know About" through infomercials that aired approximately 32,000 times in 2006-2007, falsely claiming the book contained a cure for obesity that required no diet or exercise, when in fact the book instructed readers to walk an hour daily and limit intake to 500 calories. The author expresses personal satisfaction at Trudeau's jailing, having followed and written about Trudeau's deceptive practices for years, characterizing him as a "sleazy, heartless charlatan" who defrauded customers out of millions.

## 2. HISTORY
Following his November 2013 conviction, Trudeau was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for criminal contempt. He began serving his sentence in 2014. The $38 million restitution order mentioned in the article was part of his legal penalties for defrauding consumers through deceptive marketing.

In 2017, the FTC announced it had started distributing approximately $5.3 million in refunds to defrauded consumers who had purchased Trudeau's weight loss book. The restitution process involved over 300,000 claims from consumers who paid $39.95 for the book based on Trudeau's false advertising.

Trudeau appealed his conviction and sentence multiple times, but his appeals were rejected by federal courts. He was released from prison in 2021 after serving approximately 7 years of his sentence, having received some credit for good behavior.

The case established important precedents regarding FTC enforcement against deceptive infomercial marketing and reinforced the agency's authority to pursue criminal contempt charges against repeat offenders who violate consent decrees.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This article contains no specific predictions about future developments. It is primarily a commentary on a current legal development rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

The article has moderate historical interest as documentation of enforcement action against a prominent fraudster, but its narrow focus on a single individual's legal troubles limits broader significance to the biotechnology or science fields.
