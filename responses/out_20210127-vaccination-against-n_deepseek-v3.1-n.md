# Vaccination Against the New Variants: Real-World Data (January 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This January 2021 commentary analyzed early data on how well COVID-19 vaccines and natural immunity protected against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly the UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (B.1.351) strains. The article examined laboratory data showing that while monoclonal antibody therapies showed significant drops in effectiveness against B.1.351 (with Lilly's antibody completely evaded), vaccinated individuals maintained substantial protection despite measurable decreases in antibody neutralization titers—approximately 2-fold reduction against B.1.1.7 and 6-9 fold reduction against B.1.351 compared to the original strain.

The author emphasized that these drops, while statistically significant, still left vaccinated individuals with high antibody titers well above protective thresholds. The article highlighted concerns about re-infection risks for naturally immune individuals against B.1.351, with one South African study showing some recovered patients had 200-fold reductions or complete loss of neutralizing activity. The commentary concluded that vaccination remained effective against variants but stressed the importance of rapid vaccination campaigns and public health measures, while noting that mRNA technology offered a pathway for rapid vaccine updates if needed.

## 2. HISTORY

The concerns and trends identified in this January 2021 article largely played out as anticipated over the subsequent years. The COVID-19 vaccines did maintain substantial real-world effectiveness against variants, though with diminishing returns as new variants emerged.

**Vaccine Effectiveness Evolution**: The original mRNA vaccines showed high effectiveness (~90%) against symptomatic infection with the original strain and Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Against Delta (B.1.617.2), effectiveness dropped to ~80-90% for symptomatic disease but remained >90% for severe disease and death. With Omicron (B.1.1.529) and its subvariants, effectiveness against symptomatic infection fell to ~30-60% depending on timing since vaccination, but protection against severe outcomes remained strong at ~70-90%.

**Monoclonal Antibody Therapies**: The author's concerns about monoclonal antibodies proved prescient. By late 2021 and 2022, successive variants rendered most monoclonal antibody therapies ineffective. The FDA revoked emergency use authorizations for bamlanivimab/etesevimab (Lilly) in January 2022, REGEN-COV (Regeneron) in January 2022, and sotrovimab (GlaxoSmithKline) in April 2022 as they lost effectiveness against Omicron subvariants. Only bebtelovimab retained some activity before it too was withdrawn in November 2022.

**Updated Vaccines**: The mRNA vaccine update capability mentioned became reality. In September 2022, FDA authorized bivalent COVID-19 vaccines targeting both the original strain and Omicron BA.4/BA.5, followed by monovalent XBB.1.5-targeted vaccines in September 2023. These demonstrated improved neutralization against circulating variants.

**Re-infection Patterns**: The concern about re-infection risks materialized, particularly with Omicron. Studies showed increased re-infection rates compared to earlier variants, with both vaccinated and previously infected individuals experiencing breakthrough infections, though severe disease remained less common in both groups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Vaccination would continue providing protection despite reduced antibody titers**: **Largely correct**. Real-world effectiveness studies confirmed substantial protection against severe disease and death even as variants emerged, though protection against symptomatic infection declined more significantly than perhaps anticipated in early 2021.

- **Need for variant-specific vaccine updates**: **Correct**. The mRNA vaccine platforms proved adaptable, with updated vaccines deployed starting in 2022. However, the process was slower than the "quick turnaround" initially envisioned due to manufacturing scale-up, regulatory processes, and clinical evaluation requirements.

- **Concerning re-infection risk for naturally immune individuals against B.1.351**: **Mixed**. While B.1.351 did show immune escape, it was rapidly outcompeted by other variants (particularly Delta, then Omicron) that drove most re-infections. The fundamental concern about immune escape driving re-infection was validated.

- **Monoclonal antibodies requiring close monitoring against variants**: **Highly accurate**. Multiple monoclonal antibody therapies lost effectiveness and were withdrawn from use as variants accumulated escape mutations, exactly as predicted.

- **Rapid variant spread requiring public health measures**: **Accurate**. Variants did spread globally, with countries that delayed or avoided vaccination experiencing longer and more severe pandemic waves. However, many regions relaxed public health measures by 2022-2023 despite ongoing variant circulation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated strong scientific reasoning and prescient analysis of early variant data, accurately identifying key mechanisms and risks that would dominate the pandemic's subsequent years. The balanced evaluation of laboratory data within real-world clinical context, plus recognition of the molecular tools available for countermeasures, made it both scientifically rigorous and practically relevant.
