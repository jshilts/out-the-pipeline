# Down In Phase III. Again. (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the persistent challenge in drug development where promising Phase II clinical trial results fail to translate into successful Phase III outcomes. It focuses on Renovo, a company founded to develop therapies reducing scar tissue formation, specifically their drug Juvista (recombinant TGF beta 3).

The article describes Renovo's strategy of moving quickly into human trials by conducting small-scale skin studies where patients received both drug-treated and placebo-treated cuts. While Phase II results appeared impressive, the drug completely missed its endpoints in Phase III trials. Despite investor speculation about data errors or sample switching, the failure was real. The author notes that retrospective analysis revealed earlier negative trials had been predictive, while the positive results were likely artifacts—raising fundamental questions about how to identify truly predictive clinical data in advance.

## 2. HISTORY

**Renovo's Collapse and Juvista's Failure:** Following the Phase III failure in 2011, Renovo's stock price collapsed by approximately 75% in a single day. The company had invested over $200 million and more than a decade developing Juvista. Despite this setback, Renovo initially announced plans to continue development, but by 2012, the company had essentially abandoned the program.

**Company Transition and Acquisition:** Renovo shifted its focus away from scar reduction and toward other therapeutic areas. In 2015, the company merged with the private equity firm Essex Woodlands, effectively ending its independence. The Renovo case became a textbook example in pharmaceutical circles of the challenges in translational medicine and the high failure rate between Phase II and Phase III trials.

**Clinical Trial Failure Rates:** This episode occurred during a period where drug development failure rates were increasingly scrutinized. Industry data continued to show that approximately 30-40% of drugs fail in Phase III, even after promising Phase II results. The Renovo case was frequently cited in discussions about the need for better biomarkers and more predictive early-stage trial designs.

**Impact on Anti-Scarring Field:** The failure of Juvista did not completely halt research into scar reduction therapies, but it did make investors more cautious about the field. Other approaches, such as silicone gel sheets, pressure therapy, and various topical treatments, remained available, but the prospect of a breakthrough pharmaceutical intervention for scar prevention receded significantly.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit Industry Predictions:** The article doesn't make explicit forward-looking statements, but touches on several implicit predictions and assumptions common in the industry at the time:

• **Rapid human trials would improve success rates:** Renovo's strategy of "going early into humans" was based on the assumption this would provide better predictive data. **Outcome:** This approach failed spectacularly, demonstrating that early human access alone doesn't solve the fundamental challenges of drug development.

• **Phase II biomarkers predict Phase III success:** The underlying assumption that positive Phase II results should translate to Phase III. **Outcome:** Continued to be problematic industry-wide, with failure rates remaining stubbornly high.

• **Scarring could be effectively modulated by single molecular targets:** The assumption that targeting TGF beta 3 alone could meaningfully reduce scarring. **Outcome:** Oversimplified view of complex wound healing biology; the approach failed despite seemingly compelling early data.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article remains highly relevant as a case study in translational medicine failures and the persistent challenge of Phase II to Phase III transitions in drug development. The Renovo case exemplifies fundamental issues in clinical trial design and predictive biomarkers that continue to plague the industry today.
