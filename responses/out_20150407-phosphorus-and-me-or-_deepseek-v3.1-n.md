# Phosphorus And Me. Or Maybe You First. (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses two unusual phosphorus-containing antibiotics: fosfomycin, an epoxide-containing natural product that inhibits MurA (a bacterial enzyme involved in cell wall synthesis) by targeting a specific cysteine residue; and fosmidomycin, which features both a phosphonic acid group and a hydroxamic acid moiety. The author uses these compounds to reflect on the limitations of traditional "drug-likeness" concepts in medicinal chemistry, acknowledging that he would never have chosen to work on either molecule despite both being used successfully in humans. The commentary highlights how phosphorus chemistry remains relatively unexplored in drug discovery, with few pharmaceutical applications beyond bisphosphonates and occasional phosphate ester prodrugs, and suggests that medicinal chemists may be missing opportunities by avoiding this chemical space due to lack of experience and comfort with phosphorus-containing compounds.

## 2. HISTORY

After the 2015 article, fosfomycin has maintained its clinical relevance, particularly as an oral treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). **The FDA approved fosfomycin tromethamine (Monurol) for this indication, and it has seen moderate clinical uptake, especially for multidrug-resistant UTIs.** However, its efficacy as monotherapy for complicated UTIs remains limited, and it continues to face challenges related to appropriate dosing and the emergence of resistance, particularly through the fosA resistance gene among Enterobacteriaceae.

**The "phosphorus chemistry" landscape has evolved gradually over the years.** Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis faced challenges as patent cliffs hit, but have remained the standard of care for many indications. The field has seen increased interest in phosphorus-containing antiviral agents, especially with Remdesivir for COVID-19, which demonstrated the viability of phosphate prodrug strategies.

**No major surge in phosphonic acid drug discovery occurred** in the traditional small molecule space. Most pharmaceutical companies continued to focus on more conventional chemical matter, with phosphorus chemistry remaining a niche area, primarily for specific applications rather than broad platform adoption.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about phosphorus chemistry being underexplored territory**: This assessment remains accurate—phosphorus-containing drugs are still relatively rare compared to carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen-centered molecules. **Accuracy: Correct.**

• **Implicit expectation that medicinal chemists would continue avoiding phosphorus chemistry**: This largely held true, as the field did not experience a major transformation toward widespread phosphorus exploration. **Accuracy: Largely correct.**

• **Recognition that "drug-likeness" concepts were too narrow**: The broader pharmaceutical community has indeed expanded their acceptance of diverse chemical matter over time, with more examples of "unconventional" drugs gaining approval. **Accuracy: Correct trend recognition.**

• **Implicit suggestion that there might be missed opportunities in phosphorus chemistry**: While some opportunities were explored, no major breakthrough class of phosphorus drugs emerged to dramatically change the landscape. **Accuracy: Partially correct, but not transformative.**

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article provides a thoughtful practitioner's reflection on chemical bias in drug discovery, anchored by specific phosphorus-containing antibiotics, but it focuses on a relatively niche chemistry topic without broader implications for clinical practice or major pharmaceutical trends.
