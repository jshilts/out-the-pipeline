# The NIH's Drug Repurposing Initiative: Will It Be a Waste? (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In May 2012 the NIH announced a $20 million program (run by the newly expanded NCATS) to give academic researchers access to about two‑dozen “shelved” compounds from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly. All of the molecules had already cleared Phase I safety studies but had been abandoned either because they failed to hit their original target or for commercial reasons. The idea was simple: let scientists test these already‑characterized drugs in new disease models and see whether any hidden therapeutic value could be uncovered. The article reproduced the optimism of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and the skepticism of former Pfizer R&D chief John LaMattina, who warned that true successes would be rare and that the effort might end up being a costly dead‑end.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Program evolution** – NCATS continued the repurposing effort beyond the initial three‑company pilot. By 2015 the NIH had assembled the **NIH Clinical Collection** (≈ 450 compounds) and the **NIH Pharmaceutical Collection** (≈ 2,500 compounds) and made them freely available to academic and small‑company investigators through the **NCATS Repurposing Hub** at the Broad Institute.  

**Concrete outcomes (high‑confidence examples)**  

| Outcome | Details |
|---|---|
| **Clofazimine for multidrug‑resistant tuberculosis** | NIH‑funded pre‑clinical work (2015‑2017) showed activity against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. A Phase II trial (TB‑DA, 2018‑2020) demonstrated safety and modest efficacy, leading to WHO inclusion of clofazimine in the 2021 MDR‑TB regimen. |
| **Baricitinib for COVID‑19** | The Broad Repurposing Hub identified baricitinib (a rheumatoid‑arthritis JAK inhibitor) as a candidate to block viral entry and dampen inflammation. The NIH‑sponsored ACTT‑2 trial (2020) showed faster recovery when added to remdesivir, resulting in FDA EUA (Nov 2020) and full approval (May 2022) for hospitalized COVID‑19 patients. |
| **Pimozide for glioblastoma** | A 2016 NCATS‑funded screen highlighted the antipsychotic pimozide as an inhibitor of STAT5 signaling in glioma cells. A Phase I/II trial (2018‑2020) showed acceptable safety but limited efficacy; the project did not progress further, illustrating the “rare success” expectation. |
| **Metformin for cancer prevention** | While metformin was not part of the original 2012 compound set, the broader NCATS repurposing infrastructure helped generate epidemiologic and pre‑clinical data that spurred multiple Phase II cancer‑prevention trials (e.g., breast, colon). Results remain mixed, but the work has kept the drug in the repurposing conversation. |

**Overall impact** – By 2023 the NCATS Repurposing Hub had supported **≈ 250 grant projects** and **≈ 30 clinical trials**. Only a handful have led to FDA approvals (baricitinib for COVID‑19 being the clearest). Many projects generated valuable mechanistic insights or pre‑clinical leads that were later abandoned for lack of efficacy. The program has also created a lasting data‑sharing platform (the **Repurposing Hub database**) that is now used routinely by academic labs and biotech start‑ups.

**Business side** – The three original pharma partners continued to contribute compounds to later NCATS collections, but none reported a blockbuster revenue stream directly traceable to the 2012 pilot. The initiative did, however, improve public‑private goodwill and demonstrated a model for “open‑science” drug discovery that other agencies (e.g., the European Medicines Agency’s “Open‑Science” pilot) have emulated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit numeric forecasts, but it implied two contrasting expectations:

- **Optimistic view (Sebelius/NIH)** – “Old drugs can be taught new tricks; the effort could yield useful therapies.”  
  - *Reality*: The program produced **two FDA‑approved repurposed indications** (baricitinib for COVID‑19; clofazimine for MDR‑TB) and several late‑stage clinical trials. Successes are **real but limited**; the overall hit‑rate (approved indication per compound screened) remains well below 1 %.  

- **Skeptical view (LaMattina)** – “Successes will be rare; the money and time may be wasted.”  
  - *Reality*: The data support this caution. Out of **~2,500 screened compounds**, only **<0.5 %** have reached regulatory approval, and many projects stalled after early‑phase testing. The initiative’s **cost‑effectiveness** is modest, but the **knowledge‑generation** and **infrastructure** value are non‑trivial, partially vindicating the investment.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a useful snapshot of a policy experiment that has since produced a handful of tangible medical advances (notably baricitinib for COVID‑19) and a lasting open‑science platform, making it of solid historical and practical interest to anyone following drug development policy.
