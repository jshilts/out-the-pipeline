# IDO Inhibitors Hit a Wall (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported the abrupt failure of the Phase III trial that paired Incyte’s IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat with Merck’s PD‑1 antibody Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in advanced melanoma. The author noted earlier setbacks with other IDO programs (e.g., NewLink’s compound) and framed the Merck/Incyte miss as a “massive setback” for the whole therapeutic concept. He also highlighted Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s (BMS) parallel effort—BMS‑986205 combined with Opdivo (nivolumab)—and speculated that its outcome would likely mirror the Merck result. The piece concluded that the failure called into question the broader strategy of combining PD‑1 blockade with IDO inhibition and left the field’s future uncertain.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical outcomes (2018‑2022)**  
* **Merck/Incyte (ECHO‑301/KEYNOTE‑252)** – The trial’s primary endpoints (progression‑free survival and overall survival) were not met; the data were released in June 2018. This led Merck to halt further development of epacadostat in oncology.  
* **BMS (BMS‑986205 + nivolumab)** – BMS continued its Phase III trial (NCT02752074) into 2020. Interim analyses showed no improvement over nivolumab alone, and in early 2020 BMS announced the discontinuation of the IDO program and the termination of the trial.  
* **Other IDO1 inhibitors** – Navoximod (GDC‑0919, Genentech) and other small‑molecule IDO1 inhibitors also failed to demonstrate efficacy in combination with PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies in late‑stage trials, prompting their sponsors to either stop development or shift focus to earlier‑stage or non‑oncology indications.  

**Business impact**  
* Incyte’s stock fell sharply after the Merck miss (≈‑30 % in the weeks following the announcement). The company redirected R&D resources toward its JAK/STAT and other pipelines (e.g., ruxolitinib, parsaclisib).  
* BMS wrote off the IDO program as a “non‑clinical‑value” asset in its 2020 financial statements, citing the lack of efficacy data.  

**Scientific repercussions**  
* The failures prompted a reassessment of the role of tryptophan catabolism in tumor immune evasion. Subsequent pre‑clinical work showed that IDO1 inhibition alone does not reliably reverse T‑cell suppression in the tumor microenvironment, and that compensatory pathways (e.g., TDO, kynurenine‑AHR signaling) can blunt the effect.  
* The field’s attention shifted toward other checkpoint targets (LAG‑3, TIM‑3, TIGIT) and toward combination strategies that modulate the tumor microenvironment through metabolic or epigenetic means rather than IDO blockade.  

**Regulatory / policy**  
* No specific FDA or EMA policy changes resulted directly from the IDO setbacks; the agencies continued to require robust efficacy signals for combination immunotherapies, but the episode reinforced the need for strong mechanistic justification before advancing large Phase III combos.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“The BMS trial will likely fail for the same reasons as the Merck/Incyte one.”*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. BMS halted its IDO1 program in early 2020 after interim data showed no benefit over nivolumab alone.  

- **Prediction:** *“If the BMS compound’s binding mode is different, it might still succeed.”*  
  **Outcome:** The different binding mode (BMS‑986205 is a covalent inhibitor) did not translate into clinical efficacy; the trial still failed.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“The failure will cast doubt on the broader strategy of combining PD‑1 blockade with IDO inhibition.”*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Within two years, virtually all major IDO‑inhibitor programs in oncology were discontinued, and the combination strategy is no longer pursued by the leading pharma companies.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“The setback will create uncertainty for the whole immuno‑oncology field.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While the IDO episode highlighted the risk of poorly validated combos, the field continued to progress with other checkpoints and novel modalities; the overall momentum of immuno‑oncology remained strong.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captured a pivotal moment that reshaped expectations for metabolic checkpoint inhibition and foreshadowed a major strategic shift in cancer immunotherapy research. Its relevance persists as a case study in how mechanistic hype can outpace clinical reality.
