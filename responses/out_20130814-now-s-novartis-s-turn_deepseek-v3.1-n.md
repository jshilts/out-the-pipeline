# It's Novartis's Turn in China (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary article from August 2013 discusses a developing scandal involving Novartis in China. A former Novartis sales representative claimed she was ordered to bribe doctors to meet sales quotas, with reports appearing in Chinese media outlets including 21st Century Business Herald and Shanghai Daily.

The author notes that Chinese authorities were actively investigating corruption and bribery in the pharmaceutical sector at the time. The article describes how payments to doctors and hospitals had been commonplace in China for years, partly due to doctors receiving low official salaries. The commentary suggests that the government was now targeting foreign drugmakers for enforcement, possibly to make examples of them or to pressure them for lower drug prices.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 Novartis bribery allegations were part of a much larger anti-corruption sweep by Chinese authorities targeting the pharmaceutical industry. Following these initial reports:

- **GSK Investigation (2013-2014)**: Just before the Novartis case, GlaxoSmithKline faced a major corruption investigation in China. In 2014, Chinese courts found GSK guilty of bribery and fined them $492 million, with several executives receiving prison sentences.

- **Novartis and Other Multinationals**: Multiple international pharmaceutical companies faced scrutiny during this period, including AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, and Sanofi, all of whom were investigated for similar corruption allegations in China.

- **Long-Term Policy Impact**: The 2013-2014 crackdowns fundamentally changed how foreign pharmaceutical companies operated in China. Companies had to significantly reform their sales practices, compliance procedures, and relationships with healthcare providers.

- **Industry Transformation**: The crackdown accelerated the shift toward more transparent, value-based marketing approaches and led to the widespread adoption of stricter compliance standards among multinational pharma companies operating in China.

- **Continued Enforcement**: China's anti-corruption efforts in healthcare have persisted beyond this initial wave, with periodic crackdowns continuing in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations:

- **"We're likely to see more whistleblowers come forward"**: This proved accurate. The 2013-2014 period saw numerous whistleblower reports and investigations into pharmaceutical companies operating in China.

- **"Government previously tolerated the practice"**: This was accurate, as evidenced by the widespread nature of the bribery revealed during the subsequent investigations.

- **"Officials are targeting foreign drugmakers... perhaps to twist their arms for lower prices"**: The pricing pressure prediction was partially accurate, but the corruption crackdown had broader motivations including addressing public anger over healthcare costs and establishing regulatory authority.

- **Implicit prediction about continued controversy**: The article correctly anticipated that these initial reports would not be isolated incidents but part of a larger pattern affecting multiple companies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article represents an important early signal of major changes in China's pharmaceutical regulatory environment that would significantly impact how multinational companies operated in one of the world's largest healthcare markets, though its significance was more apparent in retrospect than at publication.
