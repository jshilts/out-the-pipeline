# That Didn't Take Very Long (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the rapid scientific rejection of a controversial PNAS paper by Donald Williamson proposing that caterpillars and other insect larvae evolved through spectacular interspecies gene transfer rather than conventional evolution. The original paper had drawn attention both for its unconventional hypothesis and because it may have been among the last published through PNAS's "Track III" system, which allowed members to select their own reviewers and was subsequently eliminated.

The article describes how two follow-up publications in PNAS systematically dismantled Williamson's hypothesis by examining his specific testable predictions against existing genomic data. These papers found that virtually none of Williamson's predictions held up to scrutiny—genome sizes, genetic relatedness, and molecular evidence all contradicted his claims. The author notes that while bold scientific hypotheses should be encouraged, Williamson appeared to be ignoring previous refutations of his work, crossing the line from brave renegade to crank.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent years firmly rejected Williamson's interspecies gene transfer hypothesis for larval evolution. The scientific community largely dismissed the proposal as pseudoscience, and it gained no meaningful traction in mainstream evolutionary biology or genomics research.

**Publication and Review Reforms**: The controversy contributed to PNAS eliminating the "Track III" review system completely. By 2010, PNAS had reformed its editorial process to eliminate member-controlled review pathways, ensuring more rigorous peer review standards across all submissions.

**Williamson's Continued Work**: Despite the criticism, Williamson continued publishing variations of his hypothesis, including a 2009 book "Caterpillars Evolved from Onychophorans by Hybridogenesis" (characterizing the cell fusion process as "hybridogenesis"). He published additional papers until around 2016, though they gained little attention.

**Scientific Community Position**: The episode reinforced how modern genomic data and phylogenetic methods can decisively test unconventional evolutionary hypotheses. Mainstream evolutionary biology continues to regard larval forms as products of standard evolutionary processes like natural selection and developmental changes, with extensive genomic evidence supporting conventional views of arthropod evolution.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article doesn't make explicit predictions about future developments, but rather evaluates Williamson's already-falsified predictions:

• **Williamson's genome size predictions**: Contradicted by existing data showing parasitic barnacle relatives had *smaller* genomes than expected, not larger, and genetic analysis confirmed they were clearly related to other barnacles
• **Insect larval stage predictions**: Data showed either no correlation or trends opposite to Williamson's hypothesis regarding genome sizes in insects with caterpillar-like larvae  
• **Overall predictive success**: The critical papers demonstrated that "not one of Williamson's many predictions actually goes his way" when tested against available genomic evidence

**Outcome**: Williamson's hypothesis remained scientifically unsupported and gained no empirical validation. The episode demonstrated that even spectacular hypotheses can be decisively tested—and rejected—using existing molecular data and phylogenetic methods.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the article touches on important issues of scientific methodology, peer review reform, and hypothesis testing, the Williamson hypothesis itself proved to be a scientific dead end with no lasting impact. The primary interest lies in the institutional story about peer review reform at PNAS, but the scientific controversy was quickly resolved with little ongoing relevance to biological research or biotechnology.
