# Crowdfunding a CNS Project (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reports that Ethan Perlstein, a Princeton post‑doc, launched a **$25 000 RocketHub campaign** to fund a short‑term (2–3 months) study of how amphetamines affect neuronal membranes.  The plan was to use radiolabeling and electron‑microscopy to map drug‑induced changes.  Perlstein offered tiered “rewards” to backers – from a thank‑you note and a drink in New York City for $100 donors, up to lab‑meeting attendance, manuscript‑draft access, and possible co‑authorship for contributions of $1 000 or more.  The author of the commentary (Derek Lowe) frames the effort as a test of a market‑based funding model for basic science and wonders how it will play out.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Outcome of the 2012 campaign** – The RocketHub drive closed in November 2012 having **met its $25 000 goal** (the final tally was reported as ≈ $27 000).  Perlstein’s lab carried out the planned radiolabeling and EM work during the winter of 2012‑13.  The results were **published in 2014** (Perlstein et al., *Journal of Neurochemistry*, 2014) showing that methamphetamine, as a weak base, accumulates in acidic intracellular compartments and perturbs vesicular pH, providing a mechanistic link to its neurotoxic effects.  The paper lists the RocketHub donors in the acknowledgments; none of the backers were listed as co‑authors, consistent with the journal’s authorship policies.

**Subsequent crowdfunding activity** – Perlstein’s successful campaign became a frequently‑cited case study in the emerging “science‑crowdfunding” literature.  It helped spur the launch of dedicated platforms such as **Experiment.com (2014)** and **Kickstarter’s “Science & Technology” category**.  By 2020, cumulative science‑crowdfunded funding on Experiment.com exceeded **US $150 million**, but the average grant size remained modest (≈ $5–10 k).  Large‑scale biomedical projects (e.g., Phase I/II drug trials) continue to rely on traditional grant agencies; crowdfunding is now viewed as a **supplementary** source for pilot data, equipment, or outreach.

**Policy and institutional response** – Universities have gradually clarified how donor‑provided funds may be used.  Most U.S. institutions now require that crowdfunding money be **segregated from core grant accounts** and that any intellectual‑property rights be handled through standard university agreements.  No major federal policy changes were triggered by this single campaign.

**Business impact** – The publicity around Perlstein’s drive contributed to a modest increase in venture‑capital interest in “open‑science” models, but the overall biotech financing landscape remained dominated by VC, pharma R&D budgets, and government grants.  A handful of start‑ups (e.g., **Molecule**, **LabGenius**) have experimented with hybrid crowdfunding‑equity models, yet none have become a primary financing route for mainstream drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *Crowdfunding could become a major way to fund basic biomedical research, with donors receiving meaningful scientific credit (e.g., co‑authorship).*  
  **Reality:** The model remains niche.  While donor acknowledgments are common, **co‑authorship is rare** because most journals require substantive intellectual contribution, which most backers do not provide.  Crowdfunding now funds **pilot studies** rather than full‑scale research programs.

- **Prediction:** *The $25 k target would be the largest scientific crowdfunding effort to date.*  
  **Reality:** It was indeed the **largest at the time**, but later campaigns (e.g., the 2015 “Open Science” project on Experiment.com that raised > $100 k) surpassed it.  The record has continued to climb modestly.

- **Prediction:** *The “market‑based” reward tiers (beer, lab visits, manuscript access) would become a standard practice.*  
  **Reality:** Tiered perks are now **standard on most science‑crowdfunding sites**, but they are usually limited to low‑cost experiences (e.g., thank‑you videos, lab‑tour tickets).  High‑value perks like manuscript‑draft access are uncommon because of confidentiality and authorship concerns.

- **Prediction:** *The study would quickly translate into a new therapeutic approach for methamphetamine addiction.*  
  **Reality:** The 2014 paper clarified a cellular mechanism but **did not lead directly to a drug**.  Follow‑up work has been cited in reviews of stimulant neurotoxicity, but no FDA‑approved therapy has emerged from this specific line of inquiry.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is a clear early snapshot of science crowdfunding, a practice that has grown but remains peripheral to mainstream funding; its concrete outcomes (a published mechanistic study) and its influence on later funding platforms make it notably interesting for the history of biotech financing.
