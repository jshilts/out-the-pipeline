# Fun With Thermodynamics (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary addresses the state of applying thermodynamic principles to drug discovery, particularly the hope that binding thermodynamics could provide a reliable signature for selecting better drug candidates. The author references a Journal of Medicinal Chemistry review and acknowledges that despite years of research—including work by Ernesto Friere and others—the field had not reached consensus on practical, generalizable rules.

The article critiques attempts to oversimplify thermodynamic signatures, especially popular "rules of thumb" like favoring enthalpically-driven compounds or assuming water displacement always yields favorable entropy gains. Through examples, the piece illustrates that similar compounds within the same structure-activity relationship (SAR) series can operate through very different thermodynamic mechanisms. It emphasizes that water molecules are not all equivalent in their contributions, sometimes becoming more ordered when displaced (counterintuitively hurting entropy), and that complex networks involving protein structure, hydrogen bonding, and solvent effects make generalization difficult. The author concludes that while scientists naturally seek broad rules, ligand binding thermodynamics defies the kind of reductionist approaches that could accelerate drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following 2015, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) remained a valuable but niche tool in drug discovery rather than becoming the transformative screening method some had hoped for. The complexity highlighted in the article proved persistent—thermodynamic signatures did not deliver universal rules for candidate selection.

Academic research continued exploring enthalpy-entropy compensation and water networks in binding, with notable work on fragment-based drug discovery and allosteric modulators. However, these insights remained context-dependent rather than yielding broad predictive rules. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, the field largely accepted that thermodynamic optimization requires case-by-case analysis rather than applying generic guidelines.

Several pharmaceutical companies incorporated more sophisticated biophysical characterization, including ITC, into their workflows, but primarily for mechanistic understanding rather than primary screening. The rise of AI and machine learning in drug discovery (post-2018) created new approaches to binding prediction, though these often focused on structural and energetic modeling rather than thermodynamic signatures per se.

No major FDA-approved drugs emerged specifically because of thermodynamic signature strategies, though numerous drugs succeeded through conventional structure-guided optimization. The fundamental challenge identified in 2015—that binding is too context-dependent for simple rules—remained essentially unchanged, with the field moving toward accepting this complexity rather than conquering it.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself contains an implicit prediction:

- **That thermodynamic signatures would not yield broadly applicable, reductionist rules for drug candidate selection**: This prediction proved largely accurate. While ITC and thermodynamic analysis became more sophisticated, they remained primarily research tools for mechanistic understanding rather than providing universal screening criteria. The optimism of the 2000s-early 2010s about "enthalpy-driven" selection did not translate into widespread practical application, and drug discovery continued to rely heavily on empirical optimization rather than thermodynamic rules of thumb.

No specific timeline predictions were made about when consensus might be reached.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured an important moment of realism in drug discovery methodology, accurately identifying why oversimplified approaches to binding thermodynamics were failing. While it didn't predict transformative breakthroughs, it correctly anticipated that the field's complexity would prevent easy generalization, making it a useful reality check.
