# Market Exclusivity Is Sometimes Too Much (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 article describes a business strategy employed by companies that take older, already-available drugs and seek FDA approval to gain market exclusivity while dramatically increasing prices, rather than developing new medicines. The primary example discussed is Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, which planned to rebrand 3,4-diaminopyridine (used for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome) as "Firdapse" and charge significantly more than Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, who were providing it for free.

The article highlights how this unintended consequence of FDA regulations creates situations where companies can exploit regulatory barriers to achieve monopoly pricing power without investing in research or drug development. Other examples mentioned include Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which immediately raised prices by 525% and 212% on two heart drugs (Nitropress and Isuprel) upon acquiring them—without any improvements to the medications. The author argues that while legitimate innovation deserves market exclusivity rewards, simply acquiring existing drugs and raising prices doesn't merit such protections, and calls for easier generic competition pathways in these cases.

## 2. HISTORY

**Catalyst vs. Jacobus Outcome:**
Both companies eventually gained FDA approval for 3,4-diaminopyridine. Catalyst's Firdapse received FDA approval in November 2018 for LEMS treatment. Jacobus Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for Ruzurgi (their version) in May 2019, but only for pediatric patients aged 6 to under 17. This created a complex market situation where Catalyst held exclusive rights for adult patients while Jacobus competed in the pediatric segment.

**Catalyst's Business Model Reality:**
Rather than the predicted scenario where Jacobus would compete directly, the FDA's split approval created what some critics called a "duopoly" situation. Catalyst maintained premium pricing power over the adult market segment, which comprises the vast majority of LEMS patients. The company successfully implemented its strategy of taking a previously available compound through the regulatory process to gain market exclusivity, though at a higher price point than the previous compassionate use program.

**Valeant Pharmaceuticals Downfall:**
The article's concerns about Valeant proved prescient. Between 2015-2016, Valeant faced major scandals over drug price gouging, including congressional investigations. The company's stock plummeted from over $260 per share in 2015 to under $20 by 2016. Key executives faced scrutiny, and Valeant was forced to restructure, eventually changing its name to Bausch Health Companies in 2018. However, the fundamental issue of acquiring older drugs and dramatically increasing prices became a widespread industry concern that attracted regulatory and political attention.

**Industry and Regulatory Response:**
The practices described in the article contributed to increased public scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, leading to several developments including:
- Congressional hearings on drug pricing
- Increased FDA attention to generic drug competition
- Greater public awareness of orphan drug and market exclusivity issues
- Some states implementing drug price transparency laws
- FTC investigations into pharmaceutical industry consolidation and pricing practices

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Jacobus's clinical trial would prevent Catalyst from easily gaining exclusive market control through regulatory approval.
  - **Actual outcome**: Both companies gained FDA approval, but for different patient populations. This effectively created segmented monopolies rather than direct competition, allowing Catalyst to maintain premium pricing for adult patients.

• **Prediction**: The author called for easier generic competition pathways when companies simply repackage existing drugs without innovation.
  - **Actual outcome**: While some policy attention occurred, the fundamental regulatory framework allowing these strategies remained largely intact, though with increased scrutiny.

• **Prediction**: That such practices would reveal problems with market-exclusivity incentives being "too much reward for too little work."
  - **Actual outcome**: These concerns became central to broader drug pricing debates, particularly around Valeant and similar companies, leading to congressional investigations and public outrage, though systemic regulatory reforms were limited.

• **Implicit prediction**: Companies like Valeant could continue their strategy of acquiring drugs and immediately raising prices dramatically.
  - **Actual outcome**: While initially successful, Valeant's approach proved unsustainable and led to massive stock declines, management changes, and reputational damage, though similar practices by other companies continued at smaller scales.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **8/10**

This article remarkably anticipated major pharmaceutical industry controversies that would dominate headlines in subsequent years, particularly around Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The specific case studies analyzed proved highly relevant and the underlying issues identified became central to national debates about drug pricing and regulatory policy.
