# Time For A Name Change (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses ISIS Pharmaceuticals' decision to consider changing its name due to the negative association with the terrorist organization ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). The author compares this situation to a similar rebranding necessity from the 1980s when a weight-loss product called "Ayds" faced similar pronunciation issues during the AIDS epidemic. The article expresses sympathy for ISIS Pharmaceuticals, noting they didn't seek this trouble, while also contrasting modern scientific values with those of extremist ideologies.

## 2. HISTORY
ISIS Pharmaceuticals did indeed change its name shortly after this article was published. In December 2015, the company officially rebranded to **Ionis Pharmaceuticals** after operating as ISIS Pharmaceuticals for 26 years. The company cited the need to eliminate ongoing confusion and distractions caused by sharing the name with the terrorist organization. Following the name change, Ionis Pharmaceuticals continued its focus on antisense drug discovery and development. The company has since brought multiple drugs to market, including Spinraza (nusinersen) for spinal muscular atrophy, Tegsedi (inotersen) for hereditary transthyroidine amyloidosis, and Waylivra (volanesorsen) for familial chylomicronemia syndrome. The company maintained its NASDAQ listing under the new ticker symbol "IONS" and has continued to advance its antisense technology platform without the negative branding association hindering its business operations or scientific collaborations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Prediction made in the article:** That a name change was necessary and imminent for ISIS Pharmaceuticals due to the negative association with the terrorist organization.

**Actual outcome:** ✓ **Accurate** - The company did change its name to Ionis Pharmaceuticals within approximately one month of this article's publication (December 2015).

**Prediction made in the article:** Drawing parallels to the "Ayds" product situation from the 1980s.

**Actual outcome:** The article correctly identified the similarity between both branding challenges, though unlike Ayds (which eventually disappeared from the market), Ionis Pharmaceuticals successfully transitioned to a new brand identity and continued operations.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2/10**

This article documents a timely corporate rebranding necessity rather than discussing substantive scientific or biotechnological developments. While it captured a moment when external events impacted biotech branding, it lacks long-term importance for understanding biotechnology advances or industry evolution.
