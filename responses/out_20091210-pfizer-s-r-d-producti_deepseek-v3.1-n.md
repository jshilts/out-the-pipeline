# Pfizer's R&D Productivity (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2009 commentary analyzes Pfizer's research and development productivity by examining the company's output of New Molecular Entities (NMEs) against its escalating R&D expenditures. The article cites data from Bernard Munos showing that Pfizer produced only nine NMEs between 2000-2008, despite nearly tripling R&D spending during this period. The listed drugs include Geodon, Vfend, Relpax, Somavert, Lyrica, Sutent, Chantix, Selzentry, and Toviaz. 

The author notes the disconnect between Pfizer's earlier claims of having 101 NMEs in development with plans to file 20 NDAs by 2009, versus the actual sparse output. The analysis raises concerns about declining R&D productivity, particularly given that Pfizer had acquired multiple research organizations (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Warner Lambert, Pharmacia) that should have enhanced, not diminished, innovation output.

## 2. HISTORY

The warning signs highlighted in this 2009 article proved prescient. In the subsequent decade, Pfizer faced continued R&D productivity challenges and underwent major strategic shifts:

**Clinical outcomes of mentioned drugs post-2009:**
- **Lyrica (pregabalin)** became a blockbuster, reaching peak sales of over \$5 billion annually, though facing generic competition from 2019 onward
- **Sutent (sunitinib)** remained an important oncology drug with continued clinical use
- **Chantix (varenicline)** faced significant safety concerns, including FDA warnings about cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric side effects, eventually leading to its withdrawal from some markets
- **Selzentry (maraviroc)** had limited uptake due to the complexity of CCR5 testing required and the emergence of better HIV treatment options

**Pfizer's subsequent R&D strategy transformation:**
Rather than solving internal R&D productivity, Pfizer increasingly relied on external innovation through major acquisitions:
- **2015**: \$15 billion acquisition of Hospira (sterile injectables and biosimilars)
- **2016**: \$14 billion acquisition of Medivation (oncology, including Xtandi)
- **2019**: \$11.4 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma
- **2020**: Strategic decision to largely exit neuroscience research
- **2023**: \$43 billion acquisition of Seagen (antibody-drug conjugates)

The company did not fundamentally fix its internal R&D productivity issues but became increasingly dependent on acquiring external innovation rather than generating it internally. This shift validated the 2009 article's concerns about the sustainability of Pfizer's research model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit predictions in the article:**
- **That Pfizer's R&D productivity crisis would require fundamental changes:** ✓ **Mostly correct.** Pfizer did not solve its internal R&D productivity but instead shifted heavily toward external innovation through major acquisitions, essentially confirming the unsustainability of their existing model.

- **That the disconnect between spending and output was unsustainable:** ✓ **Correct.** The company's subsequent acquisition-heavy strategy acknowledged that internal R&D alone could not deliver sufficient innovation.

- **That having 101 NMEs in development would translate to significant approvals:** ✗ **Incorrect assumption (by Pfizer).** The pipeline did not materialize as projected, validating the article's skepticism about pipeline claims versus actual delivery.

**Broader trend prediction accuracy:**
The article correctly identified that industry R&D productivity was becoming a critical issue, a trend that continued throughout the 2010s with industry-wide declining returns on R&D investment and increased reliance on acquisitions rather than internal discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an early and accurate warning about pharmaceutical R&D productivity challenges that would define the next decade of industry strategy. Its analysis of the disconnect between R&D investment and innovation output proved highly relevant to understanding Pfizer's subsequent transformation into an acquisition-focused model.
