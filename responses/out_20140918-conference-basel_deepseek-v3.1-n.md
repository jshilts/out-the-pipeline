# Conference in Basel (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief personal announcement blog post from September 2014 in which the author states they will be attending the Fragment-Based Ligand Design (FBLD) conference in Basel, Switzerland the following week. The author expresses enthusiasm for the specialized nature of the conference, noting that having interest in most presentations makes attendance more valuable than conferences with irrelevant content. They mention plans to blog about interesting topics that emerge during the event and extend an invitation to meet with other attendees on Monday and Wednesday evenings.

## 2. HISTORY

Fragment-Based Ligand Design has continued as an important approach in drug discovery since 2014. The methodology, which involves screening small molecular fragments and growing/optimizing hits into drug candidates, has maintained relevance in pharmaceutical research. The field has seen continued development with companies like Astex, Vernalis, and others remaining active.

However, I cannot provide specific details about the outcomes of this particular September 2014 conference, what specific advances were presented there, or how individual companies or research programs mentioned at that event subsequently developed. The post itself is primarily a conference attendance announcement rather than a substantive piece about biotechnology developments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contains no predictions about future developments in biotechnology or drug discovery. It is purely an announcement of conference attendance with general commentary about the value of specialized scientific meetings.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is essentially a personal blog post about conference attendance rather than substantive biotech analysis. It lacks meaningful technical content, predictions, or insights about the biotechnology industry, making it of very limited interest for retrospective analysis of biotech developments.
