## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a follow-up to earlier coverage of InterMune and its drug pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In 2010, InterMune's prospects looked uncertain after the FDA requested more data, which cast doubt on the company's ability to fund additional trials. By February 2014, however, InterMune had successfully completed a Phase III trial that met all its endpoints, positioning the drug for another FDA submission. The author notes the company's volatile stock history, marked by dramatic swings driven by rumors and clinical trial expectations, and celebrates both the company's persistence and the potential benefit for IPF patients.

## 2. HISTORY

The aftermath of this article unfolded rapidly:

- **FDA and regulatory outcomes**: In October 2014, the FDA granted accelerated approval for pirfenidone for IPF, based on the ASCEND Phase III trial results highlighted in the article.
- **Merger and acquisition**: In 2014–2015, InterMune was acquired by Roche for approximately \$8.3 billion, a significant premium reflecting the successful Phase III outcome and regulatory momentum.
- **Market performance and adoption**: Following approval, pirfenidone (branded as Esbriet) became a mainstay IPF therapy in many markets. It was later joined by nintedanib, another approved agent, creating a dual-pillar pharmacologic approach for IPF.
- **Scientific and clinical evolution**: Subsequent studies and real-world evidence largely supported pirfenidone's benefit in slowing IPF progression, while also clarifying its side-effect profile (e.g., GI upset, photosensitivity, liver enzyme elevations). Treatment paradigms shifted toward earlier initiation and combination considerations.
- **Market expansion and access**: Esbriet achieved blockbuster status (over \$1 billion annual sales), but pricing and reimbursement hurdles persisted, affecting patient access in some regions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions that matched**:
- InterMune successfully navigated the FDA pathway with robust Phase III data, validating the premise that the company could pull together resources to deliver the needed evidence.
- The drug proved highly valuable, leading to substantial shareholder returns (via the Roche acquisition) and becoming a cornerstone IPF therapy.
- The article's implicit expectation that solid data would translate to clinical and commercial success broadly held true.

**Predictions that were wrong or incomplete**:
- The piece did not explicitly forecast a near-term acquisition at a premium; the focus was on clinical success rather than a buyout.
- It did not anticipate the emergence of a second major agent (nintedanib) creating a competitive landscape.
- Some early over-optimism about the drug's impact may have overlooked the later challenges in efficacy (modest slowing of decline rather than reversal), side effects, and variable patient access.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile score: 3**

**Rationale**: While the article correctly predicted InterMune's clinical progress and eventual drug approval, the piece primarily serves as a clinical-trial update in a crowded biotech landscape. From a broader historical and technological perspective, this is a routine development story about a single drug rather than a transformative breakthrough that reshaped medicine. IPF remained a progressive, fatal disease with limited therapeutic options, and the drug's incremental efficacy did not fundamentally alter that reality. The more enduring impact was commercial and regulatory (validating a pathway to IPF drug approval), but this did not represent paradigm-shifting science or long-term industry transformation. The article is historically accurate and relevant for IPF drug development, but its broader importance is modest.

**For context, a score of 9 would reflect a milestone like the advent of CRISPR-based gene editing or the development of mRNA vaccine platforms—technologies with sweeping, cross-disease implications.** This article is a snapshot of one company's successful trial readout in a niche indication; it is interesting but not highly significant in the broader arc of biotechnology history.
