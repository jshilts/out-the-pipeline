# Abbott Cuts the Drug Business Loose (October 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary notes that Abbott Laboratories announced it would separate its research‑based pharmaceutical division into an independent company. The author interprets the move as a reaction to “worries” about the pharma side—chiefly the heavy reliance on Humira (adalimumab), an anti‑TNF biologic that at the time generated a large share of Abbott’s drug revenue and was facing an increasingly crowded market. The piece also mentions other Abbott drugs such as TriCor (fenofibrate) and Niaspan (niacin) that were approaching patent expiry, and it speculates that the new pharma spin‑off would be left with a fragile pipeline and might need to cut jobs. The author concludes that Abbott’s medical‑device business will retain the historic “Abbott” name, while the pharma entity will be left to fend for itself.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Spin‑off and formation of AbbVie** – Abbott completed the separation on 1 January 2013, creating AbbVie Inc. as a publicly traded company. AbbVie inherited Humira, the blockbuster that continued to dominate its revenue stream for several more years.

**Humira’s trajectory** – Humira remained the world’s best‑selling drug through 2017, peaking at > $20 billion in annual sales. In the United States, its patent expired in 2018, but the FDA did not approve the first biosimilar (Amjevita/adalimumab‑atto) until 2023. Consequently, AbbVie’s Humira sales fell sharply after 2022, dropping from $19.2 billion in 2021 to about $12 billion in 2023, a ~ 35 % decline.

**Pipeline and acquisitions** – AbbVie expanded beyond Humira through several high‑profile deals:  

* **2015 – Pharmacyclics** (US$21 billion) added ibrutinib (Imbruvica), a successful oncology drug.  
* **2020 – Allergan** (US$63 billion) brought in Botox, Restasis, and a broader portfolio of specialty medicines.  
* **2022 – Immunomedics** (US$16 billion) added Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan) for triple‑negative breast cancer.  

These acquisitions transformed AbbVie into a diversified specialty‑pharma company, reducing its dependence on Humira to roughly 30 % of total sales by 2023.

**Financial performance** – AbbVie’s market capitalization grew from ~ US$70 billion at IPO to > US$200 billion by early 2024, reflecting investor confidence in its expanded pipeline despite the Humira biosimilar hit.

**Abbott (device & diagnostics side)** – The remaining Abbott retained its name and focused on medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, and established a strong position in diabetes monitoring (FreeStyle Libre), cardiovascular devices, and point‑of‑care diagnostics. Revenue from the device side grew at a compound annual growth rate of ~ 7 % from 2013 to 2023, and the company’s stock outperformed the broader S&P 500 over the same period.

**Industry context** – Abbott’s split mirrored similar moves by other large conglomerates (e.g., Johnson & Johnson’s spin‑off of its consumer health unit in 2023, and the earlier de‑merger of Pfizer’s consumer health into “Wyeth” in 2009). The strategy of separating high‑growth, high‑margin specialty pharma from lower‑margin device/diagnostic businesses proved broadly successful.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** *The new pharma company would be “left with three‑quarters of its revenue from Humira” and would face a “rough situation” once Humira entered “white water.”*  
  **Outcome:** True for the first few years; Humira accounted for ~ 70 % of AbbVie’s 2015‑2019 revenue. The “white water” arrived with US biosimilar entry in 2023, leading to a steep revenue decline, confirming the author’s concern about over‑reliance.

- **Prediction in the article:** *The spin‑off would likely need to shed jobs and struggle to sustain growth.*  
  **Outcome:** AbbVie did reduce headcount modestly (≈ 5 % cuts in 2018‑2020) but offset this with acquisitions that added thousands of employees. Overall, the company grew its workforce to > 50 000 by 2024, so the job‑loss prediction was only partially accurate.

- **Implicit prediction:** *Abbott’s device business would retain the historic brand and continue to do well.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The medical‑device and diagnostics arm kept the “Abbott” name and posted consistent double‑digit revenue growth in several segments (e.g., diabetes care, point‑of‑care testing).

- **Implicit prediction:** *No clear, convincing strategy would emerge for either side.*  
  **Outcome:** Both entities eventually articulated distinct, successful strategies: AbbVie pursued specialty‑oncology and immunology through acquisitions; Abbott focused on integrated diagnostics‑device platforms and nutrition. The initial uncertainty gave way to concrete roadmaps.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **8/10**  

The article captures a pivotal corporate restructuring that reshaped two major players in biotech and medical‑device markets. Its prescient concerns about Humira dependence proved largely correct, and the spin‑off’s subsequent evolution into a leading specialty‑pharma firm makes the piece historically valuable.
