# One For the Brave (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the synthesis of a novel class of compounds called 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborines, which are isoelectronic with benzene (they share the same electron count and occupy similar molecular orbitals). Researchers at the University of Oregon led by the Liu group developed an improved synthetic route using ring-closing metathesis, producing stable aromatic compounds that could be purified by standard chromatography methods. The author notes that boron-containing compounds historically had a poor reputation in drug development ("boron for morons"), but points to Velcade (bortezomib), a boronic acid proteasome inhibitor, as a successful counterexample that was making money for Millennium Pharmaceuticals. The central question posed is: who will be the first to incorporate this azaborine scaffold into a drug candidate, given the complete uncertainty about its in vivo fate, potential toxicity, and metabolic profile.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication, the field of boron-containing drugs experienced significant growth, validating the author's premise that boron chemistry deserved serious attention in pharmaceutical development. The Liu group's 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborines proved to be valuable building blocks, not only for potential pharmaceuticals but also as novel aromatic systems in materials science. Bortezomib (Velcade) continued its success and remains an important treatment for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More broadly, boron-containing compounds gained substantial traction in drug discovery. Several boronic acid-based drugs beyond bortezomib have been approved, including tavaborole (an antifungal), crisaborole (a topical PDE4 inhibitor for atopic dermatitis), and ixazomib (an oral proteasome inhibitor for multiple myeloma). Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) drugs have also advanced in certain markets, particularly in Japan. The pharmaceutical industry's acceptance of boron grew considerably, and numerous boron-containing drug candidates entered clinical development. The 1,2-azaborine scaffold itself found applications in materials chemistry, particularly in the design of organic semiconductors and as components in metal-organic frameworks. In drug discovery, while 1,2-azaborines did not immediately become a dominant scaffold, medicinal chemists became much more willing to explore boron-containing structures in general. The subsequent years also saw advances in understanding boron metabolism and toxicity, addressing some of the unknowns mentioned in the original article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction that azaborines would face skepticism due to boron's "bad reputation"**: This was accurate regarding initial attitudes, but the broader trend was strongly positive—boron chemistry gained substantial acceptance in pharmaceutical development over the following decade and a half, with multiple FDA approvals.

• **Implicit prediction that someone would test azaborines in drug candidates**: Correct. Various azaborine derivatives were explored in medicinal chemistry contexts, though they did not become a dominant drug scaffold comparable to traditional aromatic heterocycles.

• **Implicit prediction that Velcade would continue as a positive example**: Correct. Bortezomib remained an important oncology drug, and multiple additional boron-containing drugs received FDA approval after 2007, confirming that boron was not inherently problematic for drug development.

• **Explicit uncertainty about in vivo fate and toxicity of azaborines**: This was appropriately cautious. Subsequent research developed better understanding of boron metabolism and organoboron toxicology, but the specific azaborine scaffold did not become extensively characterized in clinical contexts.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
The article captured a turning point in medicinal chemistry attitudes toward boron-based heterocycles and correctly anticipated that skepticism would fade as more successful examples emerged, making it a prescient commentary on an important shift in drug design paradigms.
