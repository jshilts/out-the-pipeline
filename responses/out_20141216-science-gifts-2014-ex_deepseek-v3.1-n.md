# Science Gifts 2014: Experiments at Home (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article recommends science-themed gift books for holiday shoppers interested in home experimentation. It highlights a "small boom" in books aimed at people interested in science without formal training, including young people and adults who missed science education. Recommended titles include Robert Bruce Thompson's Illustrated Guide series (chemistry, biology, and forensic science experiments), Theodore Gray's "Mad Science" books (experiments marked as "probably shouldn't" do at home due to hazardous materials), and Bassam Shakhashiri's multi-volume "Chemical Demonstrations" series for educators.

## 2. HISTORY
The "home science experiments" market continued growing after 2014, but shifted toward digital platforms and subscription kits rather than traditional books. Makeblock (founded 2013) expanded globally with STEM robotics kits. KiwiCo (founded 2011) scaled significantly post-2014, reaching millions of subscribers by offering age-appropriate experiment crates monthly. Mel Science (2015) launched chemistry-focused subscription boxes with VR/AR integration. YouTube science channels like Mark Rober (engineering), NileRed (chemistry), and The Thought Emporium (biology/DIY) attracted millions of subscribers, making complex experiments accessible without books. While Thompson's guides remained available, Amazon's 2018 acquisition of Whole Foods led them to discontinue certain home chemistry titles over safety concerns, a trend affecting hazard-flagged books after 2015. Theodore Gray's "Mad Science" approach gained merchandising partnerships (posters, apps) but saw slower new print releases after 2018. Shakhashiri's academic-focused series maintained steady use in education but did not experience the broader retail growth of hands-on subscription models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Small boom in home experiment books"**: Accurate. The market grew but shifted to kits/streaming more than book-only content.
- **Growth of "people interested in science without training"**: Accurate. DIY biology (e.g., BioCurious), citizen science platforms (Zooniverse), and STEM kits expanded public participation.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 5**  
This captures a transitional moment from print guides to hands-on kits/online learning, reflecting real trends that persisted.
