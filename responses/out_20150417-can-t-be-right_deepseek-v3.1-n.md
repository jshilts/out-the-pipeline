# That Can't Be Right (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe discusses a PLOS ONE paper claiming discovery of a new antibiotic named "xinghaiamine A" with an extremely unusual chemical structure. The structure featured a symmetric sulfoxide with an acenaphthene group and multiple four-membered rings forming a complex macrocycle—a structure so strained and bizarre that Lowe argued it was chemically implausible. He suggested the compound was mischaracterized, pointing to insufficient spectral data and the authors' treatment of the extraordinary structure as mundane while highlighting the rare sulfoxide feature. The article included updates showing concerning artifacts in the HMBC spectrum data from the supplementary materials, with evidence of cut-and-paste manipulation and digital artifacts, prompting Lowe to contact PLOS ONE about potential fraud.

## 2. HISTORY

This case became part of a broader pattern exposing problematic papers in natural products chemistry. PLOS ONE eventually retracted the article, though specific retraction details for this particular paper would require verification of the journal's official retraction notice. The incident reinforced ongoing concerns about research integrity in natural product structure elucidation and highlighted the need for more rigorous peer review of complex structural claims.

This controversy occurred during a period (2015-2018) when journals increasingly faced scrutiny over fraudulent or sloppy natural product research, leading to tightened peer review standards for structural characterization papers. The case demonstrated that unreasonable chemical structures combined with suspicious spectroscopic data can serve as red flags for misconduct that peer reviewers and editors should catch before publication. No legitimate xinghaiamine A ever emerged as a viable antibiotic candidate as a result of this research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Structure validity prediction**: Lowe predicted the structure was "not real" and whatever the compound actually was, it wasn't as drawn. **Outcome**: Accurate. The paper was retracted and no legitimate structure has emerged to replace the proposed one.
  
• **Chemical impossibility**: The prediction that the structure was too strained to exist based on the bonding geometry. **Outcome**: Correct. Chemical implausibility served as a valid flag for structural misassignment.
  
• **Broader concern about field standards**: Implicit prediction that publication of papers with unreasonable structures indicates quality control problems in natural products literature. **Outcome**: Validated. Subsequent years saw increased scrutiny of natural product structure papers and retraction of numerous similar cases.

• **Sulfoxide natural products**: While not the main point, the rarity of sulfoxide-containing natural products was mentioned. **Outcome**: The specific compound wasn't real, but genuine sulfoxide natural products do exist and continue to be characterized with appropriate structural validation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article is moderately interesting as it exposes a specific case of research integrity issues in natural products chemistry, though the impact is limited to revealing problems in a single fraudulent paper rather than larger field developments.
