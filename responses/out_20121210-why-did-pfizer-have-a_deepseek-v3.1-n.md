# Why Did Pfizer Have All That Gold Dust, Anyway? (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the curious case of approximately fifty pounds of gold dust that went missing from Pfizer's laboratories in St. Louis. The author notes that while the story had been reported in news outlets, no details were provided about what legitimate pharmaceutical research purpose would require such a large quantity of gold dust. The article speculates on possible uses, including catalysts, gold nanoparticles, biophysical assay supports, or filtration applications. It invites reader comments on potential explanations, with one humorous suggestion that Pfizer might have been planning to turn it into lead.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2012 incident, there was limited public resolution to the mystery. The missing gold dust case appears to have remained unsolved, with no major breakthroughs reported in subsequent years regarding Pfizer's intended use or the location of the stolen materials. This incident highlighted broader security concerns in pharmaceutical research facilities, which handle valuable materials beyond just gold, including rare chemicals, proprietary compounds, and expensive equipment. The case served as a workplace security cautionary tale rather than revealing any significant scientific or pharmaceutical breakthrough involving gold dust. No major scientific publications or patent filings emerged linking this gold dust to notable research discoveries or drug development programs at Pfizer.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Gold to lead joke**: The humorous comment about turning gold into lead was purely satirical - no such alchemy occurred
• **Scientific breakthrough expectation**: While readers speculated about potential research applications, no subsequent scientific literature revealed gold dust as critical to any major Pfizer breakthroughs in the following years
• **Mystery resolution**: The case largely remained unsolved rather than revealing its intended research purpose

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

While the incident was briefly attention-grabbing due to the unusual nature of missing precious metals from a pharmaceutical lab, it had minimal long-term scientific or industry importance and was ultimately a security incident rather than a story of scientific significance.
