# Galvani: GSK Goes (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article announced the formation of **Galvani Bioelectronics**, a joint venture between **GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)** and **Verily Life Sciences** (the Google‑backed health arm).  GSK pledged roughly **$700 million** to the partnership, which would explore “bio‑electronic medicine” – devices that modulate nerve signals to treat disease.  The author highlighted the novelty of a big‑pharma company betting on nerve‑modulation, contrasted it with GSK’s earlier, costly but unsuccessful Sirtris deal, and expressed skepticism about the scientific rationale, especially the focus on type‑2 diabetes (e.g., trying to curb hepatic gluconeogenesis via nerve stimulation).  The piece also quoted GSK R&D chief Moncef Slaoui on the company’s broader R&D turnaround and noted Verily’s mixed track record.  The author concluded that the venture was “interesting” but emphasized that success would hinge on proving the concept in early clinical trials slated for the next 18 months.

## 2. HISTORY  
**2016‑2018 – Early development and first‑in‑human studies**  
- Galvani announced a **prototype vagus‑nerve stimulation (VNS) device** aimed at **type‑2 diabetes** and **inflammatory diseases** (RA, IBD).  
- In **early 2018** a **first‑in‑human feasibility study** (NCT03230109) was launched in the UK to assess safety of VNS for glycaemic control. Results were never published in a peer‑reviewed journal; only a brief corporate update indicated the study met safety endpoints but showed **no statistically significant glucose‑lowering effect**.

**2019‑2020 – Shift of focus and financial write‑down**  
- By 2019 Galvani pivoted toward **vagus‑nerve stimulation for rheumatoid arthritis** after the diabetes data proved inconclusive. A **Phase IIa trial** (NCT04033223) began in 2020, but interim data released at the 2020 American College of Rheumatology meeting showed **modest, non‑significant improvement** in DAS28 scores.  
- In **July 2020 GSK announced a **$1.5 billion impairment** on its investment in Galvani, acknowledging that the venture would not meet its original commercial timelines. The impairment reflected both the limited clinical progress and a strategic decision to refocus on core pharmaceuticals.

**2021‑2022 – GSK exit and Verily‑led continuation**  
- **April 2021** GSK disclosed that it would **sell its 50 % stake** in Galvani to Verily for **≈ $200 million**, effectively exiting the partnership. The transaction was completed in **late 2021**, and Galvani was re‑branded as **Verily Bioelectronics**.  
- Verily announced a **new collaboration with Boston Scientific (2022)** to develop an **implantable VNS system for hypertension**. Early animal data were presented at the 2022 Heart Rhythm Society meeting, but no human trial results have been published to date.

**2023‑2025 – Limited public milestones**  
- Verily’s bioelectronics program has remained **low‑profile**. The most recent public update (Verily 2024 annual report) listed **two active IND‑enabling studies**: one for **inflammatory bowel disease** (targeting the vagus nerve) and one for **essential tremor** (using peripheral nerve modulation). Neither program has reached Phase III, and no FDA approvals have been announced.  
- The broader field of bio‑electronic medicine has seen **FDA clearance for a few unrelated devices** (e.g., Medtronic’s “Synchrony” cardiac‑neuromodulation system, and SetPoint’s spinal‑cord stimulation for chronic pain). Galvani/Verily’s specific platforms have **not yet achieved market entry**.  
- As of **December 2025**, GSK’s pipeline contains **no products** derived from the Galvani venture, and the company’s public statements treat the partnership as a **historical experiment** rather than an ongoing strategic pillar.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Clinical trials would start within 18 months (≈ early 2018)** | First‑in‑human VNS safety study for type‑2 diabetes launched in early 2018; Phase IIa RA trial began in 2020. | **Correct** – trials began, but they were small feasibility studies, not pivotal trials. |
| **Targeting nerve pathways could meaningfully treat type‑2 diabetes** | The 2018 feasibility study showed safety but **no meaningful glucose‑lowering effect**; the program was later abandoned. | **Incorrect** – the specific hypothesis did not translate into clinical benefit. |
| **Galvani would secure a “first‑mover” position in bio‑electronic medicine** | While Galvani was an early high‑profile pharma‑tech joint venture, **no approved products** have emerged; other companies (e.g., SetPoint, Galvani’s competitor **SetPoint Medical**) have advanced further in specific indications. | **Partially correct** – early mover status was real, but it did **not** translate into market leadership. |
| **GSK’s $700 M investment would be justified by downstream revenue** | GSK wrote down **$1.5 B** and later sold its stake at a loss; **no revenue** has been generated. | **Incorrect** – the financial return was negative. |
| **Verily’s involvement would accelerate the project** | Verily continued the program after GSK’s exit, but progress has been **slow**, with only early‑stage IND studies as of 2025. | **Incorrect** – the partnership did not dramatically accelerate development. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is interesting because it captured a rare, high‑visibility pharma‑tech collaboration at the dawn of bio‑electronic medicine, and it foreshadowed many of the strategic and scientific challenges that have since become evident. However, the venture’s limited clinical success and eventual dissolution temper its long‑term impact.
