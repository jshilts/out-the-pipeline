# Sarepta Gets An Approval – Unfortunately (September 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article describes the FDA’s controversial approval of Sarepta Therapeutics’ Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51).  The author notes that the approval was granted despite an advisory committee’s recommendation against it, a very small (≈12‑patient) pivotal trial, and modest, arguably clinically irrelevant increases in dystrophin protein.  The piece emphasizes internal FDA dissent—particularly from senior officials Luciana Borio and Ellis Unger—who warned that the decision could set a low‑standard precedent and expose patients to a costly therapy with little proven benefit.  The author worries that the approval was achieved more through political lobbying (especially of CDRH director Janet Woodcock) than through solid data, and speculates that the drug could be withdrawn later if post‑marketing studies fail to show benefit.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome (2016‑present)**  
* **Accelerated approval** was granted in September 2016 on the surrogate endpoint of increased dystrophin.  The FDA required a confirmatory Phase III trial (the “PROMOVI” study, NCT02386916) to verify clinical benefit.  
* **Confirmatory data** (first reported in 2019‑2020) showed a modest increase in dystrophin but failed to meet the primary functional endpoint (change in 6‑minute walk distance).  An FDA advisory committee in 2020 again voted that the evidence was insufficient for a full approval.  The agency, however, **maintained the accelerated approval** and imposed a post‑marketing requirement for a larger efficacy study (NCT04060130).  
* **Current status (2025)** – eteplirsen remains on the market under accelerated approval.  The required post‑marketing trial is still ongoing, and the FDA has not withdrawn the drug.  The label still carries the “clinical benefit not yet established” disclaimer.  

**Commercial and clinical impact**  
* **Revenue** – Sarepta’s sales of Exondys 51 grew from ≈ $30 M in 2017 to ≈ $250 M annually by 2023, driven largely by insurance coverage for the ≈ $300 k‑per‑year price.  The high price sparked multiple payer appeals and state‑level reimbursement disputes, but most major insurers now cover the drug under specialty‑drug benefits.  
* **Clinical perception** – The DMD community remains divided.  Some clinicians and families report anecdotal slowing of disease progression, while systematic reviews (e.g., 2022 Cochrane analysis) conclude that the evidence for functional benefit is **low‑certainty**.  The drug is generally prescribed only to patients amenable to exon‑51 skipping (≈ 13 % of the DMD population).  
* **Industry ripple effect** – The approval paved the way for three additional exon‑skipping therapies:  
  * **Golodirsen** (Vyondys 53, FDA 2019) – exon‑53 skipping.  
  * **Viltolarsen** (Viltepso, FDA 2020) – exon‑53 skipping, approved under the same accelerated pathway.  
  * **Casimersen** (Amondys 45, FDA 2021) – exon‑45 skipping.  
  All three received accelerated approvals with similar post‑marketing obligations, indicating that the FDA did not broadly lower evidentiary standards but applied the same “surrogate‑endpoint” framework to a niche class of therapies.  

**Policy and precedent**  
* The FDA’s “accelerated approval” pathway remains unchanged; however, the agency has become more explicit about post‑marketing enforcement.  In 2022 the FDA issued guidance emphasizing that **withdrawal** of accelerated‑approval drugs is possible if confirmatory trials are negative, but it has not exercised that power for eteplirsen.  
* Congressional hearings (2018, 2021) questioned the cost‑effectiveness of eteplirsen and similar drugs, leading to increased scrutiny of “rare‑disease” pricing but no legislative change to the approval process itself.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made in the article (or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Approval could open the floodgates for poorly designed trials** | A handful of additional exon‑skipping drugs were approved, but each still required a confirmatory study and faced strong internal FDA dissent.  The “floodgate” effect was limited; the FDA retained its requirement for post‑marketing data. |
| **The drug might be withdrawn if no benefit is shown** | As of 2025, eteplirsen **remains approved**.  Confirmatory trials have not demonstrated a clear functional benefit, but the FDA has kept the accelerated approval pending further data. |
| **Pricing would be high and possibly a “placebo” cost** | The price stayed near $300 k / year, making it one of the most expensive rare‑disease drugs.  Payers continue to negotiate rebates, but the cost‑to‑patients (or insurers) remains substantial. |
| **Regulatory precedent would allow companies to “lobby” the director to override scientific review** | While Sarepta’s success highlighted the influence of senior FDA officials, subsequent approvals still followed the standard advisory‑committee and review‑team process.  No systematic “lobby‑to‑override” mechanism was institutionalized. |
| **Other drugs would be approved with similarly small patient numbers** | All subsequent exon‑skipping approvals were based on **≤ 30‑patient** studies, reflecting the rarity of the target population rather than a new low‑standard policy. |

Overall, the article’s concerns about **lowered evidentiary standards** were partially borne out (more surrogate‑based approvals), but the FDA’s continued insistence on confirmatory trials and the lack of any withdrawal show that the agency has not fully embraced the “placebo‑approval” model the author feared.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal moment in rare‑disease drug regulation and foreshadows the rise of exon‑skipping therapies; its relevance persists because the debate over accelerated approval, pricing, and evidentiary standards continues to shape biotech policy.
