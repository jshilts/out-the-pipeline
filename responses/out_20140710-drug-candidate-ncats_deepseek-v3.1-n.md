# A Drug Candidate from NCATS (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the first compound from NIH's NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) program that was picked up for development by a biopharma company. The compound, AES-103, was being developed by AesRx (recently acquired by Baxter) for sickle cell anemia. The drug candidate is hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which works by stabilizing mutant hemoglobin to prevent polymerization—the molecular mechanism underlying sickle cell disease.

The author expresses significant skepticism about the compound's prospects due to its chemical structure. Furans, aldehydes, and hydroxymethyl groups near aromatic rings all have problematic histories in drug development, particularly regarding pharmacokinetics, reactivity, and metabolic stability. The author notes that only 700 compounds were screened, which they consider "insanely small" for a screening effort, and questions why this particular compound was even tested given its structural red flags. However, the author acknowledges that the compound had already entered Phase II clinical trials by 2014, suggesting real clinical data supported its continued development despite the structural concerns.

## 2. HISTORY

AES-103 (also known as Aes-103 or 5-HMF) did not achieve FDA approval. The drug candidate continued through clinical development but ultimately failed to reach the market. Clinical trials progressed as planned initially—Phase I was completed in 2011, and Phase II trials were conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety in sickle cell disease patients.

Baxter International acquired AesRx in 2014 specifically to gain access to AES-103, seeing potential in the rare disease market. However, in 2015, Baxter spun off its biopharmaceutical business into Baxalta, which then became part of Shire through acquisition. The drug development program continued under these corporate transitions but ultimately did not result in an approved therapy.

The compound's mechanism—stabilizing hemoglobin to prevent sickling—was scientifically interesting but faced challenges in demonstrating consistent clinical efficacy and safety. The structural concerns raised in the article proved prescient, as developing small molecules that can effectively modify hemoglobin without off-target effects has remained challenging.

More broadly, sickle cell disease treatment has seen significant advances since 2014, but primarily through other approaches. The major breakthrough came with gene therapy treatments like Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel), which received FDA approval in 2023 and represents the first CRISPR-based gene editing therapy approved in the US. Other approaches including L-glutamine (Endari), voxelotor (Oxbryta), and crizanlizumab (Adakveo) have also reached the market, but AES-103/HMF did not join them.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and assessments:

• **Structural concerns would lead to failure**: The author's skepticism about the furan, aldehyde, and hydroxymethyl groups proved largely correct—despite reaching Phase II trials, the compound did not achieve FDA approval, suggesting that the structural liabilities did indeed pose problems for drug development.

• **"Real clinical data can shut me right up"**: While the author acknowledged that clinical data could override structural concerns, in this case the eventual outcome suggests that the initial structural skepticism was warranted. The clinical data did not prove sufficient to overcome the compound's limitations.

• **Idiosyncratic toxicity in Phase III**: Though not explicitly stated as a certainty, the author's concern about idiosyncratic toxicity with such a reactive structure was a reasonable prediction given the compound type. While we don't have detailed public information about trial outcomes, the failure to achieve approval suggests safety or efficacy issues emerged.

• **The success of hemoglobin-stabilizing approach**: The underlying therapeutic strategy—stabilizing hemoglobin to prevent polymerization—has found some success in other contexts. Voxelotor (Oxbryta), approved in 2019, works by a similar mechanism of increasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and reducing sickling. So while AES-103 failed, the mechanistic approach it represented showed promise and eventually succeeded with different chemical matter.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article demonstrates reasonable scientific skepticism about drug development, and its central concerns proved largely justified in hindsight. The case illustrates important principles about drug design challenges and the complexity of predicting clinical success from chemical structure alone, while also showing how mechanistic concepts can eventually succeed even when early candidates fail.
