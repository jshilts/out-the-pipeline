# Right In Front of You (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary reflects on how many scientific discoveries seem obvious in hindsight. The author notes a common experience where new findings trigger reactions like "I could have thought of that myself" or "Surely this was already discovered." The piece quotes a British literary/political figure who learned at Cambridge "not to be afraid of the obvious."

The article argues that people often filter out potentially valuable ideas because they assume anything genuinely good would have already been done. As a New Year's resolution, the author encourages readers to resist the internal voice that dismisses novel ideas simply because they seem too straightforward or obvious to have been overlooked.

## 2. HISTORY

This is a philosophical commentary rather than a scientific research article about biotechnology. It contains no specific biotech claims, methods, drugs, companies, or policy proposals to track. There are no concrete biotechnology developments to analyze following its publication.

The piece functions as general career/life advice for researchers and innovators, emphasizing psychological barriers rather than technical content. Since it lacks specific biotech substance, no follow-up developments in drug approval, clinical trials, scientific methods, or business outcomes are relevant or applicable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contains no predictions about biotechnology. It is purely reflective commentary about innovation psychology and contains no forward-looking statements about scientific developments, drug pipelines, regulatory changes, or industry trends.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article is off-topic for biotechnology analysis - it's a general motivational blog post about overcoming psychological barriers to innovation, with no scientific claims or biotech content to evaluate.
