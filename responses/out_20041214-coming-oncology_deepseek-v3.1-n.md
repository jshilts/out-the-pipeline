# The Coming Oncology (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the evolving oncology drug market in the mid-2000s, focusing on the tension between broad-market "blockbuster" drugs and a more targeted, biomarker-driven approach. The author argues that cancer treatment was shifting toward personalized medicine, where clinical trials would increasingly use specific biomarkers to select patients most likely to respond, leading to narrower but more reliable approvals. The post anticipates that the "everyone-prescribes-for-everything" model in oncology would break down over time, perhaps within 20 years, forcing drug companies to adapt. Key predictions included a future where patient and tumor sequencing would guide first-line therapy selection, with sequential switches to second- and third-line agents as resistance emerged—similar to anti-infective treatment paradigms, though with tumor-specific rather than transmissible resistance. The business implication was that larger companies could manage the risk by holding portfolios of cancer drugs, while smaller firms might need to target niche markets or become in-licensing partners.

## 2. HISTORY

The two decades following 2004 broadly validated the article's core trajectory. Oncology moved decisively toward biomarker-stratified development and regulatory approvals, with many targeted therapies achieving accelerated approval and high clinical success rates in defined populations.

- **Imatinib (Gleevec) and BCR-ABL in CML** set an early precedent for targeted therapy and high response rates in molecularly defined disease.  
- **EGFR inhibitors like Iressa (gefitinib)** initially struggled in unselected populations but gained approval and adoption in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, aligning with the author's specific example.  
- **HER2** became a standard biomarker in breast cancer, anchoring trastuzumab (Herceptin) and related therapies.  
- **PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors** entered the clinic around 2014–2015; although initially tested broadly, they demonstrated differential benefit, and subsequent approvals often included biomarker-defined subgroups (e.g., PD-L1 expression and later microsatellite instability/dMMR).  
- **Next-generation sequencing (NGS) tumor profiling** became widespread in clinical practice, enabling assignment of first-line therapies based on actionable alterations (e.g., ALK, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK, RET).  
- **Companion diagnostics** became routine in oncology regulatory submissions and treatment selection.  
- The "large pharma portfolio" strategy proved robust, with companies acquiring or co-developing targeted agents across multiple pathways; smaller biotechs frequently targeted narrower indications and were later acquired or in-licensed by larger players.  
- Resistance mechanisms were rapidly characterized (e.g., EGFR T790M led to osimertinib; ALK resistance mutations prompted next-generation inhibitors), reinforcing the sequential-therapy model the article outlined.

By the early 2020s, biomarker-guided cancer care was standard in many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, validating the central themes of the 2004 post.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several explicit and implicit predictions; many fared well, with nuances in timing and scope:

- **Prediction: Narrow biomarker-driven trials would trade larger market size for higher clinical/regulatory success rates.**  
  - **Outcome:** Largely accurate. Accelerated approval pathways increasingly relied on biomarker enrichment, and many targeted agents achieved high response rates and faster approvals in defined groups (e.g., EGFR, ALK, NTRK, RET). However, broader opportunities also grew—notably checkpoint inhibitors in multiple tumor types, though they often benefited from later biomarker refinement.

- **Prediction: The "everyone-prescribes-for-everything" oncology model would break down over time, possibly within 20 years.**  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. By the mid-2010s and decisively by the early 2020s, first-line oncology guidelines incorporated mandatory profiling for many cancers, and label indications frequently specified biomarker-defined subgroups.

- **Prediction: Sequencing patient and tumor samples would suggest first-line therapy, followed by sequential switches as resistance emerges (analogous to anti-infectives).**  
  - **Outcome:** Became standard practice. NGS panels are now routine in many malignancies, and decision trees account for first-line targets and later-line options upon progression or resistance (e.g., osimertinib after first-generation EGFR inhibitors).

- **Prediction: Resistant tumor lineages would drive ongoing demand for new compounds.**  
  - **Outcome:** Correct; resistance drove continuous innovation. Newer inhibitors addressed acquired resistance mutations, and combination strategies extended progression-free survival, spurring a steady pipeline of next-in-class agents.

- **Prediction: Large companies would fare better by holding portfolios of cancer drugs, spreading risk; smaller companies would target narrower markets or be in-licensed.**  
  - **Outcome:** Generally true. Many large pharmas assembled oncology portfolios through acquisitions and partnerships. Small biotechs secured approvals for niche targets (e.g., rare kinase fusions) and were often acquired or licensed. Exceptions include some stock surges in oncology biotech, but sustained value typically depended on demonstrating differentiated biomarker-driven outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**  
This essay identified several foundational shifts that reshaped oncology development and care over the next two decades. It correctly anticipated the rise of biomarker-driven trials, the erosion of broad-market prescribing, the sequential-therapy paradigm, and the business implications for large vs. small companies. While some timelines and the precise role of immunotherapy were less certain, the core insights proved highly prescient and influential.
