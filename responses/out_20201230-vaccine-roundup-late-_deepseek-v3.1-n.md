# Vaccine Roundup, Late December (December 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article provides a comprehensive survey of the COVID-19 vaccine landscape as of late December 2020. The author covers major vaccine candidates that were either in advanced human trials or already being rolled out under Emergency Use Authorization. Key topics include: the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines already under EUA in the US with ongoing but slow rollout; the Oxford/AstraZeneca adenovirus vector vaccine facing controversy over trial data and dosing strategies; emerging variants (particularly in the UK and South Africa) driving accelerated vaccination efforts; and promising candidates from J&J, Novavax, and various Chinese and Russian manufacturers (CanSino, Gamaleya/Sputnik V, Sinovac, SinoPharm). The central tension highlighted is the race between vaccine deployment and viral evolution, with vaccine makers facing scrutiny over data transparency and dosing strategies.

## 2. HISTORY

**Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines:** Both vaccines maintained their high efficacy through widespread global deployment in 2021. They became the dominant platforms globally with billions of doses administered. However, the rollout did face delays initially (the article correctly noted the 20 million vaccinated by year-end 2020 was "totally out of reach"), and subsequent challenges emerged with waning immunity requiring booster doses by mid-to-late 2021, and the emergence of variants requiring updated formulations.

**Oxford/AstraZeneca:** The vaccine was eventually authorized in many countries beyond the UK but faced numerous setbacks. Several countries suspended or limited its use in 2021 due to rare blood clot side effects (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). Manufacturing issues and supply delays plagued the program, particularly affecting deliveries to Europe and developing countries. Despite lower efficacy compared to mRNA vaccines, it remained important for global access due to easier storage requirements.

**AstraZeneca's credibility issues:** The company indeed "came out of this pandemic looking worse" as predicted, facing criticism over trial transparency, efficacy claims, and contractual disputes with governments.

**Single-dose strategy:** The UK's gamble on delayed second doses became widespread practice, and subsequent research generally supported that a single dose provided meaningful (though reduced) protection, while delaying the second dose (even longer than originally planned) did not substantially compromise long-term immunity.

**J&J vaccine:** Received EUA as a single-dose vaccine but faced similar rare blood clot concerns as AstraZeneca, leading to temporary pauses and updated warnings. Production issues also limited its deployment. The single-dose advantage was real, but low uptake in wealthy countries meant it had limited market share.

**Novavax:** The protein subunit vaccine faced extensive delays due to manufacturing challenges and quality control issues. It eventually received authorizations in 2022 in many countries but missed the critical period of 2021 when it could have had maximum market impact.

**Chinese vaccines (Sinovac, SinoPharm):** Received WHO Emergency Use Listing and widespread use globally (particularly through COVAX and BRI countries) but faced skepticism due to limited data transparency throughout 2021. Real-world effectiveness studies showed lower protection compared to mRNA vaccines, especially against variants, and they required boosters.

**Russian Sputnik V:** Remained controversial due to limited data sharing and transparency. Never achieved WHO authorization and had limited global uptake despite early deployment in some countries.

**Viral variants:** The emergence of variants (especially Alpha identified in the UK in late 2020, and eventually Delta and Omicron) drove booster campaigns and ultimately necessitated updated bivalent vaccines by late 2022.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Better than nothing" assessment of Oxford/AstraZeneca:** ✓ *Accurate.* The vaccine was indeed "better than nothing" but faced significant real-world challenges including rare side effects, manufacturing issues, and ultimately lower market share in wealthy countries compared to mRNA vaccines.

• **"No studies have been designed to find [single-dose efficacy] out" and uncertainty about waning immunity:** ✓ *Accurate.* Single-dose efficacy remained uncertain, and waning immunity did become a significant issue requiring boosters about 6-12 months after initial vaccination campaigns.

• **"Giving as many people in the UK as possible a single dose... is a gamble":** ✓ *Mostly accurate.* The strategy worked reasonably well for reducing severe disease and deaths, though breakthrough infections remained problematic until boosters were deployed.

• **"J&J data should be coming very soon indeed":** ✓ *Accurate.* J&J reported Phase 3 data in January 2021 and received EUA shortly after.

• **Novavax assessment:** ⚠️ *Correct about interest and potential, but the timing prediction was off.* The author expected data "after J&J reports," but manufacturing challenges delayed Novavax by over a year beyond initial expectations.

• **Concern about Chinese vaccine data transparency:** ✓ *Accurate.* Sinovac and SinoPharm continued to face criticism for limited data transparency throughout 2021 and 2022.

• **AstraZeneca collaboration with GRI assessment:** ✓ *Mostly accurate.* The collaboration proceeded but had minimal practical impact on the pandemic response due to timing and the controversies surrounding both vaccines.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captured a critical moment in pandemic history when vaccine deployment was beginning but facing immense logistical and scientific uncertainties. The examination of dosing strategies, variant emergence, and data transparency issues proved highly relevant to subsequent events, making this more than just a snapshot but a meaningful analysis of the challenges ahead. The skepticism about claims being made and the emphasis on uncertainty aged well, even if some specific predictions about timing were off.
