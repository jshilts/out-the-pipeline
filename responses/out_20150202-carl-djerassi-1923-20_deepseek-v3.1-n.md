# Carl Djerassi, 1923–2015 (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This obituary commemorates chemist Carl Djerassi, who had recently died at 91. It emphasizes his central role—along with John Rock, Gregory Pincus, Margaret Sanger, and Katharine McCormick—in the development of the first oral contraceptive pill. The piece notes that Djerassi was an accomplished chemist whose work on “The Pill” shifted his focus toward understanding the social impact of science, later leading to a second career as an author and dramatist. The article also questions why Djerassi never won the Nobel Prize, placing him among other notable scientists such as Gilbert Lewis and Mendeleev who were similarly overlooked. It concludes by recommending several histories and Djerassi’s own reflections for further reading.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years after this 2015 obituary, recognition of Djerassi’s contributions has persisted in both scientific and public discourse. Biographies, documentaries, and institutional retrospectives continue to cite him as a pivotal figure in the contraceptive revolution and in steroid chemistry. His literary and theatrical works exploring the social and ethical dimensions of science remain discussed within science-communication and history-of-science circles, but they have not entered the mainstream canon. The Nobel Prize question remains unresolved and is still debated; a 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for directed evolution (to Frances Arnold) revived discussions about prize eligibility windows and the Nobel Committee’s selectivity. New histories and museum exhibitions touching on contraception, women’s health, and pharmaceutical innovation often foreground Djerassi’s chemistry as a foundational enabler. On the policy and clinical front, oral contraceptives have become one of the most widely used forms of birth control globally. Subsequently developed alternatives include long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like IUDs and implants, and, more recently, apps and digital fertility-awareness tools. Emergency contraception has also become more accessible in many countries, with levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate moving to over-the-counter status in numerous jurisdictions. Research continues on non-hormonal and male contraceptive candidates; while no male oral contraceptive has yet reached the market, several candidates have advanced in clinical trials without yet achieving regulatory approval and broad uptake. Neither a new male contraceptive nor any novel non-hormonal option has, to date, achieved the disruptive impact of the original oral contraceptive pill.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This obituary did not make explicit forward-looking predictions. It offered the author’s opinion about the likely long-term standing of Djerassi’s scientific versus literary work:
- **Chemistry legacy**: The author asserted that Djerassi’s chemistry is a secure part of chemical history. This remains empirically true; Djerassi’s contributions to steroid chemistry and the first oral contraceptive are consistently acknowledged in textbooks, histories, and institutional retrospectives.
- **Literary legacy**: The author stated that Djerassi’s fiction was unlikely to long survive him. This assessment has largely held; his literary and dramatic works are still referenced in specialized circles of science communication, but they have not become broadly celebrated or commercially prominent in the general literary market.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **1/10**
The post is a straightforward obituary and retrospective, not an analysis of emerging biotechnology trends or their subsequent trajectories, which limits its relevance to a “biotechnology industry” commentary focus. It is historically informative but not forward-looking.
