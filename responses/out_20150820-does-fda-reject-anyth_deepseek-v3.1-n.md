# Does the FDA Reject Anything Any More? (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes a 2015 Forbes article by Matthew Herper which presented data showing a dramatic shift in FDA approval rates for new drugs. The key finding was that FDA rejection rates for new molecular entities had plummeted from 66% in 2008 to only 11% in 2015 (89% approval rate), with the rate reaching 96% when excluding new uses for existing drugs. The article examines possible explanations for this trend, including pharmaceutical companies improving their trial designs to meet FDA requirements, potential FDA easing of standards, or increased post-approval study requirements. It also explores whether this represents genuine therapeutic innovation or approval of marginal drugs, using a baseball analogy about "close games" to suggest that early drugs in new therapeutic areas may naturally be less effective than later improvements.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 article, the trend toward higher FDA approval rates continued through the late 2010s and early 2020s. The period saw several significant developments relevant to the article's concerns:

**Continued High Approval Rates**: FDA approval rates remained elevated compared to historical norms. In 2016-2020, CDER annual approval rates for NMEs (new molecular entities) ranged from the 70s to high 80s percent, though with some year-to-year variation. Much discussion focused on whether this represented genuine progress or regulatory capture.

**Drug Pricing and Access Crisis**: High drug prices became a major public policy issue, with scrutiny on whether the FDA was too permissive in approving drugs with marginal benefits that command high prices. Particularly relevant were approvals of Alzheimer's drugs like aducanumab (Aduhelm), which highlighted concerns about efficacy standards.

**Drug Withdrawals and Safety Issues**: Some post-2015 approvals faced challenges. Drugs like eteplirsen and other rare disease therapies faced questions about efficacy, echoing the article's concern about "echo effects" from problematic approvals. However, catastrophic safety withdrawals remained relatively rare, suggesting neither the direst warnings nor the most optimistic interpretations were fully realized.

**Regulatory Changes**: Key developments included expanded use of accelerated approvals, orphan drug designations, and breakthrough therapy designations, which likely contributed to higher approval rates. These pathways trade faster approval for post-marketing requirements, consistent with the article's speculation about increased post-approval studies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and speculations:

• **Prediction**: "We should see an echo effect over the next few years as problematic approvals run into trouble."
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. While some approvals faced controversy (like aducanumab), widespread drug withdrawals did not materialize as dramatically as this prediction suggested. The FDA's risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) and post-marketing requirements appeared to manage many issues before they reached withdrawal stage.

• **Prediction**: More marginal drugs getting through could indicate innovation in new therapeutic areas.
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated. The subsequent years saw genuine breakthroughs (CAR-T therapies, gene therapies) alongside marginal drugs. The article's "baseball analogy" proved insightful - many new therapeutic areas did see iterative improvements over initial drugs, consistent with the "toehold" theory.

• **Implicit concern**: FDA might be easing standards.
  - **Outcome**: Unclear. The FDA maintained that standards remained rigorous, pointing to mechanisms like accelerated approval with post-marketing requirements as balancing speed and safety. However, contentious approvals like aducanumab and criticisms from some clinicians suggested persistent concerns about efficacy standards.

• **Implicit prediction**: Industry getting better at trial design would explain higher approvals.
  - **Outcome**: Likely true. The pharmaceutical industry did improve its ability to work with FDA through increased use of patient-focused drug development, biomarkers, and adaptive trial designs, supported by regulatory guidance.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article was prescient in identifying a major regulatory trend and correctly anticipating complex downstream effects beyond simple "good versus bad" interpretations. Its nuanced analysis, particularly the "baseball analogy," provided a sophisticated framework that proved relevant for understanding subsequent developments in drug development and approval patterns.
