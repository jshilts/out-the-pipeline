# Amazing Deals Just For You. And You. You, Too. (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article exposes the predatory and fraudulent practices of the dietary supplement industry, particularly through what came to be known as "native advertising" scams. The author describes how fake news articles impersonated legitimate media outlets like Forbes, Bloomberg, and USA Today to promote questionable brain supplements. These fake ads used fabricated endorsements from billionaires and celebrities who had never heard of the products, along with falsified clinical trial data supposedly from universities that likewise denied any involvement.

The article highlights the layers of deception used to obscure accountability: affiliate marketers who could disclaim responsibility, phantom companies, and shadowy operators who were impossible to track down. The author draws a literary parallel from Martin Amis's novel "London Fields," comparing the supplement industry's ecosystem of fraud to a world where "everyone cheated," with each layer of deception compounding the next in a cascade of dishonesty.

## 2. HISTORY

The dietary supplement industry's fraudulent marketing practices that this article exposed in 2015 became much more widely recognized and addressed in subsequent years:

**Regulatory Actions:**
The FTC and FDA significantly ramped up enforcement actions against companies like the one described in the article. These agencies began targeting not just the supplement manufacturers but also the affiliate marketing networks and the technology platforms that hosted these fraudulent ads. This coincided with broader crackdowns on fake news that intensified after the 2016 election.

**Industry Changes:**
Major platforms including Google, Facebook, and Amazon began implementing stricter policies for supplement advertising and sales. By 2018-2019, these platforms required more rigorous verification, scientific evidence, and compliance documentation before allowing supplement companies to run ads or sell products. This forced many of the snake-oil operators either out of business or into more regulated pathways.

**Legal Precedents:**
The specific type of fraud described - fake endorsements and counterfeit media credentials - became a regular target for class-action lawsuits. Courts increasingly sided with consumers and legitimate media organizations whose brands had been impersonated, establishing clearer legal frameworks for holding both manufacturers and marketers liable for deceptive practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made an implicit prediction that the dietary supplement industry's fraudulent practices would continue in this manner, with deception operating at every level. The prediction compared the situation to Martin Amis's fiction where "everyone cheated" and layers of deception simply compounded.

This prediction proved accurate but underestimated the eventual regulatory and market responses. The fraud did continue as predicted, but faced greater scrutiny and enforcement starting around 2016-2018. The author was correct about the persistence of these fraudulent tactics, particularly the use of:
- Fake celebrity endorsements 
- Counterfeit clinical trial data
- Impersonation of legitimate media outlets
- Disappearing affiliate marketers who served as cutouts

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important but well-trodden issue in the supplement industry. While the specific exposé of fraud mechanics was valuable and the literary framing added interest, the central theme of supplement industry fraud was already widely understood by 2015. The piece contributed to ongoing coverage but didn't break new conceptual ground about supplement regulation or biotechnology.
