# More on Prices, High and Otherwise (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article addresses the pharmaceutical industry's practice of funding drug research through high drug prices, specifically responding to questions about the fairness of this model. The author argues that drug research should indeed be funded through high prices because pharmaceutical research involves substantial sunk costs that cannot be recovered—unlike traditional investments where money can be recouped. The author explains that every drug is a "wasting asset" due to patent expiration, with patents often consuming more than half their lifetime during the research and approval process before the drug even reaches market.

The article then addresses the fairness of raising prices on individual drugs, using Abbott's price hike on Norvir (an HIV drug) as a case study. The author argues that companies exercise "pricing power" where they can, similar to how supermarkets don't maintain uniform profit margins across all products. The piece acknowledges the counterbalancing forces of Medicare, HMOs, and other bulk purchasers in the US, as well as government price-setting in other countries, while defending patent protection as temporary market advantage that eventually expires.

## 2. HISTORY

The core issues raised in this 2004 article have remained highly relevant and evolved significantly over the subsequent two decades:

**Drug Pricing and Norvir**: Abbott's Norvir pricing strategy became even more controversial in later years. The company faced multiple lawsuits and investigations over alleged anti-competitive pricing practices related to Norvir. This case became emblematic of broader concerns about pharmaceutical pricing strategies.

**Patent Cliff and Generic Competition**: The phenomenon the author described—drugs losing patent protection—accelerated dramatically after 2004. Major drugs like Lipitor (2011), Plavix (2012), and many others faced "patent cliffs," leading to massive revenue losses for companies but significant cost savings for consumers through generics.

**Policy Responses**: The debate over drug pricing led to concrete policy changes. The Affordable Care Act (2010) included provisions affecting pharmaceutical pricing. More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) gave Medicare limited authority to negotiate drug prices for the first time, directly addressing concerns raised in this article.

**Industry Evolution**: The pharmaceutical industry's business model evolved toward even higher-priced specialty drugs, particularly biologics and orphan drugs, with some treatments costing hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. This intensified the pricing debates the article discussed.

**Public and Political Pressure**: The concerns about drug pricing voiced in 2004 grew into major political issues, with drug price transparency laws, importation debates, and continued calls for reform. The Norvir case specifically influenced later discussions about anti-competitive practices in pharmaceutical pricing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit predictions but rather described ongoing trends. However, the underlying assumptions and trends can be evaluated:

• **Pricing Power Continuity**: The author noted drug companies' "pricing power" during patent protection. This has remained largely true, though increasingly constrained by payer negotiations, formulary restrictions, and growing political pressure.

• **Patent Protection Dynamics**: The tension between patent life and research/approval time has persisted. Companies continued strategies like "evergreening" (making minor modifications to extend patent life), though regulatory scrutiny of these practices increased.

• **Market Mechanism Breakdown**: The author's observation about government price-setting "breaking down" market mechanisms outside the US has evolved. Many countries maintained or strengthened price controls, while the US moved incrementally toward more government involvement in pricing through Medicare negotiation provisions.

• **Cost Recovery Model**: The fundamental model of funding research through high drug prices has remained dominant, though alternatives like government-funded research, non-profit drug development, and different incentive models have gained discussion.

• **Competitive Dynamics**: The concern about using pricing to disadvantage competition (mentioned regarding Norvir) has remained relevant, with continued scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies' pricing and formulary strategies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an important early-2000s perspective on pharmaceutical economics that presciently identified tensions that would dominate healthcare policy debates for the next two decades. Its balanced treatment of both industry and consumer perspectives, combined with its clear explanation of patent economics and market forces, makes it a valuable historical artifact for understanding contemporary drug pricing debates.
