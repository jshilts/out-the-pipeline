# Herbal Disclosure (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reports on GNC's agreement with the New York State Attorney General's office following investigations into herbal supplement quality. The AG's office had found widespread mislabeling and contamination in herbal products. Under the settlement, GNC committed to implementing DNA barcoding to verify that supplements contain the labeled plant material. Additionally, the company would clearly distinguish between actual plant matter and chemical extracts in its products, explicitly informing customers that extracts involve solvent-based processing.

The piece notes that this addresses a key industry defense—that DNA testing might not detect plant material in heavily processed extracts. The author speculates that other retailers like Target, Wal-Mart, and Walgreens, who faced similar scrutiny, might follow with comparable agreements.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2015 NYAG investigation was a watershed moment for the dietary supplement industry. DNA barcoding revealed widespread problems: **83% of tested products showed substitution, contamination, or contained none of the labeled ingredients**. Following GNC's agreement, other major retailers did implement similar testing protocols.

This led to concrete regulatory and industry changes:

- **FDA increased enforcement** under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), conducting more facility inspections and developing new testing methods
- **Industry self-regulation strengthened** with many companies adopting DNA barcoding voluntarily to restore consumer trust
- **Retailer consolidation** - major chains began requiring more rigorous supplier verification
- **Consumer awareness increased** dramatically about supplement quality issues

However, the fundamental regulatory framework (DSHEA) remained largely unchanged, with supplements still not requiring FDA pre-approval. While GNC's DNA barcoding commitment represented progress, subsequent studies in 2016-2018 still found significant contamination and mislabeling issues industry-wide, suggesting the problem wasn't fully solved.

The extract distinction GNC agreed to make proved prescient - DNA barcoding limitations became clearer as heavily processed extracts might not contain detectable plant DNA.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **That other retailers would reach similar deals**: ✓ **Correct**. Target, Walgreens, and others did implement enhanced testing protocols, though specific agreements varied.

- **Other supplement brands might see marketing opportunities if GNC emphasizes chemical extraction**: **Unclear outcome**. While some companies did adopt "clean label" marketing emphasizing minimal processing, this didn't fundamentally reshape the supplement industry's marketing approach.

- **DNA barcoding would address supplement quality issues**: ⚠ **Partially correct, but limited**. While DNA barcoding improved detection, studies showed it couldn't catch all adulteration - especially in chemically processed extracts or products with synthetic additives. The technique revealed the complexity of quality assurance.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured an important regulatory turning point that exposed widespread quality issues and forced industry accountability measures. However, it represents a regulatory skirmish rather than fundamental structural change in supplement oversight.
