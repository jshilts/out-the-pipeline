# Electromagnetic Production of Stem Cells? Really?

## 1. SUMMARY

This October 2014 commentary discusses an unusual research paper published in ACS Nano claiming that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) at 50 Hz, 1 mT could reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells. The paper reported that EMF exposure, particularly when combined with only the Oct4 Yamanaka factor, could replace the other three factors (Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) typically required for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation. The authors suggested this effect was mediated through the histone methyltransferase MII2 enzyme and that cells undergoing epigenetic changes were uniquely susceptible. The original research also made the peculiar claim that cancellation of Earth's natural magnetic field reduced reprogramming efficiency. The commentary author expressed significant skepticism, noting the venue (ACS Nano) seemed mismatched for stem cell biology, the mechanism appeared mechanistically implausible given weak field energies, and flagged emerging concerns about image problems on PubPeer. The author questioned why such potentially groundbreaking findings weren't generating more attention from the stem cell research community.

## 2. HISTORY

The research area described in this article suffered a complete scientific collapse. Subsequent to the 2014 commentary and original publication, multiple research groups attempted to reproduce the reported electromagnetic field-mediated reprogramming effects without success. The field of low-frequency EMF effects on stem cell reprogramming failed to gain traction or produce reproducible results in the broader scientific community.

The original 2014 ACS Nano paper became embroiled in controversy when PubPeer discussions revealed significant image integrity concerns and potential data manipulation issues. This led to increased scrutiny of the research group's work and methodology. No subsequent high-quality, independently replicated studies have demonstrated that extremely low frequency EMF can replace Yamanaka factors for iPSC generation.

Instead, the iPSC field progressed in entirely different directions between 2014-2024. The standard approach using the four Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) or modified combinations became well-established and optimized. Research focused on improving efficiency through small molecule cocktails, RNA-based approaches, and refined culture conditions. Critical advances included the development of integration-free methods using Sendai virus vectors, episomal plasmids, and mRNA-based reprogramming.

Several iPSC-based therapies advanced through clinical trials during this period. Notable examples include Parkinson's disease treatments using dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs (initiated by groups in Japan), age-related macular degeneration therapies, and various cardiovascular applications. However, none of these successful applications utilized electromagnetic field approaches - they all relied on established molecular reprogramming methods.

The biotechnology industry's investment patterns reflect this outcome. Major stem cell companies (including Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics, Cynata Therapeutics, and academic spinouts) focused resources on improving conventional reprogramming techniques and manufacturing scale-up rather than pursuing electromagnetic approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions that can be evaluated against subsequent developments:

• **EMF as a replacement for Yamanaka factors**: The original paper claimed that low-frequency EMF could replace three of the four reprogramming factors (keeping only Oct4). This prediction completely failed - no validated reprogramming protocols or approved therapies utilize this approach. Standard methods still require the core transcription factor combination or chemical equivalents.

• **Non-invasive cell reprogramming for regenerative medicine**: The authors suggested EMF exposure could provide efficient, noninvasive reprogramming strategies. While the field achieved noninvasive methods, they involved RNA-based or small molecule approaches rather than electromagnetic fields. The EMF pathway led nowhere clinically.

• **MII2 enzyme as a master epigenetic regulator for stem cell generation**: The proposed mechanism involving histone methyltransferase MII2 did not emerge as a central player in mainstream iPSC research. While epigenetic modifications remain crucial to understanding pluripotency, MII2 did not become the validated target or mechanistic explanation the authors suggested.

• **Novel method for efficient iPSC generation**: The commentary author's skepticism about whether this represented a genuine breakthrough proved correct. The "novel method" never materialized into practical applications or widely adopted protocols.

The broader prediction implicit in the article's skepticism was that this research might follow the pattern of other controversial biological EMF claims - ultimately failing to demonstrate reproducible effects. This assessment proved accurate, as the field failed to generate sustained research interest or clinical applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This commentary touches on important issues in scientific validity and reproducibility, but the underlying research area never developed into something of lasting significance. While it serves as a useful case study in evaluating extraordinary claims, it doesn't represent a pivotal moment or substantive advance in stem cell biology or regenerative medicine.
