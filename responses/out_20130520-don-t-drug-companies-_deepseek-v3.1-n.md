# Don't They Spend More on Marketing? (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article addresses a widespread criticism leveled at pharmaceutical companies: that they spend substantially more on marketing and sales (SG&A) than on research and development (R&D). The author dissects this claim by examining publicly available financial data for major pharma and biotech firms (Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Biogen, Vertex, Celgene), presenting SG&A and R&D as a percentage of revenue for 2012.

The central argument is that these companies do spend more on SG&A than on R&D, but this is a common and necessary business practice for research-driven industries. The article contrasts these figures with those of highly regarded technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, IBM, GE, HP), showing that the tech sector’s SG&A spending is often a much larger multiple of its R&D spending. The piece concludes that the high SG&A-to-R&D ratio is not a sign of misplaced priorities or a "lie" about their research focus, but a financial reality required to market complex products in a competitive global market.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, the public debate and underlying financial realities of pharmaceutical spending have continued to evolve, becoming more transparent and remaining a central issue in healthcare policy.

1.  **Drug Pricing Scrutiny:** In the years since 2013, public and political scrutiny of drug pricing in the U.S. has intensified dramatically. The high cost of medications like Sovaldi (Harvoni) and specialty drugs has kept the question of "what are we paying for?" at the forefront. This has led to proposals for government price negotiation, which became law for a limited set of drugs through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

2.  **Increased Transparency on Marketing:** There has been a push for greater transparency in how pharmaceutical companies spend their money, though not always specifically breaking out SG&A. Laws like the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, part of the Affordable Care Act, required drug and device companies to publicly report payments made to physicians. This provides a small window into a component of marketing and promotional spend, though it doesn't capture the full SG&A figure.

3.  **R&D vs. Marketing as a Political Talking Point:** The specific "R&D vs. Marketing" ratio cited in the article has remained a potent political and rhetorical tool. Advocacy groups, politicians, and critics of the industry frequently cite large marketing budgets as evidence that high drug prices are not solely to fund innovation. This has continued to put pressure on companies to justify their pricing structures as being tied directly to R&D costs.

4.  **Pharma Business Model Evolution:** Drug companies have continued to experiment with their sales and marketing models. This includes a shift towards more direct-to-consumer advertising (DTC) and digital marketing and a reliance on smaller, specialized sales forces for complex biologic and oncology drugs. The structure of SG&A has likely evolved, but the overall necessity of a significant budget to drive sales of complex products remains.

5.  **Trends in R&D Spending:** While R&D spending has remained high as a percentage of revenue for many large companies, there has also been a trend of outsourcing R&D and a continued focus on acquiring smaller, innovative biotechs that have already de-risked a new drug candidate. This can make direct comparisons of in-house R&D spending over time more complex.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself makes no direct, falsifiable predictions about the future. It is a commentary on the state of affairs in 2013. However, it makes a strong implicit prediction and argument:

*   **Implicit Prediction:** The author implies that critics who use the "they spend more on marketing than R&D" argument to demonize the pharma industry for not being innovative or for justifying high prices will continue to be wrong, and that this financial model is necessary for survival.
    *   **Outcome:** This has held true. The pharmaceutical industry continues to operate on a model where SG&A spends significantly exceeds R&D spend for most large, established companies. Public criticism has not abated and has arguably grown louder. However, the article's core defense—that this is a feature, not a bug, of a research-driven industry—remains the industry's position. They would argue that developing a drug is meaningless if it isn't effectively brought to market and prescribed by physicians, a process that requires a substantial sales, marketing, and administrative apparatus. The debate has not been "resolved" but has shifted to the broader, more complex issue of overall drug pricing and value.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article provides a clear, data-driven corrective to a common and overly simplistic criticism of the pharmaceutical industry. While not groundbreaking, it offers a useful and accessible framework for understanding the comparative financial structures of R&D-focused companies, which remains relevant to ongoing policy debates.
