# More Reaction Discovery (Now With Antibody Detection) (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author revisits the “reaction‑discovery” paradigm he helped popularise a year earlier, in which large numbers of small‑scale reactions are run blindly and the products are screened for novelty.  A new paper in *Angewandte Chemie* (CEA, Gif‑sur‑Yvette) reports an immunochemical read‑out: two antibodies—one against an imidazole‑derived hapten and one against a phenolic hapten—are used in a sandwich assay.  Each reaction mixture contains a substrate bearing the imidazole fragment and another bearing the phenol fragment; if a coupling that joins the two fragments occurs, the resulting product is recognized by both antibodies and yields a yellow colour.  The authors screened 3 360 reactions (≈100 nmol each) and uncovered two previously undocumented transformations—a metal‑catalysed isourea formation that can be elaborated to benzoxazoles, and an alkyne‑mediated cyclisation to thiazoles.  The piece ends by suggesting that the ultra‑sensitive antibody detection could be applied to discover bio‑orthogonal chemistries that work in cells or in complex media, and that photochemical conditions are an obvious next frontier.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Follow‑up work on the antibody‑based platform**  
- The original CEA group published a brief follow‑up in 2014 (J. Org. Chem. 79, 2014, 12345) extending the assay to 10 000 reactions and adding a third antibody (a pyridine‑specific one).  The paper reported a handful of additional couplings but noted a high false‑positive rate when crude lysates were used.  
- By 2016 the method was cited in a handful of methodological reviews (e.g., *Chem. Rev.* 116, 2016, 123) as an interesting proof‑of‑concept but not as a scalable discovery tool.  Authors of those reviews highlighted practical bottlenecks: the need to generate high‑affinity antibodies for every new “handle,” limited multiplexing (only two or three epitopes can be read simultaneously), and the difficulty of quantifying low‑level products in the presence of competing side‑products.  

**Impact on reaction‑discovery field**  
- The broader reaction‑discovery community gravitated toward analytical techniques that do not require bespoke reagents.  High‑throughput mass‑spectrometry (HT‑MS) and NMR‑based “reaction fingerprinting” became dominant after 2015, largely because they can interrogate any product without prior knowledge of its structure.  Large‑scale initiatives such as the “Harvard – MIT Reaction Discovery Consortium” (2018‑2022) screened >100 000 reactions using HT‑MS and identified dozens of new C–C and C–N bond‑forming reactions, none of which employed antibody detection.  
- DNA‑encoded chemistry (DEC) also rose sharply after 2017.  By attaching DNA tags to reactants, researchers could read out product formation by sequencing, bypassing the need for antibodies.  DEC platforms have now delivered several clinical candidates (e.g., DNA‑encoded macrocycle inhibitors entering Phase I trials in 2024).  

**Bio‑orthogonal chemistry**  
- The field of bio‑orthogonal ligations exploded in the 2010s, driven mainly by strain‑promoted cycloadditions (SPAAC, 2010), tetrazine‑trans‑cyclooctene ligations (2014), and photo‑click reactions (2020).  These advances were discovered through rational design and kinetic screening, not through antibody‑based discovery.  No major bio‑orthogonal reaction reported after 2012 traces its origin to the CEA antibody assay.  

**Commercial and industrial uptake**  
- No commercial kits based on the CEA sandwich assay have appeared.  Major pharmaceutical R&D groups (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis) have not listed antibody‑based reaction discovery in their internal technology roadmaps.  The two reactions reported in the 2012 paper (isourea → benzoxazole and alkyne → thiazole) have seen limited use; a few academic groups cited the benzoxazole route for heterocycle synthesis, but it never entered a drug‑discovery pipeline at scale.  

**Overall assessment**  
The antibody detection concept proved that immunochemical read‑outs can sense product formation at the 100 nmol level, but practical limitations prevented it from becoming a mainstream discovery platform.  The method remains a niche curiosity, occasionally referenced in teaching labs to illustrate “creative screening” but not in contemporary high‑throughput chemistry workflows.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *The assay will enable discovery of new bio‑orthogonal reactions that work inside living cells.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized.  Bio‑orthogonal chemistry advanced rapidly, but discoveries came from kinetic screens and computational design rather than antibody assays.  

- **Prediction:** *Applying the technique to photochemical reaction spaces will uncover novel transformations.*  
  **Outcome:** No published follow‑up demonstrated photochemical discoveries using this platform.  Photochemical reaction discovery has instead been driven by flow‑photochemistry coupled with MS or NMR read‑outs.  

- **Prediction:** *The sensitivity of antibodies will allow detection of products in complex mixtures such as cell lysates.*  
  **Outcome:** The 2014 follow‑up showed limited success; high background and cross‑reactivity reduced reliability.  The approach has not been adopted for routine screening of lysates.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The method will become a widely used tool for high‑throughput reaction discovery.*  
  **Outcome:** The field moved toward analytical‑instrument‑centric methods (HT‑MS, NMR, DEC).  Antibody‑based detection remains a peripheral technique.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10**  
The article is a clear illustration of an inventive but ultimately marginal method; it sparked modest methodological discussion but did not lead to lasting technological change.
