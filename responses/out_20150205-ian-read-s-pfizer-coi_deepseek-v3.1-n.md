# Ian Read's Pfizer Coin (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Telegraph report about Pfizer CEO Ian Read carrying a special coin with the slogans "Straight Talk" on one side and "Own It" on the other, which he described as part of a cultural change initiative at the pharmaceutical company. The author expresses strong skepticism about such corporate sloganeering, arguing that these "crunchy little sound bites" are ineffective at addressing the complexities of running a giant R&D operation. The piece criticizes the notion that carrying a slogan-bearing talisman or promoting catchphrases can genuinely change corporate culture, suggesting instead that leadership should focus on consistent action, performance, and transparent communication rather than cultural campaigns.

## 2. HISTORY

**Corporate Developments:**
- **Pfizer-Allergan Merger Attempt (2015-2016):** Shortly after this article, Pfizer announced a $160 billion merger with Allergan in November 2015, which would have been the largest pharmaceutical deal in history. However, the deal collapsed in April 2016 due to new US Treasury regulations designed to prevent tax inversion deals.
- **Ian Read's Leadership (2010-2018):** Read served as Pfizer CEO until December 2018, when he stepped down and became Executive Chairman, succeeded by Albert Bourla. During his tenure, he presided over several major initiatives including the failed Allergan merger.
- **Cultural Initiatives:** There is no concrete evidence that the "Straight Talk/Own It" coin initiative had measurable impact on Pfizer's culture or business outcomes.

**Business Performance:**
- Pfizer's stock price grew from approximately $30-35 in early 2015 to around $40-45 by late 2018, representing moderate growth.
- The company continued its pattern of major acquisitions and pipeline development throughout Read's tenure.
- No publicly available information suggests the coin or related cultural campaigns led to specific business improvements or failures.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's Predictions/Implications:**
- **Implicit prediction:** That leadership through action rather than slogans would be more effective
  - **Outcome:** While the coin initiative's impact is undocumented, Pfizer did continue major business activities under Read's leadership. However, there's no evidence this particular initiative succeeded or failed, as corporate culture measurement is notoriously difficult.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is primarily a commentary on corporate management practices rather than biotechnology or science, making it only moderately interesting for a biotechnology industry analysis.

## ANALYSIS

This article functions more as corporate culture commentary than biotechnology industry analysis. While it touches on pharmaceutical R&D operations, the focus is on management philosophy rather than scientific or clinical developments. The skepticism toward corporate sloganeering was reasonable, though subsequent years didn't provide clear evidence either validating or refuting this specific initiative's effectiveness. The piece reflects broader debates about corporate culture change methods that remain relevant today.
