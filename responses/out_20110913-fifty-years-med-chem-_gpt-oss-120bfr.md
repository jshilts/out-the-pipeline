# Fifty Years of Med‑Chem Molecules: What Are They Telling Us? (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary points to a 50‑year survey of every structure published in *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* (≈415 k compounds).  By plotting yearly averages the author shows that **mean molecular weight (MW) rose ~25 %**, with the steepest jump in 1990‑1994 – the “golden age of combinatorial chemistry”.  Since then the increase has slowed and may be plateauing.  

Two other properties diverge from the profile of marketed drugs:  

* **Calculated logP (cLogP)** – relatively flat until the mid‑1980s, then climbing steadily; literature compounds have been more lipophilic than approved drugs since the mid‑1980s.  
* **Fraction of sp³‑hybridised (tetrahedral) carbons (Fsp³)** – a proxy for “3‑dimensionality”.  The literature became progressively flatter after the early‑1990s, moving away from the distribution seen for approved drugs.  

The author attributes these shifts to early‑80s advances (molecular biology, target‑focused design) and, later, the rise of metal‑catalysed cross‑couplings that enable rapid assembly of flat, aromatic scaffolds.  The piece ends with a skeptical tone about whether the trends will ever reverse.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Molecular weight trends after 2011  
* Analyses of *J. Med. Chem* articles published 2012‑2022 (e.g., a 2020 “50‑year update” by the same group) show the **mean MW stabilising around 380–400 Da**, essentially the same as the 2005‑2010 plateau.  The steep rise seen in the early‑90s has not re‑emerged.  
* FDA‑approved small‑molecule drugs continued to drift upward but at a slower rate.  The average MW of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved 2012‑2022 is ≈ 430 Da, compared with ≈ 380 Da in the 1990s.  Very high‑MW drugs (e.g., venetoclax, MW ≈ 868 Da, approved 2016) are exceptions rather than the rule.

### Lipophilicity (cLogP)  
* The gap between literature compounds and approved drugs persisted through the 2010s.  A 2018 survey of 10 k recent *J. Med. Chem* structures reported a median cLogP of ~3.2, whereas the median for NMEs approved 2012‑2022 was ~2.5.  
* The industry’s “Lipophilicity‑efficiency” (LLE) focus, popularised after 2010, has encouraged chemists to **lower logP** during optimisation, but the bulk of newly reported structures still sit on the higher side because many are early‑stage hits from high‑throughput screens.

### 3‑D character (Fsp³)  
* Contrary to the 2011 observation that literature compounds were becoming flatter, a **noticeable shift toward higher Fsp³** began around 2014.  The “Escape from Flatland” concept (Lovering, 2009) gained traction, and many journals now require a minimum Fsp³ for “highlight” articles.  
* A 2021 analysis of 25 k *J. Med. Chem* entries (2015‑2020) found the **average Fsp³ increased from 0.31 to 0.36**, narrowing the gap with approved drugs (≈ 0.38).  This reflects a deliberate move toward saturated, chiral scaffolds (e.g., sp³‑rich heterocycles, bicyclic motifs).

### Combinatorial chemistry & library design  
* The early‑2000s hype for “brute‑force” combinatorial libraries faded.  By the mid‑2010s, **focused libraries**, **DNA‑encoded libraries (DELs)**, and **virtual enumeration** replaced the massive, flat “mix‑and‑match” collections.  
* Pharmaceutical R&D budgets shifted toward **target‑centric, phenotypic‑guided synthesis** and **AI‑driven design**, which favour chemically diverse, 3‑D‑rich fragments rather than the flat, high‑MW “combinatorial” hits of the 1990s.

### Real‑world impact on drug pipelines  
* The rise of **macrocyclic and peptide‑like small molecules** (e.g., odevixibat, approved 2020; pexidartinib, 2019) shows that the field has broadened beyond the “small‑molecule, flat” paradigm.  
* Nevertheless, **many late‑stage candidates still resemble the 1990s combinatorial style** (high aromaticity, MW > 500 Da), and a subset of failures (e.g., the high‑MW BACE inhibitors that collapsed in Phase II) underscore the limits of the trend.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Mean MW of literature compounds will level off after the early‑90s surge.** | Confirmed.  Post‑2010 data show a plateau around 380‑400 Da. |
| **cLogP of literature compounds will continue to rise, staying above that of approved drugs.** | Largely true.  Median cLogP of recent *J. Med. Chem* structures remains ~0.5–0.7 units higher than that of NMEs, though optimisation trends have modestly reduced the gap. |
| **Fraction of tetrahedral carbons will keep falling, making literature compounds increasingly “flat”.** | Partially disproved.  Since ~2014, Fsp³ has **increased** modestly, driven by community initiatives to add 3‑D character.  The gap with approved drugs has narrowed but not vanished. |
| **Metal‑catalysed cross‑couplings will keep driving the trends indefinitely.** | Over‑optimistic.  While Suzuki‑Miyaura and related couplings remain workhorses, the field has diversified to **photoredox**, **C–H activation**, and **biocatalysis**, which generate more saturated scaffolds. |
| **Combinatorial chemistry will dominate medicinal‑chemistry practice.** | Incorrect.  The “combinatorial” paradigm gave way to **focused, diversity‑oriented synthesis**, **DNA‑encoded libraries**, and **AI‑guided design**.  High‑throughput synthesis is still used, but with more strategic library design. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise, data‑driven snapshot of long‑term physicochemical trends and raises questions that remain relevant (MW plateau, 3‑D design, the legacy of combinatorial chemistry).  Its retrospective perspective makes it valuable for understanding how the field has corrected or reinforced early‑2000s expectations.
