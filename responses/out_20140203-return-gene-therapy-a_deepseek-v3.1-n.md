# The Return of Gene Therapy (And More) - February 2014

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the renewed excitement around gene therapy, driven by the emergence of CRISPR technology. It highlights recent progress including successful embryonic gene modification in monkeys using CRISPR/Cas9, speculating that human trials would soon follow, likely outside the US initially.

The author explores both promising and concerning applications: fixing single-gene defects versus potential genetic enhancement, with ethical questions about where to draw the line between therapy and improvement. The piece also covers the startup Editas, which raised $43 million to pursue gene editing drugs, and mentions STAP (Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency) cells that appeared to offer a revolutionary method for generating stem cells.

The article predicts that gene editing and mRNA technologies would eventually disrupt the rare disease treatment market (the "Genzyme model"), creating one-time cures rather than ongoing treatments, though acknowledges significant technical and regulatory hurdles.

## 2. HISTORY

**CRISPR Progress and Human Applications:**
- **2015**: Chinese scientists conducted the first CRISPR editing of human embryos (tripronuclear zygotes), followed by UK approval for embryo research in 2016.
- **2017**: First human clinical trial of CRISPR began in China for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
- **2019**: Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics reported the first successful CRISPR treatment for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia.
- **2020**: Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for CRISPR development.
- **2023**: FDA approved Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel) for sickle cell disease, the first CRISPR-based gene therapy approved in the US, priced at $2.2 million per treatment.

**Editas Medicine:**
- The company became publicly traded and advanced multiple programs, including EDIT-101 (CEP290-associated retinal disease) and EDIT-301 for sickle cell disease.
- EDIT-101 showed mixed results in clinical trials for Leber congenital amaurosis 10.
- EDIT-301 entered clinical trials and showed promising results for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.
- The company faced significant challenges with delivery systems and clinical trial design.

**Stem Cell Research (STAP Cells):**
- **2014**: The STAP cell papers published in Nature were retracted after other labs failed to replicate the results.
- Lead author Haruko Obokata was found guilty of research misconduct.
- Senior author Yoshiki Sasai died by suicide after the scandal.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "We're very close to seeing someone try this - probably not in the US at first, but there are plenty of other jurisdictions."
  - **Actual**: Partially accurate. First human embryo CRISPR research occurred in China (2015), followed by UK approval (2016) before widespread US adoption.

• **Prediction**: Editas would pursue "gene editing" drugs for single genetic defects with one-time treatment.
  - **Actual**: Accurate. Editas advanced EDIT-101 and EDIT-301 programs, though with mixed clinical success and significant technical and delivery challenges.

• **Prediction**: Gene editing would threaten the "Genzyme model" of rare disease treatments, creating one-time cures.
  - **Actual**: Accurate but early stage. First CRISPR therapies emerged (Casgevy 2023), with extremely high costs ($2.2M), suggesting the business model disruption is still evolving.

• **Prediction**: STAP cells represented a major breakthrough in stem cell generation.
  - **Actual**: Completely inaccurate. The STAP cell research was fraudulent and retracted within months.

• **Prediction**: Gene editing would face significant regulatory and technical hurdles.
  - **Actual**: Quite accurate. Multiple technical challenges with delivery systems, off-target effects, and complex manufacturing limited rapid progress.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article accurately identified CRISPR's transformative potential and predicted major developments in gene editing, though it was wrong about the specific breakthrough of STAP cells. It correctly foresaw the commercialization path through companies like Editas and understood both the technical challenges and the ethical implications that would indeed emerge in later years. The central thesis about gene therapy's "return" proved prescient.
