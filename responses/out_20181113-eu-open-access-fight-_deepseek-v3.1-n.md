# The EU Open Access Fight Continues (November 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses reactions to "Plan S," a European initiative to mandate open-access scientific publication. The author highlights an open letter from researchers (particularly chemists) opposing the plan's strict requirements. The main concerns center on Plan S's ban on "hybrid" journals (subscription journals that offer open-access options for individual articles), which would eliminate researchers' ability to publish in many highly-regarded society journals such as those from the American Chemical Society (ACS), Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), and ChemPubSoc Europe.

The letter raised several concrete problems: researchers in Plan S countries might lose legal access to important journals as funding agencies redirect subscription money to cover article processing charges (APCs) for Gold OA; collaboration with scientists from non-Plan S countries (US, China, Japan) would become difficult; career advancement for European researchers could be hindered if they cannot publish in prestigious venues; and researchers might still be expected to peer-review for journals they cannot access or publish in. The letter frames this as a potential violation of academic freedom and calls for a broader definition of open access that includes hybrid models and peer-reviewed preprints.

## 2. HISTORY

Plan S was officially launched in September 2018 by cOAlition S, a group of national research funding organizations led by Robert-Jan Smits from the European Commission. The plan mandated that by 2020, all scientific publications resulting from publicly funded research must be immediately open access.

**Key subsequent developments:**

- **Implementation delays and modifications**: The original January 2020 deadline was pushed back, and cOAlition S introduced more flexibility, including pathways for transformative agreements with publishers.

- **Transformative agreements**: Rather than outright banning hybrid journals, cOAlition S began accepting "transformative agreements" where institutions pay publishers to transition subscription journals to full open access over time. Hundreds of such agreements have been signed across Europe.

- **Publisher responses**: Major publishers developed various compliant publishing models. Many society publishers created new fully open-access journals alongside their traditional offerings, and some eventually transitioned successful hybrid journals to full OA.

- **Financial mechanisms**: The concern about redirecting subscription funds to APCs materialized to some extent, with many institutions reallocating library budgets, though this transition has been slower and more complex than initially envisioned.

- **US and global participation**: The US did not adopt Plan S, but individual funders like the NIH continued strengthening OA policies. Several other countries outside Europe adopted or aligned with Plan S principles.

- **Current status (2021-2024)**: As of 2024, Plan S has influenced policy worldwide and accelerated the transition to open access, though not as rapidly or uniformly as originally proposed. Approximately 78 research funders and 156 research organizations have joined cOAlition S. The European Commission's Horizon Europe program requires immediate OA for publications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions found in the article:**

• **European researchers would lose access to prestigious journals** - PARTIALLY TRUE: This did occur in some cases, particularly during transitional periods when subscription negotiations broke down (as with the RSC-Netherlands dispute mentioned), but transformative agreements have mitigated widespread access loss.

• **Collaboration and attracting talent would become difficult** - MINIMALLY REALIZED: While some friction occurred, the scientific community adapted. International collaborations continued, and European institutions generally found ways to maintain competitiveness.

• **Researchers would still be asked to peer-review for journals they couldn't access** - REALIZED BUT MINIMIZED: This issue persists but has been partially addressed through reviewer access provisions and increased preprint sharing.

• **The plan would force a choice between unpopular compliance or finding new journals** - TRUE BUT MORE NUANCED: The "your problem to solve" attitude toward publishers did emerge, but cOAlition S also adapted its requirements, creating a middle ground through transformative agreements and extended timelines.

• **The strict proposal might be deliberately provocative to stimulate discussion** - LIKELY TRUE: The final implemented policy showed significantly more flexibility than the original Plan S, suggesting the initial strict version served to push negotiations forward.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient insight into the practical challenges of implementing top-down open-access mandates and accurately identified most of the major friction points that would emerge in the following years. The analysis proved more nuanced than simple pro/con positions common at the time.
