# Welcome (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is an introductory welcome post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog as it moved to Science Translational Medicine in August 2015. Lowe identifies himself as a medicinal chemist who has worked in drug discovery since 1989, across indications including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, resistant bacteria, and viruses. He notes with candid irony that despite 26 years in the industry, he has "never once worked on any compound that has made it all the way to the market," using this to illustrate the high failure rate and difficulty of drug discovery, which helps explain prescription costs. The blog covers successes and failures in the drug industry, aiming to provide editorially independent commentary while maintaining high signal-to-noise in reader discussions.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this August 2015 introductory post, Derek Lowe has continued "In the Pipeline" as one of the most influential and widely read blogs covering pharmaceutical science and drug discovery. The blog maintained its daily posting schedule and became essential reading for medicinal chemists, pharmaceutical researchers, and industry observers. 

Lowe expanded his focus to cover topics like the opioid crisis (including litigation and policy responses), controversies around drug pricing and access, the industry's response to COVID-19, and emerging therapeutic areas such as immuno-oncology and gene therapies. He has provided extensive commentary on clinical trial failures, including numerous Alzheimer's drug trials, the approval and subsequent withdrawal of Aduhelm, and broader assessment of how accurately animal models predict human outcomes. The blog continued its unvarnished, expert critique of both scientific hype and poor research practices while celebrating genuine innovation and rigorous science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no explicit predictions about future events - it is an introduction establishing the blog's scope and purpose.

However, the piece sets an implicit framing about the nature and difficulty of drug discovery that has proven consistently accurate:
- The high failure rate in drug development has remained a fundamental characteristic of the industry
- The blog's continued relevance since 2015 demonstrates the persistent need for clear-eyed expert analysis amid complex scientific and regulatory developments
- The tension between promising early research and the harsh reality of clinical translation has remained a central theme

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**

This is essentially a blog introduction/masthead post with no specific scientific content or analysis; its interest derives only from documenting the migration of an influential blog venue.
