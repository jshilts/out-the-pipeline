# Puma Update: The Roller Coaster Heads Down (14 May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reports on Puma Biotechnology and its drug neratinib. Initial breast cancer results had looked promising, causing Puma's stock to jump tremendously. However, new clinical trial results released in May 2015 showed the survival benefit was only 2.3 months, significantly below expectations. This caused Puma's stock to drop 25% in after-hours trading. The article also mentions an email exchange between Forbes reporter Matthew Herper and the company's CEO, noting that the CEO himself lost approximately $250 million due to this news. The author suggests that while there may be "possible mitigations in the data," these are insufficient to restore the drug's previous status.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the May 2015 results, neratinib continued through the regulatory process:

**FDA Approval and Market Entry:**
- Neratinib (brand name Nerlynx) received FDA approval in July 2017 for extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer
- The approval was based on the ExteNET trial showing improvement in invasive disease-free survival
- The drug entered the market as an oral medication taken once daily

**Clinical and Commercial Reality:**
- The drug faced challenges with significant side effects, particularly severe diarrhea, which limited its real-world uptake
- While approved, neratinib did not achieve blockbuster status or widespread adoption among patients
- The drug never regained the market excitement it had before the 2015 data release
- Puma Biotechnology struggled to establish neratinib as a first-line therapy option

**Subsequent Developments:**
- The company explored additional indications and combinations, but neratinib remained a niche product
- The 2.3-month survival benefit mentioned in 2015 proved broadly indicative of the drug's modest clinical impact
- The roller coaster trajectory continued, with the drug achieving regulatory success but limited commercial success

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implied prediction of drug failure:** The article's tone suggested neratinib would not achieve its previous high expectations - **This proved partially accurate.** While the drug did receive FDA approval, it never reached the hoped-for blockbuster status and had limited patient uptake.

• **Market/sentiment prediction:** The article indicated Puma's stock decline reflected a permanent shift in perception - **This proved largely accurate.** Puma never recovered the market enthusiasm it had before May 2015.

• **Clinical impact assessment:** The 2.3-month survival benefit was presented as disappointing - **This was borne out.** The modest benefit combined with significant side effects limited the drug's real-world impact.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article captures an important moment of market correction in biotech, but the story is relatively narrow in scope—centered on one company and one drug candidate—and lacks broader scientific or policy significance.
