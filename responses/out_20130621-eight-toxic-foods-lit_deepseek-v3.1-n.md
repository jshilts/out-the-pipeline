# Eight Toxic Foods: A Little Chemical Education (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by chemist Derek Lowe provides a point-by-point scientific refutation of a BuzzFeed piece titled "Eight Foods That We Eat in The US That Are Banned in Other Countries." Lowe systematically analyzes each of the eight substances flagged as dangerous—artificial dyes, Olestra, brominated vegetable oil (BVO), potassium bromate, azodicarbonamide, BHA/BHT, synthetic growth hormones, and arsenic in chicken feed.

As context, Lowe notes BuzzFeed had removed links to authoritative sources (American Cancer Association, NPR) that contradicted their claims. His critique centers on the chemophobic misinformation that ignores fundamental toxicological principles. The article combines specific fact-checking with educational explanations about dose-response relationships, chemical distinctions between elements and compounds, and the false dichotomy between "natural" and "synthetic" substances. Lowe repeatedly demonstrates that many claims lack scientific support, conflate different chemical forms, ignore exposure levels, and misrepresent actual risks.

## 2. HISTORY

**Artificial Dyes**: Research on hyperactivity and food dyes continued after 2013, but definitive conclusions remained elusive. The FDA maintained approval for certified color additives with ongoing safety reviews. Some European countries implemented warning labels (not bans), and major companies like Kraft removed artificial dyes from certain products voluntarily to meet consumer demand rather than safety mandates. No causal link to brain cancer or nerve damage was established in humans.

**Olestra**: Already declining by 2013, Olestra essentially disappeared from the market. Procter & Gamble's fat-free potato chips using Olean (the brand name) were discontinued or reformulated. The product became a case study in consumer rejection—despite FDA approval, gastrointestinal side effects and poor taste acceptance drove market failure.

**Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO)**: Demonstrating Lowe's influence, BVO became a textbook case of internet-driven regulatory change. In 2014, petitions citing food bloggers and Lowe's analysis prompted the FDA to review BVO safety. Major beverage companies (PepsiCo, Coca-Cola) voluntarily removed BVO from products by 2020, replacing it with alternatives. In 2023, California banned BVO in food products, and the FDA proposed revoking its approval in November 2023. Lowe's point that BVO required massive daily consumption (liters per day) to cause harm was validated by the absence of documented health problems in the general population.

**Potassium Bromate**: This flour additive remained approved in the U.S. but fell out of favor with commercial bakers. By 2024, many major bread producers and restaurant chains eliminated bromated flour voluntarily. The EU ban remained in place, while California required warning labels under Proposition 65. Lowe's dose calculations held up—no human health problems were documented from consumption of properly baked bread.

**Azodicarbonamide**: This became another viral target, especially after 2014 when petitions highlighted its use in plastics. Subway notably removed it from bread in response to public pressure. However, the FDA maintained its approval up to 45 ppm. Lowe's distinction between food and industrial uses remained scientifically valid—the compound degrades completely during baking. Asthma incidents were limited to workers handling industrial quantities.

**BHA and BHT**: These antioxidants remained FDA-approved and widely used in food preservation. Cancer studies in rodents using high doses did not translate to human risk at dietary exposure levels. Lowe's critique of chemophobia was validated—the EU continued approving BHT, and epidemiological studies showed no increased cancer rates from exposure.

**Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH)**: This issue evolved into a marketing rather than health concern. Consumer demand for rBGH-free milk grew substantially after 2013, with major retailers (Walmart, Kroger, Starbucks) committing to rBGH-free dairy. However, scientific consensus remained unchanged: rBGH poses no risk to human health. The actual hormonal activity difference in milk was negligible, and human IGF-1 levels were unaffected by milk consumption. Labeling became state-regulated, with Ohio and Kansas allowing "rBGH-free" claims only with disclaimers about no significant nutritional difference.

**Arsenic (Roxarsone)**: Lowe discussed roxarsone's 2011 voluntary market withdrawal, which was nearly complete by 2013. The FDA officially withdrew approval in 2015. No roxarsone products remained on the market. Comparisons to arsenic in rice (naturally occurring) became a public issue when Consumer Reports published studies in 2012 and 2014 about rice products. The FDA established 100 ppb as a non-binding "action level" for rice cereal for infants, significantly less than the previous chicken levels.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit future predictions, but Lowe's analytical approach revealed several implicit expectations:

- **That scientific evidence would continue to support dose-response principles**: **Correct**. No new evidence emerged challenging Paracelsus's fundamental principle. Regulatory actions on BVO and potassium bromate were driven by consumer pressure and the precautionary principle, not new evidence of harm at typical exposure levels.

- **That companies would eventually remove controversial ingredients due to public perception rather than safety**: **Correct**. BVO, azodicarbonamide, potassium bromate, and rBGH were largely removed from products by 2024-2027, but the removals were strategic business decisions. Scientific advisory panels did not find new safety concerns.

- **That artificial dye hyperactivity links would remain scientifically ambiguous**: **Correct**. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews in 2017 and 2020 still described the evidence as mixed, with effect sizes too small for clinical significance if they existed at all. No regulatory action was taken based on human behavior effects.

- **That chemophobia would persist**: **Correct**. The 2010s saw continued growth in "natural" product marketing and clean-label initiatives. By 2018-2020, major food companies removed various additives. However, most removals were for marketing not safety—companies reformulated to meet consumer demand while maintaining similar functionality with alternative ingredients.

- **That FDA regulatory standards based on risk assessment wouldn't significantly change**: **Correct for substances, but not for process**. The FDA maintained approval for all the discussed additives except roxarsone (already withdrawn) and BVO (proposed for withdrawal in 2023). However, the agency increasingly considered consumer perception and market realities alongside toxicological data.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article is moderately interesting as an example of expert scientific communication counteracting misinformation. Its importance lies in demonstrating how a knowledgeable insider can predict and influence the evolution of food safety controversies. The prolonged timeline of these issues—with many resolved 10+ years later—shows the value of this type of educational intervention. However, the subject matter is niche and the outcomes largely predictable.

## 5. ASSESSMENT

Lowe's analysis proved prescient across multiple dimensions. He correctly identified that many toxin claims lacked scientific merit, that dose-response would be ignored by the public, and that market forces rather than science would drive reformulation. The history shows chemophobia continued growing as he anticipated, and companies responded by removing controversial ingredients—validating his prediction that perception matters as much as risk assessment.

The article demonstrates a recurring pattern: internet-driven food fears lead to petitions and boycotts, prompting companies to reformulate for marketing reasons, which then validates the public perception of danger despite unchanged scientific evidence. Lowe's detailed explanations and dose calculations were scientifically accurate when written and remained so through 2024.

His broader thesis about misinformation outpacing education also held true. While this article and similar efforts helped educate scientifically literate readers, they had limited impact on the broader public discourse, which continued using "chemical-sounding" names as scare tactics. The regulatory outcomes validated his scientific risk assessments (no health problems emerged from these additives), but social dynamics drove changes anyway.

The arsenic/roxarsone discussion showed especially good foresight: roxarsone was already being withdrawn voluntarily, and he accurately noted that arsenic in rice posed far higher exposure than chicken ever did—a point that became widely discussed several years later.

However, Lowe underestimated the power of consumer choice as a regulatory force. Where he suggested scientific literacy should direct policy, the market instead evolved toward removing substances regardless of risk. This reflects democratized food system oversight rather than centralized scientific authority. His frustration with insufficient scientific rigor remained valid, but the solution space involved more than education—it involved business strategy.
