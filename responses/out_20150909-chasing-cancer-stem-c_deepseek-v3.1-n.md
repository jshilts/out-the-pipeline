# Chasing Cancer Stem Cells (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis as an explanation for chemotherapy resistance and cancer recurrence. The theory posits that a small subpopulation of stem-like cells drives tumor growth and regeneration, meaning that conventional chemotherapy that kills bulk tumor cells may miss these critical drivers. The piece uses Stemcentrx as a case study—a well-funded startup using an intensive approach of serial xenograft transplantation in immunodeficient mice to isolate CSC populations from patient tumors through "limiting dilution." The company was performing 150 xenografts daily to identify the rare cell types capable of regenerating tumors.

The article highlights the methodological challenges: xenograft models are necessary but notoriously poor predictors of clinical success (most drugs that work in xenografts still fail in human trials). It notes uncertainty about whether CSC-targeting drugs could even be properly evaluated in trials, since they wouldn't cause rapid tumor shrinkage. The piece also mentions competing companies pursuing similar approaches (Verastem, Oncomed) and acknowledges that the CSC field faced growing skepticism, with fundamental questions about whether these cells truly represent a distinct, targetable population or if multiple aggressive cell types exist within tumors.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this article's publication brought significant real-world developments to cancer stem cell research and the companies mentioned:

**Stemcentrx**: In April 2016, just seven months after this article, AbbVie acquired Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion upfront, with potential additional payments of up to $4 billion—one of the largest biotech acquisitions of the decade. The centerpiece was their lead drug rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rovalpituzumab tesirine), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. However, by 2018-2019, the drug failed in Phase III trials, failing to show survival benefit. The acquisition became viewed as a major setback for AbbVie and raised questions about the CSC hypothesis.

**Verastem**: The company struggled throughout 2016-2020. Their lead CSC-targeting compound, defactinib, failed multiple Phase II trials across various solid tumors. The company underwent multiple restructurings and pivoted away from CSC-focused development.

**Oncomed**: Their anti-DLL4 antibody (tarextumab) failed Phase II trials in 2016 for pancreatic cancer. By 2018, the company had discontinued most CSC-focused programs and pivoted to entirely different cancer approaches.

**Scientific Evidence**: Large-scale studies published between 2016-2021 challenged the universality of the CSC hypothesis. For solid tumors especially, evidence increasingly suggested that tumor plasticity—the ability of many (not just rare) cancer cells to acquire stem-like properties—may be more clinically relevant than a discrete CSC population. Research focus shifted toward understanding cellular plasticity and tumor heterogeneity rather than hunting rare stem cells.

**Clinical Results**: By 2020, not a single CSC-targeting drug had achieved FDA approval based on the CSC hypothesis. The field faced the reality that identifying CSCs was far more complex than initially hoped, and targeting them didn't translate into clinical benefit as predicted.

The period revealed that while some tumor types might have hierarchical organization, the CSC model was likely oversimplified, and the approach of targeting a rare subpopulation proved much harder to implement than anticipated.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions about cancer stem cell therapeutics:

* **Prediction that clinical trials would be complex and difficult to assess**
  - **Outcome**: ✓ ACCURATE. Trials for CSC-targeting drugs indeed faced challenges in demonstrating efficacy, as these drugs often didn't produce the traditional endpoints of tumor shrinkage that regulators expected.

* **Prediction that "the next few years" would be "lively ones for the CSC field"**
  - **Outcome**: ✓ ACCURATE in terms of activity. The 2016 AbbVie-Stemcentrx acquisition created major excitement, and numerous clinical programs were active through 2016-2018. However, the ultimate direction was toward disappointment rather than breakthrough.

* **Prediction that "a win in the clinic could resolve some of the controversy"**
  - **Outcome**: ⚠ PARTIALLY ACCURATE. There were no clear "wins"—no FDA approvals based on validated CSC-targeting mechanisms during 2015-2022. The failures did resolve some controversy by demonstrating that the therapeutic approach was far more challenging than hyped.

* **Implicit prediction that Stemcentrx's expensive xenograft approach would lead to breakthrough drugs**
  - **Outcome**: ✗ INACCURATE. Despite the massive investment in their platform and the $5.8B acquisition, no successful drugs emerged. The company's lead compound failed Phase III, suggesting that their methodology, while scientifically interesting, didn't translate to clinical success.

* **Implicit prediction that identifying the "ultimate culprit" cell types would lead to effective therapies**
  - **Outcome**: ✗ INACCURATE. The fundamental challenge proved not to be identifying these cells but rather whether targeting them actually provided clinical benefit. The approach didn't account for tumor plasticity and the ability of non-CSC cells to become CSC-like under selective pressure.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article was prescient in identifying both the scientific promise and practical challenges of the CSC hypothesis just before the field's peak hype cycle and subsequent reality check. It correctly anticipated that clinical development would be difficult and that fundamental questions remained unanswered, making it a valuable historical snapshot of a major biomedical research trend that consumed billions in investment before facing sober reassessment.
