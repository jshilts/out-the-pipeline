# Fluorinated Perfumes (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 blog post discusses a research paper investigating the effects of adding difluoromethyl groups to macrocyclic musk lactones, which are important fragrance compounds in the perfume industry. The research modified a known musk compound (12(R)-methyl-13-tridecanolide from Angelica root) by strategically placing fluorines at ring "corner" positions where they prefer to locate. The underlying hypothesis was that since fluorine substitution affects ring conformations, it might significantly alter or enhance fragrance properties. The article also references earlier work on fluorinated raspberry ketone for comparison.

## 2. HISTORY
The experimental results showed relatively minor changes despite the conformational alterations from fluorination. All three new fluorinated lactones retained "pleasant muskoid odour" characteristics similar to the original compound, without dramatic improvements or degradations in scent profiles. This contrasted with previous findings that methyl group substitutions produced much more significant scent variations, while fluorination of raspberry ketone had similarly limited effects as well. The research essentially demonstrated that fluorination would not "revolutionize the perfume industry."

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Primary prediction**: That fluorination was "not going to revolutionize the perfume industry" - this appears accurate based on the experimental evidence presented showing minimal scent changes and the lack of subsequent widespread fluorination adoption in commercial perfumery through current times.
• **Implicit expectation**: The research explored whether strategic fluorination could create significantly different or enhanced fragrances - the results showed only modest effects, confirming this was not a breakthrough approach.
• **Comparative prediction**: The contrast drawn with methyl substitution effects suggested fluorination would remain niche rather than transformative - consistent with industry practices remaining focused on traditional chemical modifications.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2/9**
The article represents niche academic chemistry with limited broader impact, documenting failed attempts to improve fragrances through fluorination rather than breakthrough discoveries with practical applications.
