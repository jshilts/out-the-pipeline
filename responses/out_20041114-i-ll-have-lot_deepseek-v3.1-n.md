# I'll Have the Lot (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a massive Genentech patent application (WO2004060270) filed in October 2002 that was 5,054 pages long and contained over 4,000 gene sequences. The author notes this was unusual because by 2002, patent offices had tightened requirements for gene sequence patents, demanding much more "enablement" - specific evidence of utility rather than the speculative claims common in the 1990s genomics land rush. The application's generic language ("compositions of matter useful for the diagnosis and treatment of tumor in mammals") contradicted the stricter standards that had emerged. 

The author's central hypothesis is that Genentech wasn't seriously seeking patent protection for all 4,000+ sequences, but rather was strategically publishing them as "prior art" to prevent competitors from patenting these sequences. Since journals wouldn't accept such an unfocused data dump, the patent system served as an alternative publication mechanism. Once published, these sequences would enter the public domain and become unpatentable by anyone else, while Genentech would likely abandon the application.

## 2. HISTORY

The broader context is important here: In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics*, ruling that isolated human DNA sequences were not patentable subject matter. This landmark decision fundamentally changed the gene patent landscape that the 2004 article was commenting on.

However, the practice the author described - defensive publishing through patent applications - has continued in various forms. Companies have used patent applications strategically to create prior art that blocks competitors, while often not pursuing the patents to issuance. This is particularly common in crowded technology areas where freedom-to-operate matters more than exclusive rights.

The early 2000s tightening of patent standards the author mentioned did continue, with patent offices demanding more specific utility data and reduced functional descriptions for biologics. This trend likely made the 5,000-page genomic fishing expeditions even less viable over time.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions and hypotheses:

• **Primary prediction**: Genentech would likely abandon the patent application rather than prosecute it to issuance, having achieved the goal of creating prior art. ✓ **This defensive publishing strategy was indeed a known practice, though I cannot confirm the specific case outcome.**

• **Implicit prediction**: The era of speculative gene sequence patents had ended, and the tighter enablement standards would persist. ✓ **This proved broadly correct - the *Myriad* decision in 2013 eliminated most human gene sequence patents entirely.**

• **Assumption**: The patent system would continue serving as an alternative publication venue for data that journals wouldn't accept. ✓ **This practice has continued, though the scale of 5,000-page applications remains unusual.**

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This represents an interesting historical snapshot of the genomics patent landscape at a transitional moment, with reasonable strategic analysis of corporate IP tactics. However, the Supreme Court's much more fundamental *Myriad* decision eight years later changed the landscape far more dramatically than this individual case ever could have.
