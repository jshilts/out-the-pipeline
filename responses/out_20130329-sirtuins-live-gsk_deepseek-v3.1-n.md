# Sirtuins Live On at GSK (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on GSK's decision to shut down its Sirtris operation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while simultaneously indicating that sirtuin drug development would continue through new hiring efforts in Pennsylvania. The author expresses continued interest in understanding what sirtuins are actually capable of doing in humans and hopes to see drug development emerge from this research, while acknowledging uncertainty about the likelihood of success.

The piece reflects on the ongoing "sirtuin drug development saga" - a reference to the controversial history of sirtuin research and resveratrol (the purported sirtuin-activating compound) that had generated significant scientific debate and commercial interest, culminating in GSK's $720 million acquisition of Sirtris in 2008. The article captures a moment of corporate restructuring rather than outright abandonment of the field.

## 2. HISTORY

**Sirtris Acquisition and Aftermath**: GSK's 2008 acquisition of Sirtris for $720 million represented one of the most prominent bets on sirtuin-based therapeutics, particularly targeting metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration, and aging-related conditions. In the years following this article, the sirtuin field underwent significant maturation.

**Clinical Development Trajectory**: Several sirtuin-targeting programs advanced through clinical trials. SRT2104 (a SIRT1 activator) reached Phase II trials for various indications including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation, though it failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in most studies. Other sirtuin modulators faced similar challenges with efficacy, safety, or bioavailability issues.

**Regulatory Outcomes**: To date, no sirtuin-targeting drugs have received FDA approval for their intended indications. While some compounds showed promise in early clinical studies, they generally failed to meet primary endpoints in larger, more rigorous trials. This pattern aligns with broader challenges in developing aging-related therapeutics that require chronic administration and where clinical trial design presents unique challenges.

**Scientific Consensus Evolution**: The field gradually moved beyond some earlier controversies, particularly around resveratrol's mechanism of action and claims about calorie restriction mimetics. Research continued exploring sirtuins' roles in metabolism, DNA repair, inflammation, and cellular stress responses, but with more measured expectations about therapeutic translation.

**Business Impact**: GSK maintained some sirtuin programs through the mid-2010s but eventually deprioritized most of this portfolio. The pharmaceutical industry's engagement with sirtuins shifted toward more targeted applications rather than broad anti-aging claims.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **That sirtuin drug development would continue**: ✓ **Partially Accurate**. Research did continue, but with far less pharmaceutical industry investment and few successful drug candidates reaching late-stage trials despite substantial ongoing academic interest in sirtuin biology.

• **That we would learn what sirtuins are actually capable of doing in humans**: ✓ **Accurate**. Subsequent research elucidated sirtuins' roles in metabolic regulation, cellular stress responses, and potentially some age-related processes, though the therapeutic implications remained more modest than initially hoped.

• **That drugs might emerge from this research**: ✗ **Inaccurate**. Despite over a decade of additional research and clinical trials, no sirtuin-targeting drugs achieved regulatory approval for their primary indications, representing a notable failure of therapeutic translation despite significant investment.

• **Epstein's skepticism about success odds**: ✓ **Prescient**. The author's expressed uncertainty about drug development success proved well-founded, as the field struggled with target validation, efficacy demonstration, and clinical trial design challenges that prevented most programs from advancing.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important transitional moment in a high-profile area of biotechnology that exemplified both the promise and challenges of translating basic aging research into therapeutics, though the ultimate clinical and commercial impact remained limited.
