# Blog Traffic: A Thank-You (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog at Science magazine simply thanked readers for generating nearly 441,000 page views in November 2011, marking one of the best months in the blog's history. The author expressed surprise that a blog focused on drug discovery and chemistry could attract such significant readership, indicating the niche subject matter had found an unexpectedly large audience.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2011 milestone, Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" continued to be one of the most influential and widely-read chemistry/drug discovery blogs for over a decade. The blog maintained its focus on pharmaceutical research, drug development, and chemistry, becoming a go-to source for industry professionals, academics, and scientifically-literate general readers. In 2020, Science Magazine discontinued the blog after nearly two decades, citing strategic changes, which generated significant discussion in the scientific community about science communication and the value of long-running expert blogs. In 2022, Lowe successfully launched the blog independently at his own domain, demonstrating continued strong reader loyalty.
