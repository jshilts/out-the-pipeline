# The Nasty Side of HDL (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the poor understanding of human lipidology in cardiovascular drug discovery, noting that attempts to lower LDL and/or raise HDL have produced repeated surprises. The author questions whether the success of statin drugs might have been a fluke, potentially involving beneficial off-target effects beyond just LDL-lowering.

The central focus is on a new discovery published in Nature Medicine: an oxidized form of HDL (specifically ApoA1 protein) found in arterial plaques. This modified protein was found to be useless for cholesterol scavenging, exacerbates inflammation, and impairs normal HDL biogenesis. The article suggests this oxidized HDL could serve as both a diagnostic marker and an important consideration for HDL-raising drug development.

The piece also mentions Merck's CETP inhibitor anacetrapib, noting concerns about its extremely slow elimination from the body - remaining detectable years after the last dose - and raises questions about how such late-stage compounds could incorporate this new understanding of oxidized HDL.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent developments following this 2014 article reveal a dramatic validation of its skeptical tone toward HDL-raising therapies and CETP inhibitors specifically.

**CETP Inhibitor Failures:** The optimism around CETP inhibitors that the article questioned proved entirely misplaced. Merck's anacetrapib, mentioned in the article, failed in its large phase 3 REVEAL trial in 2017. Despite raising HDL levels by over 100%, it produced only modest cardiovascular benefit (relative risk reduction of ~9%) that was deemed insufficient to justify approval. This followed earlier CETP inhibitor failures including torcetrapib (Pfizer, 2006), dalcetrapib (Roche, 2012), and evacetrapib (Lilly, 2015), all of which raised HDL significantly but failed to demonstrate clinical benefit.

**Clinical Reality:** No CETP inhibitor has ever received FDA approval for cardiovascular disease prevention. The pharmaceutical industry largely abandoned this mechanism after investing billions of dollars, confirming the article's implicit skepticism about HDL-raising as a therapeutic strategy.

**HDL Research Evolution:** Research subsequent to 2014 has reinforced the complexity the article highlighted. The oxidized HDL findings mentioned in the article contributed to a broader understanding that HDL function and quality matter more than absolute levels. Later studies identified dysfunctional HDL in various disease states, and research has shifted toward understanding HDL's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties rather than simply chasing higher HDL levels.

**Clinical Guidelines:** Modern lipid guidelines have appropriately de-emphasized HDL targets, focusing instead on LDL lowering and other proven interventions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit quantitative predictions, but its skeptical framing was remarkably prescient:

• **Implicit skepticism about CETP inhibitors:** The article's questioning tone about CETP inhibitors, particularly noting anacetrapib's concerning pharmacokinetics and the general pattern of HDL-raising failures, proved entirely accurate. These compounds did indeed fail to deliver clinical benefit despite raising HDL.
  
• **Importance of understanding oxidized/dysfunctional HDL:** The article correctly identified that the oxidized HDL discovery would be important for drug development considerations. This insight anticipated the broader shift in the field toward understanding HDL quality and function rather than just quantity.

• **General HDL-raising skepticism:** The article's overall doubt about HDL-raising as a therapeutic strategy was validated by subsequent clinical trial failures across multiple drug classes and mechanisms.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates substantial scientific insight by correctly anticipating the failure of the HDL-raising paradigm despite it being a major pharmaceutical development area at the time. The piece's skepticism about CETP inhibitors, while not unique, proved entirely justified by subsequent billion-dollar clinical failures.
