# Promoting STEM Education, Foolishly (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary criticizes massive government spending on STEM education programs, arguing that the push to drive more students into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers serves employer interests rather than benefiting science or society. The article cites a U.S. federal investment exceeding $3 billion across 209 programs, questioning whether this expansion actually produces quality scientists. The core argument posits that flooding the market with STEM graduates suppresses wages, reduces competition for workers, and ultimately suits industrial employers who want cheaper labor rather than genuinely struggling to find qualified candidates. The author suggests that complaints about skills shortages often mask employers' unwillingness to pay competitive salaries and provide proper training, challenging the widespread narrative that more STEM graduates are inherently beneficial.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments largely validated the article's skeptical analysis. The decade following 2013 saw continued debates about STEM workforce dynamics, with mixed evidence emerging about actual shortages versus wage suppression. While some tech sectors did experience genuine skill gaps, particularly in specialized areas like AI and cybersecurity, broader patterns supported the article's critique.

In the years immediately following publication, discussions about STEM workforce saturation gained traction in academic and policy circles. The "STEM shortage" narrative began facing more rigorous scrutiny, with multiple studies examining whether claimed shortages reflected genuine market needs or employers' preferences for lower-cost labor. The H-1B visa program remained controversial, with critics pointing to its use for wage suppression rather than addressing actual shortages. By the mid-to-late 2010s, media coverage increasingly questioned the automatic assumption that more STEM graduates equaled better outcomes, acknowledging nuances around field-specific demand and quality of employment.

The 2020s brought additional confirmation through labor market data showing varying outcomes across STEM fields, with computer science experiencing boom cycles while other areas demonstrated more complex patterns. The debate evolved to recognize that blanket STEM promotion might not optimize social or individual outcomes, with policy discussions becoming more sophisticated about distinguishing between different STEM disciplines and specific skill needs.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: Governments pushing more students into STEM would flood the labor market, reducing wages and benefiting employers rather than society.

**Reality**: This prediction proved largely accurate. The 2010s saw expanded STEM graduation rates, with subsequent data frequently showing wage stagnation or modest growth in certain STEM fields compared to the aggressive expansion of graduates. While some high-demand areas maintained strong compensation, broader patterns of softer wage growth emerged, particularly in research positions and certain engineering fields.

**Prediction**: Employer complaints about skills shortages often masked unwillingness to pay competitive salaries or provide adequate training.

**Reality**: This was strongly validated. Multiple analyses of labor market data showed that genuine shortages typically drove rapid wage increases, yet many sectors reporting "shortages" simultaneously showed stagnant or declining compensation. The persistence of H-1B visa debates, with documented cases of displacement and wage suppression, supported this assessment.

**Prediction**: The standard pro-STEM education position served employer interests and enjoyed political popularity because it pleased both employers and educators.

**Reality**: This prediction held true, with STEM education promotion remaining politically popular into the 2020s. The narrative's broad appeal to multiple constituencies made it resistant to skeptical evaluation, despite growing evidence of complex labor market dynamics and questions about whether every STEM field benefited society proportionally to investment.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article merits high interest for presciently challenging a widely accepted policy narrative and correctly identifying underlying economic incentives. The analysis demonstrated long-term accuracy about labor market dynamics and the political economy of education policy, maintaining relevance for over a decade.
