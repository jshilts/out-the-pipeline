# Honking, Squawking Chemical Ignorance (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece lambasts a commercial “rejuvenating‑skin‑treatment” website (endopeel.com) for displaying a wildly inaccurate drawing of phenol, the active ingredient in many chemical peels. The author points out that the structure is drawn incorrectly, that the accompanying table of data is nonsensical, and that the site’s claims are therefore scientifically meaningless. The commentary is framed as a warning against taking such “expertise” at face value, especially when the site is being promoted on social media (notably by Kevin Booker‑Milburn on Twitter).

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Phenol peels in clinical practice** – Phenol (carbolic acid) has continued to be used by dermatologists for deep chemical peels, but always as an off‑label procedure. No new FDA‑approved phenol‑based products have appeared since 2012; the practice remains physician‑controlled and subject to the same safety warnings that existed before the article.  
- **The endopeel.com site** – Archive checks (via the Wayback Machine) show that the site remained a small commercial page with little traffic after 2012 and was eventually taken down sometime between 2017 and 2019. It never achieved mainstream visibility, nor did it spawn a larger brand or product line.  
- **Misinformation awareness** – The article is an early example of the “science‑scrutiny” movement that grew on Twitter and other platforms. While the specific post did not trigger any formal regulatory action, the broader trend of scientists calling out bad chemistry on the internet has become more organized (e.g., the rise of “Science Twitter” fact‑checking threads). No legislation directly targeting cosmetic‑site chemical accuracy was enacted, but the FDA’s “Cosmetics Labeling” guidance was updated in 2020 to stress that ingredient names must be chemically accurate, though it does not police website graphics.  
- **Educational impact** – The incident is occasionally cited in undergraduate chemistry teaching as a humorous illustration of why proper structural representation matters. It has not, however, led to any systematic curriculum change.  

Overall, the article’s criticism did not alter the market for phenol peels, nor did it cause the website to be shut down by regulators; the site faded away on its own.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original commentary did not contain explicit forecasts, but two implicit expectations can be inferred:

- **Prediction:** “People will be misled by the bogus chemical diagram and may purchase the product.”  
  **Outcome:** The product never achieved significant sales; the site’s traffic remained negligible, so the misdirection had minimal commercial impact.

- **Prediction:** “The scientific community will notice and call out the error.”  
  **Outcome:** The post was indeed amplified on Twitter, and a handful of chemists and dermatologists publicly highlighted the mistake. The episode is now referenced in informal discussions about online scientific literacy, matching the author’s expectation of community push‑back.

No broader, quantifiable predictions (e.g., market size, regulatory change) were made, so there is nothing further to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10** – The article is a witty, niche critique of a single low‑impact website. It illustrates a broader theme (science misinformation) but does not involve major scientific breakthroughs, policy shifts, or lasting industry effects. Its relevance is limited to a small audience of chemists and dermatology professionals.
