# How Not To Do It: Column Chromatography
29 Feb 2008

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2008 article from Derek Lowe's popular "In the Pipeline" blog describes the evolution of chromatography column techniques in pharmaceutical chemistry labs. The author contrasts modern automated flash chromatography systems - pre-packed silica columns controlled by machines that collect UV-active fractions automatically - with the traditional manual method of packing glass columns by hand, loading samples, and manually collecting eluent fractions. The automated systems, which became industry standard, save significant time and reduce human error. 

The article's central anecdote describes a graduate student who attempted to run a manual column using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as the solvent - an unusual choice due to its high solvent strength and viscosity. When the student packed the column dry and then introduced DMSO, the exothermic reaction of DMSO with dry silica caused the column to explode, creating a dangerous mess. This exemplifies why manual column chromatography requires expertise and appropriate solvent choices to avoid catastrophic failures that automated systems prevent.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends and technologies described in this 2008 article reflect the broader progression of laboratory automation in pharmaceutical and chemical research. By 2008, automated flash chromatography systems had already become standard in industry settings, but academic labs were still transitioning due to cost constraints.

In the subsequent decade and a half, automated chromatography systems have become even more sophisticated and widespread. Companies like Biotage, Teledyne ISCO, Büchi, and Agilent have continued to refine their purification systems with improved column technology, better software integration, and enhanced detection methods. These systems have expanded beyond traditional UV detection to include evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD), mass spectrometry-coupled purification, and chiral separation capabilities.

The adoption accelerated particularly in academic settings as equipment costs decreased and the time savings became undeniable. Modern automated systems can purify compounds in minutes rather than hours, with better reproducibility and yield recovery. The manual methods described in the article are now primarily preserved in undergraduate teaching labs, very small academic labs with limited funding, or in resource-constrained environments in developing countries.

The safety considerations highlighted by the DMSO incident remain relevant, as laboratory safety standards have tightened significantly since 2008. However, automated systems have reduced such risks by eliminating manual solvent handling and ensuring proper column packing and operation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about the future of chromatography technology or laboratory practices. It was more of a retrospective reflection and personal anecdote rather than a forward-looking analysis. The author's observations about automation becoming standard practice were already becoming reality in 2008 rather than predictions about the future.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article has limited long-term importance as it's primarily a humorous anecdote about a specific lab accident combined with a description of already-established technology trends. While entertaining for chemists, it doesn't provide significant insights into broader developments in biotechnology, drug discovery, or pharmaceutical innovation. The subject matter is too narrow to be of lasting significance beyond the immediate audience of laboratory chemists.
