# The NIH, Pfizer, and Senator Wyden (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article responds to Senator Ron Wyden's critique that pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer profit excessively from NIH-funded foundational research without providing adequate return on investment to taxpayers. The immediate catalyst was Pfizer's recently FDA-approved JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib (Xeljanz) for rheumatoid arthritis, priced at approximately $25,000 annually with projected sales up to $2.5 billion. Wyden argued that since NIH research was "foundational" to Xeljanz's development, citizens deserve a better return on their investment and questioned whether the drug would be accessible and affordable.

The author challenges this perspective by emphasizing that the NIH's contribution—identifying JAK3 as a disease target—is a very early step that alone relieves no human suffering. Turning that knowledge into an actual FDA-approved drug required Pfizer to undertake the substantial financial risk and expense of drug discovery, preclinical work, and clinical trials. The author further notes that many companies pursued JAK3-related programs, with numerous failures, highlighting that not all research yields profitable drugs and questioning whether Wyden would offer to share expenses if Xeljanz failed.

## 2. HISTORY

**Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) Market Performance and Label Expansion:**
Following its initial approval for rheumatoid arthritis in November 2012, Xeljanz has seen significant clinical expansion. By 2024, it had received FDA approval for multiple additional indications, including psoriatic arthritis (2017), ulcerative colitis (2018), and ankylosing spondylitis (2021). This expanded market contributed to substantial revenue growth, with Pfizer reporting approximately $2.8 billion in global revenues for JAK inhibitors (primarily Xeljanz) in 2019.

**Safety Concerns and Regulatory Actions:**
In 2019, the FDA required updated boxed warnings for tofacitinib due to increased risks of blood clots and death at the 10 mg twice-daily dose. In 2021, the FDA issued a broader safety warning for all JAK inhibitors (including Xeljanz) regarding increased risks of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and death. Post-marketing studies revealed these cardiovascular and thrombotic risks, leading to restricted use recommendations.

**JAK Inhibitor Market Evolution:**
The JAK inhibitor class expanded significantly after 2013. Competitors included baricitinib (Olumiant, approved 2018), upadacitinib (Rinvoq, approved 2019), and filgotinib (Jyseleca, approved 2020 in Europe). These drugs targeted various inflammatory conditions beyond rheumatoid arthritis, but all carried similar safety warnings regarding cardiovascular and thrombotic risks.

**Drug Pricing and Access:**
Xeljanz maintained premium pricing throughout the 2010s, making access a persistent concern. Senator Wyden's broader concerns about drug pricing evolved into legislative efforts, including his involvement in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which included drug price negotiation provisions for Medicare—though these provisions wouldn't fully take effect until 2026 for the first negotiated drugs.

**NIH-Industry Collaboration Framework:**
The fundamental framework for NIH-industry collaboration remained largely unchanged. The Bayh-Dole Act continued to govern technology transfer from federally funded research to private industry. While NIH funding remained foundational for identifying drug targets, the dynamics described in the article—where industry bears most development costs and risks—persisted as the standard model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Article's implied prediction about Xeljanz profitability:**
The author questioned Wyden's assumption that Xeljanz would be a "$2.5 billion license to print money," noting it faced significant competition and might encounter problems.
**Outcome:** Xeljanz achieved substantial commercial success (reaching $2+ billion in annual revenues) but faced significant setbacks due to safety concerns, regulatory restrictions, and increased competition from other JAK inhibitors. The prediction of market challenges proved accurate, though the drug ultimately succeeded commercially despite these hurdles.

**• Implicit prediction about shared risk:**
The author suggested that if Xeljanz ran into trouble, Wyden wouldn't offer to share expenses or financial losses.
**Outcome:** This remained untested since Xeljanz ultimately succeeded commercially. However, the broader principle—that government doesn't share in financial losses when drug development fails—remained the norm in NIH-industry partnerships.

**• Wyden's implied prediction about public investment returns:**
That taxpayers deserved better returns when NIH-funded research led to successful drugs.
**Outcome:** Legislative changes did occur years later through the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), which included Medicare drug price negotiation provisions. However, these changes addressed drug pricing more broadly rather than specifically targeting NIH-industry collaborations or direct revenue-sharing from NIH-funded discoveries.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures a recurring and important debate about the value of publicly funded research versus private investment in drug development, and the tensions surrounding Xeljanz's safety issues and market evolution make the specific case study more relevant in retrospect. However, the fundamental arguments remain largely unchanged over a decade later, limiting its uniqueness, and the specific policy framework discussed (direct revenue-sharing from NIH discoveries) never materialized.
