# More Designer Drugs (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the growing challenge of designer recreational drugs, particularly the rise of boutique synthetic compounds. It references a detailed Medium article about the illegal recreational drug trade, highlighting how individuals are modifying known CNS (central nervous system) drug structures to create new psychoactive substances. The piece specifically mentions the case of journalist Mike Power, who successfully ordered a custom-synthesized phenmetrazine derivative from a Chinese laboratory using a flimsy cover story about developing analgesics for dogs. Despite obvious red flags in the order, the supplier completed the synthesis and offered to ship the compound hidden in a book to evade customs. The author expresses concern about the ethics of selling untested compounds to others, and quotes Power's assessment that "we can ban drugs, but we can't ban chemistry."

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2014 article, the synthetic drug landscape evolved significantly in several concrete ways:

**Regulatory Response**: Between 2015-2021, governments worldwide expanded controlled substance lists and implemented "analog acts" to ban structural variants of illegal drugs. The FDA issued numerous public safety alerts about synthetic cannabinoids, cathinones, and opioids. The 2018 SUPPORT Act in the US strengthened authorities to schedule emerging drugs more rapidly.

**Fentanyl Crisis**: The prediction about outsourcing synthesis proved tragically accurate in the fentanyl crisis. Mexican cartels and others began manufacturing synthetic opioids in China and Mexico, leading to a 2000% increase in synthetic opioid deaths in the US from 2013 to 2020. The CDC reported over 50,000 deaths from synthetic opioids in 2019 alone.

**China's Enforcement**: China implemented stricter controls on chemical exports, particularly fentanyl precursors, in 2019 under US pressure. However, production shifted to other regions including India and continued operations more clandestinely.

**Online Drug Markets**: Dark web marketplaces expanded significantly, with the DEA identifying dozens of active synthetic drug vendors by 2020. Law enforcement achieved some notable successes - the 2021 takedown of DarkMarket, the world's largest dark web marketplace, revealed substantial synthetic drug trafficking.

**Continued Innovation**: The arms race continued with novel compounds despite regulatory efforts. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime documented over 950 new psychoactive substances identified globally by 2021, compared to roughly 350 in 2014 when the article was published.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"People will keep outsourcing synthesis to laboratories"** ✓ ACCURATE - This continued and expanded, with fentanyl and other synthetic drugs primarily manufactured overseas and imported

• **"Difficult to control due to chemistry innovation"** ✓ ACCURATE - The number of new psychoactive substances continued growing rapidly despite regulatory efforts

• **Implicit prediction that existing regulatory approaches would struggle** ✓ ACCURATE - The synthetic drug death toll increased dramatically post-2014 despite enhanced enforcement

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/9**

The article identified a critical trend that would explode in significance - the intersection of globalized chemical supply chains and recreational drug innovation proved far more consequential than widely recognized in 2014, as demonstrated by the subsequent fentanyl crisis.
