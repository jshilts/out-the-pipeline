# Analysis of "Sulfur Fluoride Exchange" (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlighted Barry Sharpless and his group's extension of "click chemistry" to include sulfonyl fluorides, a relatively obscure class of compounds. The author shared personal anecdotes about his own early experience with these reactions and how they differ dramatically from the better-known sulfonyl chlorides. 

The piece described several novel reactions made possible by sulfonyl fluorides, including their inertness to water followed by unexpected reactivity with phenols to produce fluorosulfate esters. It highlighted vinylsulfonyl fluoride's exceptional properties as a powerful Michael acceptor, and the ease with which aryl silyl ethers react with sulfonyl fluorides to produce unsymmetrical diarylsulfates, a rarely explored compound class. The author specifically noted the potential of diarylsulfate "click" reactions on biological phenols like tyrosines, emphasizing how this long-neglected area of synthesis had suddenly become fascinating and useful.

## 2. HISTORY

**SuFEx was a game-changer that took far longer to catch fire than typical for click chemistry.** Most chemists' encounters with "SuFEx" (Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange) began around 2015-2016, not 2014, when Dmitrii Lushnikov's fluorosulfate probes for proteins emerged, and the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry honored Sharpless, Morten Meldal, and Carolyn Bertozzi mostly for azide-alkyne cycloaddition and bioorthogonal chemistry. Yet SuFEx quietly became an indispensable modern tool.

Between 2015 and 2018, dozens of studies demonstrated reliable protocols for SuFEx with phenols, amines, and thiols. TBS-protected tyrosines and lysines emerged as excellent substrates, allowing precise modifications on proteins, nucleic acids, and surfaces. Vinylsulfonyl fluoride turned out to be so reactive it often delivered unwanted side reactions over days in buffer, limiting direct use but inspiring variations relying on less aggressive electrophiles or careful addition at low temperature.

Fast forward to recent applications: **SuFEx-based covalent inhibitors entered clinical trials**, targeting KRAS, EGFR, BTK, and dozens of other enzymes and receptors. By 2020, SuFEx-enabled polymer networks provided self-healing materials, underwater adhesives, and new CO2 separation membranes; in 2023, SOF4- and KF-based protocols let pharmaceutical chemists rapidly build libraries of sulfonyl fluoride analogues directly from widely available sulfonyl chlorides.  

The true breakthrough happened with **covalent chemical probes and PROTACs**—biologists now enjoy irreversible, specific protein tagging via fluorosulfate esters. Tyrosine labeling is standard practice. Several commercial vendors supply reagent kits for SuFEx-based bioconjugation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Correct predictions:**
- SuFEx really did "haul back" forgotten chemistry and generalize across multiple nucleophile/electrophile pairs
- Tyrosine (phenol sidechain) modification became widely used in protein functionalization
- Diaryl sulfates provided a uniquely stable, tunable linkage for bioconjugation and materials science
- The step-change vs. sulfonyl chlorides was confirmed—many reactions work smoothly under conditions where chlorides give no product or decomposition
- Researchers quickly realized sulfonyl fluorides are highly orthogonal to common reactive groups (hydroxyls stay unreactive; thiols or amines react cleanly), fulfilling click chemistry criteria
- Whole new classes of functional materials became accessible

**Misplaced optimism / errors:**
- The article understated the safety and handling challenges of gas-phase sulfuryl fluoride ($SO_2F_2$) and the practical need for specialized flow systems or dilute liquid-phase protocols
- Commercial availability lagged significantly—basic building blocks like vinylsulfonyl fluoride were not widely stocked by suppliers until 2018–2020, delaying adoption
- Tyrosine SuFEx often required careful pH control and high excesses of reagents to achieve acceptable kinetics with proteins, limiting its immediate utility without further optimization
- The claim that aryl silyl ethers + sulfonyl fluorides → unsymmetrical diarylsulfates "very cleanly" proved overly optimistic—residual TBS protecting groups or organosilicon impurities often complicated product isolation in early studies

**Unexpected developments:**
- The vast majority of applications did not center on small-molecule diarylsulfates, but on amino- and phenoxy-fluorosulfates as covalent warheads in chemical biology and drug discovery
- Biologics manufacturing now uses fluorosulfate-based site-specific conjugation to prepare next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
- SuFEx is under serious evaluation for recycling PET plastics at scale and creating novel recyclable polymers

## 4. INTEREST

**8 out of 9**

This article has aged exceptionally well. What seemed like a niche observation launched a major subfield, with thousands of papers citing Sharpless's 2014 Angewandte Chemie report. The utility stretched from academic chemical biology into industrial drug discovery and materials science. It influenced the trajectory of covalent drug development and bioconjugation.

However, it falls short of the transformative impact of the original copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition or Bertozzi's bioorthogonal work, which explains why its discoverer earned a Nobel Prize for the other click reactions, not SuFEx. Also, the uptake was slower than many expected: most practitioners didn't incorporate SuFEx until 2017–2019, not right after 2014. Still, this ranks in the top decile of bench-level practical tools for the sheer breadth of what became possible—tyrosine-selective functionalization, covalent inhibitor design, novel polymers, and more. It sits comfortably in the 80–89th percentile of interest.
