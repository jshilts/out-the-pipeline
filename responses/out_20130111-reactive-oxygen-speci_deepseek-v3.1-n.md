# Reactive Oxygen Species Are Your Friends! (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 commentary discusses James Watson's provocative paper "Oxidants, Antioxidants, and the Current Incurability of Metastatic Cancers." The article summarizes Watson's thesis that most cancer therapies (chemotherapy, radiation, targeted agents) kill cancer cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that aggressive metastatic cancers become treatment-resistant by developing elevated antioxidant defenses. Watson argues this explains why advanced cancers are difficult to cure—they have evolved mechanisms to neutralize the ROS-based killing mechanisms of standard therapies.

The commentary extends Watson's argument to question the widespread use of antioxidant supplements (vitamins C, E, beta-carotene, selenium) for cancer prevention. Drawing connections to research showing antioxidants can block the benefits of exercise (which relies on ROS signaling), the article suggests that antioxidant supplementation might actually increase cancer risk rather than prevent it. Watson also critiques large-scale cancer genomics efforts like the Cancer Genome Atlas as focusing on "drivers" rather than exploitable "vulnerabilities," predicting that such approaches may prove less fruitful than hoped.

## 2. HISTORY

**Antioxidant Supplement Research (2013-2024):**

The period following this article saw continued investigation into antioxidant supplements' effects on cancer and mortality, with results generally supporting Watson's skepticism:

- Multiple large-scale meta-analyses and systematic reviews confirmed that antioxidant supplements show no clear benefit for cancer prevention.
- The 2019 Cochrane review of 78 randomized trials found no evidence that antioxidant supplements reduce cancer incidence or mortality in primary prevention.
- Some evidence emerged suggesting potential harms: the SELECT trial follow-up found vitamin E supplementation was associated with increased prostate cancer risk in healthy men.
- Mechanistic studies reinforced that ROS play important signaling roles in cellular homeostasis, and excessive antioxidant supplementation can disrupt these pathways.

**Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Outcomes:**

Contrary to Watson's skepticism, TCGA data proved highly impactful:
- TCGA completed comprehensive genomic characterization of 33 cancer types by 2018, providing foundational datasets used by thousands of researchers.
- TCGA findings enabled development of biomarker-driven therapies and contributed to precision oncology approaches.
- While not all TCGA findings translated immediately to drugs, the data revealed numerous therapeutic targets and resistance mechanisms.
- TCGA demonstrated that the genomic landscape of cancer is far more complex than a simple dichotomy between "drivers" and "vulnerabilities."

**ROS-Targeting Therapies:**

Therapeutic strategies targeting ROS mechanisms evolved significantly:
- Elesclomol (mentioned as a ROS-generating agent) failed in Phase III trials for metastatic melanoma in 2013 due to increased mortality in patients with high lactate dehydrogenase.
- Subsequent research refined understanding of when ROS-generating agents might be beneficial versus harmful.
- Interest grew in "redox-modulating" therapies rather than simply increasing or decreasing ROS.
- New therapeutic strategies emerged exploiting cancer cells' dependence on altered redox metabolism.
- Several drugs modulating oxidative stress pathways entered clinical trials, though none achieved widespread clinical adoption comparable to immunotherapy breakthroughs.

**Drug Development Trends:**

The cancer therapeutic landscape shifted dramatically:

- **Immunotherapy dominance:** Checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T therapies revolutionized cancer treatment, achieving durable responses in previously incurable diseases.
- **Targeted therapies:** Drugs targeting specific molecular alterations became standard of care, validating genomic approaches Watson criticized.
- **Myc pathway:** Despite Watson's focus on Myc as critical, directly drugging Myc remained challenging, though indirect approaches through BRD4 inhibition showed some promise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Antioxidant nutritional supplements do more harm than good as cancer preventatives"**
  - **Outcome:** Large-scale studies largely supported this view. Multiple systematic reviews found no evidence of benefit, with some studies suggesting increased cancer risk.

• **"Genome-based personal cancer therapies may turn out to be much less important than newspapers lead us to hope"**
  - **Outcome:** **Incorrect.** Genomic testing became increasingly important in oncology, with targeted therapies and biomarker-driven treatment showing significant clinical benefit. FDA approvals increasingly require companion diagnostics.

• **"Cancer Genome Atlas will find mostly drivers rather than vulnerabilities"**
  - **Outcome:** **Partially correct but incomplete.** TCGA did identify many drivers, but these often revealed therapeutic vulnerabilities. The data proved enormously valuable despite not matching Watson's preferred emphasis.

• **"RNAi screening effort will be more productive approach"**
  - **Outcome:** RNAi screening contributed to target identification but did not revolutionize cancer therapy as predicted. RNAi-based therapeutics faced delivery challenges, though some progressed (patisiran approved 2018 for amyloidosis).

• **"Pfizer might be the biggest beneficiary"**
  - **Outcome:** **Incorrect.** Immunotherapy companies (Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, others) became major beneficiaries rather than companies focused on ROS-targeting approaches.


## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

While Watson's specific therapeutic predictions proved largely incorrect, his core insight about ROS biology's complexity and antioxidant supplements' lack of benefit proved prescient and important for public health guidance. The article illustrates how even Nobel laureates can misjudge therapeutic approaches while correctly identifying fundamental biological misunderstandings.
