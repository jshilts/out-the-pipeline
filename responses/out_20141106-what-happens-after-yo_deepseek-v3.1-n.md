# What Happens After Your First Drug Approval (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post from ScienceMagazine discusses a Drug Discovery Today paper by Michael Kinch analyzing the fate of drug companies after their first FDA approval. The key finding is that since the 1970s, nearly two-thirds of companies that obtain their first drug approval go on to be acquired, often disappearing before they can achieve a second approval, which typically takes 6-8 years. The author notes that many acquired companies are dismantled within 1-2 years, particularly when purchased by marketing-focused companies rather than those engaged in active drug discovery, leading to the dissolution of experienced teams. While acknowledging this pattern appears inefficient from a public health perspective, the author suggests this may reflect companies' intentional business plans to be acquired, with venture capital investors expecting such exits, and considers whether this trend relates to increasing drug discovery difficulty. The piece weighs arguments about creative destruction and capital recycling against concerns about resource waste and team disruption.

## 2. HISTORY
Kinch's analysis emerged during a period of active debate about pharmaceutical industry structure and innovation sustainability (2014-2024). During this decade, the trend Kinch identified largely continued and perhaps intensified, with 2015-2021 seeing substantial M&A activity in biopharma, though specific survival rates post-first-approval were not systematically tracked in public sources. Major regulatory and policy developments included the 21st Century Cures Act (2016), which aimed to accelerate drug development and may have influenced small company trajectories, though it did not fundamentally alter the acquisition dynamics Kinch described. FDA drug approval rates remained relatively high through 2014-2024, with many first-in-class approvals going to smaller companies, yet these firms often faced the same financial and operational pressures Kinch documented. The broader biopharmaceutical ecosystem evolved with increased venture funding and specialized biotech companies, but the fundamental challenge of transitioning from one approved drug to a sustainable pipeline persisted. Notably, the dismantling of acquired companies mentioned in the article continued to occur, with some prominent examples of successful teams being dispersed post-acquisition. However, the venture capital recycling mechanism the author described also remained robust, with capital from exits funding new generations of biotech startups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events; instead, it primarily analyzed historical trends and discussed systemic dynamics without forecasting specific outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
**8/10**

This article ranks in the 80-89 percentile because it addressed a structurally important but under-examined question about innovation patterns in drug development. Its focused analysis of post-approval company trajectories revealed a systemic dynamic that remains relevant for understanding biopharma ecosystem sustainability. The article's modest length and narrow scope prevent it from being in the top decile despite its important insights.
