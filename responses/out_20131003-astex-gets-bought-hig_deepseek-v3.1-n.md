# Astex Gets Bought - At a Higher Price? (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary describes a potential challenge to Otsuka Pharmaceutical's acquisition of Astex Pharmaceuticals. A major shareholder (owning ~5% of shares) publicly declared they would not tender their shares, arguing the offer significantly undervalued Astex. The shareholder's objection focused on the timing of the deal—specifically that Astex was attempting to complete the sale before important clinical data for SGI-110, a second-generation DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, became available in December 2013 and 2014. The shareholder criticized both the auction process and the timing, suggesting management was selling prematurely before the true value of SGI-110 could be demonstrated through upcoming clinical studies.

## 2. HISTORY

The acquisition did proceed despite shareholder objections. Otsuka Pharmaceutical completed its purchase of Astex Pharmaceuticals in late 2013. Following the acquisition, Astex continued operating as a subsidiary focused on fragment-based drug discovery. 

SGI-110 (guadecitabine) continued development as a hypomethylating agent for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The drug progressed through clinical trials, with Phase II data showing some activity in these blood cancers. However, guadecitabine faced significant clinical setbacks. In a pivotal Phase III study for AML, the drug failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival improvement compared to existing treatments. Subsequent development was discontinued or significantly curtailed.

Astex's fragment-based drug discovery platform, which was the company's core technology, continued to be utilized under Otsuka's ownership, contributing to their oncology drug discovery efforts. The acquisition proved strategically important for Otsuka's expansion into oncology therapeutics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction: Higher offer or deal disruption** - The article suggested the shareholder opposition might force Otsuka to increase their bid or potentially disrupt the deal entirely. This did not occur; the acquisition proceeded at the original terms despite shareholder objections.

• **Implicit prediction: SGI-110's clinical success would increase valuation** - The shareholder argument implied that waiting for December 2013/2014 clinical data would demonstrate SGI-110's value and justify a higher acquisition price. This prediction proved incorrect; while SGI-110 showed some clinical activity in blood cancers, it ultimately failed in Phase III and did not become the breakthrough drug the shareholder envisioned. The existing offer may have represented fair value given the eventual clinical outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While providing a snapshot of acquisition dynamics, the article has limited long-term importance. The central drama (shareholder opposition to pricing) had no lasting impact, and the focal drug candidate (SGI-110) ultimately failed in clinical development, rendering the valuation debate moot. The piece mainly serves as a minor historical footnote about M&A timing disputes.
