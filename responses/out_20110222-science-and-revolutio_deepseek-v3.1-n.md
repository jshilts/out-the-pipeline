# Science and Revolution (Feb 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The author observes that North Africa and the Middle East have significantly underperformed in scientific research despite substantial oil wealth and GDP. Israel stands out as the region's only serious R&D contributor. Oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait have not translated their wealth into notable scientific achievements. Countries like Egypt and Iran have scientific infrastructure but produce minimal noteworthy research, despite expatriate talent flourishing abroad. Syria and Libya are scientifically "off the map." The author attributes this to various factors: poverty (Afghanistan), oppressive regimes preventing intellectual freedom (Syria), wealthy states choosing to "sit back and enjoy their money" (oil sheikdoms), and potential tensions between religious orthodoxy and secular scientific inquiry across the largely Islamic region. The article was written during the Arab Spring uprisings, raising cautious concern about whether revolutions would lead to scientifically progressive societies or merely replace old authoritarianism with new forms.

## 2. HISTORY

**Saudi Arabia's Transformation (2011-2024):** The Kingdom dramatically accelerated science investment post-2011. By 2016, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) had established itself as a serious research institution, and under Vision 2030 (launched 2016), Saudi Arabia rapidly climbed research rankings, becoming the Arab world's top research producer by 2021. The country now leads in fields like desalination technology and has invested heavily in NEOM and other megaprojects aiming for technological leadership. This contrasts sharply with the article's dismissive assessment.

**Egypt's Continued Struggles:** Despite the 2011 revolution's initial promise, Egypt's scientific output remained stagnant. Multiple regime changes and ongoing economic challenges prevented significant R&D investment. While some initiatives emerged, Egypt still ranked behind Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar in research output by 2024.

**UAE's Strategic Investment:** The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, became major science hubs with substantial progress in artificial intelligence, space technology (including the Mars mission), and renewable energy. The Masdar Institute and Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre demonstrated serious capacity.

**Iran's Paradox:** Iran maintained its nuclear program but saw significant brain drain of its most talented scientists to Western countries. Limited progress in civilian biotechnology and computing occurred, but economic sanctions and political isolation constrained broader scientific development.

**Regional Upheavals:** The Arab Spring largely failed to produce sustained democratic reforms or scientific revitalization. Libya collapsed into civil war with no meaningful scientific infrastructure remaining. Syria's civil war destroyed its research capacity entirely. Tunisia initially showed promise but faced economic collapse and political backsliding.

**Actual Policy Changes:** None of the countries experienced democratic consolidation that would create open, inquiry-driven scientific cultures on Western or Israeli models.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** Egypt would need to "get its act together" post-revolution, but "that's not going to be easy."
  - **Outcome:** Partially accurate. The 2011 revolution did not lead to sustained scientific reform; multiple subsequent regime changes, ongoing economic crises, and political instability prevented meaningful R&D progress. Egypt did not emerge as a scientific power.

• **Prediction:** Iran's "lid is going to come off at some point...the longer the wait, the worse the boilover will be."
  - **Outcome:** Broadly accurate. Iran experienced major protests in 2017-2018, 2019-2020, and the 2022-2023 "Mahsa Amini" protests. While these did not overthrow the regime, they demonstrated significant internal pressure and social discontent.

• **Prediction:** "The most likely result is the advent of a new boss...who may be wearing a uniform, or robes, or even a nice suit, but who has the same ideas in mind as the last guy."
  - **Outcome:** Mixed. Egypt saw a military leader (Sisi) replace Mubarak, but Egypt under Sisi was arguably more authoritarian and created less scientific reform than the article implicitly hoped for in alternative scenarios. Tunisia initially achieved democracy before backsliding, while Libya collapsed entirely.

• **Prediction:** "Doors are opening; let's hope that many of them don't just slam shut again."
  - **Outcome:** Largely accurate. Only Tunisia briefly experienced democratic opening before reverting, while Egypt quickly saw authoritarian restoration. Most revolutionary openings did indeed "slam shut."

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article correctly identified the region's scientific underperformance and the challenges facing post-authoritarian transitions, with surprising foresight about many "Arab Spring" outcomes. Its skepticism about whether revolutions would produce sustained democratic scientific cultures proved broadly accurate.
