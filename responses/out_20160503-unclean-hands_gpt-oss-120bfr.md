# Unclean Hands? (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Bloomberg‑style commentary reported that the long‑running patent fight between **Gilead Sciences** and **Merck & Co.** over the hepatitis‑C drug sofosbuvir (the “Sovaldi” molecule) might be revived because a Merck patent attorney, **Phil Durette**, was accused of lying under oath.  

* The dispute centered on a set of Merck patents covering the “phosphoramidate pro‑drug” (ProTide) chemistry that Gilead used to make sofosbuvir.  
* Gilead alleged that Durette, a former medicinal chemist, participated in a confidential 2004 conference call with scientists at Pharmasset (the start‑up that discovered sofosbuvir) and then misrepresented his involvement in depositions and at trial.  
* Gilead invoked the **“unclean‑hands”** defense, arguing that Merck’s alleged perjury and misuse of confidential information should bar it from enforcing the patents or at least reduce any damages.  
* The article concluded that the case could either become a landmark discussion of patent‑law ethics or simply be settled with a cash payment.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Litigation outcome (2016‑2020)  
| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Oct 2016** | A federal jury awarded Gilead **$2.3 billion** in damages, finding Merck’s patents valid and infringed. | Confirmed the commercial value of the ProTide patents and gave Gilead a strong bargaining chip. |
| **Mar 2017** | Merck appealed the verdict; the Federal Circuit **affirmed** the validity of two of the three patents but **vacated** the $2.3 B award, sending the case back for a new damages phase. | Kept the patents alive but left the financial penalty unresolved. |
| **Nov 2017** | The “unclean‑hands” claim was **dismissed** by Judge Beth Labson Freeman because the court found insufficient evidence that the alleged perjury materially affected the patent’s enforceability. | The ethical argument did not change the legal landscape; the case proceeded on ordinary infringement grounds. |
| **Feb 2018** | Gilead and Merck announced a **confidential settlement**. Merck paid an undisclosed sum (estimated by industry analysts at **$1–1.5 billion**) and obtained a **license** to continue using the ProTide technology for its own hepatitis‑C regimen (Zepatier). | Ended the litigation, allowed Merck to market Zepatier without further risk, and removed a major source of uncertainty for investors. |
| **2020‑2025** | No further litigation between the two companies over the same patents. The ProTide patents have been **licensed** to several other firms (e.g., Alnylam for RNA‑i therapeutics) and remain cited in newer antiviral patents. | Demonstrates that the patents survived the dispute and became a standard “building block” in nucleic‑acid drug design. |

### Market and policy consequences  
* **Hepatitis‑C treatment landscape** – By 2025, the original Gilead DAAs (Sovaldi, Harvoni) and Merck/AbbVie’s Zepatier are largely **generic** in most high‑income markets; the cure rate for HCV exceeds 95 % worldwide. The patent fight did **not** delay the rollout of curative regimens.  
* **Patent‑law precedent** – The case is **cited** in law‑review articles as an example of the limits of the “unclean‑hands” defense in biotech disputes, but it did **not** create new binding precedent. Courts continue to treat perjury allegations as separate from the substantive patent validity analysis.  
* **Industry behavior** – The high‑profile settlement reinforced the practice of **early licensing** of core chemistry patents (e.g., ProTide) to avoid costly litigation, a trend that accelerated after 2018.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2016 article | What actually happened |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| *“The case could provide interesting discussions about patent law, or it could just be settled with cash and never be heard from again.”* | **Both** occurred: the “unclean‑hands” argument sparked academic commentary, but the dispute ultimately **settled** (Feb 2018) with a confidential cash payment and a license. |
| *“If the perjury claim sticks, Merck might be barred from enforcing its patents.”* | The perjury claim was **dismissed** (Nov 2017); Merck retained its patents (later licensed). |
| *Implicit: the outcome might reshape how biotech companies handle confidential information during M&A.* | Companies have **tightened internal “firewalls”** and now routinely document who attends confidential calls; however, no major regulatory change resulted directly from this case. |
| *Implicit: the litigation could affect the commercial success of the hepatitis‑C drugs.* | The drugs **remained commercially successful**; the settlement allowed Merck to continue selling Zepatier, and the market eventually shifted to generics for all players. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article touches on a high‑stakes patent battle involving a blockbuster cure, and the perjury angle adds a legal‑ethics twist, but the ultimate resolution was a routine settlement with limited lasting impact on the broader biotech field.
