# Big Pharma's Lost Stock Market Decade (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article analyzes the poor stock market performance of major pharmaceutical companies over the previous decade (2000-2010). The author presents data showing that most pure pharmaceutical companies significantly underperformed the S&P 500 index during this period, with only Johnson & Johnson and Abbott outperforming the market. Notably, these two companies had significant medical device and diagnostic businesses alongside their drug operations, suggesting diversification may have provided some protection.

The article specifically examines Pfizer's performance in context, arguing that despite multiple large mergers and acquisitions (Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia/Upjohn, and Wyeth), the company performed no better than its non-merging peers like Eli Lilly. The author raises questions about whether mergers and acquisitions actually created value for investors, given that all the pure drug companies faced similar poor returns regardless of their strategic approach. The piece also acknowledges the deeper underlying issue: the fundamental problems in drug discovery productivity during this period drove many mergers, even though mergers didn't seem to solve the core research challenges.

## 2. HISTORY
**Stock Performance Continuation (2010-2024):** The trends identified in the article largely continued. Most major pharmaceutical companies continued to underperform the broader market, particularly when compared to technology stocks. However, the COVID-19 pandemic created a notable exception, with companies developing vaccines and treatments (including Pfizer with its mRNA vaccine) seeing temporary significant gains.

**Pfizer's Trajectory:** The article's assessment of Pfizer's merger strategy proved prescient. The company continued its pattern of large acquisitions, including the $14 billion purchase of Medivation (2016), the $15 billion acquisition of Hospira (2015), and most recently the $43 billion acquisition of Seagen (2023). Despite these transactions, Pfizer's stock performance relative to the S&P 500 remained mixed, with the notable exception of 2021-2022 when COVID-19 vaccine revenue drove significant gains.

**Industry Consolidation Continues:** The merger and acquisition trend continued throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, with major deals including Bristol-Myers Squibb acquiring Celgene for $74 billion (2019), AbbVie acquiring Allergan for $63 billion (2019), and the proposed but failed Pfizer-Allergan merger (2016) that would have been the largest pharmaceutical deal in history at $160 billion.

**Research Productivity Challenges Persist:** The underlying problem of declining R&D productivity that the article referenced continued to plague the industry. The cost to develop a new drug continued to rise, with estimates now ranging from $1-3 billion per approved drug. Many companies shifted focus toward biologics and specialty drugs as traditional small molecule discovery became increasingly challenging.

**Policy and Market Changes:** The Affordable Care Act (2010) and subsequent healthcare reforms created new pricing pressures and market dynamics. The rise of biosimilars, increased scrutiny on drug pricing, and changes in patent law all affected pharmaceutical company business models and profitability.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Implicit prediction that pure pharmaceutical companies would continue to underperform:** This largely proved accurate through 2019, though the 2020-2022 period provided temporary relief due to pandemic-related demand.
  
- **Suggestion that diversification (medical devices/diagnostics) provided some protection:** J&J and Abbott's diversified models continued to provide relative stability compared to pure-play pharmaceutical companies, validating this observation.

- **Implication that merger activity wouldn't solve underlying research productivity problems:** This prediction was generally accurate - despite continued consolidation, pharmaceutical R&D productivity remained challenging throughout the subsequent decade.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article earns a score of 6 because it correctly identified a major structural issue in the pharmaceutical industry (declining research productivity and shareholder returns) that would persist for over a decade, though it couldn't anticipate the extraordinary market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of how mergers failed to create shareholder value proved remarkably durable and insightful for understanding the industry's fundamental challenges.
