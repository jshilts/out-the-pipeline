# Merck's Aftermath (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary analyzes Merck's drug discovery restructuring following layoffs in late 2013. The author observes that Merck's West Point facility was severely affected, with a disproportionate number of bench chemists losing their jobs, leaving the organization "top-heavy with managers." The article suggests this resembles Pfizer's model of concentrating high-level strategy in-house while outsourcing routine work overseas to lower-cost operations.

The core argument is that this approach represents a form of "Taylorism"—the century-old management philosophy advocating separation between those who think about work and those who execute it. The author contends that while Taylorism succeeded in assembly-line manufacturing with defined, optimizable processes, R&D presents fundamentally different challenges. Drug discovery depends heavily on serendipity, empiricism, and poorly understood mechanisms, creating workflow turbulence that cannot be smoothed through managerial optimization alone. The piece questions whether outsourcing assumes smoother operations than actually exist in pharmaceutical research.

## 2. HISTORY

**Merck's Situation and Subsequent Performance:**
Between 2013-2020, Merck underwent significant restructuring as the pharmaceutical industry faced patent cliffs and R&D productivity challenges. The company continued to balance internal discovery with external partnerships, but the notion of wholesale outsourcing of medicinal chemistry never fully materialized as feared. Merck maintained substantial internal drug discovery capabilities while selectively partnering with CROs for specific services.

**R&D Productivity Outcomes:**
The period following 2013 saw mixed results for major pharma R&D. The industry continued struggling with high failure rates in clinical trials and escalating development costs, validating some of the article's concerns about unpredictable research workflows. However, companies found that strategic external partnerships, rather than wholesale outsourcing, proved more effective.

**Industry-Wide Trends:**
The Taylorism analogy largely proved inapt for pharmaceutical R&D. Major companies discovered that drug discovery's complexity resisted simple division-of-labor approaches. Instead, successful organizations maintained integrated teams combining discovery biology, medicinal chemistry, and clinical development expertise.

**Merck's Specific Pipeline:**
In the years following 2013, Merck experienced notable successes (Keytruda's expansion across multiple cancer types) and failures (several late-stage pipeline discontinuations). The company's R&D strategy evolved toward targeted external collaborations rather than systematic outsourcing of core discovery functions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Taylorism in Drug Discovery**: The article predicted that applying assembly-line thinking to R&D would prove inadequate due to the inherent unpredictability and dependence on serendipity in drug discovery. **OUTCOME**: Broadly accurate. The pharmaceutical industry did not adopt wholesale Taylorist approaches, recognizing that drug discovery's complexity requires integrated, flexible teams rather than rigid division of labor.

• **Outsourcing Model Failure**: The piece suggested that outsourcing discovery work while keeping only planning functions in-house would prove problematic as it underestimated real-world workflow complexity. **OUTCOME**: Partially accurate. While many companies increased external partnerships, they generally maintained core internal capabilities rather than outsourcing discovery entirely, suggesting recognition of the author's concerns.

• **Merck Following Pfizer's Path**: The article questioned whether Merck would fully adopt Pfizer's outsourcing model. **OUTCOME**: Incomplete adoption. Merck increased external partnerships but maintained substantial internal discovery operations, suggesting the Pfizer model wasn't universally adopted.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article makes thoughtful points about the limitations of manufacturing-oriented management approaches when applied to R&D, but its specific focus on a particular company's restructuring limits broader relevance compared to more fundamental analyses of drug discovery productivity challenges.
