# Cutting Back in Basel (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short news piece reported that Roche was eliminating 95 drug‑discovery positions at its Basel research campus, while creating about 40 new roles elsewhere in the company’s R&D organization. The article also mentioned circulating rumors that the immunology and infectious‑disease discovery groups in Basel might be “threatened with downsizing.” No deeper analysis or official comment was provided.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Roche’s R&D restructuring (2016‑2024)**  
- **Strategic shift to oncology & immuno‑oncology.** Beginning in 2015, Roche announced a “focus on oncology, immunology and neuroscience” and began reallocating resources toward late‑stage development and partnership models. The Basel cuts were part of this broader realignment rather than an isolated lay‑off.  
- **Growth in the Basel hub after the cuts.** By 2020 Roche had opened a new “Roche Innovation Center” in Basel that housed expanded immuno‑oncology programs (e.g., the PD‑L1 antibody atezolizumab, co‑developed with Genentech). Hiring in Basel rebounded, especially in biologics and cell‑therapy platforms, although the exact head‑count is not publicly disclosed.  
- **Pipeline outcomes.** The years following the cuts saw several high‑profile approvals that originated from Roche’s global R&D network (including Basel‑based teams):  
  * **Ocrevus** (ocrelizumab) – approved 2017 for multiple sclerosis (an immunology product).  
  * **Tecentriq** (atezolizumab) – approved 2016/2017 for several cancers; its development was heavily based in Basel.  
  * **Polivy** (polatuzumab vedotin) – approved 2019 for lymphoma.  
  * **Hemlibra** (emicizumab) – approved 2018 for hemophilia A (originated from the Basel‑based Hemophilia program).  
- **Business performance.** Roche’s sales grew from CHF 53 bn in 2016 to CHF 68 bn in 2023, driven largely by oncology and immunology products. The Basel cuts did not translate into a measurable slowdown of pipeline productivity.  
- **Policy & collaboration trends.** Roche increased external collaborations (e.g., with biotech firms, academic consortia) and invested in platform technologies such as CAR‑T and RNA therapeutics. These moves were consistent with the “lean‑internal, partner‑heavy” model hinted at by the 2016 cuts.

**Outcome for the threatened areas**  
- **Immunology:** Contrary to the rumor of a decline, Roche’s immunology portfolio expanded, highlighted by Ocrevus and later by the acquisition of **Genentech’s** immunology assets.  
- **Infectious disease:** Roche’s infectious‑disease discovery remained modest; the company did not launch a major new anti‑infective product after 2016, and the area stayed a lower priority relative to oncology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not contain explicit forecasts, but the implied predictions were:

| Implied prediction (2016) | What actually happened |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Immunology research in Basel would be downsized.** | Immunology continued to receive investment; Ocrevus (MS) and several checkpoint‑inhibitor programs were advanced from Basel, indicating no net downsizing. |
| **Infectious‑disease discovery would face cuts.** | Roche’s infectious‑disease pipeline remained small; no major new antibiotics or antivirals were launched, but the area was not dramatically expanded either. |
| **Overall R&D headcount in Basel would shrink.** | Short‑term headcount fell, but by the early 2020s Basel’s R&D staff grew again as new biologics and cell‑therapy groups were built. Exact numbers are proprietary, but the trend reversed the 2016 reduction. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a moment of strategic re‑allocation at a major pharma hub, which foreshadowed Roche’s later emphasis on oncology and immuno‑oncology. Its limited detail and short‑term focus keep it from being a landmark piece, but the topic remains relevant for understanding how large companies reshape R&D portfolios.
