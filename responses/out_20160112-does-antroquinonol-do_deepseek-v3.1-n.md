# Does Antroquinonol Do Anything? (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a troubling discrepancy surrounding the purported anticancer properties of antroquinonol A, a natural product being advanced by Golden Biotech of Taiwan into Phase II trials for non-small-cell lung cancer. Researchers from the Baran group and Bristol-Myers Squibb successfully synthesized a full gram of the compound, enabling definitive in vitro and in vivo tests. These new, well-controlled experiments could not reproduce the published activity: reported tumor-cell-killing potency was not replicated, and a Hep 3B xenograft model also failed to show activity. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a carboxylic acid metabolite, but that metabolite itself proved inactive. 

Despite being in clinical development, the compound's reported potency (around 25 micromolar) seemed unimpressive for the intended cancer type. The article calls on Golden Biotech to address these reproducibility concerns and clarify whether patients might be receiving an ineffective compound based on faulty preclinical data. The author also suggests Golden Biotech should test the Baran group's material in their own assays to resolve the discrepancy.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication, here is what happened:

- **Antroquinonol developmental status**: The compound (often called antroquinonol or Hocena) advanced into several mid- and late-phase trials but failed to secure approvals in key indications.
  - **Non-small-cell lung cancer**: A Phase II trial (NCT02047344) was completed, but no Phase III trial appears to have been initiated.
  - **Acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes**: A Phase II trial (NCT02707484) progressed, but it did not lead to a reported FDA approval.
  - **COVID-19 pneumonia**: A Phase II study in severe COVID-19 pneumonia (NCT04375735) was initiated, reflecting a pivot in strategy during the pandemic. Results did not demonstrate a clear path to approval.
  - **Hepatocellular carcinoma**: Research and trials in this area did not produce an approved therapy.

- **Regulatory and business outcomes**:
  - No FDA approval has been granted for antroquinonol in any oncology or other indication. Limited peer-reviewed evidence of convincing efficacy emerged from later trials.
  - Golden Biotechnology Corporation (Taiwan) continued to fund and conduct trials, but uptake in patients did not occur due to the absence of approvals. A number of trials were listed as completed or terminated without leading to a marketed drug.

- **Scientific replication and adoption**:
  - Subsequent independent data largely reinforced doubts about antroquinonol’s potency and mechanism, and the compound did not become a widely adopted tool compound or a foundation for related drugs in major pharma pipelines.

- **Public policy impact**:
  - No major shifts in FDA or international regulatory guidance appear directly attributable to the antroquinonol case. However, the episode contributed to broader discussions about improving reproducibility in early natural-product-based drug discovery prior to committing to costly clinical studies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Author's implied prediction**:
  - The Science blog strongly implied that Golden Biotech was likely dosing patients with an **ineffective compound**, and that the Phase II trials would probably fail to show meaningful efficacy.
    - **Outcome**: Consistent with this concern, antroquinonol did not achieve approval or demonstrate robust efficacy in later trials. The Phase II studies did not lead to Phase III success or commercialization.

- **Golden Biotech's response**:
  - Golden Biotech suggested that slight differences in experimental conditions could explain the discrepancy and that their own metabolite studies showed different, more extensively metabolized molecules.
    - **Outcome**: No compelling evidence emerged to support Golden Biotech’s position; the compound did not transition into an approved therapy despite further clinical testing.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article highlights a critical challenge in drug discovery—irreproducible preclinical data—and accurately foreshadowed a clinical outcome based on flawed science. It remains a useful cautionary example about the risks of advancing compounds without robust, independently validated data.
