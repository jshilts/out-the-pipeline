# The Cancer Stem Cell Saga (Oct 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reviews the “cancer stem cell” (CSC) hypothesis – the idea that a sub‑population of tumor cells drives growth and relapse.  It highlights a 2008 Nature paper from Sean Morrison’s lab that showed, using more permissive mouse‑transplant assays, that melanoma cells are far more tumorigenic than earlier studies suggested (≈ 1 in 4 rather than 1 in 10⁶).  The author argues that this undermines the CSC model for solid tumors, noting that no reproducible, phenotypically defined CSC population has ever been isolated and that no drug can selectively target such cells.  

The piece then surveys the commercial fallout: Stemcentrx (founded 2008) was bought by AbbVie for its lead ADC Rova‑T (rovalpituzumab tesirine), but the drug failed in late‑stage trials.  Other companies that chased CSCs – Verastem, OncoMed, several AbbVie “SC‑coded” compounds – have either pivoted or disappeared.  A 2010 New York Times profile called the field “overheated,” and the author wonders whether a “sadder‑but‑wiser” chapter lies ahead.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Rova‑T and Stemcentrx**  
* 2014: AbbVie completed a $5.8 bn acquisition of Stemcentrx.  
* 2015–2016: Phase II data in small‑cell lung cancer (SCLC) were promising; the drug targets DLL3, a protein thought to mark CSCs.  
* 2016 (TRINITY) and 2017 (TAHOE) Phase III trials in SCLC failed to meet overall‑survival endpoints and showed significant toxicity (skin‑related, pleural effusions).  
* 2018: AbbVie announced termination of Rova‑T development and wrote off the asset. No CSC‑targeted drug from Stemcentrx has reached the market.

**Verastem**  
* 2012 IPO based on a CSC‑focused pipeline (e.g., defactinib, a FAK inhibitor).  
* 2015–2018: Clinical programs stalled; the company shifted toward immuno‑oncology (e.g., pembrolizumab combinations) and later sold its FAK program to Sanofi. No CSC‑specific product reached approval.

**OncoMed**  
* Built a pipeline around antibodies against developmental pathways (e.g., DLL4, Notch).  
* 2018: Acquired by Merck KGaA (now Merck Group); the CSC focus was de‑prioritized in favor of broader oncology assets.  

**AbbVie “SC‑coded” compounds**  
* The AbbVie pipeline page listed several agents with “SC” designations (e.g., SC‑01, SC‑02). By 2022 none had entered late‑stage trials; internal reports suggest they were placed on hold or dropped.  

**Broader scientific progress**  
* Single‑cell RNA‑seq and lineage‑tracing studies (2015‑2024) have clarified that many tumors contain hierarchies, but the markers are highly context‑dependent and often overlap with non‑stem phenotypes.  
* In hematologic malignancies, the “leukemia stem cell” concept remains useful; drugs such as venetoclax (BCL‑2 inhibitor) and CD19‑CAR‑T have activity against cells with stem‑like features, but they were not developed explicitly as CSC agents.  
* No FDA‑approved therapy to date is marketed as a CSC‑targeted drug.  

**Policy & funding**  
* NIH and private foundations reduced dedicated CSC grant lines after 2015, reallocating funds toward immunotherapy, KRAS inhibitors, and tumor‑microenvironment research.  
* The field is now considered a sub‑area of tumor heterogeneity rather than a standalone therapeutic paradigm.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the article (or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **The CSC model for solid tumors would be “invalidated” by the Morrison data.** | The 2008 Nature study showed higher tumorigenic frequency, but later work (e.g., 2014–2020 lineage‑tracing) demonstrated that functional heterogeneity still exists; CSC‑like cells can be identified in some solid cancers (e.g., pancreatic, glioblastoma) though markers are not universal. | Partially true: the original extreme rarity claim was disproved, but the broader concept of a hierarchical subpopulation remains viable in certain contexts. |
| **No drug will ever selectively target CSCs; all “CSC‑specific” drugs will fail.** | Rova‑T (DLL3‑ADC) failed; other CSC‑focused agents (e.g., DLL4 antibodies, FAK inhibitors) have not achieved approval. No successful CSC‑selective drug exists as of 2026. | Accurate to date, though the statement is absolute; future breakthroughs remain possible. |
| **Companies will abandon the CSC field, leaving only a few “placeholder” compounds.** | Stemcentrx assets were shelved; Verastem and OncoMed pivoted; AbbVie’s SC compounds have not progressed. The field’s commercial activity has shrunk dramatically, though academic research continues. | Largely correct. |
| **The hype around CSCs will cool, and the field will become a “sad‑but‑wiser” chapter.** | Media coverage peaked around 2010–2015 and has since waned; recent reviews treat CSCs as one of many mechanisms of resistance rather than a silver bullet. | Accurate. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when a high‑profile therapeutic hypothesis collapsed, offering a clear lesson about translational optimism; its relevance persists for anyone studying drug‑target validation.
