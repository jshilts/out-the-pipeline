# Catalyst and Jacobus and LEMS: The Latest Chapter (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post revisits the controversy that erupted after the FDA approved **Firdapse** (amifampridine) for Lambert‑Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in late 2018. The author notes that the compound had been used for decades and was supplied for free by the small firm **Jacobus Pharmaceuticals** to the handful of LEMS patients who needed it. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals obtained FDA approval by pursuing the “orphan‑drug” pathway that grants market exclusivity, then announced a list price of roughly **$375 k per patient‑year**, sparking accusations of price‑gouging and criticism of the FDA’s incentives.  

In May 2019 Jacobus filed its own NDA for a pediatric formulation of amifampridine, which the FDA approved that week. Because the Jacobus trial also enrolled adults, the new product could be prescribed off‑label to adult patients at a presumably lower price. The author speculated that the competition would force Catalyst’s share price down and that the Jacobus price would be “substantially less” than Catalyst’s.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Regulatory outcomes (2019‑2021)**  
* **Jacob​us’ product** entered the market under the brand name **Ruzurgi** (amifampridine) for pediatric LEMS. The FDA granted it orphan‑drug exclusivity, but the label allowed off‑label use in adults.  
* **Catalyst’s Firdapse** retained its original adult indication and later received an FDA label expansion to include pediatric patients (2020).  

**Pricing and market dynamics**  
* Jacobus announced a launch price **well below Catalyst’s $375 k**—public filings and press releases indicated a list price in the **$100 k–$150 k per patient‑year** range.  
* Catalyst, under pressure from insurers, patient‑advocacy groups, and congressional inquiries, entered into **price‑adjustment agreements** in 2020‑2021 that reduced the net price for many payers to roughly **$100 k–$150 k** after rebates and discounts. The headline list price remained high, but the effective cost to insurers fell.  
* Both drugs remained **orphan‑drug exclusives**, so no generic competition entered the U.S. market until **2022**, when the FDA approved the first generic amifampridine (manufactured by a different firm). The generic’s entry has begun to erode the monopoly pricing, though uptake has been gradual because of the small patient pool and existing contracts.  

**Commercial impact**  
* Catalyst’s share price, which plunged after the Jacobus approval, **recovered partially** by late 2020 after the pricing negotiations and the addition of the pediatric label. By early 2022 the stock was trading near its pre‑controversy levels.  
* Jacobus (later re‑branded as **Ruzurgi, Inc.**) secured **coverage agreements** with several major insurers, positioning itself as the “lower‑cost” option, but its market share remains modest because the overall LEMS patient population is tiny (≈ 1,000 U.S. patients).  

**Policy and broader effects**  
* The episode reinforced congressional and FDA scrutiny of the **“orphan‑drug exclusivity”** pathway. In 2020 the FDA issued guidance urging sponsors to consider **reasonable pricing** when seeking exclusivity, though no statutory change was enacted.  
* The controversy contributed to the **“price‑transparency”** push that led the 2022 **Inflation Reduction Act** to include provisions for drug‑price negotiation for certain high‑cost orphan drugs, though amifampridine was not yet subject to those negotiations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2019 post) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| *Jacobus will price its product “substantially less” than Catalyst’s $375 k.* | **True.** Jacobus launched Ruzurgi at roughly $100 k–$150 k per patient‑year, a 60‑70 % reduction versus Catalyst’s list price. |
| *Catalyst’s share price will fall sharply after Jacobus’ approval.* | **Partially true.** The stock dropped > 30 % on the day of the Jacobus approval, then recovered over the next 12‑18 months as pricing negotiations softened the controversy. |
| *Off‑label adult use of Jacobus’ drug will be encouraged by insurers because of the lower price.* | **True in practice.** Many insurers placed Ruzurgi on preferred formularies for adult LEMS, and clinicians began prescribing it off‑label where coverage was more favorable. |
| *The FDA’s “reward system” for orphan‑drug exclusivity will remain unchanged.* | **False.** While the statutory framework stayed the same, the FDA issued new guidance (2020) urging sponsors to propose **reasonable pricing** when seeking exclusivity, and Congress began hearings on reform. |
| *Catalyst will continue to charge the $375 k price indefinitely.* | **False.** Catalyst entered into rebate‑heavy agreements that lowered the net price to roughly $100 k–$150 k for many payers; the headline list price remained high but the effective cost dropped. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the rare‑disease pricing debate, illustrating how orphan‑drug incentives can clash with market realities; the subsequent price‑adjustments, policy ripples, and eventual generic entry make it a case study of lasting relevance.
