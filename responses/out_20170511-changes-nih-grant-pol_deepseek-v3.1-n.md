# Changes in NIH Grant Policy? (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 article discusses proposed NIH funding policy changes, particularly focusing on a "Grant Support Index" (GSI) cap that would limit any single principal investigator to the equivalent of approximately 3 R01 grants (a cap of 21 GSI points). The policy aimed to broaden and diversify NIH's researcher support by creating more opportunities for early-stage and mid-career investigators, while also addressing concerns about the concentration of funding among established researchers. 

The author expresses significant skepticism about this approach, arguing that the policy represents a move away from merit-based funding. They analyze the NIH's own data presentation about diminishing returns from multiple grants, pointing out what they characterize as misleading graphical representations—specifically noting unusual log scale choices that could distort the apparent relationship between grant number and research impact. The author suggests that labs with multiple grants actually show substantially higher impact than the NIH's presentation implies, and warns that the proposed cap could be arbitrary and counterproductive.
