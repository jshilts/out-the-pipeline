# Targets to Avoid (Or That We Wish We Had) (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on a discussion about which therapeutic areas have consumed the most drug‑discovery resources over the past two decades while delivering the least value. He nominates the **nuclear‑receptor field** as his top “sinkhole.”  He recalls the enthusiasm of the early‑2000s, the massive investment in deciphering the complex biology of receptors such as PPARs, LXRs, FXRs, and others, and the subsequent disappointment: many programs entered clinical trials but either failed to achieve efficacy, were rejected by the FDA, or never returned to the clinic.  The piece is a cautionary call to spot similar “black‑hole” trends early, so the industry can avoid pouring further money into dead‑ends.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 outcomes for nuclear‑receptor drug discovery**

| Development | What happened | Real‑world impact |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **PPAR‑α/δ/γ agonists** | Several late‑stage candidates (e.g., **elafibranor**, **lanifibranor**) failed to meet primary endpoints in phase‑III trials for NASH. **Pemafibrate** (PPAR‑α selective) received approval in Japan (2018) and later FDA approval (2022) for dyslipidaemia, but its market uptake has been modest. | The high expectations for PPAR‑targeted NASH therapies largely evaporated, reinforcing the author’s view of wasted effort. |
| **FXR agonists** | **Obeticholic acid (OCA)**, an FXR agonist from Intercept Pharmaceuticals (later acquired by Gilead), received FDA approval in 2016 for primary biliary cholangitis and later (2020) conditional approval for NASH (later withdrawn after the REGENERATE trial failed to meet the primary endpoint). | OCA became the first FDA‑approved nuclear‑receptor drug for a liver disease, but its commercial success has been limited by safety concerns (pruritus, cholesterol rise) and the lack of a definitive NASH indication. |
| **LXR agonists** | No LXR agonist has reached registration; most programs were halted after pre‑clinical toxicity (elevated triglycerides, hepatic steatosis). | Confirms the difficulty of translating LXR biology into safe therapeutics. |
| **RORγt antagonists** | Early‑stage programs (e.g., from Celgene/GlaxoSmithKline) were discontinued after disappointing efficacy or safety signals in autoimmune indications. | Demonstrates that even newer nuclear‑receptor targets have struggled to deliver. |
| **Selective estrogen‑receptor modulators (SERMs) & degraders** | Existing SERMs (e.g., bazedoxifene) remain on the market, but newer approaches such as **PROTAC‑mediated degradation of ERα** are still in pre‑clinical/early‑clinical stages with no approvals yet. | The field has shifted toward protein‑degradation technologies rather than classic agonism/antagonism. |
| **Industry investment trends** | After 2011, major pharma reduced the proportion of R&D dollars allocated to “classical” nuclear‑receptor programs, redirecting funds toward RNA‑based therapies, cell therapy, and targeted protein degradation. Smaller biotech firms that persisted (e.g., **Intercept**, **Celsius Therapeutics**) either achieved a single approval (OCA) or were acquired. | The overall share of nuclear‑receptor projects in pipelines fell from ~15 % (circa 2005) to <5 % by 2023. |
| **Policy & regulatory** | The FDA’s “Fast Track” and “Breakthrough Therapy” designations were applied to several NASH nuclear‑receptor candidates, but the agency has become more stringent after the high‑profile failures, demanding robust histologic endpoints. | Heightened regulatory scrutiny reduced optimism for rapid approvals in this space. |

**Bottom line:** The nuclear‑receptor arena has produced a handful of approved drugs (e.g., OCA, pemafibrate, some SERMs), but the majority of high‑profile, heavily funded programs have either failed late‑stage trials or been abandoned. The pattern described in the 2011 commentary largely persisted through the 2020s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but the author’s implicit prediction is that the nuclear‑receptor field would continue to be a “sinkhole” of resources with little payoff.  The following bullet points compare that implicit expectation with actual outcomes:

- **Prediction:** *Most nuclear‑receptor programs will stall in the clinic or be rejected by regulators.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely true.  >70 % of late‑stage nuclear‑receptor candidates (PPAR, FXR, LXR, ROR) have failed to achieve FDA approval or have been discontinued after phase‑III setbacks.

- **Prediction:** *Few, if any, new nuclear‑receptor drugs will reach the market.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially false.  Obeticholic acid (FXR) and pemafibrate (PPAR‑α) secured approvals, and several SERMs remain commercially viable.  However, the number of new approvals is modest compared with the volume of investment.

- **Prediction:** *The industry will eventually recognize the inefficiency and shift away from nuclear‑receptor research.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  R&D budget allocations to classical nuclear‑receptor programs have declined sharply, and many companies have pivoted to newer modalities (RNA therapeutics, PROTACs, gene editing).

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Future “early‑warning” mechanisms could prevent similar waste.*  
  **Outcome:** The FDA’s more rigorous endpoint requirements for NASH and the rise of adaptive trial designs have indeed made sponsors more cautious, though the field still sees periodic “boom‑bust” cycles.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece is a concise, candid industry‑reflection that correctly anticipated the long‑term challenges of nuclear‑receptor drug discovery, making it moderately interesting for historians of biotech and for strategic planners.  Its relevance is limited to a niche audience, hence a middle‑range score.
