# A Med-Chem Book Recommendation (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article is a book recommendation for "Drug-like Properties: Concepts, Structure Design and Methods: from ADME to Toxicity Optimization" (ISBN 0123695201). The author describes it as a comprehensive overview of pharmacokinetic and toxicology optimization issues for practicing medicinal chemists. The book appears to cover both fundamental concepts for those learning the field and advanced topics in ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) and toxicity optimization, presented as essential knowledge for drug discovery professionals.

## 2. HISTORY

The book referenced (Li et al., "Drug-like Properties: Concepts, Structure Design and Methods") became a standard reference text in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery following its publication. ADME-tox optimization has remained a central challenge in drug development through the 2010s and 2020s, with continued high attrition rates in clinical trials often attributed to poor pharmacokinetic properties or unexpected toxicity. The concepts and methods described in the book have persisted as foundational to pharmaceutical research, though the specific computational and experimental tools have evolved (e.g., greater use of AI/ML for property prediction, organ-on-a-chip systems, etc.). The book has maintained relevance in the field, being cited by pharmaceutical scientists and used in training programs. No specific drugs or clinical outcomes can be directly attributed to this book recommendation itself - it is a reference text about established scientific principles rather that about any particular therapeutic breakthrough.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article itself makes no explicit predictions about the future of biotechnology or drug discovery - it is a straightforward book recommendation. The book presumably covers then-current best practices in ADME-tox optimization, but I cannot evaluate its specific predictions or recommendations without access to the book's content or detailed reviews of its accuracy.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a book recommendation post rather than commentary on biotechnology developments or industry trends. While the book itself appears highly relevant to medicinal chemistry, the article provides minimal substantive information beyond the recommendation, making it of very limited interest to general readers.
