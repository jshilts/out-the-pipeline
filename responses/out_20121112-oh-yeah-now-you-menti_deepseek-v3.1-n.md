# Oh Yeah, Now That You Mention It, They're Dead (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 blog post criticized Pluristem Therapeutics for allegedly overhyping stem cell therapy results while failing to disclose patient deaths. The article reported that Pluristem's stock had doubled after three press releases claiming patients' lives had been saved by experimental stem cell injections. However, the company remained silent when two of those patients—including a 7-year-old girl—died four months after treatment, only revealing these deaths after Bloomberg published a critical report. The company raised $34 million in stock sales shortly after the first patient's death without disclosing this information. Pluristem threatened to sue Bloomberg and, in the same press release demanding corrections, revealed that a second patient had also died—information that had not been previously announced. The author characterized this pattern as emblematic of the stem cell field's credibility problems.

## 2. HISTORY

The events described in the article led to significant regulatory scrutiny and lasting consequences for Pluristem and the stem cell therapy field. In 2013, the SEC launched an investigation into Pluristem's disclosures, focusing on whether the company had adequately informed investors about patient outcomes and deaths. The investigation resulted in Pluristem paying a $1.5 million settlement in 2015 without admitting or denying wrongdoing.

Pluristem's flagship therapy, PLX cells (placental expanded cells), continued through clinical development but faced multiple setbacks. The company conducted Phase II/III trials for critical limb ischemia and muscle regeneration, with mixed results. By 2020, none of Pluristem's stem cell therapies had received FDA approval for their initial target indications. The company pivoted toward COVID-19 applications during the pandemic, but these efforts did not result in approved treatments.

The broader stem cell therapy field experienced significant regulatory tightening after this period. In 2014-2015, the FDA began cracking down on clinics offering unproven stem cell therapies, and by 2017, the agency issued more explicit guidance requiring rigorous clinical trials for stem cell products. The FTC also increased enforcement against companies making unsupported health claims about stem cell treatments.

Pluristem's stock performance remained volatile, and the company never regained the market confidence it had in 2012. As of 2024, the broader stem cell therapy field has seen only limited success, with very few FDA-approved stem cell therapies available, mostly for specific blood disorders and immune conditions rather than the broad regenerative applications that were heavily promoted in the early 2010s.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes, instead focusing on describing ongoing problems with disclosure and hype in the stem cell therapy field.

## 4. INTEREST

Score: 7/9

This article captured a critical moment exposing systemic problems in stem cell therapy commercialization, highlighting the tension between investor communications and scientific transparency. The case exemplifies broader regulatory challenges that shaped FDA policy toward cellular therapies in subsequent years.
