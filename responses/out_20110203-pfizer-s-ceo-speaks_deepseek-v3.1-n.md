# Article: Pfizer's CEO Speaks (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary critiques a Q&A with Pfizer's new CEO Ian Read, who was explaining the company's decision to cut R&D spending while claiming it would make the organization more innovative. The author focuses specifically on Read's analysis of the Exubera failure—an inhaled insulin product that Pfizer spent years developing before it commercialized and then bombed in the market. Read attributed this failure to a lack of accountability, with projects being passed between teams without proper readiness requirements. The author disputes this explanation, arguing that the real problems were psychological factors including groupthink, self-deception, and a culture where speaking against popular trends carried too-high penalties. The author suggests that Read's proposed accountability approach ("coming down on anyone who screws up") could worsen rather than improve these underlying cultural issues, and notes that the company had recently reduced severance packages for laid-off researchers.

## 2. HISTORY

**Exubera Post-Mortem & Inhaled Insulin Market:**
After Exubera's commercial failure and withdrawal in 2007 (Pfizer took a $2.8 billion write-off), the inhaled insulin concept largely collapsed. MannKind Corporation's Afrezza, another inhaled insulin product, faced repeated FDA rejections and finally gained approval in 2014—nearly a decade after Exubera's failure. However, Afrezza achieved only minimal market penetration, capturing well under 1% of the insulin market by the late 2010s. The fundamental barriers remained: patient reluctance to use inhalers, physician preference for injections, higher costs, and questions about long-term pulmonary safety. No significant new inhaled insulin programs reached late-stage development after 2011.

**Pfizer's Strategic Direction Under Read:**
Ian Read's tenure as CEO (2011-2018) indeed emphasized cost-cutting and restructuring over internal R&D growth. During this period:
- Pfizer reduced its R&D workforce significantly and closed multiple research sites
- The company pursued major acquisitions, most notably the attempted $160 billion acquisition of AstraZeneca in 2014 (failed due to political opposition) and the $14 billion acquisition of Medivation in 2016
- Pfizer spun off its animal health division as Zoetis in 2013 and its consumer healthcare business in 2019
- The approach shifted heavily toward buying innovation rather than building it internally

**Clinical and Commercial Outcomes:**
During Read's tenure, Pfizer had some notable successes (Ibrance for breast cancer, Eliquis for stroke prevention) but also significant late-stage failures. The company's pipeline productivity remained a persistent challenge. The accountability-focused approach led to more aggressive pipeline pruning—terminating unpromising programs earlier—but didn't fundamentally solve the underlying productivity problem. By the time Read stepped down in 2018, Pfizer's R&D productivity remained below industry averages.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Company Implicit Prediction:** "Cutting R&D and increasing accountability will make Pfizer more innovative" - This proved largely incorrect. While cost reductions were achieved, innovation productivity didn't substantially improve. Through the 2010s, Pfizer continued to rely heavily on acquisitions for growth and blockbuster drugs, with most internally developed successes coming from programs that predated the 2011 restructuring.

• **Author's Skeptical Prediction:** That Read's accountability approach "isn't going to help with groupthink and self-deception" and "might even make them worse" - This proved partially correct. The fear-based accountability culture did not eliminate groupthink; instead, it may have shifted it toward risk-aversion. Decision-making became more conservative, with a preference for acquisitions over bold internal innovation bets—which some analysts argued reduced exposure to big failures but also to breakthrough successes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides valuable but narrow insight into pharmaceutical R&D culture and highlights important questions about whether accountability systems alone can fix innovation problems. Its relevance focuses mainly on Pfizer's internal dynamics rather than broader biotechnology trends.
