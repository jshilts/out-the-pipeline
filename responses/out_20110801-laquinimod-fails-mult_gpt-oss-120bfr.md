# Laquinimod Fails For Multiple Sclerosis (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that Teva Pharmaceuticals’ oral multiple‑sclerosis (MS) drug laquinimod had missed the primary endpoint of reducing relapse rates in a pivotal Phase III trial. Earlier in 2011 the company had promoted the compound as safe, effective, and a potential market‑changing therapy, but the new data suggested otherwise. The piece reminded readers that laquinimod is a derivative of roquinimex, a drug that was abandoned a decade earlier because of serious cardiovascular toxicity. The author concluded that, given the trial failure, laquinimod was “dead” or at best destined to have negligible market impact, and used the setback to comment on Teva’s broader push from generics into innovative drug development.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Clinical development after 2011**  
* **Phase III “CONCERTO” (2014‑2015).** A second large trial in relapsing‑remitting MS (RRMS) again failed to meet its primary endpoint of reducing confirmed disability progression, although it showed modest effects on MRI lesion counts.  
* **Regulatory outcome.** In 2015 Teva announced it would **discontinue development of laquinimod for MS** in the United States and Europe, citing the lack of a clear efficacy signal and an unfavorable risk‑benefit profile. No regulatory agency ever granted marketing approval for the indication.  

**Shift to other diseases**  
* **Huntington’s disease (HD).** Laquinimod entered a Phase II trial (the “LEGATO‑HD” study) in 2015‑2017. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing functional decline, and development for HD was halted in 2018.  
* **Other neuro‑inflammatory/degenerative indications.** Small exploratory studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ulcerative colitis were conducted, but none progressed beyond early‑phase testing.  

**Commercial landscape of oral MS therapies**  
While laquinimod stalled, several oral agents that were already on the market or in late development succeeded:  
* **Fingolimod (Gilenya, 2010)** and **dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, 2013)** became widely prescribed first‑line oral DMTs.  
* **Teriflunomide (Aubagio, 2012)** and later **siponimod (Mayzent, 2019)** added to the oral armamentarium.  

**Teva’s broader R&D trajectory**  
The laquinimod failure was one of several high‑profile setbacks for Teva’s innovative pipeline in the 2010s. The company refocused on biosimilars and generic expansion, and in 2020‑2021 sold or licensed several of its experimental assets to smaller biotech firms. Laquinimod was among the assets transferred (the rights were sold to **Mundipharma** in 2020 for non‑MS indications), but no further major clinical programs have been announced as of early 2026.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“the compound is dead… destined to never make much of an impact in the market.”*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Laquinimod never received regulatory approval for MS, and Teva halted its development in 2015.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Safety concerns from the roquinimex predecessor might resurface.*  
  **Outcome:** Laquinimod showed a relatively clean safety profile in trials (no major cardiovascular events), but safety alone could not compensate for insufficient efficacy.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Teva’s move into innovative drugs could be a shock if a compound fails.*  
  **Outcome:** The laquinimod failure, together with other pipeline disappointments (e.g., the anti‑IL‑17 antibody brodalumab for psoriasis), underscored the risk of Teva’s R&D push and contributed to a strategic shift back toward generics and biosimilars.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in MS drug development and illustrates the challenges of translating promising early data into approved therapies; however, the story ended without a lasting clinical or commercial legacy, limiting its long‑term impact.
