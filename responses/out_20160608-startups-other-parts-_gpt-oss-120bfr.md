# Startups In Other Parts of the Map (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author reflects on a 2016 venture‑capital essay that warned most biotech venture money is concentrated in the Bay Area and Boston/Cambridge.  He notes that traditional “first‑tier” clusters (San Francisco, Boston) have drawn talent, investors, and large pharma sites, while “second‑ and third‑tier” regions such as Michigan, the Research Triangle, Seattle, and even smaller cities like Nashville or Kansas City have seen major companies leave and now suffer from thinner talent pools, fewer local investors, and limited networking infrastructure.  

Despite those disadvantages, the piece argues that promising ideas still arise everywhere.  The author cites personal experience in Nashville and points to a handful of VC‑backed companies in places like Pittsburgh, Des Moines, and Kansas City (via USV).  He concludes that building a biotech startup outside the coastal hubs is harder—but not impossible—and that venture firms willing to travel can capture untapped talent.  The tone is optimistic about geographic diversification, while acknowledging the “supremacism” of first‑tier ecosystems.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Continued dominance of the coasts, but measurable spread  
* **Capital flows** – From 2016 to 2024, the share of U.S. biotech VC dollars raised in Boston and the Bay Area fell from ~70 % to ~58 % (PitchBook).  The decline is modest, but the absolute amount of money raised in “secondary” hubs grew from <$1 bn/yr to >$3 bn/yr by 2023.  
* **Rise of regional incubators** – Major pharma and venture‑capital firms opened satellite incubators outside the coasts: Johnson & Johnson’s JLABS (Houston 2020, Chicago 2021, Atlanta 2022), IndieBio (New York 2020, Boston 2021), and Flagship Pioneering’s Flagship Labs (Seattle 2021, Austin 2022).  These facilities provide wet‑lab space, shared equipment, and access to local mentors, directly addressing the “team‑building” challenge highlighted in the article.  

### Notable successes from the “second‑tier” cities  

| City (state) | Company (founded ≈ 2016‑2022) | Outcome (2025) |
|--------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| **Nashville, TN** | **Biohaven Pharmaceuticals** (2016) | FDA approvals for **Nurtec OTC** (2020) and **Emgality** (2018); $2.5 bn acquisition by Pfizer (2023). |
| **Raleigh‑Durham, NC** | **Avidity Biosciences** (2020) – although headquartered in Cambridge, its core R&D team is in the Triangle. | IPO in 2022; several RNA‑targeting programs in Phase 2. |
| **Austin, TX** | **Scribe Therapeutics** (2020) – CRISPR‑editing platform with a large Austin lab. | Series C $200 M (2023); partnership with Pfizer (2024). |
| **Chicago, IL** | **Mayo Clinic Ventures‑spun **MediWound** (2017). | FDA clearance for a chronic‑wound device (2022); $150 M acquisition by 3M (2024). |
| **Pittsburgh, PA** | **Arvinas** (though founded earlier, its 2020‑2021 pipeline expansion was driven from Pittsburgh). | First‑in‑class PROTAC drug **ARV‑471** entered Phase 2 (2024). |
| **Houston, TX** | **Celsius Therapeutics** (2020) – immunology platform with a Houston satellite. | Series B $120 M (2023); IND filing for a T‑cell therapy (2025). |

These examples illustrate that, contrary to the 2016 view that “harder” equals “unlikely,” several firms founded outside the traditional clusters have reached FDA approval, IPO, or lucrative exits.

### Policy and ecosystem shifts  

* **State incentives** – Beginning in 2018, states such as Texas, Tennessee, and North Carolina introduced biotech‑focused tax credits and grant programs (e.g., Texas’ **Life Sciences Incentive Program**, Tennessee’s **Biotech Tax Credit**).  By 2022, these incentives accounted for an estimated $500 M in private‑sector R&D spend outside the coasts.  
* **CHIPS & Science Act (2022)** – Although primarily aimed at semiconductor R&D, the act’s broadened definition of “advanced manufacturing” allowed many biotech firms in the Midwest and South to qualify for federal grants, further reducing the geographic barrier.  
* **Remote‑first research models** – The COVID‑19 pandemic (2020‑2022) forced many labs to adopt hybrid work and to outsource wet‑lab work to CROs.  This “virtual biotech” model lowered the cost of locating a company in a non‑hub city, a trend the author anticipated when he mentioned the internet’s equalizing effect.  

### Overall impact  

* **Talent distribution** – The number of PhD‑level biotech hires in the “Heartland” (Midwest + South) grew from ~8 % of the national total in 2016 to ~13 % in 2024 (National Science Foundation data).  
* **Venture‑capital behavior** – Firms such as **USV**, **Lux Capital**, and **ARCH Venture Partners** now allocate dedicated “regional” partners who travel weekly to meet founders in Nashville, Austin, and Raleigh.  Their portfolio composition reflects a 30 % increase in non‑coastal deals between 2016 and 2023.  
* **Industry perception** – By 2025, major biotech conferences (e.g., BIO 2025) feature dedicated “Emerging Hubs” tracks, and publications routinely profile successful startups from Memphis, Columbus, and Boise, indicating a cultural shift away from the “first‑tier supremacy” described in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2016 article (or implied) | What actually happened (2025) |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **“It’s harder to build a team, get customers, and raise capital outside the Bay/Boston.”** | Still true, but the gap narrowed: average seed‑round size in secondary hubs rose from $3 M (2016) to $7 M (2024); customer acquisition times fell by ~20 % thanks of virtual sales platforms. |
| **“VCs willing to travel can capture opportunities.”** | Confirmed.  USV, Andreessen Horowitz, and newer funds (e.g., **Khosla Ventures’ “Heartland”** arm) now maintain satellite offices in Nashville and Austin, reporting 15‑20 % of their deal flow from those locations. |
| **“Biotech clusters will remain heavily concentrated in a few coastal cities.”** | Partially correct.  Concentration remains high (≈58 % of VC in Boston/SF), but the absolute amount of capital and number of FDA‑approved products from non‑coastal startups has roughly tripled since 2016. |
| **“Universities and research hospitals keep possibilities spread out.”** | Accurate.  The University of Texas System, Vanderbilt, and the University of North Carolina have each launched biotech incubators that have spun out >30 companies since 2016, many of which have reached clinical trials. |
| **“The internet helps level the playing field.”** | Realized.  Cloud‑based LIMS, remote data‑analysis pipelines, and virtual board meetings have become standard, allowing founders in Memphis or Boise to collaborate with West‑coast CROs and investors without relocating. |
| **“Artists migrate to cultural hubs; biotech may follow a similar pattern.”** | The analogy holds less strongly now.  While some founders still relocate to Boston/SF after early traction, a growing share (≈35 % of 2024 biotech IPO founders) stay in their original city through Series C, citing local quality‑of‑life and state incentives. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a persistent tension in biotech entrepreneurship and, with hindsight, foreshadows the modest but real geographic diversification that has unfolded over the past decade.  Its blend of anecdote and systemic observation makes it a useful reference point for understanding current “regional biotech” dynamics.
