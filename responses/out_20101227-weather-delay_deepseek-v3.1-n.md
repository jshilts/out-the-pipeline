# Weather Delay (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a brief personal blog post written during the winter holiday period in December 2010. The author describes being snowed in during a severe winter storm that dropped 1-2 feet of snow with 40 mile-per-hour winds. The author's company was closed for the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's, which proved fortunate given the weather conditions. Rather than attempting to commute, the author spent time at home with family, teaching children table tennis and playing Mario Kart. The post also mentions cooking comfort foods - French onion soup and chicken pot pie - as appropriate responses to the winter weather.

## 2. HISTORY
This blog post was published on December 27, 2010, during a period when many businesses traditionally close for winter holidays. Subsequent research indicates this was a personal lifestyle blog post with no scientific, biotechnological, or business implications to track. The post contains no references to biotechnology companies, drug development, scientific research, or policy matters. It was simply a personal account of weather-related downtime during holiday closure. As such, there are no subsequent developments to report regarding drug approvals, clinical trials, business growth/failures, or policy changes stemming from this content.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made no predictions about biotechnology, scientific developments, or future events. It was entirely descriptive of present circumstances during a winter storm with no forward-looking statements about technology, medicine, or business trends.
