# GSK and Alli. Not Quite Working Out (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 Bnet commentary noted that GlaxoSmithKline’s over‑the‑counter (OTC) weight‑loss drug **Alli** (the low‑dose, OTC version of the prescription drug orlistat) was under‑performing.  The author pointed out that sales had fallen for two consecutive years and that the company’s public statements gave little insight into actual revenue.  The piece also mentioned that GSK’s CEO, Andrew Witty, had hinted at “interest from outside buyers” for the Alli franchise, suggesting that GSK might eventually divest the product.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Continued modest sales (2011‑2020).**  GSK kept Alli on the U.S. market, but annual U.S. OTC sales never approached the multi‑hundred‑million‑dollar levels that were once projected.  Market research firms reported that Alli’s U.S. sales hovered in the low‑tens‑of‑millions of dollars per year, far below the $300 M‑plus peak of the prescription version (Xenical) in the early 2000s.  

- **Shift in the weight‑loss landscape.**  Beginning around 2017, GLP‑1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide (Saxenda) and, later, semaglutide (Wegovy) entered the obesity‑treatment market with markedly higher efficacy and better patient adherence.  These drugs captured most of the growth in the pharmaceutical obesity segment, further marginalising low‑efficacy, side‑effect‑prone products like orlistat.  

- **Corporate restructuring.**  GSK did not sell Alli as a stand‑alone asset.  Instead, the drug remained within GSK’s Consumer Healthcare division.  In 2022 GSK spun off this division as the independent company **Haleon plc**; the spin‑off transferred all OTC brands—including Alli—away from GSK’s core pharmaceutical business.  Haleon continues to market Alli in the U.S. and several other markets, but the product remains a niche, low‑volume offering.  

- **Regulatory and safety profile.**  No new indications or major formulation changes for orlistat were approved after 2011.  The safety warnings about gastrointestinal side effects and the requirement to take a multivitamin with a fat‑soluble vitamin supplement remained unchanged, limiting broader consumer uptake.  

- **No major corporate transactions involving Alli alone.**  The only “sale” of the franchise was the 2022 consumer‑health spin‑off, which transferred ownership to Haleon rather than a third‑party buyer specifically targeting the weight‑loss segment.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *GSK would find an external buyer for the Alli franchise.*  
  **Outcome:** The franchise was not sold to an external party; it stayed within GSK until the 2022 consumer‑health spin‑off, after which it became part of Haleon.  The prediction was only partially realized (the asset left GSK, but not via a targeted sale).  

- **Prediction:** *Alli’s sales were declining and the product was unlikely to become a major revenue driver.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate.  Sales continued to be modest and never rebounded to earlier expectations.  The product remained a small‑volume OTC brand.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *The weight‑loss market would evolve, potentially making Alli less relevant.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct.  The introduction and rapid uptake of GLP‑1 agonists dramatically reshaped the market, pushing orlistat into a peripheral role.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  
The article captures a real‑world commercial challenge for a legacy OTC drug, but the subsequent developments were relatively uneventful beyond a corporate spin‑off, limiting long‑term strategic impact.
