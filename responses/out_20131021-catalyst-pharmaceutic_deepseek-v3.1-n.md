# Catalyst Pharmaceuticals And Their Business Plan (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines Catalyst Pharmaceuticals' strategy of developing Firdapse for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), a rare neuromuscular disorder. The key issue identified is that Firdapse is essentially the same compound as 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP), which was already being supplied free of charge to patients by Jacobus Pharmaceuticals under compassionate-use protocols. The author criticizes Catalyst for exploiting the FDA's orphan drug incentives - running minimal trials on an existing, established compound and planning to charge high prices for what patients already received for free. The piece contrasts this with genuine drug development like Biogen's Tecfidera, where the company bore discovery risks and development costs. Jacobus Pharmaceuticals was reportedly running their own trial to maintain market exclusivity and continue providing the drug at no cost to patients.

## 2. HISTORY

**FDA Approval and Market Reality:**
- Catalyst Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for Firdapse (amifampridine) for LEMS in November 2018
- The drug launched with a list price of approximately $375,000 per year, generating significant controversy
- In 2019, a lawsuit was filed against Catalyst alleging anticompetitive practices
- The FDA approved Jacobus Pharmaceutical's Ruzurgi (also amifampridine) for pediatric LEMS in May 2019, creating competition

**Clinical and Commercial Outcomes:**
- Firdapse demonstrated efficacy consistent with the long-established use of DAP in clinical practice
- The drug achieved substantial revenue growth, with Catalyst reporting $163.7 million in Firdapse net revenue in 2021 and $114.4 million in the first half of 2022
- Catalyst expanded Firdapse development into other rare neuromuscular conditions including congenital myasthenic syndromes
- The company faced multiple lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over pricing and market practices

**Market Dynamics and Access:**
- The approval triggered debates about orphan drug policy reform
- Patient access issues emerged due to the dramatic price increase from free to six-figure annual costs
- Insurance coverage disputes became common for LEMS patients
- The situation highlighted broader concerns about pharmaceutical companies acquiring rights to existing treatments and implementing massive price increases

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Jacobus would win market exclusivity to maintain free supply:** The article suggested Jacobus might complete trials first and prevent Catalyst's market entry. **Reality:** While Jacobus received approval for Ruzurgi in 2019, Catalyst's Firdapse reached market first (2018) and secured dominant market position.

• **The patient community would resist Catalyst's trials:** The article indicated LEMS patients would refuse to participate in Catalyst's studies. **Reality:** Catalyst successfully completed clinical trials and received FDA approval, suggesting adequate trial participation was achieved despite community concerns.

• **Industry indifference would continue:** The author predicted established pharmaceutical companies wouldn't challenge Catalyst's approach to avoid questioning drug pricing flexibility. **Reality:** This largely proved accurate; no major industry opposition emerged, though the case did spur broader policy discussions about orphan drug reform.

• **Pricing strategy risks regulatory backlash:** The article warned that exploitative pricing could lead to government intervention. **Reality:** While no direct federal price controls resulted, the case contributed to ongoing policy debates about drug pricing transparency and orphan drug reform, with multiple legislative proposals emerging in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article presciently identified a critical flaw in orphan drug policy that would become increasingly significant, making it highly relevant to ongoing healthcare policy debates about drug pricing and regulatory incentives.
