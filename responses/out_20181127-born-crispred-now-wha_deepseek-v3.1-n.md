# "Born CRISPRed. Now What?" (Nov 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the breaking news that He Jiankui, a researcher from Shenzhen's Southern University of Science and Technology, claimed to have used CRISPR-Cas9 to genetically edit human embryos that were then implanted and brought to term, resulting in the birth of twin girls with the CCR5 (HIV co-receptor) gene knocked out. The babies were reportedly born to an HIV-positive father. The work was conducted off-site while He was on unpaid leave, and his own university denounced the experiment as a serious violation of academic ethics. More than 100 prominent Chinese researchers publicly condemned the work, and questions arose about informed consent and forged paperwork.

George Church stated he had seen sequencing data supporting He's claims. The article questions the choice of CCR5 as the target—not a life-or-death necessity—and highlights major safety concerns about off-target effects and unknown long-term consequences of germline editing in humans. The author concludes that while human genome editing will eventually happen, this experiment was premature and ethically indefensible, potentially damaging the entire field's credibility.

## 2. HISTORY

**Verification and Consequences:**

- In January 2019, Chinese authorities confirmed the birth of the twin girls and announced that a third CRISPR-edited baby was also born. Independent genome analysis by scientists later confirmed the edits were real, showing a complex and incomplete modification—not the clean deletion initially reported.

- He Jiankui was arrested and, in December 2019, sentenced by a Chinese court to three years in prison and fined \$430,000 for conducting "illegal medical practices." His collaborators received lesser sentences. He was released in 2022.

**Scientific and Ethical Responses:**

- Major international bodies condemned the work. The WHO established a global registry for human genome editing research and issued clear guidelines emphasizing that germline editing should not proceed without broad societal consensus and robust safety data.

- The U.S. National Academies and UK's Royal Society reiterated that heritable human genome editing remains unacceptable until rigorous oversight and safety thresholds are established.

- Multiple countries strengthened regulations or enacted moratoria on germline editing, including Germany, France, and Japan.

**Clinical and Research Impact:**

- No other live births from CRISPR-edited embryos have been publicly reported since the 2018 incident. Most legitimate research has focused on correcting lethal genetic diseases (like sickle cell anemia or beta-thalassemia) in somatic cells, not germline modifications.

- The biotech sector distanced itself from the controversy, emphasizing somatic (non-heritable) applications of CRISPR, which have advanced significantly. FDA-approved CRISPR therapies like Casgevy (for sickle cell disease) treat the patient without affecting future generations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction:** The article questioned whether CCR5 deletion was harmless, noting potential increased susceptibility to other viral infections.
  - **Outcome:** In 2019, a study by Wei and Nielsen showed that CCR5-delta32 homozygosity is associated with increased mortality risk over a lifetime, suggesting the edit might not be benign. However, this remains debated in scientific literature. Long-term health data on the edited children has not been made public, so the full consequences remain unknown.

- **Prediction:** The article expressed concern that the "first human embryo corrections would be for something fatal," rather than for HIV prevention in low-risk scenarios.
  - **Outcome:** Subsequent global policy and scientific consensus have aligned with this view. The Nuffield Council, NASEM, and other bodies have prioritized a harm-reduction ethics framework, arguing that germline edits should only target serious monogenic diseases when no alternatives exist. No approved therapies use CCR5 targets for any indication.

- **Prediction:** The author warned that the experiment would "make life more complicated for everyone working in the field" and risk a public backlash hampering legitimate research.
  - **Outcome:** This proved accurate. The scandal triggered immediate calls for moratoria and tighter oversight worldwide. While somatic CRISPR therapies progressed (with the first U.S. approval in 2019 for sickle cell disease trials and full approval in 2023), germline editing remains largely stalled and highly stigmatized. Public trust in gene-editing technology decreased, and many researchers reported increased regulatory hurdles. The fundamental ethical debate intensified, slowing progress toward sanctioned clinical applications.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in biotechnology history—the first confirmed heritable human genome editing—an event that continues to shape scientific policy, ethics debates, and technical progress in gene editing.
