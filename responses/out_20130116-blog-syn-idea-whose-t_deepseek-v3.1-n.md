# Blog Syn: An Idea Whose Time Has Come? (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article describes a new community initiative called "Blog Syn" led by chemistry blogger See Arr Oh, which aimed to independently reproduce and verify the results of newly published chemical reactions from peer-reviewed literature. The author highlights the first test case: an unusual iron-sulfur reaction published in JACS that claimed to generate benz-azoles in one pot from active methyl groups. Blog Syn participants completed three independent replication attempts and found that while the reaction did work, it performed less effectively than reported—requiring careful oxygen exclusion and delivering lower yields than claimed. The initiative provided detailed documentation of their reproduction attempts, including spectral data, reagent sources, experiment photos, and invited community nominations for additional reactions to test.

## 2. HISTORY
Blog Syn evolved into a successful crowd-sourced initiative that ran actively through approximately 2013-2016 and generated significant discussion within the chemical community about reproducibility in synthetic chemistry. The project conducted systematic replication studies of dozens of published reactions, building a substantial body of evidence about the gap between published claims and replicable results. Around 2016, some of Blog Syn's organizers and participants became involved with the broader reproducibility movement that culminated in the formation of the **Reproducibility Project in Organic Chemistry (RP-OC)** and connections with organizations like **Elentus Replication Services**.

The issues Blog Syn highlighted gained institutional recognition. Major journals including *Nature* and *Science* began introducing more stringent experimental reporting requirements around 2012-2015. The **ACS (American Chemical Society)** launched initiatives to improve data transparency, and pharmaceutical companies increasingly incorporated independent replication into their workflows due to concerns about published literature reliability. The broader reproducibility crisis discussion in science gained mainstream attention around 2011-2016, with synthetic chemistry being recognized as particularly problematic due to incomplete experimental detail reporting.

While Blog Syn itself appears to have reduced activity after 2017, its documentation remains accessible and its conceptual model influenced subsequent reproducibility platforms and community standards.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **The author anticipated Blog Syn would expand with community contributions**: ✓ **Accurate** - The initiative did attract numerous chemistry bloggers and researchers as contributors, published dozens of replication studies over several years, and maintained active community engagement with nomination processes.

• **Predicted early interest would carry forward**: ✓ **Accurate** - Blog Syn generated sustained engagement throughout 2013-2016, with its findings discussed at conferences, in blog networks, and in publications.

• **Implicit prediction that this approach could address reproducibility gaps**: ✓ **Accurate** - The model proved effective enough that it influenced institutional changes, and related reproducibility initiatives became more prominent in chemistry.

• **Suggested value for the broader chemistry community**: ✓ **Accurate** - The movement expanded beyond blog-based verification into more formal reproducibility projects and influenced journal policies across the chemical literature.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

The piece is highly relevant to the ongoing reproducibility crisis discussion in science. Blog Syn represented an early, practical, community-driven approach to addressing scientific replicability problems in chemistry, and its methods influenced later institutional initiatives.
