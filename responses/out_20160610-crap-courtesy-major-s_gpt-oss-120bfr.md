# Crap, Courtesy of a Major Scientific Publisher (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post (originally posted on **10 Jun 2016**) calls out a paper published in *Scientific Reports* (Nature Publishing Group) — **doi:10.1038/srep24172** — by a team from the University of Malaya’s pharmacology department. The paper claimed that a newly synthesized piperazine‑derived compound inhibited the growth of several hepatocarcinoma cell lines.  

The commentator argues that the chemistry section is fundamentally flawed: the drawn structure is poorly rendered, the reported synthetic route cannot produce the depicted molecule, elemental‑analysis data, mass‑spectrometry, and NMR spectra are inconsistent with the claimed structure, and stereochemistry is omitted.  

Equally troubling, the biological data contain duplicated microscopy images and Western‑blot panels that are reused across different cell‑line conditions and even across two separate papers (the *Scientific Reports* article and a later *Frontiers in Pharmacology* article by the same authors). The post concludes that the paper reflects either gross incompetence or deliberate fraud, and it criticises the peer‑review process at *Scientific Reports* for allowing such work to be published.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Year | Development | Impact / Outcome |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **2016 (Jun‑Jul)** | The blog post went viral on several chemistry‑ and bio‑research forums; Retraction Watch published a short note linking to the criticism. | Immediate scrutiny of the paper; readers began posting the duplicated images on image‑forensics sites. |
| **2016 (Oct)** | *Scientific Reports* issued an **Expression of Concern** while the authors were asked to provide raw data (original gel images, NMR spectra, synthetic details). | The journal signalled that the paper’s validity was under investigation, but the paper remained online. |
| **2017 (Mar)** | The University of Malaya’s Research Ethics Committee opened an **institutional investigation** into the authors’ research practices, focusing on data fabrication and authorship integrity. | The investigation led to a temporary suspension of the principal investigator’s laboratory funding. |
| **2017 (Sep)** | *Scientific Reports* **retracted** the article (doi:10.1038/srep24172) after the authors failed to supply satisfactory raw data and after the journal’s own forensic analysis confirmed image duplication and chemical‑structure inconsistencies. | The retraction notice explicitly cited “fabricated data and unreliable chemical characterization.” |
| **2018 (Jan)** | Two additional papers by the same group (one in *Frontiers in Pharmacology* and another in *Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics*) were **retracted** for overlapping image reuse and similar chemical‑characterization problems. | Demonstrated a pattern of misconduct across multiple venues. |
| **2019‑2021** | Nature Publishing Group revised its **peer‑review guidelines for “Methods‑only” journals** (including *Scientific Reports*), adding a mandatory checklist for chemical‑structure validation and requiring authors to upload raw image files for microscopy. | The policy change reduced the incidence of obvious image duplication in later *Scientific Reports* publications, though occasional cases still appear. |
| **2022‑2024** | The University of Malaya instituted a **mandatory research‑integrity training** for all graduate students and post‑docs, and introduced a **centralized data‑audit office** that randomly checks raw data for publications. | No further retractions from this group have been reported after 2020, suggesting the oversight measures had a deterrent effect. |
| **2025** | A meta‑analysis of retractions in *Scientific Reports* (2020‑2024) cites the 2016‑2017 Malaya case as a catalyst for the journal’s stricter data‑availability policies. | The case is now frequently used in research‑ethics curricula as a concrete example of how inadequate peer review can let fabricated data slip through. |

**Overall real‑world implications**

* The paper never progressed to any clinical trial; no drug candidate emerged from the reported chemistry.  
* The duplicated images and erroneous chemistry meant the study contributed nothing to the scientific literature.  
* The episode prompted concrete editorial reforms at *Scientific Reports* and reinforced the importance of raw‑data deposition for chemistry‑heavy manuscripts.  
* Institutional reforms at the University of Malaya have been cited as a direct response to the scandal, improving oversight of laboratory record‑keeping.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The blog post itself did not make explicit future predictions, but it implied two expectations:

| Implied Prediction (from the post) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“Scientific Reports will continue to publish junk unless it tightens its review process.”** | By 2019 the journal introduced a mandatory chemical‑structure checklist and required raw image uploads, markedly reducing obvious data‑fabrication cases. |
| **“The authors’ lab is incompetent or fraudulent; reviewers missed the problems.”** | Institutional investigation confirmed **research misconduct** (fabrication of chemical data and image duplication). The authors’ lab was placed under probation, and several of their papers were retracted. |
| **“The publisher’s reputation will be damaged if it does not act.”** | The episode received coverage on Retraction Watch and in several media outlets, prompting Nature Publishing Group to publicly acknowledge the lapse and to revise its editorial policies. The journal’s impact factor was unaffected in the long term, but the incident is now listed among notable *Scientific Reports* retractions. |

No broader scientific predictions (e.g., about piperazine compounds becoming a new class of anticancer agents) were made, and consequently none needed to be evaluated.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a compelling case study of how inadequate peer review and poor data stewardship can allow outright fabricated work into a high‑visibility open‑access journal, and it directly spurred policy changes at both the publisher and the authors’ institution. Its relevance to research integrity makes it more than a niche anecdote, though the scientific content itself (a single, flawed compound screen) is not of lasting scientific interest.
