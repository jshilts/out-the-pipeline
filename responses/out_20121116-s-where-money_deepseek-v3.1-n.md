# That's Where The Money Is (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief commentary from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses a financial scandal involving Star Scientific, a small nutritional-supplement company. As detailed by journalist Adam Feuerstein, the company was supposed to receive a $50 million infusion of cash, but only $18 million actually reached the company. The remaining $32 million disappeared through opaque financial arrangements detailed in the fine print of the deal. The article serves as a cautionary tale about how small biotechnology and supplement companies can be exploited through complex financing deals, with the author noting that while such practices are common, this particular case was unusually blatant.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2012 article, Star Scientific's story took several dramatic turns. The company, founded by Jonnie Williams, became centrally involved in a major political scandal in Virginia. It was revealed that Williams had provided gifts and loans to Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his family, leading to federal corruption charges against both McDonnell and his wife in 2014. The company changed its name to Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals in 2013 and shifted focus to developing anatabine citrate, a tobacco-derived compound. Despite claiming therapeutic potential for various conditions, the company faced significant challenges including shareholder lawsuits, FDA warning letters about unsubstantiated health claims, and continued financial difficulties. The company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2019 under the name Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals, marking the end of a troubled trajectory that validated the skepticism expressed in the original 2012 article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this article. The piece was primarily a commentary on an ongoing situation rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: 3/9

While the article highlighted important issues of financial transparency in small biotech/supplement companies, it was primarily reporting on a specific financial scandal rather than broader scientific or industry developments. The subsequent connection to major political corruption adds retrospective interest, but the article itself was a brief commentary piece rather than substantive analysis of biotechnology science or policy.
