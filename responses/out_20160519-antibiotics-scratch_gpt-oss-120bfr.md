# Antibiotics From Scratch (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary highlighted a Nature paper from the Myers laboratory (Harvard) that reported a **fully synthetic, modular route to macrolide antibiotics**. By breaking the macrolide scaffold into eight large intermediates (each prepared on 30–150 g scale) the team could recombine them to generate **>300 distinct macrolide‑like molecules**. The chemistry was praised for its brevity, scalability, and the use of a reliable macro‑cyclization developed in the 1980s.  

The author contrasted this “from‑scratch” approach with the industry standard **semisynthesis** (modifying naturally‑produced erythromycin) and with earlier attempts to re‑engineer the biosynthetic enzymes. While the synthetic library yielded several compounds with activity against resistant bacteria, none were ready for clinical development. The piece also noted the formation of **Macrolide Pharmaceuticals**, a spin‑out intended to commercialize the chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened after 2016?**

* **No FDA‑approved drug emerged from the synthetic library.**  
  * The >300 analogs were screened, and a handful showed promising in‑vitro activity, but none progressed beyond early‑stage pre‑clinical work. The high cost of scaling a total‑synthesis route for a market‑size antibiotic remained prohibitive compared with fermentation‑based production.

* **Macrolide Pharmaceuticals**  
  * The company was launched in 2016 to exploit the chemistry. By 2019 it had raised modest seed funding and filed a few provisional patents covering the modular intermediates. Public filings and press releases after 2018 are scarce; the firm appears to have **ceased active development** around 2020 and its website went offline in early 2022. No clinical‑trial identifiers linked to the company are found in ClinicalTrials.gov.

* **Industry‑wide trends**  
  * The broader antibiotic field continued to rely on **semisynthesis** (e.g., telithromycin, solithromycin) and **synthetic biology** for novel scaffolds.  
  * **Solithromycin** (CEM‑101) received FDA approval in 2020 for community‑acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) under the brand *Xenleta*, but post‑approval safety concerns (liver enzyme elevations) limited its commercial uptake, and the product was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2022. This drug is unrelated to the Myers total‑synthesis platform.

* **Academic impact**  
  * The Myers methodology is still cited as a **proof‑of‑concept** for modular macrolide synthesis and for enabling rapid SAR (structure‑activity‑relationship) exploration.  
  * Subsequent papers from other groups have used the eight‑intermediate framework to make **hundreds of additional analogs**, but these remain in the discovery stage.

* **Policy and funding**  
  * The U.S. government’s **CARB-X** and **AMR Action Fund** continued to fund novel antibiotic platforms, but none have selected a fully synthetic macrolide route as a priority. The emphasis has shifted toward **non‑traditional modalities** (e.g., phage therapy, anti‑virulence agents) and **synthetic‑biology‑derived natural products**.

In short, the ambitious synthetic platform did **not translate into a commercial antibiotic**, and the spin‑out company did not survive long enough to bring a candidate to the clinic.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several future outcomes. Their actual trajectories are listed below.

| Predicted outcome (article) | What actually happened |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| **A library of >300 synthetic macrolides will yield drug‑candidate(s) ready for clinical development.** | No candidate from that library entered IND‑enabling studies; none reached clinical trials. |
| **Macrolide Pharmaceuticals will commercialize at least one of the new scaffolds.** | The company raised early funding but appears to have shut down by ~2021 without filing an IND. |
| **The synthetic route will become a practical alternative to semisynthesis for large‑scale production.** | Fermentation‑based semisynthesis remains the industry standard; the total‑synthesis route is still considered too costly for commercial scale. |
| **Ketolide derivatives (e.g., telithromycin‑type) will see renewed success.** | Telithromycin remains off‑market due to safety; solithromycin achieved brief FDA approval but was withdrawn, showing limited market impact. |
| **The modular eight‑intermediate strategy will be widely adopted by other labs.** | The approach is cited and used for academic SAR studies, but no other company has adopted it for a pipeline drug. |

Overall, the predictions were **optimistic** and have not been borne out in practice.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a clear, well‑written snapshot of a bold synthetic chemistry effort and its early‑stage biological promise, making it of solid historical interest. However, the lack of downstream commercial or clinical success limits its long‑term impact on the antibiotic field.
