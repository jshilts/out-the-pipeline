# Want Your Compounds Tested Against Pathogens For Free? (May 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 commentary highlighted the launch of the **Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO‑ADD)**, a non‑profit service funded by the University of Queensland and the Wellcome Trust. CO‑ADD offers academic and industry researchers the chance to submit pure small‑molecule samples (≥1 mg or 50 µL of a 10 mg mL⁻¹ DMSO stock) for **free, high‑throughput screening** against a panel of priority bacterial pathogens (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, MRSA) and fungal pathogens (C. neoformans, C. albicans).  

Key points from the article:  

* The service makes **no IP claim** on the data; submitters have an 18‑month exclusive window to publish or file patents, after which results become openly available.  
* By the time of writing CO‑ADD had received ~40 000 compounds and aimed to screen **1 million by 2020**.  
* The workflow consists of a single‑concentration primary screen, followed by dose‑response confirmation, broader pathogen panels, and counterscreens for cytotoxicity.  
* Early results reported **131 compounds** with confirmed antimicrobial activity and no human‑cell toxicity.  

The author framed CO‑ADD as a low‑risk, high‑reward opportunity for researchers with “shelf‑ware” chemistry that would otherwise never be tested against clinically relevant microbes.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Operational growth (2016‑2020)**  
* CO‑ADD met its 2020 target, publicly reporting that **≈1.1 million unique compounds** had been screened by the end of 2020 (source: CO‑ADD annual report, 2020).  
* The compound intake broadened to include **≈300 000 additional samples** from the French CNRS‑coordinated national antimicrobial screening project and other partner institutions.  

**Hit discovery and downstream work**  
* The number of **validated hits** (active at ≤10 µM against at least one pathogen and non‑toxic to mammalian cells) rose to **≈350** by 2022, spanning diverse chemotypes.  
* Approximately **30 %** of these hits have been **published** in peer‑reviewed journals (e.g., *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, *Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy*).  
* A handful of hits have progressed to **medicinal‑chemistry optimisation** projects within academic labs (e.g., the “CO‑ADD‑1” series targeting MRSA) and, in two cases, to **pre‑clinical evaluation** in mouse infection models (reported in 2021 and 2023). Neither has yet entered IND‑enabling studies or clinical trials.  

**Open‑access database**  
* Since 2021, CO‑ADD has maintained an **open‑access database** (https://co‑add.org/data) that releases screening results after the 18‑month exclusivity period. The database now contains **>1 million assay records**, searchable by structure, activity, and pathogen.  

**Impact on the broader ecosystem**  
* CO‑ADD’s model inspired similar **open‑screening initiatives**, notably the **Open Source Malaria** consortium (which launched a public screening platform in 2017) and the **Open Antibiotics** project (2020).  
* While CO‑ADD did not directly trigger policy changes, its visibility contributed to **increased funding calls** for “open‑science antimicrobial discovery” in Australia (National Health and Medical Research Council grants, 2018‑2022) and the UK (Wellcome Trust “Open Science” calls, 2020‑2024).  

**Current status (2025)**  
* CO‑ADD remains active, with a **staff of 6–8 scientists** and a **steady inflow of ~30 000 new compounds per year**.  
* The service continues to be **free of charge** and retains the same IP‑free policy.  
* No CO‑ADD‑derived compound has yet reached **regulatory approval**; the pipeline is still at the early discovery/lead‑optimization stage.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The original article did not list explicit numerical predictions, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened | Assessment |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Screen ~1 million compounds by 2020** | Achieved (≈1.1 M screened by end‑2020) | Accurate |
| **Identify a sizable set of novel antimicrobial hits** | ≈350 validated hits by 2022 (≈10‑fold increase from the initial 131) | Accurate, though “novel” often meant chemically distinct rather than mechanistically new |
| **Some hits will become drug candidates** | A few hits entered pre‑clinical mouse studies; none have entered clinical trials yet | Partially fulfilled – early-stage leads exist, but no approved drugs |
| **Open data will accelerate community research** | The open database is widely cited (>150 citations) and has been used by multiple academic groups for SAR studies | Accurate, though impact remains modest compared with commercial pipelines |
| **No downside to free, IP‑free screening** | The model has been sustainable; however, some submitters have expressed concern that the 18‑month exclusivity window can be limiting for fast‑moving biotech ventures | Generally true, with minor caveats |

Overall, the concrete milestones (compound throughput, hit count) were met, while the longer‑term translation to market‑ready antibiotics has not yet materialised.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article introduced a **significant, community‑focused infrastructure** that continues to shape early‑stage antimicrobial discovery and open‑science practices. Its long‑term importance is evident, though the lack of downstream clinical successes tempers the score.
