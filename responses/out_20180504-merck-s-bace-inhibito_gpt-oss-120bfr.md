# Merck's BACE‑Inhibitor Alzheimer's Wipeout (May 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports the termination of Merck’s Phase III trial of the BACE‑1 inhibitor verubecestat (MK‑8931) for symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. Two dose arms (12 mg and 40 mg) showed no improvement on the ADAS‑Cog or ADAS‑ADL scales, regardless of baseline disease severity or APOE4 genotype. Biomarker data confirmed robust target engagement: CSF Aβ40, Aβ42, and APP‑β were reduced by ~70 %, and amyloid PET signal fell markedly. Despite this biochemical success, clinical outcomes were flat, and several adverse events (falls, weight loss, sleep disturbance, hair‑color change, and mild suicidal ideation) increased in a dose‑responsive manner. The authors conclude that the “amyloid‑lowering = clinical benefit” hypothesis is unsupported and warn that ongoing BACE‑inhibitor programs may be doomed.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2018 developments of verubecestat and other BACE inhibitors**

| Year | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **2017** | Merck’s Phase III “EPOCH” trial (mild‑to‑moderate AD) stopped for futility (NEJM paper). | No cognitive benefit; trial halted. |
| **2018** | Merck initiated a Phase II/III trial (“APECS”) in prodromal AD. | Interim analyses showed no slowing of decline; trial stopped in 2019. |
| **2019** | Merck formally discontinued all verubecestat development. | No further clinical programs. |
| **2018** | Eli Lilly’s BACE‑1 inhibitor lanabecestat (AZD3293) failed in two Phase III studies (AMARANTH and DAYBREAK‑ALZ). | No cognitive benefit; development halted. |
| **2019** | Janssen’s atabecestat (JNJ‑54861911) stopped after Phase II due to safety concerns (brain atrophy, cognitive worsening). | Program terminated. |
| **2019** | Biogen’s umibecestat (CNP520) discontinued after Phase II showed no efficacy and dose‑related brain volume loss. | Program terminated. |
| **2020‑2024** | No major pharma maintains a BACE‑inhibitor program in late‑stage AD trials. The field shifted toward anti‑amyloid antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab) and non‑amyloid targets (tau, neuroinflammation). | BACE inhibitors are now considered a largely abandoned therapeutic class for AD. |
| **2023‑2024** | Post‑mortem and imaging analyses of the BACE trials consistently reported accelerated brain atrophy and, in some cases, subtle cognitive worsening in treated arms, reinforcing safety concerns. | Reinforced the consensus that BACE inhibition at the doses needed for amyloid reduction is not clinically viable. |

**Impact on the broader Alzheimer’s research landscape**

* The verubecestat failure, together with the subsequent collapse of other BACE programs, marked a decisive shift away from small‑molecule BACE inhibition as a viable strategy.  
* Funding and talent moved toward immunotherapy (monoclonal antibodies) and toward upstream prevention trials (e.g., anti‑tau, lifestyle interventions).  
* Regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) have not required any specific “amyloid‑clearance” biomarker thresholds for approval, reflecting the diminished confidence in amyloid‑lowering as a surrogate endpoint.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several predictions; their factual status is listed below.

- **Prediction:** *“If you weren’t pessimistic about BACE trials before this trial, you should be now.”*  
  **Reality:** Accurate. Within two years, all major BACE programs were terminated, and no new late‑stage BACE trials have been launched.

- **Prediction:** *“The hypothesis that reducing cerebral amyloid is beneficial is wrong.”*  
  **Reality:** Partially correct for BACE‑mediated amyloid reduction. While later anti‑amyloid antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab) have shown modest slowing of decline, the specific mechanism of BACE inhibition (large, chronic reduction of Aβ production) has not translated into clinical benefit and appears to cause off‑target neurotoxicity.

- **Prediction:** *“Adverse events were dose‑responsive and included falls, weight loss, sleep disturbance, hair‑color change, and suicidal ideation.”*  
  **Reality:** Confirmed. Subsequent safety reports from verubecestat and other BACE inhibitors documented higher rates of falls, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric events, as well as unexpected dermatologic changes (e.g., hair‑color). These safety signals contributed to trial stoppages.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *“BACE clinical trials going on will likely fail.”*  
  **Reality:** Accurate. Every other BACE inhibitor in Phase III or late Phase II failed or was discontinued for safety/efficacy reasons.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captured a pivotal moment when a major therapeutic class (BACE inhibitors) collapsed, influencing the strategic direction of Alzheimer’s drug development for years to come. Its relevance is high, though the piece is a brief commentary rather than a deep analysis, hence a solid but not top‑tier score.
