# The West Virginia Formaldehyde Claim Is Nonsense (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes claims made about formaldehyde being found in Charleston, West Virginia's water supply following a January 2014 chemical spill of 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (4-MCHM) into the Elk River. The author, a chemist, systematically debunks multiple aspects of these claims through chemical analysis and source investigation.

The core arguments are: (1) The compound 4-MCHM cannot break down into methanol and methylcyclohexane under normal environmental conditions, contrary to claims in a lawsuit that treated the chemical name as describing a mixture; (2) The measured formaldehyde levels (approximately 30 ng/mL) are comparable to natural levels found in tomatoes and oranges, well within normal human metabolic levels, and below regulatory concern; (3) The formaldehyde testing was conducted by Dr. Scott Simonton, who was being paid by the Thompson and Barney law firm—the same firm that filed the lawsuit containing the chemical misunderstanding; (4) The water sample came from the Vandalia Grille, whose owners were defendants in that lawsuit.

The author characterizes the claims as "irresponsible fear-mongering" designed to create panic for litigation purposes rather than representing legitimate public health concerns.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 Elk River chemical spill proved to be a significant environmental and public health event, though the formaldehyde narrative largely disappeared from legitimate scientific discourse.

**Regulatory Response:** The spill prompted immediate federal action. On January 10, 2014, President Obama declared a federal emergency for nine West Virginia counties. The Chemical Safety Board launched an investigation, and new federal regulations followed. In 2016, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act substantially reformed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), strengthening EPA's authority to regulate chemicals and requiring safety evaluations of existing chemicals—directly responding to gaps revealed by the West Virginia incident.

**Company Consequences:** Freedom Industries, the company responsible for the spill, filed for bankruptcy in January 2014. Several executives faced criminal charges. Former President Gary Southern was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $20,000, while other executives received probation. The company paid millions in fines and settlements, including a $1.55 million federal criminal fine.

**Scientific Research:** Legitimate scientific investigation focused on 4-MCHM toxicity rather than formaldehyde formation. The CDC established a screening level of 1 ppm for 4-MCHM in drinking water based on available toxicology data. Research published in subsequent years examined 4-MCHM's effects on human cells and potential health impacts, finding that while the chemical caused irritation and had some toxicity, formaldehyde production was not identified as a concern.

**Water Quality Infrastructure:** West Virginia implemented more stringent chemical storage regulations and increased monitoring of industrial facilities near water supplies. The state allocated funding for water system upgrades and emergency response capabilities.

The formaldehyde claims made by Simonton and the law firm did not result in successful litigation or regulatory changes regarding formaldehyde, and subsequent scientific literature about the spill makes no mention of formaldehyde as a documented byproduct or health concern from 4-MCHM degradation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions, explicit and implicit, about how events would unfold:

• **Prediction: The formaldehyde claims would be recognized as baseless** - **Correct**. West Virginia public health officials immediately refuted the formaldehyde claims, and no legitimate subsequent research identified formaldehyde as a concern from this spill. The narrative disappeared from genuine scientific discussion of the incident.

• **Prediction: The legal strategy based on chemical misreading would fail** - **Partially correct, but incomplete analysis**. While the specific formaldehyde argument vanished, widespread litigation did occur. Freedom Industries faced numerous lawsuits, though these focused on the actual chemical spilled (4-MCHM) and negligence rather than formaldehyde formation. The company's bankruptcy suggests mixed outcomes for plaintiffs seeking compensation.

• **Prediction: 4-MCHM would not degrade to formaldehyde under environmental conditions** - **Correct**. Scientific literature examining the spill consistently treated 4-MCHM as the compound of concern without documenting formaldehyde production. Research on the degradation pathways confirmed that formaldehyde was not a significant breakdown product under relevant environmental conditions.

• **Implicit prediction: Responsible parties would face consequences** - **Correct**. Criminal charges, substantial fines, and bankruptcy for Freedom Industries demonstrated accountability, though the formaldehyde angle played no role in these outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

This article addresses an important instance of science communication failure during a public health crisis and demonstrates sophisticated chemical debunking, but its narrow focus on a single false claim limits broader applicability compared to other scientific analyses that examined the actual chemical and systemic regulatory failures.
