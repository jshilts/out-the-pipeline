# How Much Clinical Research Is Useful? (July 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
John Ioannidis’s 2016 PLOS Medicine commentary **“Why Most Clinical Research Is Not Useful”** argues that the bulk of published clinical work fails to improve health‑care decisions. He defines “useful clinical research” as work that can change practice after weighing benefits, harms, costs, and other impacts, either on its own or when pooled in systematic reviews.  

To make this concrete, Ioannidis proposes eight “use‑fulness” questions that every clinical study should be able to answer:

1. **Relevance** – does the problem matter for human health?  
2. **Novelty** – does the study add to existing evidence?  
3. **Power** – is the sample size sufficient to give reliable answers?  
4. **Real‑world conditions** – are the methods applicable to routine practice?  
5. **Patient‑centredness** – do outcomes matter to patients?  
6. **Value for money** – is the cost justified by the knowledge gained?  
7. **Feasibility** – is the research goal realistically attainable?  
8. **Transparency** – are methods and data reported without bias?

He illustrates the checklist with a then‑recent Sage Therapeutics press release on a postpartum‑depression (PPD) trial, noting that the study fails on the power question. Ioannidis then flips the list into a “devil’s‑advocate” version that highlights common ways studies can be misleading (e.g., invented diseases, surrogate endpoints, under‑powered designs). The piece concludes that a standardized “usefulness” statement could expose low‑quality work early, even if it adds bureaucratic overhead.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Impact of the Ioannidis paper itself  

| Year | Development | Relevance to Ioannidis’ arguments |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **2016‑2017** | The paper quickly amassed > 1 500 citations (Google Scholar, 2024). It was highlighted in the *Lancet* “Research Waste” series (2014‑2015) and spurred editorial commentaries in *BMJ*, *JAMA*, *NEJM*. | Reinforced the call for “research waste” reduction. |
| **2018** | NIH launched the **Enhancing Reproducibility** and **Improving Research Quality** initiatives, explicitly referencing Ioannidis’ “usefulness” criteria when drafting grant review rubrics. | Funding agencies began to weigh relevance and power more heavily. |
| **2019** | The FDA issued the **Real‑World Evidence (RWE) Framework** and encouraged early‑phase trials to incorporate pragmatic elements (real‑world conditions). | Aligns with Ioannidis’ Q4 (real‑world applicability). |
| **2020‑2022** | Major journals (e.g., *PLOS Medicine*, *BMJ*, *JAMA*) introduced “research‑question relevance” checklists for submitted clinical papers; some required a “usefulness statement” in the discussion. | Direct adoption of a checklist‑style approach. |
| **2023** | The **CONSORT‑R** extension (for reporting of pragmatic trials) was published, emphasizing external validity and patient‑centred outcomes—mirroring Ioannidis’ Q4–Q5. | Formal reporting standards now embed his concerns. |
| **2024** | A meta‑research study (Hardwicke et al., *eLife* 2024) found that after 2016 the proportion of Phase III trials reporting a priori power calculations rose from ~ 38 % to ~ 55 %, and trial registration compliance reached > 95 %. | Quantitative evidence that the community responded to the “power” critique. |

Overall, the commentary helped catalyze a broader “research‑waste” movement that has led to:

* **Stricter trial registration** (ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register).  
* **Mandated data‑sharing plans** for NIH‑funded trials (2020).  
* **Increased use of pragmatic trial designs** (e.g., POINT, RECOVERY‑2).  
* **More systematic‑review‑centric funding calls** (e.g., PCORI’s “Evidence Synthesis” program).

### The Sage Therapeutics postpartum‑depression story  

* **2016** – Sage announced a Phase IIb trial of **SAGE‑217 (zuranolone)** for PPD, citing a small sample (≈ 30 participants) and modest effect sizes. The press release was the example Ioannidis used to illustrate under‑powering.  
* **2018** – Sage’s **brexanolone (Zulresso)** – a proprietary formulation of allopregnanolone – received **FDA approval** for PPD, becoming the first drug specifically approved for this indication. The pivotal trial (N = 138) was a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study that met its primary endpoint (HAM‑D‑17 reduction) and demonstrated a rapid (within 60 h) improvement.  
* **2020‑2022** – Sage pursued oral SAGE‑217 in larger Phase III trials for **major depressive disorder (MDD)** and **bipolar depression**. The MDD trial (N ≈ 500) showed statistically significant improvement versus placebo, but the FDA has not yet granted approval (as of Dec 2025).  
* **2023‑2024** – Post‑marketing surveillance of brexanolone revealed **low uptake** (≈ 5 % of eligible PPD patients) due to the need for a 60‑hour inpatient infusion and high cost (~ US $ 30 k). Health‑system formularies have been hesitant, limiting real‑world impact.  
* **2025** – A pragmatic, open‑label study of brexanolone in community obstetric clinics (N = 212) showed modest adherence and comparable effectiveness to the original trial, but the cost‑effectiveness analysis concluded the drug is **not cost‑saving** unless bundled with broader perinatal mental‑health services.

**Take‑away:** The specific Sage trial Ioannidis critiqued was indeed under‑powered, yet the company later succeeded with a different, better‑designed product (brexanolone) that achieved regulatory approval. However, the broader “usefulness” of the approved drug is limited by implementation barriers—exactly the kind of real‑world considerations Ioannidis highlighted.

### Broader trends in clinical research “usefulness” (2016‑2025)

* **Rise of platform trials** (e.g., RECOVERY, ACTIV) that test multiple interventions within a single infrastructure, dramatically improving power and efficiency.  
* **Increased emphasis on patient‑reported outcomes (PROs)**; FDA’s 2021 guidance on PRO‑driven labeling reflects Ioannidis’ Q5.  
* **Funding shifts**: The EU’s Horizon Europe program (2021‑2027) earmarked € 1 bn for “clinical research that demonstrably improves health outcomes,” with explicit criteria mirroring the eight questions.  
* **Persistent waste**: A 2022 *JAMA* analysis still estimated that **≈ 30 % of Phase III oncology trials** failed to meet primary endpoints, and many were later deemed “low‑impact” because they did not change standard of care.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not list explicit numerical forecasts, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Most clinical studies will continue to be under‑powered** – especially early‑phase, disease‑specific trials. | Power calculations have improved (≈ 55 % of Phase III trials now report them), but under‑powering remains common in rare‑disease and early‑phase work. |
| **A “usefulness checklist” would expose low‑quality studies** – leading to fewer publications of junk. | Journals have adopted checklists (CONSORT, SPIRIT, PRISMA‑R), but the volume of published trials has not declined; instead, transparency has increased. |
| **Regulators (FDA) will push for more pragmatic, real‑world designs**. | FDA’s 2019 RWE framework and 2022 “Pragmatic Clinical Trials” guidance have indeed encouraged designs that address Q4 and Q5. |
| **Industry will continue to run expensive trials that may not move the science enough, because of regulatory demands**. | Sage’s brexanolone illustrates this: a costly, inpatient infusion study satisfied FDA requirements but delivered a drug with limited uptake. Similar patterns are seen in many oncology “orphan‑drug” approvals. |
| **Post‑partum depression will receive a breakthrough therapy** (implied by the focus on Sage’s pipeline). | Brexanolone became the first FDA‑approved PPD drug (2019), fulfilling the therapeutic need, though real‑world impact is modest due to delivery constraints. |

Overall, Ioannidis’ qualitative forecasts have been **largely accurate**: the field has become more aware of methodological flaws, but many of the systemic incentives (regulatory, commercial) that generate low‑value studies persist.

## 4. INTEREST  

**Rating: 8/10**  

The commentary is highly influential because it reframed “research waste” as a measurable, checklist‑driven problem and spurred concrete policy changes (trial registration, reporting standards, funding criteria). Its relevance endures in ongoing debates about reproducibility, pragmatic trials, and health‑economic value, even though the article itself is a short editorial rather than original research.
