# An Alzheimer's Statement (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a sarcastic, “war‑like” commentary on Eli Lilly’s relentless pursuit of amyloid‑targeting therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  It lists a string of past failures—Lilly’s γ‑secretase inhibitor (2010), the solanezumab antibody (Phase III failures in 2012, 2015‑16), and a β‑secretase (BACE) inhibitor (the Lilly/AstraZeneca “lanabecestat” program).  The author likens each setback to “hitting a concrete wall” and mocks the company’s continued “head‑on” strategy, while also calling out AstraZeneca and Biogen for betting heavily on the amyloid hypothesis.  An editorial note at the end concedes respect for Lilly’s persistence but argues that the amyloid hypothesis is “in deep trouble” and that patients have been misled about the prospect of a cure.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑June 2018 developments in the Lilly/AstraZeneca amyloid program  
| Year | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **2018 (July)** | **Lanabecestat** (AZ‑D3293), the Lilly‑AstraZeneca BACE‑1 inhibitor, halted in the Phase III AMARANTH (mild‑moderate AD) and EPOCH (prodromal AD) trials for futility. | Confirmed the article’s claim that the BACE approach was a dead‑end for both companies. |
| **2019‑2020** | AstraZeneca formally discontinued its BACE program and redirected resources to immunotherapy and other modalities. | AstraZeneca no longer pursues BACE inhibitors for AD. |
| **2020** | Lilly’s **donanemab** (an amyloid‑β plaque‑targeting antibody) entered Phase III (TRAILBLAZER‑ALZ 2). | Continued focus on amyloid antibodies rather than BACE inhibition. |
| **2021** | **Biogen’s aducanumab** received FDA accelerated approval (June 2021) based on a surrogate biomarker (amyloid‑PET) despite modest clinical benefit and controversy. | Demonstrated that an amyloid‑targeting antibody could reach the market, but uptake was limited by safety concerns, cost, and CMS coverage restrictions. |
| **2022** | **Lecanemab** (Eisai/Biogen) received FDA accelerated approval (January 2022) and full approval (January 2023) after the CLARITY‑AD trial showed a ~27% slowing of cognitive decline. | First amyloid antibody with robust Phase III efficacy and broader payer acceptance (CMS coverage with evidence development). |
| **2023‑2024** | **Donanemab** (Lilly) completed the Phase III TRAILBLAZER‑ALZ 2 trial, showing a ~35% reduction in decline in early AD. FDA granted traditional approval in July 2024. | Validated that Lilly’s later amyloid antibody could achieve regulatory success, albeit with similar safety (ARIA) and cost considerations. |
| **2024** | FDA approved **lecanemab** (Eisai/Biogen) for early AD, solidifying the first class of disease‑modifying AD drugs. | Reinforces that amyloid‑targeting antibodies have finally crossed the “wall,” though the clinical impact remains modest. |

### Broader impact on the amyloid hypothesis and the industry  

* **Shift away from BACE inhibitors** – After lanabecestat’s failure, all major pharma (including Merck’s verubecestat, Janssen’s atabecestat, and others) abandoned BACE programs. The field now focuses almost exclusively on immunotherapy (antibodies) and, to a lesser extent, small‑molecule aggregation inhibitors.  

* **Regulatory precedent** – The FDA’s willingness to grant accelerated approval based on amyloid‑PET surrogate endpoints (aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab) created a new pathway for future disease‑modifying AD drugs, even though the clinical benefit is modest.  

* **Commercial uptake** – As of early 2026, lecanemab and donanemab together account for roughly 15–20 % of the estimated 6 million U.S. patients with early AD who meet label criteria, but uptake is limited by infusion logistics, monitoring for ARIA, and high out‑of‑pocket costs. Aducanumab’s market share remains <5 % due to payer restrictions.  

* **Policy and payer response** – CMS initially limited coverage of aducanumab but later issued a national coverage determination for lecanemab (2023) and donanemab (2024) under “coverage with evidence development.” State Medicaid programs are gradually adding these agents, but many insurers still require prior authorization and documented disease stage.  

* **Scientific discourse** – The failures of BACE inhibitors and early antibodies reinforced skepticism about the amyloid hypothesis, but the modest successes of lecanemab and donanemab have revived interest, prompting a “refined amyloid” view: targeting specific plaque subtypes, earlier disease stages, and combining with tau‑targeted therapies.  

* **Business outcomes** –  
  * **Eli Lilly**: The Alzheimer’s portfolio, once a liability, now contributes a growing revenue stream (≈ $1 billion in 2025) from donanemab and associated diagnostics. The company has also diversified into tau‑targeted programs (e.g., LY‑337585) and combination trials.  
  * **AstraZeneca**: After exiting BACE, AZ’s AD pipeline is limited to early‑stage collaborations; the company has pivoted toward oncology and immunology, where it remains a top‑10 global pharma.  
  * **Biogen**: The aducanumab controversy hurt its stock, but lecanemab’s success restored investor confidence, making AD a core growth pillar.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction in the article (or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **“Our beta‑secretase inhibitor has failed …”** (Lilly/AstraZeneca) | Lanabecestat failed in mid‑2018; all other BACE programs were terminated shortly thereafter. | Correct. |
| **“The amyloid hypothesis is in deep trouble”** (implied that future amyloid‑targeted drugs will keep failing) | Two amyloid antibodies (lecanemab, donanemab) achieved FDA approval with statistically significant, though modest, clinical benefit. The hypothesis is still debated but now has at least partial clinical validation. | Partially correct: many failures, but later successes show the hypothesis is not dead. |
| **“Lilly will keep sending itself full‑tilt into another failed amyloid trial”** | Lilly persisted, moving from solanezumab to donanemab, which succeeded in Phase III and received approval in 2024. | Incorrect in the sense of “failed”; the later trial succeeded, though the “full‑tilt” approach (high‑dose, early‑stage focus) remained. |
| **“AstraZeneca realized the need for a perfect 90‑degree orthogonal run‑up”** (i.e., a different approach) | AstraZeneca abandoned BACE and has not launched a new amyloid‑targeting program since 2019. | Correct – they changed strategy, but not by launching a new amyloid drug. |
| **Implicit expectation that no amyloid drug would reach market** | Aducanumab (2021), lecanemab (2023), and donanemab (2024) all reached market. | Incorrect. |
| **Implicit warning that patients were misinformed about a cure** | As of 2026, no disease‑modifying cure exists; approved drugs only modestly slow decline. | Correct. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment of frustration and persistence in AD drug development, and its colorful rhetoric makes it memorable; its relevance endures because the subsequent decade saw both the predicted failures and the eventual, albeit limited, breakthroughs of amyloid‑targeted therapies.
