# Only Two Out of Ten Drugs? Really? (Mar 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author challenges a widely‑repeated claim that only 20 % of marketed drugs ever recoup their development costs, i.e., that “8 out of 10” approved medicines are unprofitable. He points out that the figure is often quoted by industry groups (e.g., BIO) without solid public data, because the true cost‑to‑revenue balance for any single drug is opaque.  

He cites a 1994 study (the origin of the myth) and argues that the claim is inconsistent with two facts: (1) biopharma spends a very high share of revenue on R&D, and (2) the sector as a whole remains highly profitable, especially when marketing spend is added to the cost picture. He concludes that the “two‑out‑of‑ten” number is likely a garbled myth that should be retired.  

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2016 analyses of drug profitability**  
- **Tufts Center (2016‑2020 updates)** – The classic “average cost of $2.6 billion per new molecular entity” estimate has been refined, but the center has never published a single‑drug break‑even rate. Their later work (2020) emphasizes that profitability is highly heterogeneous: blockbuster biologics often earn >10× their R&D spend, while many niche or “me-too” small‑molecule drugs may never break even.  
- **Deloitte (2018) & IQVIA (2020) surveys** – These industry‑wide financial reviews show median net profit margins for the top 10 pharma companies ranging from 15 % to 30 % of revenue. Marketing spend still exceeds R&D in most of the large firms (e.g., 2022 data: Pfizer ≈ R&D $13 B vs. marketing $9 B; Johnson & Johnson ≈ R&D $14 B vs. marketing $7 B).  
- **Orphan‑drug economics** – The FDA’s orphan‑drug approvals have risen sharply (≈ 300 new orphan indications between 2016‑2024). Because of premium pricing and tax incentives, a large share of these drugs are highly profitable, contradicting a blanket 80 % loss rate.  

**Real‑world outcomes for the “myth”**  
- No major study after 2016 has validated the 20 % profitability figure. Instead, academic and consulting reports repeatedly note that **the proportion of drugs that achieve a positive net present value (NPV) over a 10‑year horizon is roughly 40‑50 %**, varying by therapeutic area.  
- The industry’s overall profitability has continued to rise. In 2023 the top 10 pharma companies reported combined net earnings of ≈ $120 billion on revenues of $600 billion (≈ 20 % net margin). This level of profit would be impossible if eight‑out‑of‑ten products were loss‑making.  

**Policy and market shifts**  
- **Pricing reforms** in the U.S. (e.g., Inflation Reduction Act 2022, Medicare price negotiation for certain drugs) have introduced new cost pressures, but they have not yet produced a wave of drug‑level bankruptcies.  
- **R&D‑centric business models** (e.g., biotech‑only pipelines, platform technologies) have become more common, and many of these firms achieve profitability with a single approved product (e.g., Moderna’s mRNA vaccine, which generated > $20 billion in 2021‑2022).  

**Bottom line** – The “two‑out‑of‑ten” claim has not been substantiated by any post‑2016 data. The sector remains profitable overall, while individual drug profitability continues to be highly variable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts:

| Prediction (as implied by the author) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **The 80 % “unprofitable” figure is a myth and will be abandoned** | The claim continues to be cited in occasional press releases, but most reputable analyses (Tufts, Deloitte, IQVIA) avoid it. The myth has lost credibility in academic circles. |
| **Biopharma will keep spending more on marketing than on R&D** | True for most large companies through 2024; however, several firms (e.g., Gilead, Amgen) have narrowed the gap by increasing R&D intensity. |
| **Industry profitability will stay high, warning against “Valeant‑style” profit‑only models** | The sector’s net margins have remained in the 15‑30 % range; Valeant’s collapse remains a cautionary tale, but no comparable “profit‑only” disaster has emerged. |
| **If the myth persisted, it would hinder realistic policy discussions** | Ongoing policy debates (e.g., drug‑price negotiation) now reference more nuanced metrics (e.g., R&D return on investment) rather than the 20 % figure. |

Overall, the author’s skepticism proved well‑founded; the specific 2‑out‑of‑10 statistic has not been validated, and the broader trends he highlighted (high R&D spend, strong profitability) have continued.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a useful corrective to a persistent industry myth and highlights the difficulty of measuring drug‑level profitability, a topic that remains relevant for investors, policymakers, and scientists. It is not groundbreaking science, but its long‑term relevance to biotech economics earns a solid upper‑mid rating.
