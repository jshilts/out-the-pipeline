# Ingenol: A Walk In The Park (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a 14-step total synthesis of ingenol achieved by the Baran group at Scripps, published in *Science* in 2013. The natural product ingenol, isolated from *Euphorbia* plants, had clinical relevance: a synthetic ester of ingenol (ingenol mebutate) had recently been approved for treating actinic keratosis, a precancerous skin condition caused by sun exposure. The author emphasizes that despite being only 14 steps (relatively short for complex natural product synthesis), the route represents a significant achievement in elegance and efficiency, particularly because it started from (+) 3-carene, a readily available turpentine component.

The synthesis faced major challenges, with the pinacol rearrangement step alone taking most of 2012 to optimize. The author uses an extended metaphor comparing complex molecule synthesis to assembling intricate balloon sculptures using improvised tools from random junk piles. What made this synthesis particularly noteworthy was its practical scale—producing grams of material—and the collaboration with LEO Pharmaceuticals, which marketed the approved ingenol gel and was interested in developing better analogs for clinical testing.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Outcome:**
The ingenol mebutate gel (marketed as Picato) referenced in the article faced significant developments after 2013. While initially FDA-approved in 2012 for actinic keratosis treatment, the drug was **withdrawn from the market in 2020** due to safety concerns. Post-marketing studies revealed an increased risk of skin malignancies, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, in patients using the gel. This led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendation for withdrawal in January 2020, followed by the manufacturer's voluntary global withdrawal.

**Scientific Impact:**
The Baran group's synthesis methodology proved valuable beyond the specific clinical failure. The route enabled access to ingenol analogs for structure-activity relationship studies, contributing to medicinal chemistry research on protein kinase C modulators. However, the commercial impetus for large-scale analog production diminished with Picato's withdrawal.

The total synthesis field continued evolving toward more efficient routes, with this synthesis remaining notable as an example of strategic bond disconnection and convergent synthesis planning. The pinacol rearrangement methodology influenced subsequent synthetic approaches to complex polycyclic natural products.

**LEO Pharmaceuticals:**
The company faced significant revenue loss from Picato's withdrawal but maintained other dermatology products in its portfolio. The experience highlighted the pharmaceutical industry's ongoing challenge of balancing innovation in natural product-derived drugs with post-marketing safety surveillance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** The article anticipated that the synthetic route would enable "real quantities of analogs can be produced" and that "with any luck, you'll never have to do something like this again, unless it's by choice!"

**Reality:** The synthesis did provide access to analogs for research purposes, and the methodology influenced synthetic chemistry. However, the commercial motivation for extensive analog development evaporated when Picato was withdrawn due to safety issues. The synthesis remained a valuable academic achievement rather than becoming the foundation for an expanded clinical pipeline.

• **Prediction:** Implicit expectation that ingenol mebutate's approval represented the beginning of expanded therapeutic applications for ingenol-based compounds.

**Reality:** Rather than expanding, the ingenol mebutate clinical program ended entirely. The withdrawal demonstrated that FDA approval doesn't guarantee long-term market success, especially when post-marketing surveillance reveals unanticipated safety concerns.

• **Prediction:** The synthesis was viewed as enabling the "making analogs for testing" that "everyone who does total synthesis talks about" with better "follow-through."

**Reality:** While analog synthesis occurred academically, the commercial failure of the parent compound limited practical translation. This highlights a broader pattern in pharmaceutical development where promising synthetic access doesn't always translate to clinical success, especially when safety issues emerge.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article has moderate long-term interest because it captures a specific moment in both synthetic chemistry achievement and pharmaceutical development where significant scientific progress was made, yet the ultimate clinical application failed due to safety concerns discovered post-approval. It serves as an important case study in the disconnect between elegant synthesis and sustainable therapeutic value.
