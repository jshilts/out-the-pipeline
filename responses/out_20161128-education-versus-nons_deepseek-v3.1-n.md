# Education Versus Nonsense (Nov 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article addresses the challenge of scientific illiteracy and the public's vulnerability to misinformation. The author, writing from a science-focused perspective, presents two stark examples of nonsensical beliefs that gained traction: first, conspiracy theories around the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill claiming that toxic rains would wipe out life in Eastern North America, sourced from dubious websites citing unnamed Russian scientists; and second, a South African religious charlatan who convinced people that commercial insecticide spray ("Doom" brand) could cure diseases when administered with religious incantations.

The article explores whether science education can protect people from such beliefs, or if confirmation bias and motivated reasoning are so powerful that people will believe what they want regardless of their knowledge base. The author distinguishes between religious faith (which may involve supernatural claims) and what they call "just plain ignorance and credulity" - the latter including anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, alternative medicine scams, and pseudoscientific wellness products. The central question posed is whether better science education can inoculate populations against misinformation, or if deeper psychological factors make some people inherently susceptible to nonsense regardless of scientific knowledge.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this article's publication (late 2016 onward) saw dramatic developments in misinformation and the societal response to it:

**Platform Accountability and Content Moderation**: Major internet platforms implemented more aggressive policies against health misinformation, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and others began labeling, downgrading, or removing false health claims, including anti-vaccine content. These measures were often controversial and their effectiveness remains debated.

**Scientific Community's Response Infrastructure**: The growing attention to misinformation led to investment in fact-checking organizations, academic research programs, and public-facing initiatives like the National Institute of Health's efforts to combat COVID misinformation. Many scientific institutions expanded public engagement programs.

**Evidence on Education's Limitations**: Research following 2016 has shown that while science education matters, its ability to prevent belief in misinformation is limited. Studies, such as those on vaccine hesitancy among educated populations, have shown that scientific literacy alone doesn't prevent motivated reasoning. This has led to rethinking approaches toward medical and digital literacy.

**Key Events That Highlighted These Challenges**: The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented test of public health communication. Despite extensive scientific resources and education campaigns, misinformation about masks, treatments, and vaccines spread widely - showing the continuation of patterns described in the article, and that susceptibility cuts across education levels and socioeconomic groups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article suggests several implicit predictions about future developments:

• **That science education might protect against misinformation**: Subsequent research has shown this to be incomplete. Studies found that while education helps, it doesn't prevent motivated reasoning - highly educated people often use their knowledge to rationalize pre-existing beliefs rather than evaluate evidence objectively. This suggests the article's pessimistic alternative (people believe what they want regardless of knowledge) has proven more accurate than hoped.

• **That platforms would face increasing pressure to address misinformation**: This proved correct. Following the 2016 US election and COVID-19 pandemic, major tech platforms implemented unprecedented content moderation policies, though their effectiveness and impact on free speech remain contentious issues. Regulatory frameworks like the EU's Digital Services Act now mandate risk assessments and mitigation for systemic misinformation.

• **Implicit prediction that problems like medical misinformation would continue**: This proved dramatically correct. Anti-vaccine misinformation reached crisis levels during COVID-19, contributing to vaccine hesitancy and preventable deaths. However, organized responses also scaled up significantly, suggesting the development of institutional capacity to combat misinformation.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article anticipated key challenges that became dominant public issues in subsequent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its core tension (education versus motivated reasoning) remains central to understanding why misinformation persists despite increased scientific knowledge.
