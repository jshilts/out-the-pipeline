# The Key Player in the Sanofi-Genzyme Deal Speaks Out (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This satirical blog post presents an imaginary interview with Vesivirus 2117, a contaminant that infected Genzyme's Allston, Massachusetts manufacturing facility around 2009. The virus claims credit for setting in motion the events that led to Sanofi's acquisition of Genzyme, arguing that its contamination of cell cultures disrupted production and damaged Genzyme's stock price and shareholder confidence, ultimately making the company vulnerable to takeover.

The article references real events: the virus contamination did occur at Genzyme's Allston facility starting in June 2009, causing manufacturing shutdowns and drug shortages for treatments like Cerezyme and Fabrazyme. This disruption indeed preceded Sanofi's eventual acquisition of Genzyme, which was announced in August 2010 and finalized in February 2011 for approximately $20.1 billion. The tone is humorous but built on factual contamination events that significantly impacted Genzyme's operations.

## 2. HISTORY

The Vesivirus 2117 contamination proved to be a pivotal real-world event with lasting consequences:

**Manufacturing Impact**: The contamination, first detected in June 2009, forced Genzyme to shut down its Allston Landing facility for cleaning and decontamination. This caused severe shortages of Cerezyme (for Gaucher disease) and Fabrazyme (for Fabry disease), two of Genzyme's blockbuster orphan drugs. The facility remained offline for several months, with production not fully restored until well into 2010.

**Regulatory Fallout**: The FDA issued a consent decree in May 2010 requiring Genzyme to address manufacturing quality issues at the Allston facility, including the viral contamination and other problems. Genzyme paid $175 million to resolve the issues.

**Economic Consequences**: The stock price impact was real - Genzyme shares dropped from highs around $83 in 2008 to lows in the $50s during 2010, making the company more attractive as a acquisition target. The manufacturing problems cost Genzyme an estimated $300-400 million in revenue during 2010.

**Sanofi Acquisition**: Sanofi-Aventis initiated its hostile takeover attempt in August 2010, eventually reaching agreement in February 2011. While the virus contamination wasn't the sole factor, it significantly weakened Genzyme's position and negotiating leverage.

**Long-term Effects**: The contamination highlighted vulnerabilities in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, particularly the risks associated with single-facility production of critical orphan drugs. It spurred increased industry focus on viral safety protocols and contingency planning.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made no direct predictions about future events, as it was primarily satirical commentary on events that had already occurred by February 2011.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The piece offers an unusual and memorable angle on a significant biopharma business story, using satirical humor to illuminate how manufacturing issues can have outsized corporate consequences. While entertaining, it's primarily commentary on circumstances already well-known by its publication date.

## 5. CONTEMPORARY ANALYSIS

What makes this article noteworthy in hindsight is how it presciently captured a recurring challenge in biopharmaceutical manufacturing: the vulnerability of production systems to unexpected contamination events. The Vesivirus 2117 incident became something of a case study in the industry, demonstrating several critical realities:

**Single-Point Vulnerabilities**: The contamination exposed the risks of concentrating critical drug production in single facilities, particularly for orphan drugs serving small patient populations with few alternative sources.

**Regulatory Evolution**: This incident, along with other manufacturing quality issues in the industry, contributed to heightened FDA scrutiny of biopharmaceutical manufacturing practices, especially regarding viral safety protocols and facility redundancy.

**Corporate Vulnerability**: The piece correctly identified how operational problems at biotech companies can translate into acquisition opportunities for larger pharmaceutical companies with deeper resources to address manufacturing challenges.

**Viral Safety Innovation**: The contamination spurred development of improved viral detection methods and decontamination protocols, including the Applied Biosystems detection kit mentioned in the article.

The Sanofi-Genzyme deal, meanwhile, proved relatively successful for Sanofi, particularly regarding Genzyme's rare disease portfolio, though it faced ongoing manufacturing challenges in subsequent years.
