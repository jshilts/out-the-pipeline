# Lack of Experience, You Know (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal reflection blog post by a medicinal/organic chemist (likely Derek Lowe, based on the writing style and blog context) discussing their surprising gaps in practical laboratory experience with famous named organic reactions. The author notes that despite ring-closing metathesis (RCM) winning the Nobel Prize in 2005 and being widely published, they had never performed one. They then lists numerous other reactions they've never executed, including directed ortho-metalation, Fischer indole synthesis, Eschweiler-Clarke, multicomponent reactions (Ugi, Passerini), Rosenmund reduction, Julia olefination, Fries rearrangement, Kolbe-Schmitt, and Paterno-Büchi reactions. The author contrasts this with having performed more obscure reactions like Shapiro elimination and Prins cyclization.

## 2. HISTORY

This personal blog post reflected a common phenomenon in medicinal chemistry: synthetic chemists develop specialized expertise based on their specific drug discovery projects, leading to surprising gaps in experience. The subsequent decade and a half revealed several relevant trends:

**Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM)** became increasingly important in drug discovery synthesis, with the 2005 Nobel Prize catalysts (Grubbs, Schrock, Chauvin) seeing widespread industrial adoption. In many contexts, RCM transitioned from novelty to standard methodology.

**Directed ortho-metalation** remained a valuable tool for specific substitution patterns, though its usage varied significantly by lab and project needs.

**Multicomponent reactions (Ugi, Passerini)** saw continued use in combinatorial chemistry and drug discovery libraries, though their adoption remained somewhat niche compared to more traditional approaches.

**The broader trend** the article touched upon—that chemists accumulate different experiences based on project needs rather than systematic coverage of all named reactions—has become more institutionalized over the past decade.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article contained no specific predictions about future developments in chemistry, biotechnology, or drug discovery. It was purely a personal reflection on professional experience gaps. The author was not making forward-looking statements about the field, reactions, or their future applications. Therefore, there are no predictions to evaluate against subsequent developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is essentially a personal blog post about a chemist's experiences rather than an analysis of biotechnology developments or predictions. While it touches on some important context about how synthetic chemistry methodology gets adopted (or doesn't) in drug discovery, it lacks broader analytical insights or predictive claims that would make it highly interesting for retrospective analysis.
