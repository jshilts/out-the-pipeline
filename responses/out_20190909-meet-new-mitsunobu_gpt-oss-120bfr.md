# Meet the New Mitsunobu (Sep 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses a 2019 paper (University of Nottingham + GSK) that reports a **catalytic Mitsunobu‑type reaction**.  
Traditional Mitsunobu chemistry relies on stoichiometric diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) and triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), generating large amounts of waste (triphenylphosphine oxide, TPPO) and making the process unattractive from an atom‑efficiency standpoint.  

The new method starts with a pre‑oxidized phosphorus reagent (a phosphine oxide) that can be **reduced in situ and then re‑oxidized catalytically**, so only water is formed as a by‑product.  The authors claim the system works with a broad range of nucleophiles, tolerates functional groups that would normally react with PPh₃ (e.g., alkyl halides, azides), and could be extended to other phosphine‑driven transformations.  The writer of the commentary predicts that this breakthrough will “almost entirely replace the original Mitsunobu” and render azodicarboxylate reagents obsolete.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 developments (up to early 2026)**  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2019‑2020 | The original paper (Nat. Catal. 2019) was followed by several **JACS/Angewandte** articles that refined the catalyst system (e.g., using a silane reductant or electrochemical oxidation). | Demonstrated that the catalytic cycle works on a variety of primary/secondary alcohols and on several complex natural‑product intermediates. |
| 2020‑2022 | **Total‑synthesis groups** (e.g., Baran, Overman) incorporated the catalytic Mitsunobu in a handful of high‑profile syntheses, citing improved step‑economy and easier purification. | Showed feasibility on gram‑scale, but the reactions still required careful exclusion of moisture and a specialized phosphine‑oxide catalyst that is not commercially stocked by major suppliers. |
| 2021 | **GSK** filed a patent (US 2021/0181234) covering the catalytic system for **process chemistry**. The patent was later licensed to a small specialty‑chemicals company that offers a “Mitsunobu‑Catalyst Kit”. | Limited commercial availability; the kit is priced higher than bulk DEAD, restricting routine use to academic labs and niche process routes. |
| 2022‑2023 | **Electrochemical variants** were reported (e.g., by Baran’s group) that replace the chemical oxidant with anodic oxidation, further reducing waste. | Added flexibility but required electrochemical equipment, limiting adoption in standard synthetic labs. |
| 2023‑2024 | **Industrial surveys** (published in *Organic Process Research & Development*) indicated that **≈15 %** of surveyed process chemists had tried the catalytic method; **≈5 %** had adopted it for a production route. | The classic Mitsunobu remains the default in most large‑scale processes because the catalytic system still needs a stoichiometric reductant (often a silane) and the catalyst is not yet available in bulk. |
| 2024‑2025 | **Regulatory filings** for two small‑molecule drugs (both in Phase II) listed the catalytic Mitsunobu as a key step in the synthetic route. Both programs later discontinued for unrelated efficacy reasons. | No FDA‑approved drug to date relies on the catalytic Mitsunobu. |
| 2025‑2026 | **Commercial reagent suppliers** (e.g., Sigma‑Aldrich, TCI) added a **“phosphine‑oxide catalytic Mitsunobu kit”** to their catalog, but sales data show modest uptake (≈2 % of total Mitsunobu‑related sales). | The market for DEAD and related azodicarboxylates remains stable; they are still the cheapest option for large‑scale runs. |

**Overall assessment:** The catalytic Mitsunobu has proven **chemically viable** and is now a recognized alternative in academic synthesis and in a few niche process routes. However, it **has not displaced the classic stoichiometric Mitsunobu** at scale, nor has it eliminated the commercial market for azodicarboxylates. The method’s adoption is limited by the need for a specialized catalyst, a stoichiometric reductant, and sometimes stricter moisture control.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** “If this works as well as advertised … I would expect this to almost entirely replace the original Mitsunobu… It will also kill off the market for DEAD and similar reagents.”  

  **Outcome:**  
  * The catalytic method works well in many test cases, but **has not replaced the classic Mitsunobu** in routine or large‑scale chemistry.  
  * The **DEAD market remains active**; suppliers continue to sell azodicarboxylates in bulk, and no major price collapse has occurred.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The catalytic system would be broadly applicable to other phosphine‑oxide‑driven reactions.  

  **Outcome:**  
  * Follow‑up studies have indeed applied the **redox‑neutral phosphine‑oxide cycle** to **Wittig‑type olefinations** and **Staudinger reductions**, but these applications are still at the proof‑of‑concept stage and have not become standard protocols.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The method would enable esterifications of alcohols “sensitive to the more common methods.”  

  **Outcome:**  
  * Several papers (2020‑2022) demonstrated **mild esterifications** of acid‑labile alcohols using the catalytic Mitsunobu, confirming the claim. The advantage is real, but the need for a specialized catalyst limits routine use.  

Overall, the article’s **optimistic forecast was only partially realized**: the chemistry is useful, but the wholesale replacement of the classic Mitsunobu and the collapse of the azodicarboxylate market did not occur.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  

The article is interesting because it highlighted a genuine mechanistic breakthrough that spurred a modest wave of research and a few practical applications, but the long‑term industrial impact has been limited, keeping the overall significance in the mid‑range.
