# Double-Blinded Peer Review (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses *Nature*'s decision to offer double-blind peer review as an optional feature, where papers are sent to referees without author names or institutional affiliations. The author considers this worthwhile but raises concerns about the optional nature of the system, arguing that papers from prominent researchers at major institutions likely wouldn't use the blinded option since they have more to lose than gain from anonymization. This could create a negative signal where double-blinded papers become disproportionately associated with smaller research groups trying to level the playing field. The article suggests *Nature* should have made double-blinding mandatory for all submissions and questions whether the blinding should extend to initial editorial decisions. The author acknowledges that reviewers can sometimes still identify authors based on research content, but maintains that double-blind review is valuable, concluding by asking whether other major journals would follow *Nature*'s lead.

## 2. HISTORY
Following *Nature*'s 2015 announcement, double-blind peer review adoption has been gradual and limited among major scientific publishers. The system remains optional at most journals that offer it, with mandatory implementation rare outside specific disciplines or newer journals. Studies have shown mixed results on double-blind review's effectiveness in reducing bias. A 2017 analysis in *Nature* itself found that post-publication, double-blind reviewed papers received similar citation rates as single-blind papers. Many publishers have instead focused on other transparency measures like publishing reviewer reports and author responses, or using reporting guidelines and checklists. Contrary to the article's implication that other major journals would follow, most top-tier journals in natural sciences have not adopted double-blind review as standard practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: Double-blinded papers might become disproportionately from smaller groups trying to even the playing field, potentially creating a negative signal.
  
  **Outcome**: While systematic data is limited, the continued optional nature at most journals means this concern remains theoretically relevant, though no clear evidence shows this has created a negative signal in practice.

• **Prediction**: *Nature* taking the plunge and blinding everything would be better than optional implementation.
  
  **Outcome**: *Nature* never made double-blinding mandatory, keeping it optional.

• **Prediction**: Whether other big-name journals would follow *Nature*'s lead.
  
  **Outcome**: Most major journals did not adopt double-blind peer review as standard practice.

• **Prediction**: Whether journals might go even further than *Nature* in anonymizing the review process.
  
  **Outcome**: The most significant innovations have been in different directions (open peer review, published reviews) rather than deeper anonymization.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article addressed an important publication ethics topic, but double-blind review never became the systemic transformation envisioned, limiting its long-term significance.
