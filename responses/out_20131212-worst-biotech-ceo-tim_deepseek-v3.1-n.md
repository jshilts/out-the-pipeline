# Worst Biotech CEO Time (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2013 blog post from Science magazine references Adam Feuerstein's annual "Worst Biotech CEO" awards, highlighting a poll where readers could vote on the worst-performing biotech chief executives of the year. The author notes that the list contains "some real stinkers" and difficult choices, treating the exercise with a mix of amusement and acknowledgment that poor leadership decisions have real consequences in the biotech industry.

## 2. HISTORY
Adam Feuerstein was a prominent biotech journalist at TheStreet.com who gained a reputation for sharp, skeptical analysis of biotech companies and their executives, particularly those making unrealistic claims about drug development timelines or clinical trial results. His annual "Worst Biotech CEO" awards became a notable industry fixture, with the 2013 poll mentioned in this article likely including executives from companies that later faced significant challenges.

Unfortunately, without access to the specific voting results from TheStreet.com's 2013 poll (the original link is no longer active), I cannot identify which specific CEOs were nominated or won that year, nor can I trace their subsequent career trajectories or the fate of their companies with sufficient confidence to make definitive statements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No specific predictions were made in this article - it was commentary on an existing poll rather than forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

This is a light-hearted industry commentary piece with limited long-term analytical value. While Feuerstein's critical coverage of biotech executives was influential at the time, this particular blog post serves mainly as meta-commentary rather than substantive analysis of specific companies, technologies, or clinical outcomes.
