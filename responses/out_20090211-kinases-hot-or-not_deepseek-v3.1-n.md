# Kinases: Hot or Not? (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the kinase drug development landscape from the late 1990s through 2009. Kinase enzymes, which add phosphate groups to proteins and small molecules, serve as crucial signaling switches throughout biology. After being considered "nearly impossible" drug targets due to selectivity challenges, the field gained momentum once chemists learned to target the "hinge" region common to most kinases.

The author notes that most kinase inhibitor development had focused on oncology by 2009, where side effects were more tolerable than in other therapeutic areas like inflammation, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. The clinical experience had been mixed, with some selective inhibitors like Gleevec working well in limited patient populations, while multi-kinase inhibitors ("hand grenades") like Sutent and Nexavar showed broader but less spectacular efficacy.

By 2009, the author observed a "kinase hangover" in the industry — reduced enthusiasm as the best targets faced clinical failures, were already in trials, or had proven chemically intractable. The article concludes that the field was waiting for better biological understanding to make sense of the accumulating data.

## 2. HISTORY

The kinase inhibitor field evolved significantly after 2009, though many of the author's observations proved prescient:

**Clinical Expansion and Approvals:** The period from 2009-2025 saw dozens of additional kinase inhibitors gain FDA approval. Oncology remained the dominant indication, with drugs like ibrutinib (Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, approved 2013 for blood cancers), palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor, approved 2015 for breast cancer), and osimertinib (EGFR inhibitor, approved 2015 for lung cancer) achieving blockbuster status. By the mid-2020s, over 70 kinase inhibitors had been approved worldwide, with many more in clinical development.

**Beyond Oncology:** The author's observation about limited progress outside cancer proved partially accurate. JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib approved 2012 for rheumatoid arthritis) finally achieved success in autoimmune diseases, validating kinases as targets in inflammation. However, kinase inhibitors for metabolic diseases like diabetes generally failed to reach market due to toxicity concerns, confirming the "severe side effects" challenge the author noted.

**Selectivity Debate Evolution:** The selectivity question continued without clear resolution. Some highly selective inhibitors succeeded (vemurafenib for BRAF-mutant melanoma, approved 2011), while multi-kinase inhibitors remained important tools, particularly in cancers where resistance to selective agents emerged. The clinical reality matched the author's prediction: the answer remained "it depends" based on disease context.

**Scientific Maturation:** Kinase research did mature from "hot" to "useful" as the author suggested. Better structural biology, improved chemical tool compounds, and accumulated clinical experience gradually enabled more rational design. However, many kinase targets identified in the early 2000s failed in late-stage trials, and companies faced increasing challenges differentiating new kinase inhibitors from existing therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions about kinase drug development:

• **Prediction:** "the kinase field may never regain its hot status. But who knows, it may make it all the way to useful and valuable, bypassing 'hot' completely"  
**Outcome:** This proved largely accurate. Kinase research never regained the intense hype of the early 2000s, but evolved into a mature therapeutic area with steady drug approvals and established clinical utility. Kinase inhibitors became standard-of-care in many cancer types.

• **Prediction:** "we're waiting, whether we know it or not, for our understanding of the biology to catch up"  
**Outcome:** Confirmed. Understanding of kinase networks, resistance mechanisms, and patient stratification improved significantly between 2009-2025, enabling better clinical trial design. However, biological complexity remained challenging, and many programs still failed due to insufficient target validation.

• **Prediction:** Non-oncology applications would remain slower due to tolerability concerns  
**Outcome:** Correct. While some successes emerged (particularly JAK inhibitors in autoimmune diseases), kinase inhibitors generally struggled outside oncology. Cardiovascular applications largely failed, and metabolic disease targets remained elusive due to on-target toxicity in normal tissues.

• **Prediction:** Selectivity strategy would remain context-dependent  
**Outcome:** Accurate. Both selective and multi-kinase inhibitors found continued utility. The optimal selectivity profile depended heavily on indication, with narrow-spectrum drugs often facing rapid resistance and broad-spectrum drugs carrying higher toxicity burden.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article captured a pivotal moment in kinase drug development with well-reasoned analysis that largely predicted (rather than merely described) the field's evolution. Its balanced assessment of industry "hangover" and long-term value proved both honest and prescient. The piece remains relevant for understanding how therapeutic areas mature from early hype to clinical utility.
