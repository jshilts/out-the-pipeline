# Phase II Failures (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary highlighted a worrying dip in Phase II success rates for new‑drug projects. Using data from the Centre for Medicines Research (CMR) on 16 major pharma companies (≈60 % of global R&D spend), the author noted that the proportion of projects that progressed from Phase II to Phase III fell from **28 % (2006‑07)** to **18 % (2008‑09)**.  

Among the 108 Phase II failures recorded for 2008‑10, the stated reasons were:  
* **≈50 %** – lack of efficacy,  
* **≈19 %** – safety concerns,  
* the remainder – “strategic” decisions (e.g., insufficient differentiation in a crowded therapeutic space).  

Four therapeutic areas accounted for nearly 70 % of the failures: **cardiovascular, central‑nervous‑system (CNS), metabolic (largely diabetes), and oncology**. The piece suggested that in fields with strong standard‑of‑care options (especially cardiovascular), new candidates faced a high bar for both efficacy and cost‑effectiveness, contributing to the slump.

## 2. HISTORY  
### Phase‑II success rates after 2010  
* **2011‑2015:** Industry surveys (e.g., BIO, Deloitte) reported a modest rebound, with Phase II success rates hovering around **25‑30 %**. The recovery was attributed to better target validation, increased use of biomarkers, and a shift toward biologics.  
* **2016‑2022:** The **2022 BIO R&D Outlook** placed the Phase II success rate at **≈31 %** for all modalities, with biologics slightly higher (~34 %) than small molecules (~28 %). This marks a clear reversal of the 2008‑09 dip noted in the article.  
* **2023‑2025:** Preliminary data from the **Pharma Intelligence “R&D Productivity”** report suggest a plateau around **30‑32 %**, with incremental gains driven by adaptive trial designs and real‑world evidence integration.

### Therapeutic‑area outcomes  

| Area | Notable successes (post‑2011) | Overall trend |
|------|------------------------------|---------------|
| **Cardiovascular** | *PCSK9 inhibitors* (evolocumab, alirocumab) approved 2015; *SGLT2 inhibitors* (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) repurposed for heart failure 2020‑22; *bempedoic acid* (2020). | Phase II success rose to ~30 % by mid‑2010s, helped by novel mechanisms beyond traditional lipid‑lowering. |
| **CNS** | *Aducanumab* (2021, controversial approval); *Lecanemab* (2023) for Alzheimer’s; *Duloxetine* and *vortioxetine* continued; *Esketamine* (2019) for depression. | Success rates remain low (~15‑20 % in Phase II) but a handful of high‑profile approvals have occurred, largely driven by biomarker‑guided trials. |
| **Metabolic (Diabetes)** | *SGLT2 inhibitors* (empagliflozin 2014, dapagliflozin 2014) and *GLP‑1 agonists* (semaglutide 2017) achieved major approvals; *dual GIP/GLP‑1* (tirzepatide 2022) expanded the class. | Phase II success improved to ~30 % as the field moved toward combination mechanisms and cardiovascular outcome trials. |
| **Oncology** | *PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors* (pembrolizumab 2014, nivolumab 2014) and *CAR‑T* therapies (tisagenlecleucel 2017) transformed the pipeline; numerous targeted kinase inhibitors approved. | Oncology Phase II success climbed to **≈35 %** by 2020, the highest among therapeutic areas, reflecting biomarker‑driven patient selection. |

### Strategic failures & M&A impact  
* The early 2010s saw a wave of **pipeline culls** after large mergers (e.g., Pfizer‑Wyeth 2009, Merck‑Schering‑Plough 2009). Companies routinely dropped projects deemed “non‑core” or insufficiently differentiated, matching the article’s “strategic” failure category.  
* By the mid‑2010s, **portfolio‑management tools** (e.g., portfolio scoring, external innovation scouting) reduced the proportion of purely strategic terminations; most Phase II exits were now justified by data (efficacy/safety).  

### Broader industry shifts  
* **Biologics dominance:** By 2024, biologics accounted for **≈55 %** of all FDA NMEs, and their Phase II success rates consistently outperformed small molecules.  
* **Adaptive & seamless designs:** The adoption of **Phase II/III seamless trials** and **platform trials** (e.g., I-SPY2 for oncology, ADAPT‑AD for Alzheimer’s) improved decision‑making speed and reduced attrition.  
* **Regulatory evolution:** The FDA’s **Breakthrough Therapy** and **Accelerated Approval** pathways, introduced in 2012, have allowed some drugs with modest Phase II data to reach patients earlier, though post‑marketing confirmatory failures remain a concern.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several expectations. Below each is paired with the observed outcome.

- **Prediction:** *Phase II success rates would continue to fall, reaching below 15 %.*  
  **Outcome:** **Incorrect.** After the 2008‑09 dip, rates recovered to ~30 % and have remained stable; no sustained decline below 15 % occurred.

- **Prediction:** *Strategic failures would be common, especially in crowded therapeutic areas.*  
  **Outcome:** **Partially correct.** Early‑2010s pipeline cuts were indeed strategic, but later years saw a shift toward data‑driven terminations. The proportion of “strategic” exits fell from ~30 % of Phase II stops (2010) to <10 % by 2020.

- **Prediction:** *Cardiovascular drugs would suffer the most because the standard of care is strong and cheap.*  
  **Outcome:** **Mixed.** While many CV candidates failed in the early 2010s, the introduction of PCSK9 inhibitors and SGLT2 agents demonstrated that novel mechanisms can break through, leading to a modest rise in CV Phase II success (≈30 % by 2018). However, the overall CV attrition rate remains higher than in oncology.

- **Prediction:** *CNS and oncology would remain high‑risk, with many failures.*  
  **Outcome:** **Accurate for CNS; partially accurate for oncology.** CNS Phase II attrition stayed high (~70 % failure), but oncology saw a notable improvement, driven by immunotherapy and biomarker‑guided trials, lifting its Phase II success to the highest among all areas.

- **Prediction:** *Mergers and acquisitions would explain many “strategic” failures.*  
  **Outcome:** **Correct for the early‑2010s.** The 2009‑2012 wave of mega‑mergers coincided with a spike in strategic terminations. Post‑2015, M&A activity still influences pipelines, but the effect on Phase II attrition has diminished.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The piece is a useful snapshot of a pivotal moment in pharma R&D productivity, and its observations about strategic failures and therapeutic‑area risk patterns remain relevant for understanding how the industry adapted over the subsequent decade.
