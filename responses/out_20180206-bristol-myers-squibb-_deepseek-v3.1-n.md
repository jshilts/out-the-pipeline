# Bristol-Myers Squibb Sows Confusion (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Bristol-Myers Squibb's announcement of the CheckMate-227 clinical trial results, which tested the combination of Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab) in lung cancer patients. The trial was highly anticipated as BMS had been losing ground to Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the competitive immuno-oncology space. However, BMS made unexpected changes to the trial's primary endpoint: rather than focusing on PD-L1 status as planned, they retrospectively made tumor mutation burden (TMB) the main success measure and pooled results from both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patient groups. The company had not disclosed these changes beforehand, leading to significant confusion and suspicion among observers about whether the modifications were designed to produce more favorable results. The lack of transparency left fundamental questions unanswered—specifically whether the Opdivo/Yervoy combination was actually superior to Opdivo alone or chemotherapy.

## 2. HISTORY

The aftermath of the CheckMate-227 trial revelations had substantial real-world consequences. The FDA approved the Opdivo/Yervoy combination for first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in May 2020, though importantly this approval was based on overall survival data rather than the controversial TMB findings. The agency specifically granted approval for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, effectively sidelining TMB as a predictive biomarker for this indication.

TMB has subsequently shown modest utility in certain contexts, with the FDA granting accelerated approval for pembrolizumab in TMB-high solid tumors in 2020 (an approval that was later voluntarily withdrawn by Merck in 2022 after confirmatory trials failed). In clinical practice, TMB has not become a widely adopted biomarker for immuno-oncology treatment selection in lung cancer, with PD-L1 expression remaining the primary biomarker for first-line treatment decisions. The combination therapy did eventually demonstrate overall survival benefit, leading to its incorporation into treatment guidelines, though with significant toxicity concerns that limit its use compared to single-agent PD-1 inhibitors.

The competitive landscape evolved with Merck's Keytruda maintaining market leadership in lung cancer, highlighting that the CheckMate-227 modifications did not fundamentally shift the competitive dynamics that the article described. The episode served as a cautionary tale about clinical trial transparency and biomarker validation in drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Trial design concerns would lead to confusion and skepticism** - **Accurate**: The article noted that changing endpoints and lack of transparency would raise suspicions and questions that remained unanswered. This proved correct, as the FDA's eventual approval bypassed the controversial TMB findings entirely, focusing instead on overall survival data.

• **The immuno-oncology field would remain wide open with clarity arriving slowly** - **Accurate**: The competitive landscape stayed competitive, with multiple combination approaches being explored. However, single-agent PD-1 inhibitors (particularly Merck's Keytruda) continued to dominate first-line lung cancer treatment rather than being displaced by combination therapies as some had anticipated.

• **TMB as predictor would face skepticism due to lack of overall survival correlation** - **Accurate**: TMB has not become a standard biomarker for treatment selection in lung cancer. While it shows some correlation with response rates, it has not demonstrated consistent overall survival prediction and is not widely used in clinical decision-making.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in immuno-oncology development where questionable clinical trial practices intersected with competitive market pressures and biomarker validation challenges. The episode has ongoing relevance for understanding drug development methodology, regulatory scrutiny, and the evolution of cancer immunotherapy biomarkers.
