# Is HDL Always (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The commentary reflects on the disappointment surrounding Roche’s CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib, which failed to improve cardiovascular outcomes despite raising HDL‑cholesterol (HDL‑C). The author points out a pattern of “puzzling” failures in the lipoprotein field—niacin, fenofibrate, and the apoA‑I Milano program—suggesting that our mechanistic understanding of HDL is incomplete. A newly published genome‑wide association study (GWAS) is highlighted: among many lipid‑affecting variants, one that selectively raises HDL‑C did **not** lower cardiovascular risk, whereas LDL‑lowering variants consistently did. The piece concludes that HDL‑C is not a simple “good cholesterol” and that the future of CETP inhibition (and HDL‑targeted therapy more broadly) remains uncertain.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Post‑2012 clinical trial outcomes  
| Drug / Approach | Trial(s) & Year(s) | Result | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dalcetrapib** (Roche) | *dal‑OUTCOMES* (2014) | No reduction in major cardiovascular events; trial stopped early for futility. | Development halted; reinforced skepticism about CETP inhibition that merely raises HDL‑C. |
| **Evacetrapib** (Eli Lilly) | *ACCELERATE* (2017) | Large‑scale trial stopped after ~12 months because it showed no clinical benefit despite large HDL‑C increase and modest LDL‑C reduction. | Program discontinued; highlighted that HDL‑C elevation alone is insufficient. |
| **Anacetrapib** (Merck) | *REVEAL* (2017) | Modest 9% relative risk reduction in major coronary events; HDL‑C rose ~130 % and LDL‑C fell ~18 %. Benefit attributed mainly to LDL‑C lowering; drug not pursued for approval. | Demonstrated that CETP inhibition can work if LDL‑C is also reduced, but commercial interest waned. |
| **Niacin** (extended‑release) | *AIM‑HIGH* (2011) & *HPS2‑THRIVE* (2014) | No incremental benefit on top of statin therapy despite HDL‑C rise. | Niacin fell out of guideline recommendations. |
| **ApoA‑I Milano infusions** | Various phase II/III studies (2000s‑2010s) | Mixed, generally neutral effects on atherosclerosis progression; no FDA‑approved product. | Concept remains experimental; focus shifted to HDL function rather than quantity. |

### Genetic and mechanistic insights  
* **Mendelian randomization** studies (e.g., Voight et al., *Lancet* 2012; 2015 updates) confirmed that genetic variants that raise HDL‑C without affecting other lipids do **not** lower myocardial infarction risk, supporting the article’s GWAS observation.  
* Research shifted toward **HDL functionality** (cholesterol efflux capacity, anti‑inflammatory properties) as a more relevant biomarker; several cohort studies (e.g., Khera et al., *N Engl J Med* 2011) showed that efflux capacity predicts events independently of HDL‑C levels.  
* The field’s therapeutic focus moved away from simply raising HDL‑C to **modulating LDL‑C** (PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid) and **targeting inflammation** (canakinumab, colchicine), both of which have demonstrated outcome benefits.

### Policy and guideline changes  
* The 2018 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline placed **LDL‑C** as the primary therapeutic target; HDL‑C is mentioned only as a risk marker, not a treatment goal.  
* No FDA‑approved HDL‑raising drug exists as of 2024; all major CETP programs are discontinued or deprioritized.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction in the article:** “What this means for things like CETP inhibition is anyone’s guess.”  
  - **Outcome:** Subsequent CETP trials (evacetrapib, anacetrapib) showed that HDL‑C elevation alone does not translate into clinical benefit; only modest benefit when LDL‑C is also lowered (anacetrapib). The “guess” turned out to be that CETP inhibition would not revive HDL‑C as a therapeutic lever, and the industry largely abandoned the approach.

- **Implicit prediction:** HDL‑C is not a reliable therapeutic target despite being a risk marker.  
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed by multiple large trials (dalcetrapib, niacin, evacetrapib) and genetic studies; HDL‑C raising strategies have not produced approved drugs. Research now emphasizes HDL function rather than concentration.

- **Implicit prediction:** LDL‑lowering mechanisms will dominate future cardiovascular drug development.  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab) and the modest LDL‑lowering effect of anacetrapib have become the cornerstone of recent therapeutic advances, while HDL‑centric strategies have stalled.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment when optimism about HDL‑targeted therapy collapsed, and its discussion of genetics presaged the shift toward LDL‑centric and functional‑HDL research—topics that shaped cardiovascular drug development over the next decade.
