# Should Drug Industry Research All Get Rejected for Publication? (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a heated debate published in the British Medical Journal asking whether medical journals should stop publishing research funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Richard Smith (former BMJ editor) and Peter C. Gøtzsche argued "yes," comparing drug companies to tobacco companies and claiming prescribed drugs are the "third leading cause of death." They cited bias in industry-funded trials and made dramatic claims, including that olanzapine (Zyprexa) "probably caused 200,000 deaths."

Taking the opposing view, Trish Groves of BMJ rejected the tobacco industry comparison as "offensive and ridiculous." She acknowledged problems with selective reporting but argued that investigator-led trials also have bias, and pointed to reforms like trial registration requirements, mandatory results reporting, the AllTrials campaign, and the RIAT (Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials) initiative. The article's author (himself a drug industry scientist) strongly favored Groves' position, viewing the "mass murder" accusations as unsupported and inflammatory.

## 2. HISTORY

Looking at what actually happened after January 2014, the landscape evolved toward greater transparency rather than blanket exclusion of industry research:

**Transparency Reforms Gained Momentum:**
- The **AllTrials campaign** (mentioned in the article) continued growing, ultimately involving over 600 organizations and 85,000 individuals by 2020, successfully pressuring institutions and regulators
- **Trial registration requirements** expanded: In 2016, Health Canada mandated registration; the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (2014) came into full effect requiring registration and results posting
- **ClinicalTrials.gov** increased enforcement of reporting requirements, with FDA beginning to levy fines for non-compliance starting in2015

**FDA Approval and Post-Market Outcomes for Olanzapine:**
- Olanzapine (Zyprexa) remains on the market with a **Black Box warning** for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis
- Post-market surveillance showed metabolic side effects remain significant, but widespread clinical use continued for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
- The "200,000 deaths" claim by Gøtzsche was never substantiated in peer-reviewed literature or regulatory findings

**The Transparency Movement's Concrete Impact:**
- **RIAT initiative** resulted in multiple "restored" trial publications, revealing hidden data that sometimes contradicted original positive findings
- **EMA Policy 0070** (2016-2020) allowed patient-level data access for research, though with significant redaction requirements
- Many major journals implemented stricter conflict-of-interest disclosure requirements
- Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted data-sharing platforms (e.g., ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com, Vivli)

**What Didn't Happen:**
- No major journals adopted blanket bans on industry-funded research
- The tobacco industry comparison did not gain institutional traction
- Industry funding of clinical trials remained the norm, not the exception

**The Practical Reality Became Clearer:**
- Investigator-led trials also face bias problems, as Groves noted
- Complete elimination of industry-funded research would eliminate the majority of drug trials, as industry funds an estimated 70-80% of clinical research
- The focus shifted to transparency and rigorous peer review rather than funding source exclusion
- Some high-profile cases (e.g., Tamiflu data controversies) illustrated both the value of transparency and the complexity of interpreting "hidden" data

The empirical evidence shows the debate evolved toward regulatory and transparency solutions rather than publication bans, reflecting the practical reality that most drug development requires industry funding.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Explicit Predictions in the Article:**

• **Smith & Gøtzsche predicted that industry research should be excluded from journals entirely due to corruption similar to tobacco companies.**
  - *Reality:* No major journals adopted this policy. Instead, transparency reforms became the standard approach. The "tobacco company" framing failed to gain institutional acceptance.

• **Smith & Gøtzsche predicted that prescribed drugs being "the third leading cause of death" argument would justify excluding industry research.**
  - *Reality:* While medication-related deaths remain a serious concern (adverse drug events do cause significant mortality), this framing did not lead to exclusion policies. Public health focus shifted toward medication safety, pharmacovigilance, and post-market surveillance rather than research publication bans.

• **The author predicted the tone of the debate might moderate after scrutiny.**
  - *Reality:* The extreme claims (like 200,000 deaths from olanzapine) were not substantiated and did not become mainstream scientific consensus. The discussion moved toward evidence-based reforms.

**Implicit Prediction:**

• **Groves and the article's author implicitly predicted that transparency measures (registration, data sharing, RIAT) would be more effective than exclusion.**
  - *Reality:* This proved largely accurate—transparency reforms proliferated and became standard practice, while exclusion policies did not materialize.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a moment when concerns about publication bias and industry influence reached a fever pitch, yet the reforms that actually emerged were more pragmatic than the radical proposals discussed. The gap between the dramatic accusations and the measured institutional responses that followed makes this a valuable case study in how scientific reform actually happens.
