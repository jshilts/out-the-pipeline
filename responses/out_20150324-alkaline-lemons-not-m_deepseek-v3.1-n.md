# Alkaline Lemons. Not a Misprint. (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article critiques "Food Babe" (Vani Hari) and her health claims as reported in a New York magazine profile. The author takes issue with her assertion that "lemon water is very alkaline" and claims that "an acidic body promotes disease." The piece argues that these statements contradict basic scientific understanding—noting that lemons are actually acidic, that the body tightly regulates its own pH levels, and that the premise of systemic pH imbalance causing disease is fundamentally flawed. The tone is highly critical, dismissing such pH-based health advice as nonsensical.

## 2. HISTORY

Over the subsequent years, the scientific and medical consensus around alkaline diets and pH-balancing claims remained unchanged: these concepts continue to be regarded as pseudoscience. No peer-reviewed evidence emerged to support claims that alkaline foods or water meaningfully alter systemic body pH or prevent disease.

Vani Hari (Food Babe) maintained her platform and expanded her influence through books, speaking engagements, and social media, though she faced continued criticism from scientists and science communicators regarding her claims. She shifted some focus toward food additives and organic advocacy. No regulatory action or policy changes occurred that would validate alkaline diet claims.

The broader wellness industry, however, continued to market alkaline water products and pH-focused supplements. Companies like Essentia Water built substantial businesses around alkaline water, despite ongoing scientific debunking. This illustrates how market demand for wellness products often persists independent of scientific evidence.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained implicit predictions about the validity of pH-based health claims:

• **pH diets would remain scientifically unsupported**: ✓ **Correct**. No credible scientific evidence emerged to validate systemic pH manipulation through diet as a disease prevention strategy.

• **Basic scientific literacy would recognize these claims as flawed**: ✓ **Correct**. The scientific community's position remained consistent—the body's pH regulation is automatic and not meaningfully altered by dietary choices like lemon water.

• **Those promoting such claims would face criticism**: ✓ **Correct**. Vani Hari continued to face extensive criticism from scientists, physicians, and science educators for promoting scientifically unsupported health claims.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **3/10**

While accurately identifying pseudoscience, the article lacks substantive connection to biotechnology industry developments, focusing instead on consumer wellness misinformation. Its relevance to biotechnology—as opposed to general science communication—is limited.
