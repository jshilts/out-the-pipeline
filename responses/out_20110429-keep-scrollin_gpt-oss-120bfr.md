# Keep On Scrollin' (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short blog post reflects on how scientists skim journal RSS feeds and decide, within a few seconds, whether a paper is worth opening. The author lists several stereotypical titles that would make a reader “speed up” or “slow down,” emphasizing personal bias toward novelty, relevance, and methodological elegance. The piece is essentially a tongue‑in‑cheek commentary on information overload in the life‑science literature, warning that many papers—especially those describing routine natural‑product isolation, incremental catalyst improvements, or overly niche nanomaterial constructs—are routinely ignored.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2011 the problem of “scroll fatigue” has intensified rather than disappeared. A few concrete developments illustrate how the community has responded:

* **Pre‑print servers and overlay journals** – bioRxiv (launched 2013) and medRxiv have become primary venues for early dissemination. Their simple, title‑only listings have forced authors to craft clearer, more compelling headlines, and many readers now scan pre‑print feeds before journal tables of contents.  
* **AI‑driven literature recommendation** – Tools such as Semantic Scholar, PubMed’s “Similar articles,” and later large‑language‑model (LLM) assistants (e.g., Elicit, Scite) have been adopted in academic labs. These services rank papers by relevance rather than by journal prestige, reducing reliance on eye‑catching titles alone.  
* **Open‑access mandates** – Funding‑agency policies (e.g., NIH Public Access, Plan S in Europe) have increased the volume of freely available articles, further expanding the pool that researchers must triage.  
* **Rise of “Methods” journals** – Dedicated venues like *Nature Methods*, *Cell Reports Methods*, and *Methods in Molecular Biology* have grown, offering concise, method‑focused abstracts that help readers quickly assess utility.  
* **Metrics of attention** – Altmetric scores and article‑level usage statistics are now displayed alongside titles on many publisher platforms, giving an additional signal of community interest that can override a bland title.  
* **Continued “incremental” publishing** – Despite the above, the bulk of the literature still consists of incremental chemistry or biology papers (e.g., modest enantiomeric excess improvements, routine natural‑product isolation). Their citation impact remains low, confirming the author’s original observation that such work is often skimmed past.  

Overall, the ecosystem has added layers of filtering (AI, metrics, pre‑prints) but the core issue—too many papers for limited human attention—remains.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The post itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implies several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Researchers will increasingly ignore routine natural‑product isolation papers** | True. Citation analyses show that papers describing known metabolites from common sources receive far fewer citations than those reporting new bioactivities or novel synthetic routes. |
| **Large, cumbersome catalysts with marginal gains will be less attractive** | Partially true. The field of asymmetric catalysis has shifted toward “designer” organocatalysts and biocatalysts that are smaller, more modular, and often commercially available. However, some high‑impact papers still report complex metal‑based systems when they enable unprecedented reactivity. |
| **Nanomaterial hype (e.g., nanorods on nanoplates) will wane** | Largely accurate. The early 2010s saw a flood of exotic nanostructure papers; by the late 2010s the community refocused on functional applications (drug delivery, sensing) rather than purely structural novelty. |
| **“Green Chemistry” series will proliferate** | Correct. The “Green Chemistry” journal and related special issues have multiplied, and many journals now require a “green” statement, reflecting genuine industry and academic interest. |
| **Readers will rely more on abstract content than title flair** | Mixed. While abstract quality remains crucial, AI‑driven summarizers and recommendation engines now often replace the human abstract scan, meaning titles matter less for discovery but still affect click‑through rates. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece captures a timeless, relatable frustration among scientists and foreshadows the need for better literature‑filtering tools, but it offers no substantive data or novel insight beyond personal anecdote. Its relevance has grown with the explosion of publications, yet its impact on the field has been modest.
