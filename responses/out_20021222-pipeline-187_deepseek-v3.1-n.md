# Clearance Sale (22 Dec 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses how the human body processes foreign substances through Phase I and Phase II enzyme systems. Phase I enzymes, particularly P450 enzymes in the liver, oxidize molecules to make them more water-soluble for excretion. Phase II enzymes attach disposal tags like glucuronic acid or glutathione to facilitate removal. The author notes that poor clearance can lead to tissue accumulation and potential harm, citing heavy metals like lead and mercury as problematic due to their poor fit with P450 enzymes.

The article then pivots to discuss thimerosal (a mercury-containing preservative), referencing a recent Lancet study that found mercury was eliminated through the GI tract primarily as elemental mercury, with faster excretion than expected. The author expresses skepticism about thimerosal causing autism, noting that if such an effect exists, it would likely occur in only a few susceptible children, and the available evidence doesn't support this hypothesis.

## 2. HISTORY

The thimerosal-autism controversy evolved significantly after this 2002 article. In 2004, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) conducted a comprehensive review concluding that the evidence favored rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Multiple large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in various countries between 2003-2019 consistently found no association between thimerosal exposure and autism rates.

In response to public concerns, thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines in the United States and other developed countries as a precautionary measure, despite the lack of scientific evidence linking it to autism. Autism prevalence rates continued to rise even after thimerosal removal, further undermining the hypothesis.

The scientific consensus remains that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism. The Lancet study referenced in the article (likely by Pichichero et al., 2002) was part of a growing body of evidence showing thimerosal was metabolized and excreted efficiently. Subsequent research confirmed these findings, though some critics continued to raise concerns about potential effects in susceptible subpopulations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Elemental mercury excretion**: The article suggested that conversion to elemental mercury was beneficial due to its low solubility and harmlessness. This prediction held true - subsequent research confirmed that thimerosal is rapidly metabolized to ethylmercury and inorganic mercury, which are efficiently excreted, though the exact metabolic pathways remained an area of ongoing study.

• **Thimerosal-autism hypothesis would be ruled out**: The author expressed strong skepticism that thimerosal causes autism and suggested that accumulating evidence would disprove this hypothesis. This prediction proved largely correct - the scientific consensus firmly rejects this causal relationship, though the controversy persisted in public discourse far longer than the author anticipated.

• **Subpopulation susceptibility concern would be addressed by future studies**: The author acknowledged the limitation that small studies might miss susceptible individuals. This concern was addressed through numerous large-scale epidemiological studies across multiple populations, which consistently found no evidence supporting differential susceptibility to thimerosal-related autism effects.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article touches on the important thimerosal-autism controversy and demonstrates generally sound pharmacokinetic reasoning, but its impact was limited by being published during early stages of the controversy when the scientific evidence was still accumulating.
