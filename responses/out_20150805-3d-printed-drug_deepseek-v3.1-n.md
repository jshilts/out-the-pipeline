# 3D Printed Drug? (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2015 commentary discusses what was billed as the "world's first 3D-printed drug" — actually Spirtam, Aprecia's fast-dissolve formulation of the epilepsy drug levetiracetam. The author corrects the hype: this wasn't a 3D-printed drug molecule, but rather a 3D-printed drug formulation. The technology enabled creation of porous tablets that dissolve rapidly in the mouth, marketed for patients (especially children and elderly) who have difficulty swallowing the standard high-dose tablets (250mg–1g) of this generic epilepsy medication.

The article explains the complexities of oral drug formulation—balancing absorption, particle size, crystalline structure, pH effects, and excipients—and notes that the fast-dissolve approach is limited to highly soluble drugs that are hard to swallow. The author speculates that while the technology won't work for poorly soluble drugs or those that need enteric (small intestine) release, it does open new possibilities for structured drug tablets and formulation science.

## 2. HISTORY

**Spirtam's regulatory path and market adoption:**
- Spirtam received FDA approval in August 2015 as the first 3D-printed pharmaceutical product.
- It entered the US market as a fast-dissolving version of levetiracetam in multiple dose strengths, positioned for patients with dysphagia (swallowing difficulties).

**Technology limitations and adoption:**
- ZipDose, Aprecia's 3D printing platform, creates highly porous structures that rapidly absorb liquid and disintegrate. While innovative, the technology remained niche.
- The approach proved unsuitable for many drug classes: drugs with poor solubility, those requiring controlled/sustained release, and medications needing enteric coating for stomach-acid protection.
- No major pharmaceutical companies broadly adopted 3D printing for mainstream tablet manufacturing in the following years.

**Broader 3D printing in pharmaceuticals:**
- Triastek (China) developed a 3D printing system (MED®) for complex multi-layer tablets and received FDA clearance for clinical trials.
- In 2015, the FDA approved SPRITAM (levetiracetam) tablets—notable as the first 3D-printed drug product.
- In 2023, the FDA approved the first 3D-printed drug in pill form (produced using Triastek's technology), but 3D printing did not become the standard for pharmaceutical manufacturing.

**Business outcomes:**
- Aprecia's technology showed promise for specific patient populations, but the company did not achieve widespread adoption.  
- Spirtam likely captured a small fraction of the overall levetiracetam market due to higher costs and limited patient population (those with dysphagia) compared to traditional tablets.

**Policy and production:**  
- The FDA established frameworks for 3D-printed medical products, but no large-scale regulatory changes occurred.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction:** The author said, "This trick, I'd think, will only be useful for high-dosage medications that are otherwise hard to swallow, and it'll also only be useful for ones that have a very high solubility."
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. Spirtam targeted high-dose levetiracetam for dysphagia patients, and later 3D-printed pharmaceuticals focused on specialized applications rather than broad use. The technology didn't replace traditional manufacturing for most drugs.

- **Prediction:** The author emphasized that poorly soluble drugs or those requiring intestinal release would not benefit from rapid-dissolve 3D printing.  
  - **Outcome:** Correct. Most drug moieties have poor solubility or complex release requirements, limiting fast-dissolve approaches.

- **Prediction:** The article noted 3D printing could create "new kinds of structured drug tablets" and that formulations research would explore these possibilities.
  - **Outcome:** Partially true. Research on structured tablets and personalized dosing continued, but 3D printing remained a niche manufacturing method outside specialized applications.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article provides a clear-eyed analysis of an emerging technology overcoming early hype, but the long-term importance of 3D-printed tablets remained modest compared to other advances in pharmaceuticals, as the approach never scaled to widespread adoption.
