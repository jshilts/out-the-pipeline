# A Quick Note to Eli Lilly (March 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short blog post, published on 6 March 2012, complains that Eli Lilly’s award‑giving ceremony (the “Eli Lilly Award” for synthetic chemistry) misspelled the names of several award recipients. The author, writing on the ChemBark blog, points out the error and asks the company to take basic care with spelling, implying that such a slip looks unprofessional for a prestigious scientific prize.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **The award itself** – The Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry (administered by the American Chemical Society) continued to be presented annually after 2012. Official ACS press releases and the award‑listing pages from 2013 onward show the winners’ names spelled correctly. No further public complaints about misspellings have surfaced.  
- **Eli Lilly’s response** – There is no record of an official statement from Eli Lilly addressing the 2012 blog post. The company’s subsequent award‑related communications (e.g., 2014, 2016, 2020 announcements) display proper spelling, suggesting the issue was corrected internally, if not publicly.  
- **Impact on the industry** – The incident did not trigger any broader policy change, nor did it affect the reputation or funding of Eli Lilly’s chemistry programs. The award remains a respected accolade in the field, and the companies and institutions that sponsor it have continued their usual activities.  
- **Public perception** – The blog post received modest attention within the chemistry blogging community but did not generate wider media coverage or lasting controversy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit future forecasts, but the implicit expectation was that Eli Lilly would improve its editorial accuracy. The outcome can be evaluated as follows:

- **Prediction:** Eli Lilly will correct the misspellings in future award announcements.  
  **Outcome:** Subsequent official announcements (e.g., ACS press releases for 2013‑2023 winners) list names correctly, indicating the prediction was realized.

No other concrete predictions were made, so no further comparison is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **2/10**  
The piece is a brief, niche complaint with limited lasting relevance to biotechnology or the broader scientific enterprise. Its only lasting note is that the specific spelling error was apparently fixed.
