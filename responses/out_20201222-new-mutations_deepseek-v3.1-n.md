# The New Mutations (December 22, 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article from December 2020 discusses the emergence of two new SARS-CoV-2 variants that were causing concern at the time: the B.1.1.7 "UK variant" and the B.1.351 "South African variant." The author provides a balanced analysis focusing on what was known versus what remained uncertain at that moment in the pandemic.

The UK variant was notable for accumulating 17 mutations, including 14 amino-acid-changing mutations and 3 deletions, with 6 mutations concentrated in the Spike protein including N501Y (in the receptor-binding domain), 69-70del (a deletion associated with potential immune evasion), and P681H (near the furin cleavage site). The South African variant had 8 Spike protein mutations, with three of particular interest: K417N, E484K, and N501Y, with E484K being especially concerning as it affected a region targeted by multiple antibodies. The author notes that these variants suggested active selection pressure rather than random drift, possibly occurring in immunocompromised individuals with prolonged infections.

The article emphasizes that while increased transmissibility was suspected, it was not yet confirmed, and there was no evidence at the time that these variants caused more severe disease. The author maintains a cautiously watchful stance, acknowledging the appropriate level of scientific concern while criticizing media sensationalism that was outpacing the available evidence.

## 2. HISTORY

The two variants discussed in this article went on to have profound real-world impacts that validated and in some cases exceeded the cautious concerns expressed in December 2020.

**B.1.1.7 (Alpha/UK variant)**: Research in the months following this article confirmed that this variant was indeed significantly more transmissible (estimated 40-70% higher than previous strains). It rapidly became dominant in the UK and spread globally, contributing substantially to the winter 2020-2021 wave in Europe and North America. However, the author's assessment proved correct in several ways: vaccines maintained good effectiveness against B.1.1.7, and while it appeared to be associated with increased hospitalization and mortality risk in some studies (~40-60% increased risk), this was more modest than feared. By mid-2021, comprehensive studies showed that existing vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines, remained highly protective against severe disease and death from this variant, with effectiveness generally above 90% for preventing hospitalizations and deaths.

**B.1.351 (Beta/South African variant)**: This variant proved more concerning from an immunological perspective. Studies in early 2021 showed that it was capable of substantial immune escape, significantly reducing neutralizing antibody titers from prior infection and partially diminishing vaccine effectiveness. Real-world data from South Africa showed that AstraZeneca's vaccine had significantly reduced effectiveness against mild-to-moderate disease from this variant, leading to strategic shifts in vaccine deployment. However, vaccines generally maintained reasonable protection against severe disease even with this variant.

**Vaccine Policy and Development Impact**: The emergence of these variants had several concrete policy and scientific consequences. First, they accelerated the development and regulatory review processes for variant-specific boosters. Second, they led to increased global viral surveillance infrastructure and genomic sequencing efforts. Third, they triggered debates about vaccine strategy, including whether to use variant boosters or maintain original formulations, and highlighted concerns about global vaccine equity. By late 2021, vaccine manufacturers were producing variant-specific formulations and combination vaccines targeting both original and variant strains.

**Evolutionary Trajectory**: These variants proved to be harbingers of continued viral evolution. The P681H mutation discussed in the UK variant appeared in subsequent variants including Delta, and both N501Y and various versions of the E484 mutation appeared in later variants. The concerns about immune escape raised by the E484K mutation in the South African variant prefigured similar concerns with later variants including Gamma, Mu, and ultimately Omicron.

**Therapeutics**: These variants had variable effects on monoclonal antibody therapies. Some early antibodies saw reduced effectiveness, particularly against variants with the E484K mutation, leading to treatment guideline modifications and emphasizing the importance of combination antibody strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several specific predictions and assessments that can be evaluated in hindsight:

• **Higher transmissibility of UK variant**: ✅ **Broadly accurate**. Subsequent research confirmed B.1.1.7 was 40-70% more transmissible, and it did become dominant in the UK and spread globally.

• **Vaccine effectiveness would be largely maintained**: ✅ **Mostly accurate for B.1.1.7, but needed qualification for B.1.351**. The author's assessment that vaccine effectiveness would persist proved broadly correct for the UK variant, with studies showing good protection against severe disease. However, the South African variant did reduce neutralizing titers more substantially, and real-world effectiveness against symptomatic infection was indeed lower than for previous strains (though protection against severe disease remained).

• **Disease severity assessment**: ✅ **Generally accurate**. Neither variant proved to cause dramatically more severe disease in the extreme sense feared by some, though B.1.1.7 did show a modest increase in hospitalization risk. Neither variant exhibited the "much worse clinical course" that concerned observers had feared.

• **Timeline for better data**: ✅ **Accurate**. The author predicted weeks to months for clearer data, and indeed by February-March 2021, solid epidemiological and laboratory data had emerged on both variants' characteristics.

• **Mechanism of emergence (immunocompromised patients)**: ⚠️ **Plausible but not definitively proven**. Subsequent research has suggested this as one plausible pathway for variant emergence, but definitive proof for these specific variants remains challenging to establish due to genetic bottlenecks and other complexities. This mechanism has gained support as a general pathway for viral adaptation in various systems.

• **Antibody response being polyclonal would provide resilience**: ✅ **Broadly accurate**. While neutralization titers were reduced against some variants, indeed the polyclonal nature of the immune response did generally maintain protection against severe disease across variants, particularly after booster doses.

• **Infectivity vs. virulence trade-off**: ⚠️ **No clear signal yet**. While conceptually sound as a long-term evolutionary trend, over the 1-2 year timeframe after these variants, clear reductions in virulence did not emerge (and Omicron actually demonstrated that increased transmissibility could coexist with somewhat reduced average severity in certain populations due to pre-existing immunity). The basic evolutionary prediction remains sound but short-term outcomes are complex.

• **Virus would continue evolving**: ✅ **Dramatically confirmed**. These variants were just the beginning of what became a continuing series of variants of concern, culminating in Omicron and its many sublineages showing even more extensive patterns of immune escape and transmissibility.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates excellent scientific journalism for its time—balancing appropriate concern with measured assessment of uncertainty, and correctly identifying the key questions. The variants discussed proved to be genuinely important, not just media sensations, making the article's carefully calibrated analysis both prescient and useful for understanding the dynamics of pandemic viral evolution.
