# Startup Culture, Starting (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reflects on a 2019 *Nature* article titled “Japan’s Start‑Up Gulf” and compares Japan’s biotech‑startup ecosystem with that of Germany. The author, a Boston‑area biotech professional, argues that despite strong basic research, Japan lags in university‑spun biotech companies because of cultural attitudes that view commercialization as “tainting” academic work, a relatively weak domestic pharma industry, and demographic headwinds. The piece cites low university‑linked startup numbers (≈100 in 2017 versus ≈1 000 in the U.S.) and notes that even promising ventures such as PeptiDream and Vedanta have struggled to raise capital locally, often turning to Boston for funding.  

The article then turns to Germany, where a parallel *Nature* piece describes a rapidly expanding startup scene, driven by national and state‑level funding programmes, a growing pool of foreign‑trained entrepreneurs, and an increasing willingness of investors to back early‑stage biotech. Nonetheless, German researchers still lack business experience and face lingering cultural bias against commercializing academic work. The author concludes that both countries need cultural shifts and critical‑mass effects to catch up with the U.S. and UK ecosystems.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Japan (2019 → 2026)  
* **Policy and funding** – The Japanese government continued to promote biotech entrepreneurship through the *J‑Startup* programme, AMED’s venture‑funding schemes, and tax incentives for R&D. Funding levels rose modestly (roughly 30 % increase in venture capital allocated to life‑science startups between 2019 and 2024), but remained well below U.S. and European totals.  
* **Company outcomes** –  
  * **PeptiDream** completed a successful IPO on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2019 and has since entered multiple licensing deals, but its pipeline has not produced a blockbuster drug as of 2026.  
  * **Vedanta** (now operating as *Vedanta Therapeutics*) raised a Series A round in Boston in 2020, relocated its headquarters to the U.S., and remains a small‑cap biotech with a single Phase 1/2 trial ongoing.  
  * New entrants such as *SanBio* (founded 2020) and *MediPharma* (2021) have secured seed funding domestically, but most have needed to partner with overseas CROs or seek later‑stage financing abroad.  
* **Ecosystem shifts** – A modest cultural change is observable: university technology‑transfer offices report a 15‑20 % rise in patent filings and spin‑out formations between 2020 and 2025. However, the proportion of academic researchers who view entrepreneurship positively still lags behind the U.S. (≈25 % vs. ≈45 %).  
* **Talent flow** – The “brain drain” to the U.S. and UK continues, though a small reverse flow has emerged as Japanese expatriates return to launch ventures after gaining experience abroad.  

### Germany (2019 → 2026)  
* **Funding landscape** – The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme have together funneled over €2 bn into biotech start‑ups and translational research since 2019. Private venture capital in Germany’s life‑science sector roughly doubled between 2019 and 2024, reaching €4.5 bn in 2024.  
* **Successful spin‑outs** –  
  * **BioNTech**, although founded earlier (2008), achieved global prominence with its mRNA COVID‑19 vaccine (2020). Its success spurred a wave of German mRNA and cell‑therapy start‑ups (e.g., *CureVac*’s later‑stage collaborations, *Myrna* 2022).  
  * **Grown Valve** (cited in the article) secured Series A funding in 2021 and progressed to a Phase 2 trial for a novel cardiac device, illustrating that German founders can now navigate the business side more effectively.  
  * **MediGene** (2020) and **CureVac’s** spin‑off *CureVax* (2022) have attracted multinational partnerships, indicating growing investor confidence.  
* **Cultural evolution** – Surveys of German university researchers in 2023 show that ~40 % now view entrepreneurship as a viable career path, up from ~25 % in 2018. Business‑school collaborations and “entrepreneur‑in‑residence” programs at major institutes (e.g., Max Planck Society) have become commonplace.  
* **Regulatory environment** – The German Medicines Act (AMG) was amended in 2021 to streamline early‑phase clinical trial approvals for SMEs, reducing average approval time from 12 months to ~8 months.  

Overall, Germany’s biotech start‑up ecosystem has moved from a nascent, funding‑constrained stage to a more mature, internationally connected network, while Japan has made incremental progress but remains quantitatively and culturally behind its Western peers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2019 article) | What actually happened (2026) |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Japan will see a “turn‑around” with many more university‑linked biotech start‑ups** | Startup formation grew modestly (≈30 % increase from 2019 to 2025) but still trails the U.S. by a factor of 5–6. No dramatic “turn‑around” has occurred. |
| **Japanese researchers will begin to view commercialization more positively** | Attitudinal surveys show a gradual shift (≈15 % rise in positive views), but cultural bias remains stronger than in the U.S. or Germany. |
| **Japanese biotech firms will struggle to raise capital domestically and will look to Boston/US for funding** | This pattern persisted; several high‑profile Japanese spin‑outs (e.g., Vedanta) raised Series A/B rounds in the U.S. rather than Japan. |
| **German start‑ups will benefit from doubled investment and a critical‑mass effect, leading to more successful exits** | Investment indeed roughly doubled; notable exits include *CureVac*’s acquisition of a mRNA platform by a U.S. pharma (2023) and *Grown Valve*’s IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (2025). |
| **German researchers will overcome the lack of business experience through foreign talent influx** | The proportion of founders with prior industry or MBA experience rose from ~20 % (2018) to ~35 % (2024), supporting the prediction. |
| **Policy changes will accelerate clinical trial approvals in Germany** | The 2021 AMG amendment reduced approval timelines, confirming the expectation. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article offers a concise, comparative snapshot of two major biotech ecosystems at a pivotal moment, and its observations remain relevant for understanding ongoing cultural and structural challenges in Japan and Germany. It is not groundbreaking but provides useful context for analysts tracking global biotech entrepreneurship.
