# Waiting for the FDA (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This February 2005 commentary addresses the FDA's ongoing review of COX-2 inhibitors, a class of pain-relief drugs that had recently faced safety concerns. The author predicted that Bextra (valdecoxib, Pfizer) might be withdrawn from the US market, while Celebrex (celecoxib, Pfizer) would likely remain with strengthened warnings and narrower prescribing guidance—essentially restricted to patients who cannot tolerate traditional NSAIDs. The author suggested Merck's Vioxx (rofecoxib), which had been voluntarily recalled, could plausibly return to market under similar restrictions. Regarding pipeline drugs Arcoxia (etoricoxib, Merck) and Prexige (lumiracoxib, Novartis), the author expected the FDA would demand substantial cardiovascular safety data before approval, likely leading to similar warnings. The commentary noted that even if more COX-2 drugs reached the market, the overall market size would shrink, and questioned whether major launches remained commercially viable. The author also reflected that companies had overextended into the general pain market when these drugs should have been reserved for higher-risk patients who could not use traditional anti-inflammatories.

## 2. HISTORY

**Regulatory outcomes:**
- In April 2005, the FDA requested Bextra's withdrawal from the US market due to cardiovascular risks and rare but serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Bextra was indeed pulled—Pfizer complied with the request.
- The FDA required a "black box" warning—the strongest type—for Celebrex and all prescription NSAIDs, highlighting cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks.
- Vioxx did not return to the US market; Merck faced massive litigation and paid billions in settlements over cardiovascular events. The drug remained off the market.
- Arcoxia was never approved in the US; the FDA issued multiple complete response letters, and Merck ultimately abandoned its US submission.
- Prexige was briefly marketed in several countries but was withdrawn globally in 2007–2008 due to hepatotoxicity (severe liver injury).
- The FDA mandated a black box warning for the entire NSAID class in 2005, including both COX-2 inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs, emphasizing cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks.

**Clinical and commercial impact:**
- COX-2 prescribing dropped sharply; Celebrex continued to be used, but largely confined to patients at high GI risk who could not tolerate traditional NSAIDs.
- Industry advertising for COX-2 inhibitors was curtailed significantly.
- Merck faced extensive product-liability lawsuits over Vioxx, paying roughly $4.85 billion to settle claims and incurring massive legal costs.
- The Vioxx crisis spurred broader drug-safety reforms, including FDA initiatives for risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and enhanced post-marketing surveillance.

**Later research:**
- Large outcomes trials and meta-analyses continued to show modestly elevated cardiovascular risks with both COX-2 inhibitors and some traditional NSAIDs.
- Guidelines evolved to emphasize cardiovascular/GI risk stratification when choosing NSAIDs; COX-2 inhibitors are recommended for patients with high GI risk but low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: "Bextra will probably be pulled outright."  
  **Outcome**: Correct. Bextra was withdrawn from the US market in April 2005, and globally soon after.
  
- **Prediction**: Celebrex will stay with added warnings and guidance to prescribe only to patients who cannot tolerate traditional anti-inflammatories.  
  **Outcome**: Correct. Celebrex remained available with strengthened warnings and narrower use, effectively reserved for patients at high GI risk.

- **Prediction**: Vioxx might return to market.  
  **Outcome**: Incorrect. Vioxx never returned to the US market; Merck faced extensive litigation and kept it withdrawn.

- **Prediction**: The FDA will demand major cardiovascular data for Arcoxia and Prexige; they may eventually get through with warnings.  
  **Outcome**: Mixed. The FDA indeed demanded substantial cardiovascular data, but neither drug was approved in the US. Arcoxia received multiple rejections and was never approved; Prexige was withdrawn globally due to liver toxicity.

- **Prediction**: The COX-2 market will shrink, and the financial damage to the class has already been done.  
  **Outcome**: Correct. COX-2 use fell sharply, marketing was curtailed, and the class never regained its previous commercial prominence.

- **Prediction**: We'll likely end up with more COX-2 drugs on the market than we have now.  
  **Outcome**: Incorrect. The number of approved COX-2 inhibitors decreased, between Bextra's withdrawal, Vioxx staying off the market, and both Arcoxia and Prexige failing to reach or remain on the US market.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This commentary is sharply focused, shows clear reasoning, and makes concrete predictions that mostly aligned with later outcomes. It captures a critical moment in post-market drug safety and offers realistic insight into FDA decision-making and industry behavior, making it both historically important and analytically interesting.
