# Alzheimer's Disposes of Another Idea (July 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on another clinical failure in Alzheimer's disease drug development, specifically Roche's MAO-B (monoamine oxidase B) inhibitor program that reached Phase II before being discontinued. The author notes this adds to the extensive list of failed approaches for treating Alzheimer's, acknowledging that while MAO-B inhibition may have been a marginal concept, the enormous market potential drives companies to test many such ideas. The failure is presented as somewhat expected, with the only silver lining being that it failed in Phase II rather than the more expensive Phase III stage, saving further development costs.

## 2. HISTORY

MAO-B inhibitors had shown some promise historically, with drugs like selegiline and rasagiline approved for Parkinson's disease. However, the Alzheimer's field after 2015 continued to be characterized by high-profile failures, particularly around the amyloid hypothesis. The subsequent years saw major Phase III failures including solanezumab, bapineuzumab, gantenerumab, and crenezumab. Notably, Biogen's aducanumab became controversially approved by the FDA in 2021 despite questionable efficacy data, while lecanemab received accelerated approval in 2023 with more substantial evidence of modest cognitive benefit, though with significant safety concerns around ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities). The field gradually shifted toward combination approaches, biomarkers for patient selection, and earlier intervention in the disease course, as monotherapies continued to struggle. Overall, few therapeutic breakthroughs emerged, with most new approvals showing only modest effects on disease progression.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction of continued marginal approaches**: The article suggested the huge market payoff would continue driving marginal ideas to be tested. **Accuracy**: Correct - the field continued to pursue numerous approaches with limited rationales, many of which subsequently failed.

- **Expectation that Phase II failures are preferable to Phase III**: The article implied Phase II failures save costs compared to Phase III. **Accuracy**: Factually accurate, though this doesn't address the underlying issue that late-stage failures remained common throughout the period.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article addresses an important ongoing challenge in drug development but covers a relatively routine Phase II failure without broader mechanistic context. While Alzheimer's failures remain highly relevant, this particular case represents one of many similar setbacks rather than a pivotal moment.
