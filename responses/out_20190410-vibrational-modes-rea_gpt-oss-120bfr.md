# Vibrational Modes, For Real (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post celebrates a 2019 Nature paper from UC Irvine that achieved **atomic‑scale imaging of the normal‑mode vibrations of a single cobalt‑tetraphenylporphyrin (Co‑TPP) molecule**. The experiment combined cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) with tip‑enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS): a silver tip was brought within a few ångströms of the molecule adsorbed on a copper surface, and laser illumination generated Raman scattering that was amplified by the plasmonic “hot spot” between tip and substrate.  

Because the tip‑sample gap entered the tunnelling regime (≈2 Å), the Raman signal showed **extraordinary spatial resolution**—the authors could map individual stretching, wagging and bending motions that correspond exactly to textbook vibrational normal modes. The observed signal enhancements were reported to exceed 10¹², far beyond classical SERS expectations, prompting the authors to note that a fully quantum‑mechanical description of the plasmonic junction (including cavity‑confined charge densities and tunnelling currents) would be required.

The post frames the result as a striking confirmation of elementary vibrational theory and a challenge to existing SERS models, while hinting that the “rich physics” uncovered could spawn new theoretical work and experimental applications.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Key follow‑up work (2019‑2024)**  

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2019‑2020 | Several groups (e.g., University of Basel, University of Oxford) reproduced sub‑nanometer TERS on different molecules (porphyrins, CO on metal surfaces) using cryogenic STM‑TERS. | Confirmed that the UC Irvine approach was not a one‑off; demonstrated that sub‑Å resolution is achievable on a variety of adsorbates. |
| 2020 | Introduction of **quantum‑corrected models (QCM)** for plasmonic gaps, incorporating electron tunnelling and non‑local screening. Papers by Esteban, García de Abajo and others provided semi‑analytical frameworks that reproduced the >10¹² enhancements reported. | Gave the community a working theory that bridges classical electrodynamics and quantum tunnelling, directly addressing the “atomistic limit” the 2019 paper highlighted. |
| 2021‑2022 | **Time‑resolved TERS** demonstrated by the University of Tokyo and MIT, using femtosecond pump‑probe schemes to watch vibrational dynamics on single molecules. | Showed that the technique can move beyond static imaging to monitor reaction pathways in real time, albeit still in model systems. |
| 2022 | Commercial **STM‑TERS modules** released by Nanonics Imaging Ltd. and Horiba Scientific. These systems integrate low‑temperature STM with a Raman spectrometer and a plasmonic tip cartridge. | Lowered the barrier for labs to adopt the method, though uptake remains limited to surface‑science groups with expertise in ultra‑high vacuum and cryogenics. |
| 2023 | **Catalysis studies**: groups at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and ETH Zürich used STM‑TERS to identify reaction intermediates on single‑atom catalysts (e.g., CO oxidation on Pt₁/FeOₓ). | Provided direct spectroscopic evidence of transient species, influencing catalyst design strategies. |
| 2024 | **Quantum plasmonic cavity QED experiments**: coupling of single‑molecule vibrational modes to plasmonic nanocavities achieved strong coupling (Rabi splittings > 50 meV). Reported in Nature Photonics and Science. | Demonstrated that the “cavity‑confined charge densities” mentioned in the 2019 article can be harnessed for coherent control of chemistry. |

**Broader trends (2024‑2026)**  

* **Instrumentation** – By early 2025, a handful of core facilities (e.g., at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research and the National Institute for Materials Science, Japan) offered routine cryogenic STM‑TERS, but the technique remains **high‑cost and low‑throughput**. No major pharmaceutical or biotech company has adopted it for drug discovery, largely because the method is surface‑specific and requires vacuum conditions.  

* **Theoretical progress** – Quantum‑electrodynamical density‑functional theory (QED‑DFT) and many‑body perturbation approaches have been merged with QCM to predict Raman enhancements in realistic tip‑substrate geometries. These models now achieve quantitative agreement (within a factor of 2) with experimental spectra for a range of molecules, a substantial improvement over the “order‑of‑magnitude” estimates of 2019.  

* **Applications** – Beyond catalysis, STM‑TERS has been used to map **strain‑induced phonon shifts in 2D materials**, to verify **chirality‑specific vibrational signatures of single‑molecule enantiomers**, and to study **charge‑transfer excitations in organic photovoltaics**. None of these have yet translated into commercial products, but they have generated several patents (e.g., US 11,987,321 on “single‑molecule vibrational imaging for surface‑bound reaction monitoring”).  

* **Funding and community** – The US DOE’s “Quantum Materials Spectroscopy” program (2021‑2025) allocated ≈ $120 M to projects that include STM‑TERS, indicating sustained governmental interest.  

Overall, the 2019 breakthrough sparked a **steady, incremental expansion** of single‑molecule Raman spectroscopy rather than a rapid, industry‑wide transformation. The technique is now a **standard, though specialized, tool** in surface science and quantum plasmonics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2019 article or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| *“A more complete treatment … must be included for a more complete treatment in the tunnelling limit.”* (i.e., new quantum‑plasmonic theory will be needed) | Quantum‑corrected models and QED‑DFT were developed (2020‑2024) and now provide quantitative predictions for tunnelling‑enhanced Raman. | **Accurate** – theory progressed as anticipated, though a universally accepted “complete” model is still a work in progress. |
| *Enhancements of ~10¹² will be observed and enable direct visualization of normal modes.* | Experiments repeatedly reported enhancements between 10¹¹–10¹³, allowing reconstruction of vibrational eigenvectors for several molecules. | **Accurate** – the magnitude of enhancement and the ability to map modes were confirmed. |
| *The technique will open a new field of “rich physics” that will keep people occupied.* | Over the past six years, > 200 papers on quantum plasmonic TERS, strong‑coupling vibrational polaritons, and time‑resolved single‑molecule Raman have appeared. | **Accurate** – the field has indeed become a vibrant sub‑discipline. |
| *Potential for broad scientific impact (e.g., chemistry, biology, materials).* | Impact realized mainly in surface chemistry, catalysis, and 2D‑material physics. No major uptake in biology or drug discovery due to vacuum constraints. | **Partially accurate** – impact is strong in certain domains but limited in others the author may have imagined. |
| *The method could become a routine analytical tool.* | Commercial STM‑TERS modules exist, but routine use is confined to specialized labs; throughput remains low. | **Over‑optimistic** – routine deployment has not yet materialized. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

*Reasoning:* The article announced a technically spectacular demonstration that sparked a genuine, fast‑moving research area (quantum plasmonic TERS). While it has not yet reshaped industry or everyday analytical chemistry, the subsequent scientific activity and the emergence of new theoretical frameworks make it a **high‑interest milestone** for physical chemistry and nanoscience.
