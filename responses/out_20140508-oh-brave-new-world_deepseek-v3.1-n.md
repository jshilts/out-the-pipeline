# Oh Brave New World (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary critiques futurist Andrew Hessel's vision of personalized medicine enabled by synthetic biology. Hessel envisioned a Netflix-style subscription model where patients with cancer could receive cheap genetic screening followed by computer-generated, personalized medicines—specifically engineered viruses—manufactured in hours rather than years.

The author sharply contrasts this optimism with biomedical reality, arguing that the "garage startup" ethos of software doesn't translate to biology. Key concerns include Hessel's dismissal of biosecurity risks (viewing engineered viruses as unlikely weapons) and claims that generational change would eliminate public fear through better biology education. The article characterizes Hessel's position as "digibabble"—overconfident tech-industry thinking that treats biology as mere programming rather than understanding the inherent complexity and risks of living systems. The commentary includes safety warnings about potential bioweapon misuse.

## 2. HISTORY

**Personalized Medicine Progress:**
- As of 2024, personalized cancer treatments exist but remain expensive, hospital-based therapies—nowhere near the "hours to generate" vision
- CAR-T cell therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta) reached market approval starting 2017, but cost $373,000-$475,000 per treatment, require 2-3 weeks manufacturing time, and need specialized hospital administration
- Genetic screening costs did drop dramatically: whole-genome sequencing fell from $10,000+ (2014) to $200-$600 (2024), but therapeutic implementation hasn't kept pace

**Engineered Viruses:**
- Oncolytic virotherapy achieved its first FDA approval: Imlygic (talimogene laherparepvec) in 2015 for melanoma
- Rather than explosive growth, progress has been modest—Imlygic showed only 16.3% durable response rates, and oncolytic viruses remain niche treatments with limited commercial uptake
- The field didn't transform into distributed manufacturing; instead, it followed traditional pharmaceutical development with centralized production

**Business Model Reality:**
- No subscription-model personalized medicine emerged as envisioned
- Biotechnology continued operating under blockbuster drug models and traditional venture capital funding
- High-profile synthetic biology companies faced mixed outcomes: 
  - Amyris struggled commercially despite technical achievements
  - Zymergen and Ginkgo Bioworks grew but faced profitability challenges and stock volatility
  - No major success stories in personalized therapeutic manufacturing

**Safety and Regulation:**
- Gain-of-function research controversies (2012-2014 influenza studies) triggered ongoing debates about engineered viruses
- The COVID-19 pandemic intensified biosecurity concerns rather than reducing them
- Distributed biotechnology threats remain a significant international security concern
- Dual-use research oversight tightened rather than relaxed

**Generational Change Impact:**
- While younger generations may be more comfortable with technology broadly, concerns about genetic engineering, CRISPR, and biological manipulation persist across all age groups
- Privacy concerns around genetic data intensified post-2014 (GDPR 2018, ongoing GINA Act enforcement)
- Public understanding of molecular biology didn't fundamentally improve or eliminate skepticism

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Hessel's Predictions:**

• **Prediction:** Personalized cancer medicines generated in hours for individual patients  
  **Reality:** CAR-T therapies still require 2-3 weeks minimum; completely bespoke treatments don't exist. Neoantigen vaccines show promise but remain experimental and time-intensive.

• **Prediction:** Netflix subscription model for medicine replacing blockbuster drugs  
  **Reality:** Zero adoption of subscription medicine models. Pharmaceutical industry structure remains fundamentally unchanged, with traditional pricing and distribution dominating.

• **Prediction:** Computer-generated medicines becoming standard  
  **Reality:** Computational design plays important roles (AlphaFold, drug discovery algorithms), but generative medicine remains experimental. Human expertise and empirical validation remain essential at every step.

• **Prediction:** Genetic screens becoming so cheap that personalized medicine becomes routine  
  **Reality:** Screening costs dropped dramatically, but interpretability, clinical utility, and ethical challenges limit widespread therapeutic implementation.

• **Prediction:** Fear of engineered viruses disappearing through generational education  
  **Reality:** Safety culture actually strengthened post-2014. COVID-19 intensified public awareness of viral risks. High-profile lab safety incidents (including Wuhan Institute of Virology scrutiny) increased rather than reduced caution.

**Article Author's Predictions:**

• **Implicit prediction:** Tech industry's "move fast and break things" approach wouldn't work in biology  
  **Reality:** Largely validated. Most consumer biotech startups failed to achieve promised timelines. Evidence includes Theranos collapse (2016-2018), high-profile clinical trial failures, and slower-than-promised adoption of CRISPR therapeutics.

• **Prediction:** Concerns about engineered bioweapons weren't "laughable"  
  **Reality:** Validated. Continued biosecurity incidents, COVID-19 origins debate, and ongoing dual-use research concerns dominate policy discussions.

• **Prediction:** Distributed biotechnology would progress despite risks  
  **Reality:** Partially true. Home CRISPR kits, biohacking communities, and citizen science exist but haven't produced significant medical breakthroughs or widespread safety issues—contradicting both utopian and catastrophic predictions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured a defining tension of 2010s biotechnology discourse, accurately diagnosing the oversimplification of complex biological systems and correctly predicting that software-industry models wouldn't translate easily to medicine. The piece demonstrated prescient caution about timelines and safety that proved more accurate than the futurist visions it criticized.
