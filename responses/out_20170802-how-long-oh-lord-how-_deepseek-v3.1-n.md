# How Long, Oh Lord, How Long? (August 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a reflective commentary about the time it takes to deliver a clinical candidate in preclinical drug discovery. The author asks readers to share personal experiences of their longest projects - both those that eventually delivered a clinical candidate and those that never reached that milestone. They recount spending over five years on an Alzheimer's project that briefly entered the clinic but quickly failed, with over 4,000 analogs synthesized during their tenure. The article notes that this topic is complex, acknowledging that some great successes require long gestation periods while many time sinks run endlessly without delivering results. The author discusses differing management approaches to project timelines, highlighting the tension between managers who impose tight deadlines due to past experiences with failed long-running projects, versus the risk of letting projects spin out indefinitely without delivery.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published in 2017, a period when the pharmaceutical industry was grappling with R&D productivity challenges. Alzheimer's disease research specifically continued its pattern of high failure rates post-2017. Several high-profile Alzheimer's programs failed in subsequent years, including multiple Phase III trials for amyloid-targeting therapies. However, in 2021, Biogen's Aduhelm (aducanumab) received controversial FDA approval, though it achieved very limited patient uptake due to efficacy concerns, Medicare coverage restrictions, and mixed clinical data. More significantly, in 2023, Eisai/Biogen's lecanemab (Leqembi) received full FDA approval with clearer clinical benefit data, representing the first disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment to show meaningful cognitive preservation. Gilead's capsid inhibitor programs mentioned in the article have evolved - while some early candidates may have failed, the company has continued to advance compounds in this class. The broader biotech industry has seen continued consolidation and failure rates that validate the article's concerns about lengthy, unsuccessful drug discovery programs. The fundamental challenges of drug discovery timelines and high attrition rates remain largely unchanged since 2017.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article is more observational than predictive in nature. It doesn't make explicit forward-looking statements about specific outcomes, but rather reflects on ongoing patterns in drug discovery:

• **Underlying concern about Alzheimer's drug development**: The author's personal experience with a 5+ year Alzheimer's project that "slid right out [of the clinic] almost immediately" aligns with the continued pattern of Alzheimer's trial failures through 2023, though with recent qualified successes like lecanemab.
• **Implicit prediction about management approaches**: The tension between rigid timeline management and allowing adequate development time continues to be relevant, with pharmaceutical companies still struggling to balance these competing pressures.
• **Gilead's capsid inhibitor programs**: While not making explicit predictions about these programs, the mention of 4,000+ analogs reflects the massive investment in structural exploration that remains characteristic of competitive drug discovery programs, particularly in difficult target classes.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

This article sits in the middle range of interest - it provides genuine insight into pharmaceutical R&D culture and timelines, but its anecdotal nature and lack of specific predictions limit broader significance. It captures an important aspect of drug discovery reality that remains highly relevant today.
