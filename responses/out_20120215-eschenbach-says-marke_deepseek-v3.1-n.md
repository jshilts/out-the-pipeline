# Eschenbach Says Market, Then Test (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 article discusses former FDA commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach's proposal in the Wall Street Journal to reform FDA evaluation of breakthrough technologies, particularly regenerative medicine. The core idea was that after proof-of-concept and safety testing, products could be approved for marketing while efficacy would be established through post-market registry studies with eligible patients, rather than requiring lengthy pre-approval clinical trials.

The author notes this proposal resembles Andy Grove's earlier idea for opening up clinical trials. The piece analyzes multiple concerns: post-marketing data quality being inferior to controlled trials, faster access potentially benefiting both useful and useless therapies, legal liability when patients receive investigational treatments, insurance companies being unwilling to cover unproven therapies, and the need for clear efficacy endpoints to prevent indefinite "fishing expeditions." While acknowledging some merit in faster patient access and reduced development costs, the article concludes the proposal is more problematic than Eschenbach or Grove suggested.

## 2. HISTORY

Eschenbach's 2012 proposal reflected ongoing debates about regulatory pathways for breakthrough therapies, but it did **not** result in broad adoption of his specific "market first, test later" approach. However, several related developments occurred:

**Regulatory Pathway Evolution:**
- The FDA established the **Breakthrough Therapy Designation** in 2012 (July, just months after this article) under the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), providing expedited development and review for drugs treating serious conditions with preliminary clinical evidence of substantial improvement over existing therapies.
- **Accelerated Approval** pathways (existing since 1992) continued to expand, allowing approval based on surrogate endpoints with post-marketing confirmatory studies.
- The **21st Century Cures Act** (2016) further expanded the FDA's flexibility for regenerative medicine and breakthrough technologies, including the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation established in 2017.

**Real-World Implementation:**
Post-marketing studies became more common for accelerated approvals, but the FDA maintained *pre-market efficacy demonstration* requirements rather than adopting Eschenbach's pure "market then test" approach. Examples of post-marketing requirement challenges emerged:
- Aducanumab (Aduhelm) for Alzheimer's received accelerated approval in 2021 based on biomarker data, with confirmatory trials required, sparking significant controversy about limited efficacy evidence before approval.
- Multiple oncology drugs received accelerated approval but later faced withdrawal when confirmatory trials failed (e.g., pembrolizumab for gastric cancer, atezolizumab for bladder cancer).

**Regenerative Medicine Specific Development:**
The promise of "growing cells that repair the retina" mentioned in the article did materialize in part: **Luxturna** (voretigene neparvovec) received FDA approval in 2017 for inherited retinal disease, but through traditional pathways rather than post-market registry approaches.

**No Major Policy Adoption:**
Eschenbach's specific proposal of approving therapies after only proof-of-concept and safety testing, then establishing efficacy purely through post-market registries, was **never adopted** as FDA policy. Clinical trials with pre-market efficacy data remained the standard.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictive concerns, some of which manifested while others were avoided:

• **Prediction that post-marketing data quality would be inferior to controlled trials**: **Confirmation** - Studies consistently show real-world evidence is prone to confounding and bias compared to randomized trials, making post-market efficacy determination challenging.

• **Concern that useless therapies would reach patients faster**: **Mixed outcome** - While accelerated pathways sometimes approved drugs later found to have limited benefit (e.g., aducanumab controversy), the FDA largely maintained thresholds preventing truly useless therapies from reaching market. The balance remained contentious but not as severe as predicted.

• **Legal liability concerns with investigational therapies**: **Did not materialize** - Existing legal frameworks for expanded access/investigational drugs provided sufficient liability management without major lawsuits disrupting access programs.

• **Insurance companies refusing payment**: **Accurate prediction** - Payers frequently restricted coverage for accelerated approval drugs pending additional evidence, creating access disparities even after FDA approval.

• **Entrepreneurial types stretching out timelines**: **Accurate prediction** - Multiple instances of sponsors delaying confirmatory trials or using surrogate endpoints indefinitely emerged, prompting FDA enforcement actions.

• **The article's implicit skepticism about broad adoption**: **Accurate prediction** - While limited expedited pathways expanded, the fundamental "market then test" paradigm shift never occurred.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures a timely policy debate that remained relevant as regulatory frameworks evolved, accurately identifying key implementation challenges, though the specific proposal discussed was ultimately too radical to gain traction.
