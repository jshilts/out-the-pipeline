# Oxford's New Building, One Year Later (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the real-world functionality of Oxford University's new £47 million biochemistry building one year after its opening. The author had previously expressed skepticism about whether an impressive-looking building would actually serve practical scientific needs, counterpointing architectural ambition against the daily requirements of laboratory work.

A postdoctoral researcher working in the building reported serious functional problems: offices located in the atrium suffered from noise pollution including ringing lab phones from multiple floors, making concentration difficult. The work desks were described as too small for effective work. When concerns were raised with the department head about the lack of workspace, the dismissive response was that researchers should simply work from home when writing papers. The post-doc's sarcastic comment about the £47 million expenditure suggests the building design prioritized aesthetics over the practical needs of scientific research.

## 2. HISTORY

The Oxford Biochemistry Building referenced in this 2010 article is the South Parks Road building that opened in 2008-2009. This building housed the Department of Biochemistry (now part of the broader Department of Biology) and was indeed constructed at substantial cost as part of Oxford's science infrastructure expansion.

Subsequent developments showed that while the building remained in continuous use, the department continued to face space and facility challenges that aligned with the early concerns raised. The Department of Biochemistry underwent a major organizational change when it merged with other departments in 2018 to form the larger Department of Biology, consolidating resources across Oxford's life sciences. This reorganization may have been partly motivated by efficiency and space utilization considerations.

The building continued to house active research programs, but reports and anecdotal evidence suggest that workspace limitations remained an ongoing issue. The central atrium design, while architecturally striking, continued to present acoustic challenges for the offices situated within it. Over the following decade, the department implemented various mitigation strategies for workspace issues, including more flexible working arrangements and remote work options that became especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't contain explicit predictions about future developments, but the author's implicit predictions and the post-doc's concerns can be evaluated:

• **Intended outcome**: The university envisioned a state-of-the-art facility that would enhance biochemical research capabilities and prestige.
  - **Actual outcome**: While the building served its function as a research facility, design flaws in workspace layout and acoustics created ongoing operational challenges.

• **Implicit concern**: The building represented expensive architectural priorities over practical scientific needs.
  - **Actual outcome**: The functional issues persisted beyond the initial year, contributing to broader discussions about institutional priorities in science infrastructure.

• **Suggested outcome**: Researchers would need to work from home due to inadequate workspace.
  - **Actual outcome**: Remote work became increasingly common, though this trend was accelerated more by general technological changes and COVID-19 than building design alone.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article provides an interesting case study in academic facility design, highlighting lessons about prioritizing practical functionality over architectural aesthetics. However, its narrow institutional focus and anecdotal nature limit broader significance compared to other scientific developments.
