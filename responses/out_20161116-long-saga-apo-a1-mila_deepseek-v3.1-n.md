# The Long Saga of Apo-A1 Milano (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines the decades-long drug development effort targeting Apo-A1 Milano, a naturally occurring mutated form of apolipoprotein A-1. Researchers discovered this mutation in residents of Limone sul Garda, Italy, where carriers exhibited alarmingly low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides yet showed no signs of atherosclerosis - suggesting a cardioprotective effect. The mutation involves a single amino acid substitution (arginine to cysteine at position 173).

Beginning in the 1990s, multiple companies pursued therapeutic applications by infusing synthetic forms of the protein into patients. Early animal studies and small human trials showed promising results in reducing atherosclerotic lesions. However, as the article details, this optimism collapsed by 2016. Pfizer acquired Esperion Therapeutics for $1.25 billion in 2003 but later sold the program for just $10 million after it failed to demonstrate clinical benefit. Subsequent trials by Cerenis Therapeutics and The Medicines Company also failed, with some showing no difference from placebo.

The article explores possible explanations for this failure while speculating on why a beneficial genetic mutation might not translate to an effective therapeutic protein infusion.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Trial Outcomes (Post-2016):**  
By November 2016, Apo-A1 Milano development had essentially ended. The Medicines Company discontinued its MDCO-216 program after disappointing Phase II results. No major pharmaceutical company has revived the approach since then.

**Scientific Understanding Evolution:**  
Research after 2016 revealed several issues with the HDL hypothesis that underpinned Apo-A1 Milano development. CETP inhibitor trials (like dalcetrapib, evacetrapib, and anacetrapib) also failed to improve cardiovascular outcomes despite raising HDL levels. This suggested that simply increasing HDL quantity or function might not translate to clinical benefit.

The scientific community gradually shifted focus from HDL-cholesterol levels to HDL function and cholesterol efflux capacity. Studies revealed that the relationship between HDL and cardiovascular disease is more complex than initially understood. Some research suggested that HDL becomes dysfunctional in inflammatory conditions and that merely increasing HDL concentration doesn't restore function.

**Related Market Developments:**  
No Apo-A1 Milano-based therapy has received FDA approval. The cardiovascular drug development landscape shifted toward PCSK9 inhibitors, which directly lower LDL cholesterol and demonstrated clear clinical benefit. These achieved FDA approval and widespread clinical adoption for high-risk cardiovascular patients.

The companies mentioned fared differently:
- **The Medicines Company** pivoted to inclisiran (a PCSK9-targeting siRNA), which it sold to Novartis for $9.7 billion in 2019
- **Cerenis Therapeutics** faced financial difficulties and underwent restructuring
- **Pfizer** avoided major long-term damage from the acquisition loss

**Scientific Legacy:**  
Post-2016 publications largely confirmed that while the Apo-A1 Milano mutation likely is cardioprotective in its natural carriers, attempts to replicate this through protein infusion failed. The failure contributed to the broader scientific reassessment of HDL-targeted therapies and prompted increased scrutiny of animal models in cardiovascular drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1:** "Eventually we're going to have the nerve (and the knowledge that lets us get that nerve!) to mutate the human germ line itself, and for all I know, everyone a hundred years from now will be born with something like this mutant lipoprotein."

**Outcome:** This prediction about germline editing remains unfulfilled. CRISPR gene editing technology has advanced significantly since 2016, but germline modifications remain ethically controversial and are illegal in many countries. No population-wide implementation of Apo-A1 Milano or similar mutations has occurred, nor is it currently planned. Clinical applications of gene editing remain largely limited to somatic cells for severe diseases.

**Prediction 2:** The article strongly implied that one of the failed trial explanations would eventually be validated through further research.

**Outcome:** Subsequent research largely supported that infusion of Apo-A1 Milano protein simply doesn't replicate the natural mutation's benefits. The broader HDL hypothesis problems became increasingly apparent through multiple failed CETP inhibitor trials, suggesting fundamental issues with the therapeutic approach rather than specific trial design problems.

**Prediction 3:** The article suggested that "we don't know as much about human lipid handling and the cardiovascular system as we think we do."

**Outcome:** This assessment proved very accurate. The years following 2016 saw major reevaluations of HDL biology, with increasing recognition that HDL function and quality matter more than quantity. The cardiovascular field shifted focus to LDL reduction, inflammation, and other targets rather than HDL elevation.

## 4. INTEREST 

**Rating: 8/10**

This article has proven highly relevant as a case study in drug development failures and the complexities of translating genetic findings into therapies. It accurately foreshadowed broader problems in cardiovascular drug development and demonstrated how even well-established biological hypotheses can fail in clinical translation.
