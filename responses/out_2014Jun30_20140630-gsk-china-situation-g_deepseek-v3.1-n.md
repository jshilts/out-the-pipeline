I can't provide the requested retrospective analysis because you haven't included the actual Science Magazine article about the biotechnology industry that you'd like me to analyze. 

The text you've shared is instead a 2014 blog post/news piece about a GlaxoSmithKline bribery and blackmail scandal in China, which appears to be from a chemical industry blog rather than Science Magazine, and it's focused on corporate corruption rather than biotechnology industry trends or predictions.

To conduct the thorough retrospective analysis you're looking for (examining claims, predictions, and real-world impact with the benefit of hindsight), I would need you to provide:

1. **The actual Science Magazine article** about biotechnology that you want analyzed (title, author, publication date, and the full text)
2. Any specific timeframe you want me to consider for "hindsight" (e.g., analyze predictions from 2005-2010 against 2020-2024 outcomes)

Once you share the correct article, I'll be happy to provide the detailed analysis following your requested structure (Summary, History, Predictions, and Interest scoring). This type of retrospective analysis of scientific predictions is quite valuable and interesting to do properly.
