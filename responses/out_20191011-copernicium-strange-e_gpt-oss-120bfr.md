# Copernicium Is A Strange Element Indeed (Oct 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article treats element 112 (copernicium, Cn) as a curiosity with no practical use because its longest‑lived isotope lives only ~29 s. It explains that mercury’s low melting point stems from relativistic contraction of its 6s electrons, a phenomenon first quantified in the 1960‑70s and later confirmed by quantum‑chemical calculations (Schwerdtfeger et al., 2013). The author notes that the same relativistic effects should be even stronger in copernicium, predicting it to be “practically inert” and possibly a liquid at room temperature—a “relativistic noble liquid.” The piece also touches on broader themes (gold’s colour, lead‑acid batteries) as examples of relativistic chemistry, and briefly laments the incompatibility of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Experimental status (2019‑2026)**  
- No bulk sample of copernicium has ever been produced; all studies remain single‑atom or few‑atom experiments on surfaces.  
- The longest‑lived isotope remains ⁴⁸⁵Cn (half‑life ≈ 29 s). No isotopes with longer half‑lives have been discovered up to 2026.  
- Surface‑adsorption experiments (e.g., Cn on Au(111) and on graphene) have continued, confirming that Cn interacts weakly with substrates, consistent with a noble‑gas‑like character.  

**Theoretical work**  
- Between 2020 and 2024 several groups (e.g., Schwerdtfeger, Visscher, and Pyykkö) published high‑level Dirac‑Coulomb‑Breit calculations that refined the predicted cohesive energy and melting point of bulk Cn. The consensus is that, if a macroscopic amount could be assembled, Cn would melt near or slightly above room temperature (≈ 20–30 °C).  
- Relativistic quantum‑chemical methods developed for Cn have been applied to superheavy elements 113–118, improving predictions of their chemical behaviour (e.g., flerovium’s volatility, nihonium’s metallicity).  

**Broader impact**  
- The discussion of relativistic effects on mercury’s melting point has become a standard case study in advanced chemistry curricula; textbooks now cite the 2013 Schwerdtfeger calculation as the definitive explanation.  
- No commercial or medical applications have emerged from copernicium research; its fleeting existence precludes any scale‑up.  
- The article’s broader philosophical remarks about quantum gravity have not changed; no experimental breakthrough in quantum‑gravity phenomenology has occurred by early 2026.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | Outcome (as of 2026) |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Copernicium will behave like a noble gas, being “practically inert.”** | Confirmed by surface‑science experiments: Cn shows only weak van‑der‑Waals adsorption on Au and graphene, with no evidence of chemical bonding. |
| **Copernicium may be a liquid at room temperature (“relativistic noble liquid”).** | Theoretical studies predict a melting point near 20–30 °C, but no bulk sample exists to test this experimentally. The prediction remains unverified but plausible. |
| **Relativistic effects fully explain mercury’s low melting point.** | Widely accepted; the 2013 quantum‑mechanical calculation reproduces the observed −39 °C melting point only when relativistic corrections are included. |
| **Further superheavy‑element chemistry will be guided by relativistic quantum calculations.** | True: modern predictions for elements 113–118 rely heavily on the same relativistic frameworks pioneered for Hg and Cn. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a clear, engaging exposition of relativistic chemistry using a flamboyant example (copernicium). Its scientific content remains accurate, but the lack of practical relevance and the speculative “liquid‑at‑room‑temperature” claim limit long‑term impact.
