# Medivation Decides That Their Drug Isn't What They Thought (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes an embarrassing situation for Medivation, a biotech company that had been developing an anti-PD-1 antibody called MDV9300 (pidilizumab) for large B-cell lymphoma. Through an SEC filing, Medivation disclosed that they had determined their drug's mechanism of action was not actually PD-1 blockade as previously believed. The company informed the FDA of this mechanistic error and was placed under a partial clinical hold until they revised all their documentation, including investigator brochures.

The author notes that while the FDA doesn't require companies to know their drug's mechanism of action, preferring instead to see safety and efficacy data, having an unknown mechanism creates significant complications. Medivation would need to re-label and re-word materials for clinicians while continuing to enroll patients in their Phase II trial, with the awkward situation of not understanding why the drug might work if it proves effective. The article highlights the uncertainty around when Medivation discovered this error, noting that while a December 5 conference presentation highlighted the PD-1 mechanism, a January 11 presentation already mentioned preliminary data suggesting a different target.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Development Failure**: After this 2016 disclosure, pidilizumab's development trajectory collapsed rapidly. The drug had previously shown some promise in early trials for various cancers, but the mechanistic uncertainty proved critical. Medivation was acquired by Pfizer in August 2016 for approximately $14 billion, with the acquisition driven primarily by Medivation's successful prostate cancer drug Xtandi (enzalutamide), not by pidilizumab.

**Pipeline Abandonment**: Pfizer discontinued clinical development of pidilizumab following the acquisition. The drug never gained FDA approval for any indication. The mechanistic confusion appeared to be terminal for its development pathway, as the scientific uncertainty made it difficult to design appropriate trials or understand which patient populations might benefit.

**Scientific Methods Impact**: This case highlighted the importance of confirmatory target validation and rigorous mechanism-of-action studies. While the FDA's flexibility on mechanism (focusing instead on efficacy and safety) is well-established, in practice, significant mechanistic uncertainty can make clinical development extremely challenging. The incident reinforced the value of early investment in target validation and mechanistically-driven drug discovery, even when regulatory flexibility exists.

**Competitive Landscape**: During this same period, validated anti-PD-1 antibodies (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) achieved tremendous commercial success and transformed cancer treatment. The contrast between these validated PD-1 inhibitors' success and pidilizumab's failure underscored how critical correct mechanistic understanding is for therapeutic success.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"They are free to continue enrolling patients in their Phase II trial. They just won't know, if the drug works, exactly why it's working."** - The prediction that Medivation would continue the trial proved incorrect: development was discontinued shortly after Pfizer's acquisition.

• **"One would assume that efforts are underway to figure that out!"** - While Medivation likely conducted internal research to identify the true mechanism, no clear mechanistic understanding emerged publicly, and the program was terminated rather than rescued through mechanistic clarification.

• Implicit in the article was that FDA flexibility on mechanism might allow continuation: In reality, while the FDA maintained its regulatory flexibility, the commercial and scientific challenges of developing a drug with unknown mechanism proved insurmountable for this program.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important real-world example of how mechanistic uncertainty can derail drug development, illustrating the practical limits of regulatory flexibility even when safety and efficacy data exist. The case became a cautionary tale about the critical importance of target validation.
