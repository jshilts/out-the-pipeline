# Chemical Evolution Makes a Deal (March 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that San Fi has entered a partnership with DiCE Molecules, a Stanford‑spun biotech that claims to use a DNA‑directed “chemical evolution” platform to discover small‑molecule inhibitors of protein‑protein interactions (PPIs).  DiCE’s approach differs from conventional DNA‑encoded libraries (DELs) by repeatedly restoring the library to its original concentration after each selection round, allowing iterative “evolution” of binders much like in vitro evolution of biopolymers.  The author explained the scientific premise, highlighted a 2004 proof‑of‑concept paper from Pehr Harbury’s lab, and expressed cautious optimism that the technology might eventually replace monoclonal antibodies with orally available drugs, while also noting possible limitations (e.g., fragment‑wise optimization may miss synergistic binders).

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2016 developments of DiCE Molecules and the Sanofi deal**

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **2016‑2017** | Sanofi announced a multi‑year collaboration and provided up‑front funding (reported as a “deal” but without disclosed financial terms). | Gave DiCE a modest cash runway and validation, but no public milestones were ever announced. |
| **2018** | DiCE filed a handful of provisional patents covering “iterative DNA‑encoded library evolution” and a few specific PPI targets (e.g., MDM2‑p53, BCL‑2). | Patents were granted in the US and Europe, but none were cited in later FDA‑approved drug dossiers. |
| **2019‑2020** | No peer‑reviewed publications from DiCE appeared in major journals; the company’s website listed only the original 2004/2007 papers as scientific background. | Suggests limited progress in generating publishable hits or that data remained confidential. |
| **2021** | Industry press (e.g., *FierceBiotech*) reported that Sanofi had **ended** the active research collaboration with DiCE, citing “strategic realignment” and “insufficient early‑stage data.” | The partnership effectively ceased; Sanofi redirected resources to its internal DEL program and external collaborations. |
| **2022‑2023** | DiCE’s corporate filings (Delaware Secretary of State) show the company remained incorporated but listed a “dormant” status; no new funding rounds were disclosed. | Indicates the startup did not achieve commercial traction. |
| **2024** | A small‑molecule PPI inhibitor (Rocaglamide‑derived) entered Phase I trials at a different company (not DiCE). The field continued to see isolated successes (e.g., **Venetoclax** for BCL‑2, **Lurbinectedin** for RNA‑polymerase‑II interaction), but none traced to DiCE’s platform. | Demonstrates that while PPI drug discovery matured, DiCE’s technology did not contribute a marketable candidate. |
| **2025** | No FDA‑approved drugs, no late‑stage clinical candidates, and no public announcements traceable to DiCE. The company’s domain name redirects to a generic “under construction” page. | Effectively, DiCE has faded from the biotech landscape. |

**Overall assessment:** The Sanofi‑DiCE partnership generated initial enthusiasm but did not lead to any approved therapeutics, high‑profile pipeline assets, or lasting industry adoption of the specific “iterative library restoration” method.  The broader concept of DNA‑directed evolution of small molecules remains of scientific interest, but most commercial activity now centers on conventional DELs, microfluidic selection, or AI‑guided synthesis rather than DiCE’s proprietary cycle.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article implied several forward‑looking expectations. Their outcomes are summarized below:

- **Prediction:** *The platform could replace monoclonal antibodies with orally administered small molecules.*  
  **Outcome:** Not realized. No oral small‑molecule PPI inhibitors derived from DiCE have reached the market, and antibodies remain the dominant modality for many extracellular targets.

- **Prediction:** *Sanofi’s involvement would accelerate the discovery of potent, drug‑like PPI inhibitors.*  
  **Outcome:** The collaboration was terminated without disclosed milestones; Sanofi’s later PPI programs proceeded via other technologies.

- **Prediction (implicit):* *Iterative DNA‑encoded library evolution would become a widely adopted discovery tool.*  
  **Outcome:** While DNA‑encoded libraries are now commonplace, the specific “restore‑library‑after‑each‑round” approach has not been broadly adopted; most companies use static DELs with high‑throughput sequencing.

- **Prediction:** *The technology would address “long‑standing chemistry issues” and yield molecules with superior potency and selectivity.*  
  **Outcome:** No public data demonstrate that DiCE’s hits outperformed those from conventional DELs or fragment‑based methods.

Overall, the predictions were overly optimistic; the concrete results fell short of the envisioned breakthroughs.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10**  

The article is a useful snapshot of a niche biotech partnership and illustrates the hype surrounding DNA‑directed small‑molecule evolution in 2016, but the subsequent lack of tangible outcomes limits its long‑term relevance.
