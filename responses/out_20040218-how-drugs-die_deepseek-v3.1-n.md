# How Drugs Die (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2004 commentary discusses the high failure rate of drugs in clinical trials and challenges the prevailing belief that poor pharmacokinetics (ADME - Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) accounts for approximately 40% of clinical failures. The author cites Hugo Kubinyi's analysis which suggests this widely cited figure is inflated due to a skewed sample set. Kubinyi contends that ADME problems only represent about 7% of drug development failures. Instead, the real culprit appears to be **lack of efficacy in Phase II trials**, which accounts for 46% of failures according to Kubinyi's adjusted data. The article notes the pharmaceutical industry's reluctance to accept these findings, given substantial existing investments in ADME prediction programs and the momentum of established research directions.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent to 2004, drug development failure patterns evolved but largely confirmed the core insights about efficacy challenges:

**Continued High Attrition Rates**: Industry data from 2006-2020 consistently showed Phase II remained the primary bottleneck, with failure rates often exceeding 60%. The lack of clinical efficacy continued to dominate as the primary reason for discontinuation.

**Mechanism Validation**: Over the next two decades, the industry increasingly recognized that **target validation** - ensuring a drug target actually drives disease - was more critical than ADME optimization. Many expensive failures resulted from pursuing biologically plausible but therapeutically ineffective targets.

**Regulatory Adaptations**: The FDA and EMA introduced adaptive trial designs and biomarkers to improve early efficacy signals, directly addressing the Phase II efficacy challenge identified in the article.

**ADME Technology Evolution**: While ADME prediction tools improved significantly through computational approaches and in vitro models, they didn't eliminate the basic problem: compounds with excellent ADME properties still failed at high rates when they didn't work biologically.

**Business Impact**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted portfolio management strategies prioritizing targets with strong human genetic validation, recognizing that efficacy concerns outweighed ADME optimization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **"Many people have just decided to ignore Kubinyi's contention and carry on as if nothing had happened"**: This prediction proved largely accurate. Despite the argument being valid, the ADME prediction industry continued growing, with companies like Cyprotex, Pharmaron, and numerous CROs expanding ADME services through the 2010s. However, investment focus gradually shifted toward target validation.

• **Implicit prediction that efficacy would remain the core challenge**: This proved prescient. Phase II efficacy failures remained the dominant cause of drug development attrition through 2020 and beyond.

• **Implicit prediction about momentum of ADME programs**: Correct - ADME research programs maintained significant funding, though their strategic importance evolved from being "the bottleneck" to being one component of multi-parameter optimization.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article identified a crucial insight about drug development that proved durable and strategically important over nearly two decades. It correctly challenged industry orthodoxy about the primary causes of failure, highlighting the critical importance of clinical efficacy over pharmacokinetic optimization - an insight that shaped smarter R&D investment strategies and portfolio management approaches in the pharmaceutical industry.
