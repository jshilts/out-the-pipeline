# Genentech's Big Worry: Roche? (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports a whistle‑blower lawsuit filed by former Genentech employee Juliet Kniley.  The suit alleges that, in 2008‑09, the Genentech PI3K‑inhibitor team deliberately rushed a clinical trial to meet a deadline imposed by Roche, the parent company.  According to the complaint, Kniley was demoted after warning that the accelerated timeline was unsafe, and she was told twice that Roche would “take this molecule away from us” if the study lagged.  Genentech denied any wrongdoing, and the piece ends by suggesting the lawsuit may reveal tension between Genentech and Roche over the drug’s development.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened to the PI3K programs?**  

| Program | Outcome (post‑2012) | Key points |
|---|---|---|
| **GDC‑0941 (pictilisib)** – a pan‑PI3K inhibitor | Phase III trials in breast cancer (FERGI, PEGGY) failed to meet primary endpoints (2015). Roche discontinued development in 2016. | No FDA approval; the molecule never reached the market. |
| **GDC‑0032 (taselisib)** – a β‑sparing PI3K inhibitor | Phase III SANDPIPER trial in HR‑positive, HER2‑negative breast cancer stopped early (2017) because the benefit‑risk profile was unfavorable. Development halted in 2018. | Again, no approval; the program was written off. |
| **Copanlisib (BAY 80‑6946)** – a PI3Kα/δ inhibitor acquired from Bayer | FDA approval for relapsed follicular lymphoma (2017). Marketed by Roche under the brand *Aliqopa*. | Represents Roche’s successful PI3K entry, but it is a different chemical series from the Genentech programs. |
| **Alpelisib (BYL719, Piqray)** – a PI3Kα inhibitor from Novartis | FDA approval (2019) for HR‑positive, HER2‑negative breast cancer with PIK3CA mutation. Roche licensed the drug for Europe and other regions. | Shows that the PI3K target remained attractive, but the successful drug came from outside Genentech. |

**Legal/Corporate aftermath**  

* The whistle‑blower complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in 2012.  Public docket information shows the case was **dismissed without prejudice** in 2015; no settlement was reported, and no admission of wrongdoing was made by Genentech or Roche.  

* Roche’s acquisition of Genentech (completed in 2009) made Roche the ultimate owner of all Genentech assets.  There is no public evidence that Roche ever “took the molecule away” in the sense of stripping Genentech of rights; rather, the two entities have operated as a single integrated R&D organization since the acquisition.  

* The broader PI3K field continued to be active, but the specific Genentech molecules cited in the article never reached patients.  Roche’s PI3K portfolio shifted toward copanlisib and later to collaborations (e.g., alpelisib) rather than the internal programs that were the subject of the lawsuit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not contain explicit, quantified predictions, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Roche would intervene to accelerate the PI3K trial, possibly taking the molecule away from Genentech if timelines were not met.*  
  - **Outcome:** Roche already owned Genentech; there is no record of a formal “take‑away.”  The internal pressure alleged in the suit may have existed, but the programs were ultimately discontinued after failing late‑stage trials, not because Roche seized them for another partner.

- **Prediction 2 (implicit):** *The rushed study could jeopardize patient safety and damage the drug’s prospects.*  
  - **Outcome:** Both GDC‑0941 and GDC‑0032 failed in Phase III for efficacy (and in some cases raised safety concerns).  While the lawsuits allege ethical lapses, the primary reason the drugs never reached market was lack of clinical benefit, not a proven safety breach from a rushed schedule.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  

The story offers a glimpse into internal pressures within a major biotech merger and foreshadows the eventual failure of two high‑profile PI3K programs, but the specific whistle‑blower claim never led to a landmark legal precedent or a lasting change in industry practice.  Its relevance is moderate for those studying drug‑development governance and the challenges of PI3K drug discovery.
