# Alzheimer's Antibodies: Can the Current Ones Even Work? (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary examines a Melbourne research paper questioning whether anti-beta-amyloid antibodies could effectively engage their targets in human tissue. The study found that three major antibody candidates—bapineuzumab, solanezumab, and crenezumab—performed very differently in human brain tissue compared to mouse models. While bapineuzumab captured various N-terminally truncated Aβ species, solanezumab detection was barely above limits and crenezumab detected none at all. Notably, none of the antibodies could detect Aβ species in human blood. The paper raised concerns about extensive cross-reactivity with non-Aβ proteins, particularly the IL-12 receptor, suggesting that transgenic mouse studies may have been misleading and that the "peripheral sink" mechanism proposed for solanezumab might not function in humans.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent development of these antibodies largely validated the concerns raised in this 2014 analysis, though with some important nuances:

**Bapineuzumab** was already in late-stage trials when this article published. The drug ultimately failed in Phase 3 trials, showing no clinical benefit despite some evidence of target engagement.

**Solanezumab** continued through multiple Phase 3 trials (EXPEDITION 1, 2, 3) with consistently negative results for moderate Alzheimer's disease. Lilly shifted strategy to focus on preclinical/prodromal populations, initiating the landmark A4 (Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's) prevention trial. However, the drug showed no cognitive benefit even in these earlier disease stages.

**Crenezumab** also failed in multiple Phase 2 and 3 trials despite continued development by Roche/Genentech. The CREAD 1 and 2 trials were terminated early in 2019 due to futility analyses.

The broader class of anti-amyloid antibodies has seen mixed outcomes. While most antibodies failed, **aducanumab** (Biogen/Eisai) received controversial FDA approval in 2021 based on surrogate biomarker endpoints rather than proven clinical benefit. **Lecanemab** later showed modest cognitive slowing (0.45 points on CDR-SB at 18 months) in the CLARITY AD trial, receiving FDA approval in 2023, though with significant safety concerns including brain swelling and bleeding.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **The article questioned whether the antibody programs were "doomed"** - This proved largely accurate. Bapineuzumab, solanezumab, and crenezumab all failed to show clinical efficacy in subsequent trials despite billions in investment.

• **Concerns about mouse models being misleading** - Validated by the stark contrast between promising mouse data and repeated human trial failures across the entire anti-amyloid antibody class.

• **Cross-reactivity concerns** - While the specific IL-12 receptor finding wasn't pursued as a major drug mechanism, the broader issue of off-target effects and poor target engagement in humans proved prescient.

• **Questions about "peripheral sink" mechanism** - The failure of solanezumab in prevention trials (including A4) suggested this mechanism either didn't work or wasn't sufficient for clinical benefit.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated remarkable prescience about fundamental problems in Alzheimer's drug development that took years and billions of dollars to fully reveal. It identified critical issues with target engagement and species differences that proved central to the field's struggles, making it highly relevant to understanding why so many promising therapies ultimately failed.

*Note: This analysis reflects the historical record of these drug development programs. The opinions expressed in the original 2014 article about the likelihood of success proved largely accurate, making it a notable example of scientific skepticism that aged well.*
