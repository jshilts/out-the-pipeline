# Recommended Books For Medicinal Chemists, Part One (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a curated list of book recommendations for medicinal chemists, compiled from reader suggestions. The author categorizes the recommendations by specialty: general medicinal chemistry (recommending Rydzewski's "Real World Drug Discovery," Wermuth's "The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry," Patrick's "An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry," and Silverman's "The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action"); process chemistry (Anderson's "Practical Process Research & Development" and Lee & Robinson's "Process Development: Fine Chemicals from Grams to Kilograms"); drug discovery case histories (Ng's "Drugs: From Discovery to Approval" and Sneader's "Drug Discovery: A History"); enzyme inhibitors (Copeland's "Evaluation of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug Discovery"); biology primers for chemists (Kenakin's "A Pharmacology Primer" and Nogrady & Weaver's "Molecular Biology in Medicinal Chemistry"); ADME/tox and pharmacokinetics (Kerns & Di's "Drug-like Properties," Birkett's "Pharmacokinetics Made Easy," and Casarett & Doull's "Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisons"). The article serves as a practical reading guide for practitioners rather than a commentary on industry trends.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article was published, the recommended books largely remained staple references in medicinal chemistry education and practice. Several of the texts saw updated editions: Wermuth's "The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry" reached at least a 4th edition; Kenakin's "A Pharmacology Primer" had a 4th edition by 2014 and a 5th edition by 2018; Rydzewski's "Real World Drug Discovery" continued to be cited; Silverman's "The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action" (3rd edition) and Patrick's "An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry" (6th edition) became widely adopted in university courses. Kerns & Di's "Drug-like Properties" (2008) solidified its place as a core text in ADME optimization. The field itself increasingly integrated structure-based design, computational methods, and biologics, but the foundational medicinal chemistry principles these books covered remained relevant for small-molecule drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article did not contain specific predictions about future industry developments or drug outcomes; it was a resource list rather than a forward-looking commentary. Therefore, no prediction analysis applies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This is a useful but narrow reference list for practitioners rather than a broader industry analysis; it lacks prediction, debate, or retrospective insight, making it of limited general interest for assessing biotech trends after the fact.
