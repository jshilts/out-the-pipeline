# (Un)stoppable Pixantrone (January 2012)

## 1. Summary
This article reports on Cell Therapeutics' persistent, and ultimately failed, efforts to gain FDA approval for pixantrone, an investigational drug for last-ditch non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The piece highlights a history of setbacks, noting that in 2010 an FDA advisory committee voted 12-0 against recommending the drug. Despite this, the company's CEO remained publicly confident of eventual approval, claiming a major FDA critic of the drug had been disciplined. Just days before an expected FDA decision, Cell Therapeutics abruptly withdrew its application, citing "communication difficulties with the FDA." The author frames the story as a case study in regulatory failure and wishful corporate thinking.

## 2. History
After the January 2012 withdrawal, Cell Therapeutics continued to pursue approval for pixantrone. The drug was eventually **approved in Europe in May 2012** by the EMA under the brand name Pixuvri®, indicated as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas. However, the drug failed to gain traction in the market. In the U.S., the company resubmitted its application but again **failed to secure FDA approval**; the drug remains unapproved in the United States.

Cell Therapeutics, later rebranded as **CTI BioPharma**, continued to struggle financially. While Pixuvri remained on the market in Europe, its commercial impact was negligible due to a limited niche indication, competition from more effective therapies and CAR-T treatments, and a lack of U.S. approval. The company's stock price remained highly volatile and generally declined over the long term. CTI BioPharma eventually shifted its focus to other assets and was acquired by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (Sobi) in 2023, with Pixuvri representing a minor, legacy part of its portfolio.

## 3. Predictions
*   **The article suggested the company was refusing to accept the FDA's clear signals that the drug was "not approvable."** This assessment proved correct. While the company did briefly succeed in securing European approval, its subsequent failure to gain U.S. approval and the drug's minimal commercial success validate the article's implication that the company's confidence was misplaced. The ultimate market outcome aligned more with the FDA's initial skepticism than with the company's persistent optimism.

## 4. Interest
Rating: **5/10**

The article serves as a prescient snapshot of a stubborn biotech failure, correctly identifying a company's refusal to accept regulatory realities, though its interest is limited by the drug's subsequent lack of significant clinical or commercial impact.
