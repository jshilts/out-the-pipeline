I notice that you've referenced an article titled "Combichem Into Drugs: How Many?" dated October 14, 2014, but the article content itself wasn't included in your message. The text you've provided appears to be just a brief introduction to the topic.

To properly analyze the article's claims and predictions about combinatorial chemistry in drug discovery, I would need the complete article text. Could you please provide the full article content? This would allow me to give you a thorough analysis including:

1. **Summary** of the article's main arguments and claims
2. **Historical context** of what happened in combinatorial chemistry and drug discovery since 2014
3. **Prediction accuracy** assessment of the article's forecasts
4. **Interest ranking** based on the significance and lasting impact of the combichem field

Once you share the complete article, I can deliver the detailed hindsight analysis you're looking for.
