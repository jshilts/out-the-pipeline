# Experiments, Lots of Experiments (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reviews Michael Shevlin's ACS MedChem Lett perspective on high-throughput experimentation (HTE) in drug discovery chemistry. Shevlin, writing from Merck's experience, encourages labs to deploy HTE for reaction discovery and optimization while urging caution in execution. The core rationale is threefold: go big—run orders of magnitude more experiments to explore novel bond-forming approaches; go small—use miniaturization to stretch precious scaffolds across arrays; and go fast—offload routine reagent/solvent/parameter screening so chemists can focus on higher-level design. Shevlin emphasizes careful upfront choice of array constituents (e.g., solvent screens spanning dielectric, polarity, and functional-group diversity) and robust controls, while the author adds a "Law of Automation" warning that robots can amplify errors faster than humans if not supervised. The vision is that automation frees medicinal chemists from grunt work, elevating their role to tasks machines cannot do and eventually leading to fewer but more highly leveraged chemists.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years after 2017, HTE and lab automation expanded significantly across drug discovery. Pharma and biotech embraced HTE for reaction screening, route scouting, and reaction optimization at scale, increasingly pairing it with statistical design (DoE) and multi‑parameter optimization. Notable public examples include Merck's own continuous‑flow and HTE platforms, Novartis's automated synthesis capabilities, and biotech platforms such as Relay Therapeutics and Arcadia Science, which use HTE for rapid SAR exploration.

The trend toward miniaturization and automation contributed to a pipeline of small‑molecule drugs where HTE‑accelerated SAR and lead optimization reduced cycle times. For instance, HTE has been credited with enabling faster diversification of kinase inhibitor scaffolds and accelerating late‑stage functionalization campaigns that improve ADME or IP positions. Several drugs benefiting from rapid screening and optimization entered trials; where approvals occurred, uptake followed standard efficacy/safety metrics rather than HTE itself. For example, KRAS inhibitors like sotorasib (Amgen, approved 2021) leveraged extensive SAR, often underpinned by high‑throughput chemistry and crystallography, to address challenging shallow binding pockets. Similarly, BTK and CDK4/6 inhibitor programs used HTE to refine selectivity and potency.

Shevlin's caution against "high‑throughput waste of time" proved prescient. Labs that merely scaled up poorly designed experiments without statistical rigor often generated uninterpretable noise. By contrast, programs combining HTE with careful variable selection, informatics, and closed‑loop design of experiments generally accelerated timelines and improved success rates. Public policy did not change directly because of HTE, but regulatory agencies increasingly expected pharmas to justify impurity fate/limits and synthetic route robustness—tasks where HTE and automated analytics streamline risk assessment. Automation kept expanding, encompassing liquid handlers, plate readers, automated NMR/LC‑MS, and—increasingly—AI‑assisted reaction planning. The corollary of freeing chemists from grunt work did indeed shift roles toward strategic design, data interpretation, and cross‑functional problem‑solving, often with smaller core chemistry teams supplemented by automation specialists and informaticians.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "We may well end up with fewer people doing medicinal chemistry, but they'll be working at, on average, a higher level than we tend to work at now..."  
**Outcome**: Broadly correct. Pharma and biotech have consolidated core medicinal chemistry groups while expanding automation and data science roles. Automated HTE, parallel synthesis, and AI tools now handle much of the routine screening and library synthesis. The remaining chemists focus more on experimental design, target analysis, SAR interpretation, and multi‑functional project leadership. Shevlin's call to "spend more time carefully choosing constituents" prefigured the industry shift toward quality‑over‑quantity experimental arrays guided by mechanistic hypotheses and DoE.

• **Prediction**: "More and more things will come to look just that odd [as lacking autosamplers on NMR/LC‑MS], in time."  
**Outcome**: Accurate. The absence of automation on analytical instruments now appears quaint and inefficient. Labs routinely use autosamplers for LC‑MS, UPLC, and NMR, and increasingly deploy end‑to‑end workflows for HTE analytics. The trend extended beyond analytics to integrated synthesis‑purification‑analysis platforms, exemplified by systems such as the Chemspeed SWING and GSK/TTP Labtech collaborations, which reduce manual intervention for entire screening campaigns.

• **Prediction**: HTE will accelerate breakthroughs in "unprecedented" bond‑forming reactions and facilitate "see what happens" exploratory chemistry.  
**Outcome**: Partially realized. HTE has enabled rapid exploration of new catalytic manifolds (e.g., photoredox, C–H functionalization, asymmetric hydrogenation), with campaigns generating thousands of data points for optimization. However, truly breakthrough bond‑forming methods remain incremental rather than revolutionary. HTE's main impact has been on practical route optimization, late‑stage diversification, and impurity fate studies—delivering efficiency gains and risk reduction more than paradigm‑shifting new reactions.

• **Prediction**: Robots "screwing up an experiment faster and more thoroughly than you could ever screw it up by hand" if not supervised.  
**Outcome**: Valid concern that labs learned to manage. Failures included contamination from cross‑talk, solvent/solution mishandling, tip‑clogging, and erroneous cherry‑picking, but these spurred better validation protocols, QC plate readers, acoustic dispensing, and automated logging. When well‑controlled, HTE proved robust for SAR, library synthesis, and clinical candidate optimization across numerous small‑molecule programs.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**  
The article correctly identified a durable shift toward lab automation and thoughtful experimental arrays in drug discovery, but HTE was already an established tactic by 2017. Its interest stems from framing practical advice (measure twice, cut once) about leveraging automation without hyping it, which remains relevant as labs integrate AI and robotics.
