# Taking Risks - You Have To, So Do It Right (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article highlights a post by Michael Gilman discussing risk management in biotechnology and pharmaceutical development through the lens of hypothesis testing. The commentary emphasizes three critical types of hypotheses that drug discovery programs must navigate: biological hypotheses (what molecular targets and pathways are involved), clinical hypotheses (how interventions will meaningfully improve patient outcomes), and commercial hypotheses (why patients, physicians, and payers will value the drug). The author stresses the expensive consequences of mismatches between these three hypothesis types, and advocates for careful front-loading of experimental risk—solving major questions as early and cheaply as possible in the development process. The piece also discusses portfolio management strategies, recommending a balance where programs address their biggest risks early rather than deferring them to expensive Phase III trials, particularly avoiding portfolios dominated by high-risk, long-duration programs in areas like Alzheimer's or rheumatoid arthritis.

## 2. HISTORY
The risk management framework articulated in 2014 proved prescient as the biotech industry faced significant challenges in the subsequent decade. In Alzheimer's disease, which the article specifically mentioned as high-risk, numerous expensive Phase III failures occurred, including Eli Lilly's solanezumab, Roche's gantenerumab, and Biogen's early aducanumab trials. The article's emphasis on commercial hypotheses became particularly relevant with the approval of Biogen's Aduhelm in 2021, which faced payer resistance and limited patient uptake despite FDA approval, demonstrating exactly the commercial mismatch warned about. The framework also anticipated the high-profile clinical failures in gene therapy programs, where biological hypotheses about delivery mechanisms and long-term effects proved overly optimistic.

The strategy of front-loading risk became increasingly common, with companies like Moderna demonstrating this approach through rapid platform validation before the COVID-19 pandemic. The biotech market correction of 2021-2023 reinforced these principles, as companies with poorly differentiated programs or weak commercial hypotheses struggled to raise capital, while those with clear pathways to derisking fared better.

In clinical trial design, the period saw increased adoption of adaptive trial designs, biomarker-stratified approaches, and basket trials, which allowed for earlier hypothesis testing and risk reduction. Companies like Vertex demonstrated success with the rigorous hypothesis-testing approach in cystic fibrosis, systematically validating targets and building a robust franchise.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions about biotech risk management:

• **Prediction**: High-risk, long-duration programs (specifically mentioning Alzheimer's and rheumatoid arthritis) would create "gigantic multiyear money furnaces"
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Alzheimer's programs particularly saw numerous expensive Phase III failures, with programs costing hundreds of millions to billions of dollars before failure. Biogen's aducanumab development exemplifies this pattern.

• **Prediction**: Programs would "come to grief" due to mismatches between biological, clinical, and commercial hypotheses
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Multiple examples emerged, including: Amarin's Vascepa struggling with payer acceptance despite clinical success; expensive gene therapies like Novartis's Zolgensma and Luxturna having limited commercial uptake due to pricing challenges; and weight loss drugs demonstrating that commercial hypotheses can sometimes exceed expectations (semaglutide/Wegovy uptake surpassed projections).

• **Prediction**: "Ostensibly successful trials have come to nothing because they were set up to answer the wrong questions"
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. The fastest FDA approval in history (Biogen's Aduhelm) resulted in minimal patient benefit and commercial success due to clinical trial design issues and unclear endpoints. Similarly, many oncology drugs showed statistically significant but clinically marginal benefits in overall survival.

• **Prediction**: Front-loading risk would become essential for portfolio management
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. The 2021-2023 biotech downturn forced companies to prioritize earlier-stage derisking. Companies with strong platform technologies (like CRISPR companies demonstrating ex vivo editing) successfully raised capital while programs with late-stage uncertainties struggled.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article demonstrates enduring relevance by articulating fundamental principles of drug development risk management that remained applicable throughout major industry shifts including the biotech downturn and pandemic-era acceleration. The framework provided proved predictive of key failures and successes in the subsequent decade, making it valuable beyond its original publication context.
