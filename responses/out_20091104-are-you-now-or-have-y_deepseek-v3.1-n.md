# Are You Now, Or Have You Ever Been. . .? (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses conflict of interest disclosure requirements for scientific papers, focusing on a controversial new rule from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). The rule would require authors to disclose not just financial conflicts but also "any personal, professional, political, institutional, religious, or other associations that a reasonable reader would want to know about in relation to the submitted work."

The author raises concerns about the inclusion of "personal," "political," and "religious" disclosure requirements, arguing that determining what constitutes "reasonable" disclosure would be problematic and contentious. Examples given include whether Francis Collins should disclose his Christian beliefs or whether atheist scientists should be flagged as such. The article suggests this could lead to endless arguments and inconsistent application, citing a recent disclosure controversy at the New England Journal of Medicine as evidence of how difficult such requirements can be to implement fairly.

## 2. HISTORY
The ICMJE conflict of interest policies evolved significantly after 2009. The committee continued refining its disclosure requirements, with major updates in 2010, 2017, and most recently in 2019. The focus remained primarily on financial relationships, with non-financial disclosures generally limited to relevant professional relationships rather than personal beliefs.

Federal policies also tightened during this period. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act (2010) mandated disclosure of payments to physicians from pharmaceutical and medical device companies, with data becoming publicly available through the Open Payments database starting in 2014.

Academic institutions and journals increasingly adopted systematic disclosure systems. The Association of American Medical Colleges issued guidelines in 2014 emphasizing that conflict of interest policies should focus on interests that could directly affect research integrity, rather than personal beliefs or political affiliations.

The NEJM continued to face disclosure controversies, notably in 2015 when it was revealed that the journal had failed to disclose financial conflicts involving authors of certain articles. This led to enhanced editorial scrutiny and more rigorous disclosure verification processes.

Major scientific misconduct cases in the 2010s, such as the Stapel fraud case (2011) and various retractions involving manipulated data, reinforced the importance of robust financial conflict disclosure rather than expanding into personal belief disclosure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions about how disclosure requirements might evolve:

• **Prediction: Disclosure requirements would expand to include personal, political, and religious beliefs**
  - **Outcome: This did NOT happen.** ICMJE and most major journals maintained focus on financial conflicts and relevant professional relationships. Personal beliefs remained outside standard disclosure requirements.

• **Prediction: Endless arguments and inconsistent application would result from broad disclosure requirements**
  - **Outcome: The feared expansion didn't occur, so these arguments largely didn't materialize in the way predicted.** However, ongoing debates continued about the appropriate scope and enforcement of financial disclosure requirements.

• **Prediction: NEJM and other journals would struggle with disclosure consistency**
  - **Outcome: Partially accurate.** NEJM and other major journals did face several disclosure-related controversies post-2009, leading to enhanced editorial processes, but these remained focused on financial rather than personal/political disclosures.

• **Prediction: "Reasonable reader" standards would prove unworkable**
  - **Outcome: Accurate in principle, but the feared expansion to personal beliefs never materialized, so this particular implementation challenge was avoided.**

• **Implicit prediction: The slippery slope toward personal belief disclosure would accelerate**
  - **Outcome: Inaccurate.** The scientific community largely rejected this expanded approach, maintaining focus on financial and direct professional conflicts that could objectively influence research outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article addressed legitimate concerns about disclosure policy scope, but the feared expansion to personal/political/religious disclosures never materialized in practice. The piece captures a moment of policy debate but proved largely inaccurate in its predictions about where disclosure requirements would head. The topic remains relevant to ongoing discussions about research integrity, but this particular concern became largely moot.
