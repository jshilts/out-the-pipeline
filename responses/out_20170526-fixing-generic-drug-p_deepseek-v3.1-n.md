# Fixing the Generic Drug Process (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2017 commentary article discusses newly appointed FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb's early stance on generic drug approvals. The author expresses optimism about Gottlieb's commitment to addressing regulatory gaming that allowed companies to extend monopoly periods and artificially inflate prices on old drugs. Specifically mentioned are reforms to the REMS (risk evaluation and mitigation strategies) program, which had been exploited to slow generic competition, and proposals to streamline generic drug review processes while eliminating application backlogs. The article notes how price-gouging scandals involving figures like Martin Shkreli were giving the entire pharmaceutical industry a negative reputation, as the public doesn't distinguish between generic manufacturers and research-driven drug companies.

## 2. HISTORY

In subsequent years, the FDA under Gottlieb made substantial progress on generic drug reforms:

- **REMS Reform**: In June 2018, the FDA finalized guidance allowing generic manufacturers to develop their own REMS programs rather than sharing a single system with brand manufacturers, removing a significant barrier to generic entry.

- **Generic Drug Backlog Elimination**: The FDA successfully eliminated the backlog of over 2,500 pending generic drug applications by 2018, largely through the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) II program.

- **First Generic Approvals**: The agency dramatically increased first generic drug approvals, with 2017 seeing record numbers and 2018 reaching 781 first generic approvals—the highest in FDA history.

- **Drug Competition Action Plan**: Launched in 2017, this comprehensive plan addressed multiple anti-competitive practices including REMS abuse, citizen petition delays, and complex generic development challenges.

However, pricing issues persisted beyond regulatory fixes. While some gaming practices were curtailed, drug pricing remained a contentious political issue throughout the late 2010s and into the 2020s, leading to further legislative proposals like the Inflation Reduction Act's drug pricing provisions in 2022.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Curtailing regulatory gaming**: This largely succeeded through REMS reforms and increased generic approvals, though some anti-competitive behaviors persisted in different forms.

- **Eliminating application backlogs**: Successfully achieved by 2018 through GDUFA II implementation.

- **Improving processes for complex generic drugs**: Made progress with guidance documents, but complex generics (especially biologics/biosimilars) remained challenging and relatively underdeveloped compared to small molecule generics.

- **Industry reputation improvement**: The hoped-for reputational boost was limited; drug pricing controversies continued through subsequent years with insulin pricing, EpiPen scandals, and broader political debates about pharmaceutical industry practices.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

While the article identified important regulatory issues and their reform was significant, the piece was too narrowly focused on specific FDA procedural changes rather than the broader systemic factors driving pharmaceutical pricing and access.
