# Steve Nissen's Meeting with GSK (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a revealing encounter between Dr. Steve Nissen, a prominent cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, and executives from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) prior to the publication of Nissen's meta-analysis on the cardiovascular safety of Avandia (rosiglitazone), GSK's blockbuster diabetes drug. The meeting occurred while both parties were preparing their respective studies—Nissen's meta-analysis and GSK's RECORD trial—that would address Avandia's cardiovascular risk profile.

The text reveals two significant ethical breaches: first, an unidentified peer reviewer had inappropriately faxed a copy of Nissen's unpublished manuscript to GSK, and second, Nissen secretly recorded the meeting (legal under Ohio's one-party consent laws). During the recorded conversation, GSK's chief medical officer Dr. Krall references specific statistical outcomes from the ongoing RECORD study—specifically mentioning a hazard ratio of 1.12—while claiming not to know the actual results. This raised questions about whether GSK executives had advance knowledge of their trial's outcomes before publicly reporting them. When asked how he would respond if the RECORD trial showed a hazard ratio of 1.12, Nissen stated unequivocally that he would "pull the drug." The actual RECORD interim results, published two months later, showed a hazard ratio of 1.11 with borderline statistical significance due to methodological limitations.

## 2. HISTORY

The fallout from this incident marked a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical regulatory history and the Avandia saga:

**Regulatory Actions and Market Withdrawal:**
In September 2010, the FDA significantly restricted Avandia's use, requiring it to be available only through a special restricted access program due to cardiovascular safety concerns. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) suspended Avandia's marketing authorization entirely in September 2010. The drug was effectively removed from the European market and severely restricted in the United States. In November 2011, GSK agreed to stop enrolling new patients in the TIDE trial, the controversial study designed to compare Avandia with Actos. The FDA lifted some restrictions in 2013 after re-evaluating the data, but by then Avandia's market presence had been decimated.

**GSK's Legal and Financial Consequences:**
In July 2012, GSK agreed to pay \$3 billion to settle allegations including failure to report safety data and inappropriate marketing of Avandia and other drugs. This was one of the largest healthcare fraud settlements in U.S. history at the time. The settlement included \$657 million specifically related to Avandia civil liabilities. GSK's legal troubles extended beyond this settlement, with numerous individual lawsuits from patients who had suffered cardiovascular events while taking the drug.

**Impact on Pharmaceutical Industry Practices:**
The Avandia scandal, including this Nissen-GSK meeting revelation, contributed to major changes in clinical trial transparency requirements. The incident highlighted issues with selective reporting of clinical trial data and the pharmaceutical industry's control over research dissemination. These revelations were instrumental in strengthening requirements for clinical trial registration and results reporting that became more stringent in subsequent years.

**Scientific Community Response:**
The controversy led to enhanced scrutiny of meta-analyses and observational studies in drug safety assessment. It also influenced methodological discussions about how to handle missing data and how to properly evaluate cardiovascular safety signals in diabetes drugs, ultimately affecting the design of cardiovascular outcome trials for subsequent diabetes medications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction from the article:** "Somehow, I don't think that many pharma executives are going to agree to meetings with Nissen in his office in Cleveland after this."

**What actually happened:**
- ✓ **Partially accurate prediction:** While pharmaceutical executives did not completely cease interactions with Nissen, the incident did significantly increase the tension and formality of such meetings. The recording revelation made pharmaceutical companies much more cautious about direct, unmonitored communications with vocal critics like Nissen.
- ✓ **Changed dynamics:** Subsequent interactions between pharmaceutical companies and outspoken physician-scientists became more formal, often involving legal counsel or occurring in more controlled environments. However, pharmaceutical companies still engage with key opinion leaders and critics, recognizing the necessity of scientific dialogue.
- ✓ **Documentation practices changed:** The incident influenced how pharmaceutical companies document interactions with external experts, leading to more thorough and legally careful communication practices throughout the industry.

**Unstated but implied prediction about Avandia's future:**

**What actually happened:**
- The article suggested that a hazard ratio around 1.11-1.12 would be concerning enough to warrant removing the drug. Indeed, this is essentially what transpired—the 1.11 hazard ratio from the poorly conducted RECORD trial, combined with Nissen's meta-analysis and other evidence, led to severe regulatory restrictions and practical removal from the market in most jurisdictions. The prediction implicit in Nissen's statement proved prescient regarding regulatory outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides a crucial window into the intersection of clinical science, corporate behavior, and regulatory oversight during a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical history. The recording revelation exposed the sophisticated information networks between peer reviewers and pharmaceutical companies, highlighting systemic problems in clinical trial transparency that led to concrete regulatory reforms and billion-dollar legal settlements. While focused on a specific incident, its implications for drug safety oversight and industry accountability give it lasting significance.
