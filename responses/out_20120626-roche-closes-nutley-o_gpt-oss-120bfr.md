# Roche Closes Nutley, Once Its US R&D Home (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that Roche announced the shutdown of its long‑standing research complex in Nutley, New Jersey – a site that had been operating since the 1930s and employed roughly 1,000 scientists and support staff. All discovery‑stage work would be transferred to Roche’s larger R&D hubs in Germany and Switzerland. Roche said it would replace the large site with a much smaller “translational research center” on the U.S. East Coast, intended to support clinical‑trial activities, FDA interactions, and collaborations with U.S. academia and biotech firms. The author speculated that the new center might end up in the Boston/Cambridge biotech corridor.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑closure restructuring (2012‑2015)**  
- The Nutley campus was formally vacated by the end of 2012; most of the 1,000 employees were either offered relocation to Roche sites in Basel, Mannheim, or to other U.S. locations, or received severance.  
- In 2013 Roche announced the creation of a **Roche Translational Research Center (TRC)** in **New Brunswick, NJ**, employing about 200‑250 staff. The TRC focused on early‑phase clinical development, biomarker work, and regulatory science rather than basic discovery. This matches the article’s description of a “smaller translational research center,” though the location turned out to be New Brunswick rather than Boston.  

**Integration with Genentech and U.S. R&D footprint (2014‑2020)**  
- Roche’s 2009 acquisition of Genentech continued to shape its U.S. R&D strategy. By 2015 the majority of discovery‑stage work in the United States was conducted at Genentech’s South‑San Francisco campus, while the New Brunswick TRC handled translational activities.  
- Roche opened a **Roche Innovation Center** in **Boston** in 2015, primarily to foster collaborations with local academic institutions and biotech start‑ups. This later expansion partially fulfills the author’s “Boston/Cambridge deal” speculation, though it is a distinct entity from the New Jersey TRC.  

**Impact on pipelines and product launches**  
- The closure of Nutley did not impede Roche’s pipeline. Between 2013 and 2022 the company received FDA approvals for several high‑impact drugs, including **Ocrevus** (ocrelizumab, 2017, multiple sclerosis), **Hemlibra** (emicizumab, 2017, hemophilia A), **Polivy** (polatuzumab vedotin, 2019, lymphoma), and **Cotellic** (cobimetinib, 2015, melanoma).  
- None of these products trace their discovery origins to Nutley; most were discovered at Genentech, Basel, or other European sites. The translational work that moved to New Brunswick contributed to the early‑phase clinical programs for some of these molecules, but its contribution is difficult to isolate.  

**Long‑term business outcomes**  
- Roche’s U.S. R&D headcount fell modestly after the Nutley closure (from ~2,200 in 2011 to ~1,900 in 2020) but remained one of the larger pharma R&D presences in the United States.  
- The New Brunswick TRC continues to operate as of 2024, now integrated into Roche’s **Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED)** organization, supporting biomarker development, clinical‑trial design, and FDA liaison.  
- The local New Jersey economy absorbed a portion of the displaced workforce through other biotech firms (e.g., Celgene, Johnson & Johnson) and through the growth of contract research organizations in the region.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** “A location is being identified on the East Coast… likely a Boston/Cambridge deal.”  
  - **Outcome:** Roche did open a Boston‑area Innovation Center in 2015, but the primary translational hub that replaced Nutley was established in New Brunswick, NJ, not Boston. The Boston site serves a complementary partnership role rather than directly replacing Nutley’s functions.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The article implied that Roche’s R&D would continue to thrive despite the closure, by shifting work to Europe and a smaller U.S. hub.  
  - **Outcome:** Roche’s pipeline remained robust, with multiple blockbuster approvals after 2012, indicating the restructuring did not harm its overall innovation capacity.  

- **Implicit prediction:** The loss of 1,000 jobs would be a “very large closing indeed.”  
  - **Outcome:** The job loss was real and had a noticeable local impact, but many employees were redeployed or rehired elsewhere in the company, and the New Brunswick TRC restored roughly a quarter of the headcount within two years.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article captures a notable moment in the reshaping of U.S. pharma R&D geography, and the subsequent developments (new translational hub, Boston partnership) illustrate broader industry trends, though the piece itself is relatively narrow in scope.
