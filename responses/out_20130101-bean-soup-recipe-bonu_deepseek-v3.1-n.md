# A Bean Soup Recipe, With Bonus Country Ham Talk, And a Cameo By Frederick the Great (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal blog post from *Science* magazine's blog section where the author shares a family recipe for white bean soup made with country ham. The article begins with a thought experiment the author conducted with his children about what crops they would grow if they had to be self-sufficient on their small plot of land. He concluded that potatoes, corn, and beans would be the optimal choices for caloric yield and winter storage, referencing Frederick the Great's promotion of potatoes and Native American Three Sisters agriculture.

The recipe itself calls for dried white beans (Great Northern), soaked overnight, then simmered for 2-3 hours with bay leaves, pepper, and chunks of country ham—a salty cured ham specialty from the Southern US. The author provides specific recommendations for country ham brands (Burger's, Tripp, Mar-Tenn) and cooking tips to achieve the right texture without turning the beans to mush. The post is framed as comfort food for New Year's Day, representing a simpler alternative to richer holiday meals.

## 2. HISTORY

This blog post appeared in the science blogging ecosystem but has minimal connection to biotechnology or scientific research. It's primarily a lifestyle/cooking piece cross-posted to a science audience, which was common practice for science blogs in the early 2010s.

The article had no measurable impact on biotechnology, drug development, scientific methods, or public policy. None of the agricultural or food preservation concepts discussed led to research breakthroughs or commercial applications in the subsequent decade. The country ham brands mentioned (Burger's, Tripp, and the potentially defunct Mar-Tenn) continued as regional food producers with no expansion into biotech or scientific ventures. No regulatory changes, clinical trials, or scientific publications resulted from this content. The post represents personal culinary content rather than scientific or biotechnological discourse, and no later developments connected back to this specific article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about biotechnology, scientific developments, or future trends. The only forward-looking statements are:

- **Implicit expectation that readers might try the recipe**: The author provides detailed cooking instructions and brand recommendations, implying readers could replicate the dish. This is standard recipe sharing with no measurable outcome to evaluate.

- **Continuation of agricultural practices**: The piece implicitly assumes traditional farming and food preservation methods would remain relevant, which they have, though this wasn't presented as a formal prediction.

There are no testable scientific, medical, or biotechnological predictions in the article.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 0/10**

This is a cooking recipe blog post with no relevance to biotechnology, science policy, or drug development. The article is completely off-topic for the analytical framework requested and contains zero information about the biotechnology industry despite being hosted on *Science* magazine's blog network. It's a lifestyle piece about bean soup and country ham, not a scientific commentary.
