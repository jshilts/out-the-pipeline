# The Cost of Developing A New Drug (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2014 article discusses a new estimate from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development regarding the cost of developing a new drug. The author notes that Tufts estimates have historically generated polarized reactions—drug R&D professionals generally find them credible, while industry pricing critics view them as inflated. The article references Bruce Booth's detailed analysis, which breaks down the three components of drug development costs: direct out-of-pocket expenses, costs associated with failed drugs (attrition), and time/opportunity costs of capital. Booth's conclusion was that while the rise of orphan drugs might affect direct cost calculations, the overall Tufts estimate was reasonably accurate and not off by the order of magnitude suggested by critics who advanced significantly lower cost estimates.

## 2. HISTORY
In the decade following this 2014 article, several relevant developments occurred:

**Continued Cost Escalation**: Post-2014 data confirmed and even exceeded the trends discussed. By 2022, various analyses showed drug development costs continuing to rise, with estimates ranging from $1.3 billion to over $2.8 billion per approved drug, including capitalized costs and accounting for failures. The factors identified in 2014—attrition rates, regulatory complexity, and opportunity costs—remained central drivers.

**Critics vs. Industry Data**: The debate between critics (like Donald Light) and industry continued throughout 2015-2024. Critics maintained that industry calculations overestimated true costs through questionable methodology, pointing to substantial government funding and inflated costs of capital. Industry sources continued citing Tufts-like methodology, emphasizing that excluding failures and opportunity costs made comparisons misleading.

**Regulatory and Policy Response**: The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) attempted to streamline drug development, partially in response to cost concerns. However, costs continued rising, and drug pricing became an even more prominent political issue, leading to the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), which included Medicare drug price negotiation provisions—a direct policy response to concerns about pharmaceutical pricing and R&D cost justifications.

**Orphan Drug Evolution**: The trend noted in 2014 accelerated significantly. By 2022, orphan drugs represented approximately 40-50% of FDA approvals, with different cost structures but still substantial development expenses.

**Methodological Refinements**: Subsequent analyses have refined both direct cost measurement and the treatment of opportunity costs, but the fundamental tripartite structure identified in 2014 remains the standard framework for discussing drug development economics.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not explicitly make predictions but discussed ongoing debates and methodological considerations. The underlying analysis it referenced (Bruce Booth's assessment of Tufts estimates) indicated that:

• **Implicit prediction**: The Tufts cost methodology was sufficiently accurate and not off by orders of magnitude
  - **Outcome**: Appears largely validated—subsequent analyses have confirmed rising costs, with estimates mostly clustering in the billion-dollar-plus range, though methodological debates continue about exact components and calculations

• **Implicit trend**: The rise in orphan drugs would continue affecting cost calculations
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed—orphan drugs became an increasingly dominant share of approvals, though their development costs, while different in structure, remained substantial

• **Implicit assumption**: Critics' alternative estimates (orders of magnitude lower) were fundamentally flawed
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated—while specific low estimates remained outliers, the broader debate continued with more nuanced positions emerging on both sides over time

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4/9**

This scores in the 40-49th percentile of interest. While the article addresses an important and persistent issue, it primarily discusses methodology rather than reporting dramatic new findings or paradigm shifts. The topic remains highly relevant to policy and industry economics, but the analysis format is more focused on evaluating existing estimates than exploring new territory.
