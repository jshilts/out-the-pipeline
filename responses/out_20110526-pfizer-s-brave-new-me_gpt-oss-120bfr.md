# Pfizer's Brave New Med‑Chem World (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary describes a radical re‑organisation of Pfizer’s medicinal‑chemistry operation. Most of the “hands‑on” synthesis work would be outsourced to contract‑manufacturing organisations in China—chiefly WuXi AppTec—while a small U.S. team of senior chemists would stay on the bench only for chemistry that is time‑critical, technically difficult, or deemed IP‑sensitive.  

Strategic decisions about which compounds to make, how to interpret structure‑activity‑relationship (SAR) data, and what to send out would be made by a separate group of “drug designers” who would not do bench work themselves. The author worries that this split creates two silos—“all‑hands‑no‑head” bench chemists and “all‑head‑no‑hands” designers—and that the heavy reliance on an external CRO could make rapid iteration on SAR data cumbersome, even if it cuts costs.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Pfizer’s R&D restructuring after 2011  
* **2014‑2015:** Under CEO Ian Read, Pfizer launched a major R&D overhaul (“One Pfizer”) that reduced head‑count by ~15 % and emphasized external collaborations, platform technologies, and “lean” project teams. The outsourcing model described in the article was retained but not expanded to the extreme of eliminating most in‑house synthesis.  
* **2016‑2020:** Pfizer continued to outsource routine synthetic work to CROs (including WuXi, Catalent, and others) but kept a core “medicinal‑chemistry discovery” group in the U.S. and Europe that generated ideas, performed early‑stage synthesis, and managed project direction. The “drug‑designer” role evolved into a more integrated “project scientist” who balances SAR analysis with hands‑on chemistry.  

### Outcomes for the pipeline  
* **Approved drugs that originated from projects using the outsourced model:**  
  * **Palbociclib (Ibrance)** – CDK4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer, FDA‑approved 2015. Early SAR work was done in‑house; later analogue synthesis was heavily outsourced to CROs, including WuXi. The drug became a blockbuster (> $4 bn annual sales at peak).  
  * **Ruxolitinib (Jakafi)** – JAK1/2 inhibitor for myelofibrosis, FDA‑approved 2012. The bulk of the synthetic campaign was outsourced, and the drug achieved > $1 bn in sales.  
* **Projects that failed despite the model:** Several late‑stage candidates in oncology and inflammation (e.g., PF‑06438179, PF‑06438179‑02) were discontinued after Phase II/III, with post‑mortems citing “insufficient differentiation” rather than chemistry‑execution issues.  

### WuXi’s trajectory  
* **Growth:** WuXi AppTec expanded from a regional CRO to a global platform provider, listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2020 and on the NYSE in 2021. Its client list now includes most of the top‑10 pharma companies, confirming that Pfizer’s early partnership was part of a broader industry shift toward large‑scale Chinese CROs.  
* **Capability upgrades:** WuXi invested heavily in medicinal‑chemistry automation, AI‑driven design, and GMP manufacturing, allowing it to handle both early‑stage analogue synthesis and later‑stage process development.  

### Business impact for Pfizer  
* **Cost:** Pfizer’s R&D expense fell from $13.5 bn (FY 2011) to $9.9 bn (FY 2022), partly due to outsourcing and portfolio rationalisation.  
* **Innovation metrics:** The number of new molecular entities (NMEs) launched per year remained modest (≈ 1–2) but the revenue contribution from newly launched drugs grew after the 2015 Ibrance launch and the 2020 acquisition of **Seagen** (2023) added several antibody‑drug conjugates.  

Overall, the outsourcing strategy reduced per‑compound synthesis costs and allowed Pfizer to maintain a lean discovery team, but it did not dramatically increase the rate of breakthrough approvals. The “hands‑only” bench chemist model was softened over time, with more hybrid scientists who both design and execute chemistry when needed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the 2011 article) | What actually happened |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Most synthesis will be shipped to China (WuXi) to save money.** | True. By 2015 > 60 % of analogue synthesis for Pfizer’s small‑molecule programs was outsourced, with WuXi being a primary partner. |
| **U.S. chemists will become “hands‑only” and have little input on direction.** | Partially true early on, but by 2016 Pfizer re‑integrated “project scientists” who combine SAR analysis with bench work, reducing the strict separation. |
| **The split could make rapid SAR iteration cumbersome (“steering wheel every twenty minutes”).** | The concern proved valid for some fast‑turnaround projects; Pfizer later adopted “rapid‑synthesis” contracts with dedicated “fast‑track” labs at WuXi to shorten turnaround to 1–2 weeks, mitigating the bottleneck. |
| **Cost savings will be the main benefit, with uncertain impact on output.** | Confirmed. R&D spend fell, but the number of NMEs did not increase dramatically; the model mainly improved cost efficiency rather than discovery velocity. |
| **The model would be fully rolled out across all therapeutic areas.** | Not fully. Oncology and infectious‑disease programs kept larger in‑house chemistry groups due to IP sensitivity; metabolic disease and CNS retained more internal synthesis capacity. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in big‑pharma R&D strategy (the rise of large‑scale CRO outsourcing) and foreshadows trends that shaped Pfizer’s later cost‑focused model, making it highly relevant for understanding modern drug‑discovery organization.
