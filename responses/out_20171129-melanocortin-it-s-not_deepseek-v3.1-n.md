# Melanocortin: It's Not Just For Lizards Any More (November 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a commentary on melanocortin receptor biology and drug development. It explains how the melanocortin system evolved from a single ancestral pathway into a complex family of five receptor subtypes (MC1R-MC5R) with diverse functions including skin pigmentation, appetite regulation, immune response, and sexual arousal, all activated by different cleavage products of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). 

The author notes that despite the therapeutic potential, developing selective melanocortin drugs has been challenging due to the closely related receptors, leading to side effects from lack of selectivity. Two existing drugs are mentioned: Scenesse (afamelanotide), a marketed but non-selective therapy for skin pigmentation disorders with noticeable side effects administered via subcutaneous implant, and bremelanotide, which was heading to FDA for female sexual dysfunction. The article highlights a new research paper presenting a more selective MC1R-targeting peptide using only standard amino acids, with improved selectivity and longer half-life than endogenous MSH, tested in a color-changing anole lizard assay where it produced reversible skin darkening within 24 hours.

## 2. HISTORY

The period after this article's publication saw several significant developments in the melanocortin drug development space:

**Bremelanotide (Vyleesi)**: In June 2019, the FDA approved bremelanotide for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. The drug is marketed under the brand name Vyleesi and is administered as a subcutaneous autoinjector prior to anticipated sexual activity. However, market uptake has been modest, with sales remaining well below initial projections despite the significant unmet medical need in this indication.

The melanocortin field has continued to see drug development activity targeting various receptor subtypes for different indications, though progress has generally been slower and more challenging than anticipated. The selectivity challenges highlighted in the article remain a persistent issue in melanocortin drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **Prediction**: The new selective MC1R peptide could become a "second-generation therapy" potentially moving into "broader market protecting people at higher risk for melanoma."
  - **Outcome**: This has not materialized to date. No such melanoma prevention drug has reached the market or advanced significantly in clinical development.

- **Prediction**: The approach of developing more selective melanocortin analogs while using only standard amino acids could improve on existing therapies.
  - **Outcome**: While bremelanotide was approved in 2019, there has been limited evidence of second-generation melanocortin therapies achieving significantly better selectivity profiles or clinical success based on the selective peptide design approaches described.

- **Prediction**: The melanocortin field would continue to face the challenge of selectivity due to close receptor similarities.
  - **Outcome**: This has proven accurate. The field continues to struggle with achieving sufficient receptor selectivity, and marketed melanocortin drugs still face side effect challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

The article covers an interesting niche area of pharmacology and drug development, and the 2019 FDA approval of bremelanotide validates some of the broader field activity discussed. However, the more specific predictions about melanoma prevention applications and selective peptide development have not materialized, and the field overall has seen limited major breakthroughs despite the intriguing biology.
