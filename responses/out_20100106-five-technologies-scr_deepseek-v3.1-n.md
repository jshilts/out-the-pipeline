# Five Technologies For the Scrap Heap? (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post references an Xconomy article that identified five biotechnology approaches predicted to become obsolete during the 2010s. The author agrees with the assessment, specifically mentioning that "raw proteomic approach to understanding disease states" and "a lot of the biomarker work being done currently" are included in the list of technologies headed for obsolescence. The post notes that RNA interference and stem cells are explicitly not on the list of fading technologies, implying these were still considered promising at the time. The author provides minimal direct commentary but endorses the overall premise that certain biotech approaches would fade away during the coming decade.

## 2. HISTORY

The biotechnologies discussed experienced dramatically different fates than predicted:

**Proteomics** saw major advances rather than obsolescence. Mass spectrometry technologies improved significantly, with techniques like SWATH-MS and data-independent acquisition becoming widely adopted. The Human Proteome Project launched in 2010, and by 2020, proteomic approaches had become standard in drug discovery, biomarker discovery, and clinical diagnostics. Companies like Olink and SomaLogic developed high-plex proteomic platforms that became commercially successful.

**Biomarkers** became increasingly important rather than fading. The 2010s saw numerous FDA approvals of companion diagnostics based on biomarkers, particularly in oncology. Liquid biopsy technologies emerged as a major application, with companies like Guardant Health (founded 2012) and Foundation Medicine becoming commercial successes. The Precision Medicine Initiative launched in 2015 further accelerated biomarker development and adoption.

The **unmentioned RNA interference** indeed remained promising but faced challenges. While Alnylam's Onpattro (patisiran) became the first FDA-approved RNAi therapeutic in 2018, technical hurdles around delivery and off-target effects limited broader clinical success during the 2010s.

**Stem cells**, also noted as not on the scrap heap, had mixed results. While therapeutic applications progressed more slowly than hoped, CAR-T cell therapies (Kymriah approved 2017, Yescarta approved 2017) demonstrated major clinical success, though these represent a specific subset of cell therapy rather than broad stem cell applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Proteomic approaches to understanding disease states would become obsolete
  - **Reality**: Proteomics became more sophisticated and widely adopted throughout the 2010s, with improved mass spectrometry platforms, standardized workflows, and commercial platforms achieving significant market penetration

• **Prediction**: Much biomarker work would fade away
  - **Reality**: Biomarker research expanded dramatically, driven by precision medicine initiatives, companion diagnostic approvals, and liquid biopsy technologies that became standard clinical tools

• **Prediction**: Five specific biotechnologies would become obsolete during the 2010s
  - **Reality**: The specific technologies mentioned (proteomics and biomarkers) saw growth rather than obsolescence, suggesting the underlying prediction framework was fundamentally flawed or based on outdated assumptions about technological trajectories

• **Implicit prediction**: That RNA interference and stem cells would remain promising (by noting their exclusion)
  - **Reality**: RNAi achieved limited clinical success with delivery challenges persisting; stem cells had mixed results with notable successes in specific applications like CAR-T therapies

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **7/10**

This article serves as a valuable cautionary example of how predictions about technology obsolescence can be fundamentally wrong, particularly when based on current technical limitations rather than potential improvements. The complete reversal of fate for proteomics and biomarkers makes this historically significant for understanding technology forecasting in biotechnology.
