# Artemisia Comes Through Again (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2019 article discusses a clinical trial from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Worcester Polytechnic that examined using tea infusions from two Artemisia (wormwood) species as a treatment for schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease affecting hundreds of millions in tropical regions. The study compared Artemisia tea (three times daily for seven days) versus standard praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, finding that Artemisia appeared "faster and more effective" than the standard drug.

The article provides crucial context: schistosomiasis affects roughly 250 million people, treatments cost $0.30 per dose in Africa ($200-400 in the US), and there are ongoing concerns about praziquantel resistance. Praziquantel is donated by Merck Serono and distributed by the WHO, but affordable doses remain insufficient to meet global need. The Artemisia approach was appealing because the plants grow in affected regions, potentially enabling local production and reduced cost compared to importing praziquantel.

## 2. HISTORY

The central finding of this article collapsed entirely. The paper discussed was **retracted in 2020** due to serious concerns about data reliability. Any conclusions about Artemisia's superiority over praziquantel lack credible scientific support.

**Praziquantel remains the standard of care** for schistosomiasis to the present day. The WHO continues to recommend praziquantel for mass drug administration in endemic areas, with 250-300 million doses donated annually through Merck's program. No Artemisia-based therapies have been approved or widely adopted for schistosomiasis treatment.

**Clinical reality:** While artemisinin and its derivatives (semi-synthetic artesunate) maintain established roles in malaria treatment, evidence supporting their use for schistosomiasis remains limited and mixed. Several studies have explored artemether and artesunate as potential schistosomiasis treatments, but they have not replaced praziquantel as first-line therapy. No regulatory approvals exist for Artemisia tea or extracts for schistosomiasis.

**Public health impact:** Schistosomiasis control programs continue relying primarily on praziquantel mass drug administration, with over 100 million people treated annually. Drug resistance, while a concern, has not rendered praziquantel ineffective at the population level. No significant policy changes resulted from this retracted Artemisia paper.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Artemisia tea would prove faster and more effective than praziquantel**  
This prediction proved false. The underlying data was unreliable and the paper was retracted. No subsequent research has supported this claim.

• **Artemisia could become a local industry more cost-effective than praziquantel imports**  
This did not materialize. No scalable local Artemisia cultivation for schistosomiasis exists anywhere in endemic regions.

• **Practical details like tea vs. tablets could be sorted out through real-world use**  
No such rollout occurred given the scientific evidence collapsed.

• **Artemisia treatment could help ease the schistosomiasis burden globally**  
Not achieved. Artemisia-based therapy plays no meaningful role in schistosomiasis control.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The subject matter—affordable treatments for neglected tropical diseases—is intrinsically important. However, the article's scientific foundation crumbled with the paper's retraction, and it did not catalyze any practical advancements in schistosomiasis treatment. Its primary value today is as a cautionary case about the importance of rigorous scrutiny before embracing clinical trial results.
