# How Not to Do It: Ether Peroxides (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes laboratory safety incidents involving ether peroxides at the "Wonder Drug Factory." Chemists using common solvents like diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran (THF) discovered an unexpected impurity appearing across multiple, unrelated reactions, which turned out to be ether peroxides. These peroxides form over time when oxygen reacts with ether solvents, generating explosive byproducts that persist even when solvents contain radical inhibitors like BHT.

The author explains that while suppliers typically add stabilizers, improper storage or aging can deplete these protective agents, leading to hazardous peroxide accumulation, especially with slow-evaporating ethers like diisopropyl ether where crystalline peroxide can precipitate. The piece closes with an anecdote about a careless molecular biology lab head who shook an aged ether can while listening for solid peroxides inside, demonstrating dangerous laboratory practices.

## 2. HISTORY

Lab safety awareness continued to improve. Years after this article, incidents persist. For example, in 2010, an explosion seriously injured a researcher at Texas Tech handling explosive compounds. The incident highlighted ongoing training gaps. Lab safety protocols contributed to injury reductions. The CDC reported that the rate of non-fatal occupational injuries and illnesses in scientific R&D fell from 1.9 cases per 100 full-time workers in 2006 to 1.2 by 2010. While the article gives no names, recall that peroxides were a known hazard well before 2006, but enforcement, training, and automation have improved. Academic labs now often require peroxide test strips, use metal trays, and date and inspect solvents. These tangible precautions limit harm and liability, but anecdotes suggest gaps remain, especially where shortages lead staff to use old reagents.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not contain explicit predictions about future events. Its focus is on describing current (in 2006) safety incidents and illustrating poor lab practices rather than forecasting industry trends or technological developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This ranks relatively low because it's a narrowly focused laboratory safety reminder about well-known chemical hazards rather than broader developments impacting drug discovery. Important within lab practice, but not central to major biotech trends that followed (e.g. mAbs, gene therapies, or discovery platforms).
