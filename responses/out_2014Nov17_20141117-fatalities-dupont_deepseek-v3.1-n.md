I notice there seems to be some confusion here. The article you've provided is not about the biotechnology industry - it's actually about a fatal chemical accident at a DuPont plant involving methyl mercaptan exposure. This appears to be from a chemistry blog or column rather than a Science Magazine article about biotechnology.

The piece describes an industrial chemical manufacturing incident and focuses on workplace safety in laboratory and chemical plant environments. It has nothing to do with biotechnology topics like genetic engineering, pharmaceuticals, medical diagnostics, or biomanufacturing.

Could you perhaps clarify or provide the correct article about biotechnology that you'd like me to analyze? Alternatively, would you like me to proceed with analyzing this chemical safety article instead, even though it's not biotechnology-related?
