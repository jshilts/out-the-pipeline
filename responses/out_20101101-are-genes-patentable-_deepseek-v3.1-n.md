# Are Genes Patentable Or Not? (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article from November 2010 discusses conflicting positions within the U.S. government regarding the patentability of human genes. The Department of Justice filed an amicus brief in the Myriad Genetics case concerning BRCA gene patents, arguing that genes are products of nature and therefore unpatentable. This position directly contradicted the long-standing practice of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which had been granting gene patents for years. The author notes the absence of USPTO lawyers on the DOJ brief as potentially significant and observes that the issue would ultimately be resolved through court proceedings rather than administrative statements, with the Myriad case serving as the key litigation vehicle.

## 2. HISTORY
The legal and scientific landscape following this 2010 article was decisively shaped by the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.* In a unanimous decision, the Court held that isolated human DNA segments are products of nature and therefore not patent-eligible, while cDNA (complementary DNA) remained patentable because it is synthetically created. This ruling invalidated Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which had given the company a monopoly on genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk. The immediate practical impact was significant: the price of BRCA testing dropped from approximately \$3,000-4,000 to under \$1,000, and multiple laboratories began offering testing, giving patients broader access and second-opinion options.

The decision catalyzed broader changes in the biotechnology industry's approach to intellectual property, shifting focus from gene patents toward methods, diagnostic applications, and therapeutic innovations. The USPTO revised its patent examination guidelines accordingly, and patent portfolios across the industry were reassessed. Myriad Genetics itself adapted by expanding its offerings beyond BRCA testing and developing new technologies while facing increased competition in its core market. The ruling did not eliminate all forms of biotechnology patent protection but established clearer boundaries between natural discoveries and patentable inventions, influencing subsequent cases involving diagnostic methods and personalized medicine.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future outcomes, instead focusing on describing the ongoing legal conflict and its procedural context. The author's observation that the issue would be "worked out in the courts, rather than by any sort of statement from any particular agency" proved accurate, as the Supreme Court ultimately resolved the matter through judicial decision rather than administrative action.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8**

This article addresses a pivotal moment in biotechnology law and policy that had substantial real-world consequences for patient access, industry competition, and scientific research practices. The gene patentability question directly affected healthcare costs, diagnostic availability, and innovation incentives across the entire biotechnology sector.
