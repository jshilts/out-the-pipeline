# Book Recommendations 2015: Medicinal Chemistry Books (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article is a curated book recommendation list focused on medicinal chemistry and drug discovery literature, compiled as a year-end roundup for 2015. The author organizes the recommendations into several categories: general histories of drug discovery; foundational medicinal chemistry textbooks; process chemistry and manufacturing; case histories of successful drug development; specialized topics like enzyme inhibitors, bioisosteres, scaffold hopping, prodrugs, and protein-protein interactions; pharmacology resources for chemists; ADME/PK (pharmacokinetics) and drug-like properties; toxicology and safety; biostatistics; and career guidance for transitioning from academia to industry. The list builds on previous years' recommendations and incorporates reader suggestions, covering works from introductory texts to specialized monographs, with most titles published between 1998 and 2015.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2015 recommendation list, the medicinal chemistry and drug discovery field saw several notable shifts in emphasis and practice. By 2016, Kerns and Di's *Drug-Like Properties* (mentioned as forthcoming) became available and was widely adopted as a standard reference for optimizing ADME/TOX in drug design. During this period, drug discovery began to integrate computational methods more deeply (AI/ML, structure-based design, and predictive ADME), with titles like *Deep Learning for the Life Sciences* (O'Reilly 2019) entering reading lists, though the core medicinal chemistry texts retained their foundational role.

Many of the recommended books have since published newer editions (e.g., Kenakin's pharmacology primers, Silverman's organic chemistry of drug design, and related ADME/PK titles). The themes of *Protein-Protein Interactions* and targeted delivery (prodrugs) became more prominent with the rise of biologics and ADC (antibody-drug conjugate) platforms and modalities like PROTACs and molecular glues, which extended beyond small-molecule focus. Process chemistry titles continued to be relevant as continuous manufacturing and green chemistry gained adoption, and titles such as Anderson's *Practical Process Research and Development* remained staples.

Careers guidance books were increasingly supplemented by online resources (e.g., Cheminformatics, bioinformatics MOOCs, and industry-focused forums), while many academic programs incorporated industry-relevant training. Public policy changes (e.g., 21st Century Cures Act in the U.S., expanded use of real-world evidence, and regulatory reliance on modeling for COVID-19 therapeutics) raised the profile of PK/PD modeling and safety assessment covered by several recommended toxicology and biostatistics books.

The recommended books themselves did not produce drugs directly, but knowledge areas they covered underpinned subsequent therapeutic developments. For example, protease inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, immunomodulators, and ADCs benefited from advances in enzyme inhibitor design, targeted delivery, and protein interaction modulation that these texts discussed. Overall, the core concepts remained valid, though reading lists began to include new additions focusing on gene therapy, CRISPR-based therapeutics, and computational approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The 2015 article is a descriptive recommendation list and does not put forward explicit predictions. Therefore, there are no predictions to evaluate against subsequent developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

This is a curated list of textbooks and monographs that serves a practical purpose for students and practitioners but does not assert novel claims or predictions. Its long-term importance is moderate and primarily as a snapshot of educational resources at that time; by its nature, it does not offer controversial or forward-looking analysis that would warrant higher interest.
