# What to Do About Turing (And the Others) (September 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary addresses Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals and other companies that acquired older drugs with small patient populations and immediately imposed massive price increases. The author argues this business model is damaging not just ethically, but strategically for the entire pharmaceutical industry. The core concern is that these pricing strategies—exemplified by Turing's 5,000% price hike on Daraprim—threaten the industry's reputation and could trigger heavy-handed government regulation of drug pricing across the board. The article calls for industry self-policing through public condemnation of such practices and regulatory reform to close loopholes allowing such price increases on drugs that required no new R&D investment. Companies mentioned include Turing, Retrophin, Catalyst, Valeant, and the Makena drug.

## 2. HISTORY

**Shkreli's Downfall and Conviction**: Martin Shkreli was convicted in 2017 on securities fraud charges unrelated to drug pricing (schemes at Retrophin and MSMB Capital Management). He was sentenced to 7 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $7.4 million. In 2022, he was banned from the pharmaceutical industry for life by a federal court and ordered to return $64.6 million in profits from the Daraprim price hike.

**Daraprim's Evolution**: Turing Pharmaceuticals became Vyera Pharmaceuticals, which later became Phoenixus AG. In 2020, the company reached a $40 million settlement over Daraprim pricing allegations. Competition finally emerged: in 2020, the FDA approved a generic version from Cerovene, and in 2022, a second generic from Rising Pharmaceuticals entered the market. Daraprim's price dropped dramatically from over $750 per pill to more accessible generic pricing.

**Valeant's Collapse and Transformation**: Valeant Pharmaceuticals (now Bausch Health) faced enormous scrutiny after this period. The company's stock dropped over 90% from its 2015 peak due to pricing controversies, accounting scandals, and scrutiny over its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor. Valeant lost approximately $80 billion in market value, underwent massive debt restructuring, and eventually rebranded to Bausch Health in 2018 while divesting numerous assets.

**Industry and Regulatory Response**: The controversy catalyzed significant policy changes. The FDA created new pathways to expedite generic competition for drugs with limited competition. Congress held extensive hearings on drug pricing. The CREATES Act (2019) made it harder for brand-name companies to block generic competition by restricting access to drug samples needed for bioequivalence testing.

**Market Impact**: Specialty pharmaceutical companies using similar acquisition-and-spike strategies faced investor backlash and declined. The broader industry intensified public relations efforts around value-based pricing and R&D investment justification.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author warned that companies like Turing could trigger heavy government scrutiny and regulation of drug pricing across the entire industry
  - **Outcome**: ACCURATE. This controversy was indeed catalytic. It preceded major policy debates around drug pricing that continued through multiple administrations, contributed to Medicare drug price negotiation provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), and influenced state-level transparency laws and federal regulatory changes to speed generic competition.

• **Prediction**: The author predicted that silence from industry associations like PhRMA would be interpreted as consent, damaging industry reputation
  - **Outcome**: ACCURATE. PhRMA and individual companies did ultimately respond with extensive PR campaigns emphasizing their differences from "bad actors" and highlighting R&D investment. However, the reputational damage persisted, contributing to sustained public distrust and political momentum for price controls.

• **Prediction**: The author suggested that without industry self-policing, companies using legitimate R&D-based business models would be tarred with the same brush as those using rent-seeking strategies
  - **Outcome**: ACCURATE. In subsequent years, drug pricing debates often failed to distinguish between innovative new drugs and acquired older drugs, leading to broad political pressure affecting the entire industry's pricing flexibility.

• **Prediction**: Implicit in the article was the concern that these business models might become more widespread without intervention
  - **Outcome**: INACCURATE. While some companies attempted similar strategies, the intense scrutiny, investor backlash, and eventual regulatory/legal consequences made the pure acquisition-and-spike model less viable. Most companies that attempted it suffered severe consequences.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article was remarkably prescient about the cascading consequences of extreme drug price hikes. The author correctly anticipated that such moves would become emblematic of industry problems, drive political action, and force regulatory responses that affected the entire sector. The specific companies mentioned either collapsed or transformed dramatically, validating the analysis about the unsustainability and broader risks of these strategies.
