# Mistreating Enzymes For a Good Cause (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the unpredictable effects of organic solvents on enzyme activity, focusing on empirical observations rather than theoretical predictions. The author highlights a research paper examining HMG CoA reductase (the statin drug target) under various solvent conditions. The findings reveal contradictory behaviors: while alcohols uniformly decreased enzyme activity, DMSO initially increased activity before suppressing it at higher concentrations, DMF consistently harmed activity, dioxane was highly destructive, and THF and acetonitrile actually enhanced activity at certain concentrations. The paper used multiple biophysical techniques (small-angle X-ray, calorimetry, melting point analysis) to investigate mechanisms, finding that alcohols acted as active-site inhibitors, acetonitrile increased protein flexibility (potentially beneficial), and DMSO caused structural changes by stripping water molecules. The study concluded that no holistic theoretical framework exists to predict these solvent effects, emphasizing the complexity of protein folding and the need for empirical investigation.

## 2. HISTORY
The research direction highlighted in this 2018 article reflects broader developments in enzymology and biopharmaceuticals over the subsequent years. The empirical approach to studying solvent effects on enzymes has remained important, particularly as interest grew in using enzymes under non-physiological conditions for industrial biocatalysis. However, the specific question of solvent-induced protein denaturation has not fundamentally changed—biochemical assays still rely heavily on empirical optimization of buffer conditions, with DMSO tolerance remaining a practical consideration in drug screening assays. While computational methods for predicting protein stability have improved, the complexity described in 2018 persists. HMG CoA reductase has continued to be a critical drug target, with statins remaining first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease, though new approaches like PCSK9 inhibitors have emerged. The biophysical techniques mentioned (calorimetry, X-ray scattering) remain standard tools in protein characterization.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article included implicit predictions about the field's trajectory:

• **"It's going to be a while before we really have a grip on [the protein folding problem]"**: This cautious prediction has held true. While AlphaFold2 (2020) revolutionized structure prediction from sequence, predicting detailed solvent effects and dynamic behavior under non-physiological conditions remains challenging. The fundamental complexity described in 2018 persists.

• **The expectation that solvent effects research would remain empirical**: This has largely been accurate. While computational tools have advanced, practical biochemistry still relies heavily on empirical screening for optimal buffer conditions, DMSO tolerance in assays, and stabilization strategies.

• **The implication that this work has relevance for industrial applications**: This has been validated. Biocatalysis in non-aqueous media has grown in importance for pharmaceutical synthesis, though the field still faces the empirical optimization challenges highlighted in the article.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses a real and persistent challenge in biochemistry with practical implications for drug discovery and industrial enzymology, but the specific research represents incremental progress rather than transformative breakthrough.
