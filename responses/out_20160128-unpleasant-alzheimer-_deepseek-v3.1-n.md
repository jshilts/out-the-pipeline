# Unpleasant Alzheimer's News (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses two concerning developments in Alzheimer's research from early 2016. First, a JAMA Internal Medicine study found a dose-response relationship between long-term use of strong anticholinergic drugs (including tricyclic antidepressants, first-generation antihistamines, and bladder control medications) and increased risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in older patients.

Second, the article covers emerging evidence for potentially "transmissible" aspects of Alzheimer's pathology. Swiss pathologists examined brain tissue from patients who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease contracted from surgical dura mater grafts, finding that these patients - unusually young for such findings - showed amyloid plaques similar to those seen in Alzheimer's. This followed earlier reports of similar findings in patients who received human-derived growth hormone treatment. The article notes this suggests surgical procedures might transfer "seeds" of pathological amyloid protein, though emphasizes this doesn't mean Alzheimer's is transmissible under ordinary circumstances.

## 2. HISTORY

**Anticholinergic Drugs and Dementia Risk:**
Subsequent research largely confirmed and expanded upon the 2016 findings. Multiple large-scale studies published between 2016-2020 reinforced the association between anticholinergic burden and dementia risk, with some studies showing up to a 50% increased risk with long-term use. In 2019, a major UK study of over 280,000 patients provided robust confirmation of the dose-response relationship.

Clinical guidelines began incorporating these findings. The American Geriatrics Society updated its Beers Criteria to flag certain anticholinergic medications as potentially inappropriate for older adults. However, widespread clinical practice changes were gradual - many older adults continued receiving these medications, particularly for depression, allergies, and overactive bladder, though some healthcare systems implemented anticholinergic burden screening tools.

No FDA regulatory actions specifically targeting anticholinergic drugs for dementia risk emerged, but prescribing patterns began shifting toward alternatives where available. The clinical impact remains ongoing, with millions of elderly patients still on these medications.

**Transmissible Alzheimer's Theory:**
The transmissible amyloid hypothesis gained additional support but remained highly controversial. In 2018, UK researchers published follow-up studies on the original growth hormone cohort, finding nearly all recipients showed amyloid pathology at autopsy. Subsequent research identified amyloid deposits in other iatrogenic prion disease cases.

However, several important caveats emerged. No evidence suggested routine contact transmission of Alzheimer's. The phenomenon appeared limited to direct central nervous system exposure through medical procedures using contaminated materials. The amyloid-only pathology (without tau tangles) suggested this might represent accelerated amyloidosis rather than full Alzheimer's disease.

Clinical implications were limited but real: some neurological societies issued guidance on instrument decontamination, and blood transfusion safety protocols received scrutiny, though no documented cases of Alzheimer's transmission through blood products emerged.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions, instead focusing on interpreting existing evidence and speculating about mechanistic implications. However, it contained several implicit expectations:

- **That anticholinergic risk evidence would accumulate**: ✓ **Correct**. Multiple large studies published through 2020 consistently supported the association.
  
- **That surgical procedures and instruments would receive close scrutiny**: ✓ **Partially correct**. Research attention increased significantly, with multiple studies examining decontamination protocols, but no major public health guidelines changes occurred beyond enhanced instrument cleaning protocols.

- **That the environmental insult evidence base would grow**: ✓ **Correct**. Numerous subsequent studies examined various environmental and lifestyle factors in Alzheimer's development.

- **That the transmissible mechanism would remain limited to extraordinary circumstances** (not ordinary transmission): ✓ **Correct**. No evidence emerged suggesting routine transmission, with cases remaining limited to iatrogenic exposures.

The article's measured tone about "transmissible Alzheimer's" being limited to surgical procedures proved prescient - no evidence of casual transmission emerged, maintaining the consensus that Alzheimer's is not contagious.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article highlighted two significant and lasting contributions to Alzheimer's research that influenced both clinical practice and scientific understanding of disease mechanisms. The anticholinergic findings had immediate practical implications affecting millions of patients, while the transmissible hypothesis opened important new research directions in protein misfolding diseases, representing genuine paradigm-shifting insights in neurodegenerative disease research.
