# Back From DC (February 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief personal blog post describing the author's attendance at a CMPI (Center for Medicine in the Public Interest) conference in Washington DC. The author found the conference engaging, noting that political discussions about FDA funding and operations were more accessible and lively than typical scientific conference topics. The post also mentions a personal meeting with blogger Megan McArdle ("Jane Galt") and references plans to potentially meet economist Tyler Cowen on a future visit. The author notes the challenges of live-blogging multiple posts per day during conferences due to limited laptop battery life and hotel internet costs.

## 2. HISTORY

This article is a personal blog post rather than a substantive commentary about biotechnology industry developments. It contains no claims, predictions, or analyses about biotech science, drug development, or FDA policy that could be evaluated against subsequent events. The post is purely anecdotal, describing conference attendance and personal meetings without substantive content about biotechnology outcomes, drug approvals, clinical trials, or policy changes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about biotechnology, drug development, FDA policy, or industry trends. It is entirely retrospective, describing events that have already occurred (the conference experience and personal meetings). There are no forward-looking statements to evaluate against later developments.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article is completely off-topic for the requested analysis framework, which expects commentary about the biotechnology industry with predictions that can be evaluated against subsequent developments. It is a personal blog post about conference attendance and social meetings with no substantive biotech content.
