# The Top 200 Drugs (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights the "Top 200 Drugs" posters produced by the University of Arizona group, which display the chemical structures of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals in graphical form. The author notes that browsing these compounds provides a valuable dose of humility for chemists, as many useful drugs have surprisingly simple structures (like valproic acid) or contain functional groups that initially seem unlikely to succeed as drugs. The piece specifically mentions fingolimod (Gilenya) as an upcoming addition to the poster, noting that its fungal-derived structure "baffles and offends almost every chemist at first glance" but represents the kind of unexpected compound that becomes a successful therapeutic.

## 2. HISTORY

The Top 200 Drugs posters created by Jon Njardarson's group at the University of Arizona have become an enduring educational resource in medicinal chemistry. These posters, which have been updated multiple times since 2011, are widely used in pharmaceutical training programs, academic courses, and industry settings to teach structure-activity relationships and drug design principles.

**Fingolimod (Gilenya)** did indeed become featured on subsequent versions of the poster. The drug received FDA approval in September 2010 for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and became the first oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for MS treatment. Gilenya achieved significant commercial success, with annual sales peaking at over $3 billion, though it has faced increasing competition from newer MS therapies and generic versions entered the market after patent expiration.

The poster series expanded beyond just the Top 200 format, with the Arizona group creating additional educational materials including "Top 100 Prescription Drugs" and specialized posters focusing on specific therapeutic areas. These resources remain freely available and continue to be downloaded by thousands of students and professionals annually.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

* **That Gilenya (fingolimod) would be featured on the "next edition of the poster"**: This prediction was accurate. Fingolimod appeared on subsequent versions of the Top 200 Drugs posters and became a frequently cited example of an unconventional drug structure.

* **Implied prediction that Gilenya's unusual structure would gain acceptance despite initial chemist skepticism**: This proved correct. Gilenya not only gained regulatory approval but became a blockbuster drug, demonstrating that "baffling" structures can indeed become successful therapeutics. The drug's mechanism (S1P receptor modulation) became validated as an important therapeutic approach.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **4/10**

While the article provides an interesting snapshot of medicinal chemistry education in 2011 and offers some entertaining commentary about chemist prejudices, it doesn't address major biotechnology trends or have lasting scientific importance beyond documenting a useful educational resource.
