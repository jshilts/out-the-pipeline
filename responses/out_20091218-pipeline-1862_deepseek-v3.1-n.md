# Day Off! (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a brief personal blog post from December 18, 2009, where the author announces they will be taking the day off from work to engage in non-scientific activities. The author shares a link to a website called "There, I Fixed It" (http://www.thereifixedit.com), describing it as something that will make one's "sense of order shudder." The author mentions this site is popular in their household and expresses a parenting goal of teaching their children to avoid the makeshift repair approaches featured on the site. The post concludes with the author noting they will return on Monday.

## 2. HISTORY
This appears to be a personal blog entry rather than biotechnology industry commentary. The content is focused on the author's personal day off and a humorous website about DIY repairs, with no scientific or biotech content present. The "article" contains no substantive discussion of biotechnology industry developments, scientific research, drug development, or related topics that would warrant analysis of subsequent historical developments in the biotech field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The post contains no predictions about biotechnology or scientific developments. It is purely a personal announcement about taking time off from work.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **0/10**

This content appears to be completely off-topic from biotechnology industry commentary and therefore receives a score of 0.
