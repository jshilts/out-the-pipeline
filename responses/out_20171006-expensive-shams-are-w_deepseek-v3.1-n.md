# Expensive Shams Are the Way to Go, Apparently (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the nocebo effect—the phenomenon where inert treatments cause adverse effects when people believe they are harmful. The piece highlights research using fMRI to study pain perception, where researchers packaged the same inactive skin cream in either plain "cheap" packaging or attractive "expensive" packaging. When subjects believed they were testing an expensive cream, they reported significantly more pain sensitivity to heat stimuli than those who thought they received the cheaper version. The fMRI data revealed differential activation in brain regions like the periaqueductal gray (PAG), rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala, suggesting these areas process both placebo (positive expectation) and nocebo (negative expectation) effects. The article relates this to marketing psychology, noting how consumer preferences can be manipulated by product presentation.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this 2017 article, placebo and nocebo research has expanded significantly, particularly in the context of clinical trials and real-world treatment effects. Meta-analyses published in subsequent years continued to demonstrate substantial nocebo effects across conditions, with headache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms remaining the most common nocebo symptoms reported in clinical trials. Open-label placebo studies gained traction as a legitimate research approach, with researchers finding that placebos can still show benefits even when patients know they're inert. The World Health Organization and regulatory bodies increasingly recognized the importance of managing nocebo effects in clinical trials to avoid unnecessary drug discontinuations. Digital health tools began incorporating expectation management strategies to minimize nocebo effects in telehealth and remote monitoring settings. Price manipulation studies continued to find effects on treatment perception, extending to generic drugs versus branded versions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author made the following predictions/observations:

• **Prediction**: Neuroscience tools would increasingly reveal uncomfortable truths about consciousness and decision-making
  - *Outcome*: **Accurate**. Improved imaging techniques and machine learning analysis of neural patterns have provided deeper insights into unconscious decision-making processes, with implications for understanding free will debates.

• **Observation/Suggestion**: Easier brain monitoring techniques might enable strange applications like shampoo neuro-studies
  - *Outcome*: **Partially realized**. Researchers developed less invasive imaging methods (fNIRS, portable EEG) and neuromarketing became a recognized field, although direct shampoo consumption neuroscience studies remain exaggerated.

• **Implication**: Marketing strategies leverage placebo/nocebo effects through product presentation
  - *Outcome*: **Well-established**. The entire field of neuromarketing and sensory marketing grew substantially, with companies increasingly designing product packaging, pricing strategies, and experiences to shape consumer expectations and experiences.

• **Underlying Mechanism**: Brain regions involved in placebo effects would show similar activation patterns during nocebo effects
  - *Outcome*: **Strongly supported**. Subsequent research confirmed that overlapping neural circuits (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula) mediate both placebo and nocebo effects, with expectation as a key mechanism that can be modulated by contextual factors like price.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article warrants high interest because it addresses fundamental questions about how psychological factors affect physiological responses, which has broad implications for clinical trial design, patient care, regulatory policy, and marketing practices. The intersection of neuroscience and real-world decision-making continues growing in importance.
