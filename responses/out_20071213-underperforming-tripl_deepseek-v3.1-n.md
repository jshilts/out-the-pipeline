# Underperforming Triple Bonds (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2007 article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" commentary reflects on the medicinal chemistry challenges posed by carbon-nitrogen (nitrile, CN) and carbon-carbon (alkyne, C≡C) triple bonds in drug discovery. The author praises these groups for their linear geometry and unique polarity, but laments their metabolic lability: nitriles are susceptible to liver metabolism and can release toxic cyanide, while terminal alkynes are rapidly oxidized to carboxylic acids and excreted, undermining their utility as drug scaffolds. He notes that more exotic triple bonds (e.g., C≡O, C≡S) are generally too reactive to be used as drugs. The piece calls for "rock-solid, nonreactive" triple-bond mimics to open new molecular design space and better drug candidates.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent developments largely mirrored the author's concerns, but also produced notable advances and successful drugs incorporating triple bonds.

**Nitrile-containing drugs and metabolism**: The metabolic liability of nitriles has persisted as a practical hurdle, yet several drugs with nitrile groups have reached the market. For example, the anticancer agent **crizotinib** (FDA approved in 2011) and related kinase inhibitors feature nitriles that generally retain metabolic stability in vivo and are used clinically. The immediate concerns about widespread metabolic lability leading to toxic cyanide release proved more nuanced; most drugs with nitriles bound within complex ring systems do not undergo significant cyanide loss, whereas small alkyl nitriles remain problematic.

**Alkyne stability and applications**: Alkyne metabolism remains a common issue, but the functional group has found continued use in pharmaceutical, materials, and chemical biology contexts. The antiviral drug **rilpivirine** (approved in 2011) includes a terminal alkyne, demonstrating that with careful design and prodrug strategies, alkyne-containing candidates can achieve acceptable metabolic stability and clinical efficacy. In addition, alkynes became central to **click chemistry** (e.g., the CuAAC and SPAAC reactions) after the early 2000s, enabling broad adoption in bioconjugation, chemical probes, and materials science.

**Beyond C≡C and C≡N**: The author's wish for stable, uncharged alternatives to CN and C≡C has not been fulfilled in the sense of entirely new stable triple-bond functional groups (due to the underlying physics of bond energies and electronic structure). Instead, medicinal chemists turned to **bioisosteric replacements** (e.g., tetrazoles for carboxylic acids, oxadiazoles, and heterocyclic rings) that mimic the shape and polarity of triple-bond motifs while improving metabolic and chemical stability. This "functional-group substitution" approach entered routine practice, and database analyses (e.g., in the ChEMBL and DrugBank databases) still show nitriles and alkynes represented—but typically in constrained contexts that limit their metabolism. Stable triple bonds beyond C≡C and C≡N remain confined to niche research contexts and reactive intermediates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several informal predictions and observations that can be compared to actual outcomes:

- **"A rock-solid, nonreactive nitrile group would be a big hit"**: The field did not invent a truly nonreactive nitrile mimic, but instead developed design rules, prodrug strategies, and ring-constrained nitriles that proved clinically viable. Successes like crizotinib (and later axitinib, another approved nitrile-containing drug) showed that *selectively* stable nitriles can succeed when steric and electronic factors disfavor metabolic attack and cyanide release.
- **Alkyne oxidation leading to rapid clearance**: This prediction was validated. Terminal alkynes remained metabolically vulnerable, seen both in drug candidates failing due to rapid clearance and in intentional prodrug strategies (e.g., **apalutamide**, approved in 2018 for prostate cancer, whose terminal alkyne is masked as a prodrug to improve stability). The broader industry practice moved toward internal alkynes or alkyne bioisosteres when possible.
- **New stable triple bonds beyond C≡C and C≡N**: This did not materialize in drug-usable form. Stable, uncharged triple bonds (e.g., with O, S, or heavier atoms) remained laboratory curiosities or reactive species, not practical drug substituents. The prediction about "laws of physics" blocking progress proved accurate; no general class of stable, drug-like triple bonds was introduced.
- **"A whole new world of new molecules would open up to us"**: While no new triple-bond classes emerged, the general goal was partially met by the rise of advanced heterocyclic chemistry and bioisosteric design that replicates the steric, electronic, and topological features of nitriles and alkynes with improved stability. High-throughput screening and structure-based design also enabled chemists to navigate metabolic liabilities without fundamentally new triple-bond chemistry.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article remains a clear and candid snapshot of medicinal chemistry's practical frustrations with functional-group stability. Though it did not forecast revolutionary therapeutics based on triple bonds, it accurately anticipated persistent metabolic liabilities and indirectly foreshadowed the field's reliance on bioisosteric replacements. It is noteworthy for its honest assessment of real-world bottlenecks in drug design. The interest score reflects its enduring relevance to medicinal chemistry and preclinical drug discovery decision-making.
