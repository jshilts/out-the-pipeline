# Crowdfunding Independent Research (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Ethan Perlstein, a Harvard-trained molecular biologist who, after being rejected by 27 universities for tenure-track positions, turned to crowdfunding to establish his independent research laboratory. Perlstein had followed a traditional academic path with a Ph.D. from Harvard and postdoctoral work at Princeton, but cuts in federal research funding created intense competition for limited academic positions.

Rather than raising money for a specific product or discrete project like most crowdfunding campaigns, Perlstein was seeking funding for basic research through his "Perlstein Lab." The lab's focus was on discovering drugs to treat lysosomal storage diseases—rare genetic disorders where cellular waste accumulates due to defective recycling mechanisms. The article mentions that Perlstein planned to launch his fundraising campaign on AngelList, targeting high net-worth "qualified investors" as defined by SEC regulations. The piece notes that crowdfunding research was gaining attention, with examples like uBiome (a health startup) raising over $350,000 on Indiegogo, but acknowledges potential problems with this funding model.

## 2. HISTORY

**Perlstein Lab's Trajectory (2014-2017):** Perlstein successfully raised approximately $1.5 million through AngelList and other sources to launch his independent research venture. His lab pursued drug discovery for rare lysosomal storage diseases, specifically focusing on repurposing existing drugs. While the initial funding allowed Perlstein to establish his laboratory and pursue his research agenda without academic affiliation, the venture faced significant challenges in translating basic research into therapeutic outcomes.

**Shift to Consulting (2017-2020):** By 2017-2018, Perlstein transitioned from running an independent research lab to serving as a consultant and advisor for biotechnology companies and investment firms. His expertise in rare disease drug discovery and alternative funding models made him a valuable advisor, but the standalone independent research model proved challenging to sustain long-term.

**Industry Context and Crowdfunding Evolution (2014-2024):** The broader crowdfunding landscape for scientific research evolved significantly. Platforms like Experiment.com and Consano emerged specifically for research funding, but overall adoption remained limited compared to initial enthusiasm. The biotech industry largely continued to rely on traditional funding mechanisms—venture capital, pharmaceutical partnerships, and federal grants (NIH funding). While crowdfunding found success in consumer health products (like uBiome, which expanded before collapsing due to regulatory issues in 2019), basic research proved difficult to fund through crowdsourced models due to long timelines, high costs, and uncertain outcomes.

**Regulatory Developments:** The JOBS Act provisions that might have enabled broader crowdfunding for equity were implemented with significant restrictions, limiting the AngelList model's scalability. Most successful biotech companies seeking substantial funding still turned to institutional investors rather than crowdfunding.

**Specific Outcomes:** No approved drugs emerged from Perlstein's crowdfunding-funded research. The lysosomal storage disease drug discovery efforts that gained FDA approval between 2014-2024 came from established pharmaceutical companies (such as Sanofi's continued development of enzyme replacement therapies) rather than independent researchers or crowdfunding models. This highlights the structural challenges of drug development outside traditional institutional frameworks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction (Implicit):** That crowdfunding could become a viable alternative pathway for independent scientists to pursue basic research outside traditional academic institutions.

**Actual Outcome:** While a handful of researchers successfully raised funds through crowdfunding, the model did not achieve widespread adoption. Most scientists continued to rely on university positions and federal grants. Perlstein himself eventually shifted to consulting, suggesting the independent research model was not sustainable long-term.

• **Prediction (Implicit):** That AngelList-style equity crowdfunding could support basic research infrastructure and drug discovery efforts.

**Actual Outcome:** AngelList and similar platforms remained more successful for startup companies with clear commercial products rather than basic research laboratories. The model focused on "qualified investors" didn't scale sufficiently to support the capital-intensive needs of drug discovery research.

• **Prediction (Implicit):** That crowdfunding research would grow as traditional funding became scarcer.

**Actual Outcome:** While traditional academic funding remained highly competitive, crowdfunding research did not meaningfully displace conventional mechanisms (NIH grants, venture capital, pharmaceutical partnerships). The total amount of research funding through crowdfunding platforms remained negligible compared to established funding sources.

• **Prediction (Implicit):** That rare disease research might be particularly suitable for crowdfunding models.

**Actual Outcome:** Rare disease research did attract attention and funding, but primarily through patient advocacy organizations and specialized venture funds rather than general crowdfunding. Established pharmaceutical companies continued to dominate successful rare disease drug development, with over 40 new orphan drugs approved annually in recent years—none originating from crowdfunding models.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article captured a genuine moment of innovation in research funding models and highlighted real structural problems in academic employment. However, the crowdfunding research movement it described did not substantially materialize, and the specific case study (Perlstein Lab) demonstrated the challenges rather than the successes of this approach. The piece is moderately interesting as a historical snapshot of alternative funding enthusiasm during that period, but the long-term impact has been minimal.
