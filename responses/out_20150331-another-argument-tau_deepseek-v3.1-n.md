# Another Argument For Tau (31 Mar 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2015 article describes a Mayo Clinic study published in *Brain* that challenged the prevailing Alzheimer's disease hypothesis by suggesting tau pathology (neurofibrillary tangles) may be more clinically important than beta-amyloid pathology. The study, based on examination of thousands of brains, found that while amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation occurs, it is the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation that directly mediates the relationship between amyloid pathology and cognitive decline. The researchers concluded that amyloid burden itself is not the proximate causal pathology for cognitive impairment, though they acknowledged potential crosstalk between the two pathologies. The article notes this adds to ongoing debate in the Alzheimer's field and raises questions about therapeutic strategies primarily targeting amyloid.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent years after this 2015 article have been marked by continued controversy and significant challenges in Alzheimer's drug development. The amyloid hypothesis dominated therapeutic development for decades, leading to numerous clinical trials of anti-amyloid antibodies and other amyloid-targeting approaches. However, most of these trials failed to show clinical benefit, including major studies of drugs like solanezumab, gantenerumab, and bapineuzumab.

By 2021-2023, three anti-amyloid antibodies received FDA approval: aducanumab (Aduhelm, 2021), lecanemab (Leqembi, 2023), and donanemab. These approvals were controversial and based primarily on biomarker data (reduction of amyloid plaques) rather than clear clinical benefit. The drugs showed modest slowing of cognitive decline (e.g., ~27-35% slowing over 18 months in specific measures) but with significant safety concerns including brain swelling and microhemorrhages. Real-world uptake has been limited due to high costs, infrastructure requirements, and questions about clinical meaningfulness of the observed effects.

During this period, tau-focused research continued, with several tau-targeting therapies entering clinical trials, though none have reached approval as of 2024. Biomarker research solidified that tau pathology (measured via PET imaging or CSF p-tau181, p-tau217) correlates more strongly with cognitive decline than amyloid biomarkers alone. Blood-based biomarkers for both amyloid and tau have emerged as practical diagnostic tools.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Predictions in the article:**
• The Mayo study wouldn't settle the amyloid vs. tau argument
• Amyloid-centric approaches might still be beneficial due to crosstalk between pathologies
• Amyloid might still be the real driver of the disease state
• None of these possibilities were sure things

**What actually happened:**
• The article was prescient - the argument remains unsettled through 2024
• Amyloid-targeting drugs did eventually achieve FDA approval, validating that they have some biological effect
• However, clinical benefits have been modest and don't clearly demonstrate amyloid is the primary driver
• The "crosstalk" concept gained support, with evidence that amyloid and tau pathologies interact
• Drug development has increasingly shifted toward combination approaches and tau-targeting strategies
• No therapeutic approach has yet delivered transformative treatment, confirming the article's caution that Alzheimer's has "no sure things"

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**
This article demonstrates strong scientific foresight by highlighting key uncertainties that proved central to Alzheimer's research and drug development over the subsequent decade. It correctly anticipated that the amyloid hypothesis alone was insufficient and that tau pathology would remain critically important to understanding disease mechanisms.
