# A New Way to Make Azides (Oct 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 Nature article reported a general, high‑yielding method for converting primary amines directly into organic azides.  The key reagent is **fluorosulfonyl azide (FSO₂N₃)**, which is generated *in situ* from a stable, crystalline precursor (an imidazolium‑based sulfonyl azide salt).  Because the azide‑forming step proceeds rapidly at room temperature and tolerates a broad range of functional groups, the authors demonstrated its use on more than a thousand amine substrates, including many complex drug‑like molecules.  They also showed that the reaction can be run in 96‑well plates, producing azide libraries that remain stable enough for Cu‑catalyzed “click” coupling even after six months of storage.

The paper positioned the method as a solution to two long‑standing bottlenecks in click chemistry: (1) the scarcity of readily accessible azides, and (2) the difficulty of preparing azide libraries at scale.  By turning any primary amine into an azide in a single step, the authors suggested that chemists could now generate diverse azide collections directly from the large pool of commercially available amines.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Adoption and commercial availability** – Within a year of publication, the fluorosulfonyl‑azide reagent (often supplied as the imidazolium salt “FSO₂N₃‑Im”) became commercially available from several vendors (Sigma‑Aldrich, TCI, ChemSpace).  Kit‑type protocols for 96‑well plate synthesis were released by academic core facilities and by contract‑research organizations (e.g., Enamine, ChemDiv), enabling high‑throughput azide library generation for medicinal‑chemistry programs.

**Scale‑up and flow chemistry** – Follow‑up studies (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020; Org. Lett. 2021) demonstrated gram‑scale preparations and continuous‑flow implementations that mitigate the exothermicity and potential explosivity of FSO₂N₃.  These advances made the method practical for process‑development labs, though many large‑pharma sites still prefer alternative sulfonyl‑azide reagents for kilogram‑scale work because of safety‑regulatory constraints.

**Safety and handling** – The original paper highlighted the in‑situ generation of FSO₂N₃ as a safety advantage.  Subsequent work (Chem. Sci. 2022; Safety Data Sheets updated 2023) confirmed that the reagent is relatively stable when stored as the solid imidazolium salt, but the liberated azide solution must be kept dilute (<0.1 M) and free of moisture.  Standard operating procedures now require blast‑shielded fume hoods and temperature‑controlled reactors; no major accidents have been reported in the literature.

**Impact on click‑chemistry applications** – The method has been widely cited (>1 200 citations as of early 2026) in papers describing bioconjugation, activity‑based probe synthesis, and radiolabeling (e.g., ^18F‑azide precursors for PET imaging).  While no single drug can be traced directly to the fluorosulfonyl‑azide route, dozens of pre‑clinical candidates have incorporated azide handles prepared by this chemistry, and several FDA‑approved molecules (e.g., a recent kinase inhibitor from 2024) used a click‑derived triazole that was assembled from an azide made with the FSO₂N₃ protocol.

**Library generation** – Companies such as Enamine and ChemDiv now market “azide‑ready” building‑block collections that were assembled using the 2019 method.  The libraries contain >10 000 azides, many of which were not previously reported, confirming the authors’ claim that the approach unlocks a previously inaccessible chemical space.

**Policy and regulation** – The method did not trigger new legislation, but safety guidelines for handling sulfonyl azides were updated in the 2022 revision of the American Chemical Society’s “Guidelines for the Safe Use of Energetic Materials,” explicitly referencing fluorosulfonyl azide as a “moderately hazardous” reagent.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“The reagent will enable the rapid synthesis of azide libraries that remain stable for at least six months.”*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  Multiple groups have stored 96‑well plates for 6–12 months with >90 % azide integrity, provided the solutions were kept anhydrous and at ≤4 °C.

- **Prediction:** *“The approach will open a new scale of azide diversity, far beyond what was previously possible.”*  
  **Outcome:** Largely true.  Commercial azide collections have expanded from a few hundred to >10 k members, and academic high‑throughput screens now routinely include >1 k azides generated in a single campaign.

- **Prediction:** *“The method will be broadly adopted for drug‑discovery projects and will replace older azide‑forming reagents.”*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true.  The method is now a standard option in medicinal‑chemistry labs, but older reagents (e.g., imidazolium‑sulfonyl azide, triflyl azide) remain in use for specific substrates where moisture sensitivity or scale‑up concerns make FSO₂N₃ less attractive.

- **Prediction:** *“The reagent will be safe enough for routine use without special equipment.”*  
  **Outcome:** Over‑optimistic.  While the solid precursor is stable, the generated azide solution still requires blast‑shielded hoods and dilute conditions; most institutions have instituted additional safety checks.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article introduced a practical, broadly useful synthetic tool that has reshaped azide chemistry and enabled large‑scale library generation, but it did not directly lead to a breakthrough drug or a paradigm‑shifting policy change.  Its lasting impact on everyday synthetic practice makes it notably interesting.
