# Not in My European Back Yard (January 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This editorial critiques Sanofi-Synthélabo's hostile $57 billion bid for Aventis, focusing on the inevitable job cuts that follow pharmaceutical mergers. The author argues that mergers require eliminating redundant positions, particularly in marketing and regulatory affairs, and often extend to R&D staff despite their value. The central question posed is where these job cuts would occur, given political constraints in both France and Germany.

The article notes that France's unions and high unemployment make large-scale domestic layoffs politically unpalatable, while Germany (home to many ex-Hoechst employees within Aventis) already had political leaders like Roland Koch and Wolfgang Clement publicly opposing job losses. The author concludes that the most likely target for cuts would be Aventis's major R&D facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey—the former Hoechst site in the US. This creates a paradox where a European company might need to shrink US operations while competitors expand stateside, purely to avoid political backlash at home.

## 2. HISTORY

The Sanofi-Syntthélabo/Aventis merger did proceed in 2004, creating Sanofi-Aventis (later simplified to Sanofi). The merged company became one of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms, but the consolidation did indeed trigger significant restructuring and job reductions.

Regarding geographic impact, substantial cuts occurred in the United States, including operations in New Jersey where Aventis had major presence. The company pursued a strategy of rationalizing R&D sites globally, with North American facilities often among those consolidated or closed. The Bridgewater, New Jersey site referenced in the article did experience changes, though not complete closure—Sanofi maintained US commercial operations but restructured R&D presence over time.

The broader European pharmaceutical landscape evolved differently than suggested in the article. Many European companies did not dramatically expand US operations as predicted; instead, several underwent their own mergers and restructurings. The trend toward consolidation continued across the industry, with job cuts typically affecting expensive geographic locations regardless of national boundaries, though home-country political considerations remained relevant.

Sanofi-Aventis/Sanofi did not ultimately shrink US operations significantly relative to peers—the company maintained and in some areas expanded US presence, but the merger's efficiency goals did result in substantial global workforce reductions, with the heaviest impact often falling on redundant administrative functions rather than core R&D.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Job cuts**: The article correctly predicted substantial job reductions following the merger, which materialized through global restructuring programs that eliminated thousands of positions.

- **Geographic targeting of cuts**: The prediction that US operations (particularly Bridgewater, NJ) would bear disproportionate cuts was partially accurate—significant reductions did occur at US sites, though not exclusively or particularly at Bridgewater compared to other locations worldwide.

- **European companies expanding in US**: This broader prediction about competitors expanding US operations did not materialize strongly. The 2004-2010 period saw continued consolidation among European pharma rather than aggressive US expansion, with companies like Pfizer-Wyeth and Merck-Schering-Plough showing similar merger patterns.

- **Political pressures dictating outcomes**: The fundamental prediction about European political constraints influencing corporate decisions proved accurate, with geopolitical considerations continuing to affect pharmaceutical industry decisions globally.

- **Sanofi-Aventis shrinking US operations to preserve European jobs**: This specific outcome did not happen. The merged company maintained substantial US commercial and R&D presence, though restructured for efficiency.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

The article correctly identified imminent merger-related job cuts and accurately predicted that U.S. operations might face particular scrutiny, but its broader framing around European industrial policy and competitors' U.S. expansion didn't fully materialize as expected.
