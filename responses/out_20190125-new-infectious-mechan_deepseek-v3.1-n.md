# A New Infectious Mechanism for Alzheimer's? (January 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article examines a compelling hypothesis that *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, the key pathogen in gum disease, may be a causative agent in Alzheimer's disease. The supporting evidence comes from a large multicenter study showing that gingipains (cysteine proteases secreted by the bacteria) are present in Alzheimer's brain tissue at significantly higher levels compared to controls (96% of AD samples vs 39% of controls). The researchers demonstrate correlations between gingipain levels and tau pathology, presence of bacterial DNA in brain tissue and CSF, and show that gingipain inhibition can prevent neuronal damage in cell cultures and mouse models. Small-molecule gingipain inhibitors developed by Cortexyme protected mice from P. gingivalis-induced brain infection and amyloid pathology. Cortexyme had already advanced compound COR388 into human trials, with Phase I completed and Phase II expected to begin in 2019, providing a direct clinical test of the infectious-disease hypothesis for Alzheimer's.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, Cortexyme's COR388 (also called atuzaginstat) progressed into Phase II/III clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. However, in **October 2021**, Cortexyme announced that the **GAIN trial missed its primary endpoints**, failing to show statistically significant cognitive or functional benefits in Alzheimer's patients. The company reported that while the drug was generally well-tolerated, it did not demonstrate clinical efficacy on the ADAS-Cog11 and ADCS-ADL scales.

The trial failure dealt a significant blow to the P. gingivalis hypothesis, though Cortexyme has continued investigating the role of oral pathogens in neurodegeneration. The company shifted focus to alternative indications and formulations, and the broader field has continued to examine connections between oral health and dementia, but without the transformative breakthrough this paper initially suggested was possible.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: COR388 would advance through clinical trials and potentially provide the first successful disease-modifying therapy targeting an infectious mechanism in Alzheimer's.
  - **Reality**: The compound successfully completed Phase I safety trials as mentioned in the article, but the pivotal Phase II/III GAIN trial failed to meet primary endpoints in 2021, showing no clinical benefit for Alzheimer's patients.

- **Prediction**: The gingipain inhibitors would demonstrate efficacy based on strong preclinical data showing protection in mouse models and reduction of pathological markers.
  - **Reality**: While preclinical data was promising, the translation to human patients did not materialize, continuing the long pattern of Alzheimer's drug failures.

- **Prediction**: The infectious-disease hypothesis would gain substantial traction as the "best shot at something new in Alzheimer's in a long time."
  - **Reality**: The hypothesis generated significant interest and research activity, but the clinical trial failure reduced enthusiasm and did not fundamentally shift the Alzheimer's research paradigm toward infectious causation.

- **Bigger picture**: The underlying mechanism of amyloid-as-antibiotic response to P. gingivalis infection, while intellectually appealing and supported by some preclinical data, has not yet translated into clinically effective interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addresses a high-impact hypothesis that generated substantial research interest and advanced to late-stage clinical trials, representing one of the more innovative approaches to Alzheimer's disease in recent years. While ultimately unsuccessful in the clinic, the work highlighted important connections between oral health and neurodegeneration and demonstrated rigorous translational research, making it more significant than typical biomarker or preliminary mechanism studies.
