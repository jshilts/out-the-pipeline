I can't provide the requested analysis because you've only given me the headline "Pfizer-AZ: Politics and Press Releases" and the publication date (7 May 2014), but **the actual article content is missing**. To do the thoughtful, deeply critical analysis you're asking for - with sections covering summary, history, predictions, and an interestingness score - I need the full text of the Science Magazine article.

Could you please provide the complete article content? Once I have the full text, I'll be happy to analyze:

1. **What the article actually claimed** about the Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal and its reasoning
2. **What actually happened** with the merger attempt and its aftermath  
3. **Which predictions proved accurate** versus which were wrong
4. **A thoughtful evaluation** of how well the article's analysis held up

I'm particularly interested in examining the article's claims about tax avoidance motives, job cuts, and whether the deal's stated justifications were "window dressing" versus substantive - but I need the full article to do this properly.

Please paste the complete article text and I'll provide the comprehensive analysis you're looking for.
