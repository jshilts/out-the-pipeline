# Pay-to-Delay: Not Necessarily Illegal, But Not Long For The World (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in *FTC v. Actavis*, which addressed "pay-to-delay" agreements where brand-name pharmaceutical companies pay generic manufacturers to delay market entry of cheaper generic versions. In this specific case, Solvay paid Actavis and Paddock to refrain from bringing generic AndroGel to market, even after Actavis had won its patent challenge and received FDA approval. The FTC sued, alleging antitrust violations under Section 5 of the FTC Act. While lower courts dismissed the complaint, the Supreme Court reversed these decisions, ruling that such agreements should be subject to antitrust scrutiny under the "rule of reason" standard. Although the Court declined to declare pay-to-delay deals presumptively unlawful, it established that large reverse payments could indicate patent weakness and anticompetitive harm. The author predicted these arrangements would become much less common or disappear entirely.

## 2. HISTORY

The Supreme Court's 2013 decision in *FTC v. Actavis* marked a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical antitrust enforcement. In the years following this ruling, the FTC significantly intensified its scrutiny of reverse payment settlements. The agency filed numerous lawsuits challenging similar arrangements, achieving a mixed but generally positive track record in the courts. Several pharmaceutical companies faced FTC investigations and had to defend their settlement agreements under the rule-of-reason analysis established by the Supreme Court. Many drug manufacturers responded by restructuring their patent litigation settlement practices, either by abandoning reverse payments altogether or by including provisions that allowed generic entry well before patent expiration (so-called "early entry" provisions without monetary payments). The legal framework established in *Actavis* has been cited extensively in subsequent pharmaceutical antitrust cases and has become the foundation for ongoing enforcement efforts against what regulators view as anticompetitive conduct in the pharmaceutical industry. This ruling represented one of the FTC's most significant antitrust victories in the healthcare sector. Judicial application of the *Actavis* framework has varied across different federal circuits, leading to somewhat inconsistent outcomes depending on jurisdiction. However, the decision fundamentally altered the calculus for patent settlement negotiations in the pharmaceutical industry and reduced the prevalence of the most brazen forms of reverse payment agreements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction:** The author predicted that pay-to-delay deals would become "fewer of these deals now - perhaps none at all" because "I doubt many of them would hold up."

**Outcome:** This prediction was largely accurate. While pay-to-delay agreements did not disappear entirely, their prevalence significantly declined after the *Actavis* decision. Pharmaceutical companies became much more cautious about entering into reverse payment settlements, and when they did, the terms were often structured differently to avoid the appearance of anticompetitive conduct. The decision created substantial legal uncertainty for these arrangements, making them far less attractive to both brand-name and generic manufacturers.

• **Implicit Prediction:** The decision would allow the FTC to effectively challenge anticompetitive patent settlements.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court's ruling armed the FTC with significant legal authority to pursue pay-to-delay cases. While the "rule of reason" standard required case-by-case analysis rather than automatic condemnation, the agency leveraged this authority to bring numerous enforcement actions. Courts became more receptive to antitrust challenges against reverse payment agreements, and pharmaceutical companies faced heightened legal risks when structuring patent settlements involving monetary payments to generic manufacturers.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article addresses a landmark Supreme Court decision that fundamentally altered pharmaceutical patent litigation and antitrust enforcement in a critical healthcare sector, making it highly significant for both legal precedent and drug pricing policy.
