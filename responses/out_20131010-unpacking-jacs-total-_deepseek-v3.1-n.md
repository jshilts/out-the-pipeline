# Unpacking a JACS Total Synthesis Paper (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article is actually a blog post by Derek Lowe commenting on Mark Peczuh's educational blog series at UConn, where Peczuh was meticulously deconstructing the Winkler group's 2002 JACS paper on the total synthesis of ingenol. The post highlights how Peczuh was walking his students through reading highly compressed synthetic chemistry literature by analyzing transformations step-by-step, explaining the strategic trade-offs (such as choosing intermediate 6 over 5 and the "payment" of seven extra steps to introduce A-ring functionality). The article emphasizes both the intellectual rigor required to understand complex total synthesis papers and Lowe's recognition that while he doesn't practice this type of chemistry (and has questioned its utility), it represents an "extreme intellectual and practical challenge."

## 2. HISTORY

The context for this article involves several converging threads in synthetic chemistry and biotechnology:

**Ingenol Mebutate (Picato)**: The ingenol synthesis being discussed relates to a natural product that became the active ingredient in Picato, a topical treatment for actinic keratosis. Ingenol mebutate was approved by the FDA in 2012—shortly before this blog post—and marketed by LEO Pharma. However, in 2020, LEO Pharma voluntarily withdrew Picato from the market due to concerns about potential skin cancer risk, essentially ending the commercial story of this particular ingenol derivative.

**Total Synthesis in the Pharmaceutical Industry**: The period following 2013 saw continued debate about the role of complex natural product synthesis in drug development. While academic groups continued pursuing syntheses of structurally complex natural products, the pharmaceutical industry increasingly shifted toward more streamlined approaches, fragment-based drug design, and biologics. The practical utility question that Lowe references became more pronounced as companies focused resources on druggability and efficiency over purely synthetic achievement.

**Educational Approaches**: Peczuh's pedagogical approach of deep-reading primary literature became part of a broader movement in chemical education emphasizing critical analysis of research papers over textbook learning. This methodology gained traction in graduate and undergraduate curricula.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article doesn't contain explicit predictions about the future of biotechnology or pharmaceutical development. Rather, it's retrospective educational commentary. However, reading between the lines, several implied positions can be evaluated:

- **Utility of Complex Total Synthesis**: Lowe's questioning of the utility while acknowledging the intellectual challenge reflects an ongoing tension in the field. Subsequent years showed that extremely complex syntheses often don't translate into practical drug production, with fermentation, semi-synthesis, or alternative scaffolds being preferred.
- **Ingenol's Therapeutic Potential**: While not explicitly predicted in this piece, ingenol mebutate's subsequent market withdrawal (2020) illustrates the broader challenge—even when synthesis and approval are achieved, post-market surveillance can reveal unexpected safety issues that undermine commercial viability.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article ranks in the bottom 30-40% of interest for biotechnology industry analysis, as it's primarily educational commentary about chemical pedagogy rather than biotech industry developments, policy, or clinical outcomes. While it touches on an important natural product (ingenol) and its synthesis, the piece is fundamentally about how to read chemistry papers, not about biotechnology industry trends or their real-world impact.
