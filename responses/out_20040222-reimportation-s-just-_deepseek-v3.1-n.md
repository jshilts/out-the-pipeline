# Reimportation's Just the Beginning (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2004 commentary addresses pharmaceutical drug reimportation—the practice of importing prescription drugs from countries with lower prices (particularly Canada) back into the United States. The article presents reader Duane Oyen's analysis arguing that reimportation should be approached through free trade principles to address price discrimination between markets.

The core argument suggests that Canada serves as a useful test case due to NAFTA, where companies face the choice of accepting lower Canadian prices or withdrawing from the market entirely. The author acknowledges the political complexity of achieving equilibrium between profit needs and drug accessibility. The discussion extends beyond reimportation to broader pharmaceutical industry challenges, including R&D sustainability, the role of startups and university spinoffs in feeding corporate pipelines, and potential reforms to patent laws and FDA regulatory processes. The author expresses skepticism about whether enough innovation exists in startups to sustain major pipelines and warns that the industry faces inevitable changes to patent exclusivity and pricing models.

## 2. HISTORY

In the two decades since this article was published, drug pricing and reimportation evolved significantly, though not necessarily in the directions anticipated:

**Drug Reimportation Outcomes:**
Reimportation from Canada never became the widespread solution some politicians advocated. While multiple legislative attempts were made (including provisions in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act and various state initiatives), safety concerns, regulatory barriers, and pharmaceutical industry resistance limited implementation. Canada's market proved too small to significantly impact U.S. drug prices, and Canadian authorities restricted bulk exports to protect their own supply.

**Industry Structure Changes:**
The prediction about increased reliance on startups and university spinoffs proved largely accurate. The pharmaceutical landscape shifted dramatically toward collaboration, in-licensing, and acquisition models. Major companies increasingly depended on biotechnology startups for pipeline innovation, leading to a robust ecosystem where companies like Moderna, BioNTech, and countless others fed larger pharmaceutical pipelines.

**Regulatory Evolution:**
FDA processes did evolve, though not as radically as suggested. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) streamlined some approval pathways, particularly for breakthrough therapies. Orphan drug incentives were indeed strengthened and proved highly successful—orphan drugs now represent a substantial portion of FDA approvals annually.

**Pricing Pressures Intensified:**
Rather than reimportation solving cost concerns, new challenges emerged. The Affordable Care Act (2010) brought pharmaceutical coverage to millions but didn't fundamentally alter pricing structures. High-profile price increases (like Turing's Daraprim and Mylan's EpiPen) created public outcry. Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit (2006) expanded access but also increased government spending.

The article's concern about industry being "dragged" into changes proved prescient—public pressure led to Medicare drug price negotiation provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), representing the most significant government intervention in pharmaceutical pricing in decades.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Reimportation from Canada would serve as a test case for addressing international price discrimination, potentially leading to market equilibrium.
  - **Reality**: Reimportation failed to gain significant traction. Canada's market size proved insufficient to impact U.S. prices substantially, and regulatory barriers prevented widespread implementation.

• **Prediction**: No collapse in drug R&D, but significant business model changes with increased reliance on entrepreneurial startups and university spinoffs.
  - **Reality**: This prediction proved largely accurate. The biopharmaceutical ecosystem evolved toward a model where major companies heavily depend on in-licensing and acquisitions. Venture capital funding for biotech surged, and startup innovation became crucial to industry pipelines.

• **Prediction**: The in-licensing game was already competitive and might not have enough innovation to sustain all pipelines.
  - **Reality**: While competition for quality assets remained intense, the biotech sector generated substantial innovation. The concern about insufficient startup activity proved unfounded—biotech funding and company creation accelerated significantly through the 2010s.

• **Prediction**: Changes would be needed in patent laws and regulatory approval processes.
  - **Reality**: Patent law saw incremental changes but no major overhauls targeting pharmaceuticals specifically. FDA regulatory processes did evolve, with accelerated approval pathways, breakthrough therapy designations, and orphan drug programs achieving success.

• **Prediction**: Different reward models beyond patent exclusivity and pricing power would emerge.
  - **Reality**: The core model remained largely intact, though with added complexity. Value-based pricing discussions increased, and outcomes-based contracts emerged. However, patent exclusivity and pricing power remained central to industry economics.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article demonstrates reasonable foresight about industry structural changes while overestimating the impact of reimportation as a policy solution. The discussion of startup ecosystems and business model evolution proved more prescient than the reimportation analysis, though the broader themes of pricing pressures and industry adaptation remain highly relevant today.
