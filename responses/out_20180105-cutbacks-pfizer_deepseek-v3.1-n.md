# Cutbacks at Pfizer (January 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article reported that Pfizer was exiting the neuroscience therapeutic area completely, with many layoffs involved despite no official company announcement. The author characterized this as a significant move given the company's size and the importance of neuroscience as a therapeutic area. Additionally, the article mentioned reports from two sources about major cuts in the Drug Safety and Metabolism department at Pfizer's Andover, Massachusetts site. The author interpreted Pfizer's withdrawal from neuroscience as a strong statement about the perceived likelihood of success in neurological drug development projects.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2018 reports, Pfizer did indeed substantially scale back its neuroscience research efforts, though not completely. In June 2018, Pfizer confirmed it had ended most of its neuroscience discovery programs. However, the company maintained its rare neurological disease research and continued development of tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain. The move eliminated approximately 300 positions.

In the years following, there was growing recognition across the pharmaceutical industry of the particular challenges in neuroscience drug development, including high failure rates, expensive and lengthy clinical trials, and incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms for conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Pfizer's decision to exit became part of a broader industry trend. Notably, by 2021-2022, some pharmaceutical companies began re-entering neuroscience as new technologies and approaches emerged, though Pfizer maintained its reduced footprint in this area.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction:** The article implicitly predicted that Pfizer's exit signaled poor prospects for success in neuroscience drug development.

**Outcome:** ✓ **Broadly accurate.** Neuroscience drug development continued to face very high failure rates well after 2018. Between 2018-2023, Alzheimer's drugs from various companies continued to fail at high rates, validating the challenging risk-reward calculation that likely drove Pfizer's decision. However, some successes did emerge (notably Biogen's Aduhelm and Leqembi for Alzheimer's, though with controversy and limited uptake), and the field is showing signs of renewal with new approaches.

**Prediction:** The article suggested this represented a major strategic shift at Pfizer regarding neuroscience.

**Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate.** Pfizer largely maintained its reduced neuroscience presence through 2020-2024, with no major re-entry into broad neuroscience discovery, confirming the strategic nature of this decision.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **6/10**

The article captured an important industry trend that accurately reflected the challenging economics of neuroscience drug development and presaged similar moves by other companies. However, it was primarily a breaking news piece with limited analysis or broader context about the underlying factors driving these decisions.
