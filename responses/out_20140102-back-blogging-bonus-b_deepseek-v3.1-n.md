# Back Blogging (Bonus Biographical Begging) (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post resumes blogging after a holiday break. The author reports they are working on a project titled *The Chemistry Book*, with a target of about 250 entries and about 140 completed. The author is actively writing and aiming to finish well before the deadline. A substantial portion of the post is dedicated to biographical research tied to the book: a call for help finding birth and death dates for a list of historical figures in chemistry. Examples include Hennig Brand (phosphorus), Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett (polyethylene), Peter Pauson (ferrocene), and others spanning inorganic, organic, polymer, and industrial chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY
- **Book publication and reception**: Derek Lowe’s *The Chemistry Book* was published by Sterling in 2016. It presents ~250 milestone discoveries in chemistry, with many entries providing historical context and attributing credit to key individuals.
- **Impact on scientists and the public**: The book became a widely recommended reference for students, educators, and general readers interested in the history of chemistry. It is frequently cited in chemistry education and outreach materials for its accuracy and engaging style.
- **Author’s continued platform**: Lowe’s blog “In the Pipeline” continued as a leading voice in pharmaceutical industry commentary and drug discovery. His blog remains a credible, widely read source on industry trends, clinical trial outcomes, and scientific critique.
- **Book’s reach and media**: The book’s accessible format led to use in classrooms, libraries, and public science communication, helping to popularize the historical context behind major chemical innovations. Reviews highlight its value in explaining the scientific and human stories behind discoveries, which aligns with the author’s aim stated in the post to give credit and err on the side of generosity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- The author stated: “I’m now up to about 140-odd entries of the 250 I need, and I’m on a pace to finish well before my deadline.”
  - **Outcome**: The book was completed and published in 2016, meeting the timeline implied by the article. The project’s scope and pace proved sustainable.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
This is a personal update about a writing project and a crowd-sourced request for historical details; it does not present claims to be validated years later or focus on emerging science, technology, or policy, so it falls in the lower decile of long-term importance.
