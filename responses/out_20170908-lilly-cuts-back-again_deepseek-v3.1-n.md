# Lilly Cuts Back, Again (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on Eli Lilly's announcement that it would cut approximately 3,500 jobs (8.5% of its global workforce), including 2,000 positions in the US and the closure of facilities in Bridgewater, New Jersey, and Shanghai, China. The author notes this makes Lilly the second major multinational drug company after GSK to close its physical presence in China. The layoffs were driven by patent expirations and what the article describes as a "massive lack of success" in Alzheimer's research programs. The company planned to implement most US cuts through early retirement packages. The article also observes that despite the negative human impact, Lilly's stock price increased on the news of layoffs, as is typical when companies implement cost-cutting measures.

## 2. HISTORY

After the September 2017 restructuring, Eli Lilly's trajectory took several significant turns:

**Alzheimer's Program Outcomes**: Lilly's Alzheimer's research efforts referenced in the article eventually gained momentum. The company's donanemab program, targeting amyloid plaques, progressed through clinical trials. In 2023, Lilly reported positive Phase 3 results for donanemab, showing it slowed cognitive decline by 35% in early-stage Alzheimer's patients. However, full FDA approval was still pending as regulators requested more data, and the drug faced the same commercialization challenges that have plagued the Alzheimer's field.

**Business Recovery and Growth**: Contrary to the article's concerns about sustained "hard times," Lilly experienced remarkable recovery and growth post-2017. The company achieved significant success with its type 2 diabetes drugs Trulicity and Mounjaro (tirzepatide), and particularly with Mounjaro's use for weight loss. The company's stock performance from 2017-2024 dramatically outperformed expectations.

**China Market Strategy**: The Shanghai facility closure mentioned in the article was part of broader industry trends. While Lilly reduced some physical presence, many Western pharmaceutical companies continued to navigate China's evolving regulatory landscape and market opportunities, with varying strategies for market access and partnerships.

**Corporate Evolution**: The predicted "big stretch of hard times" did not materialize as extensively as anticipated. Lilly managed to restructure successfully and find growth in areas beyond Alzheimer's research, particularly in diabetes care and weight management.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author suggested that Lilly might face "years from now" a historical view showing "a big stretch of hard times in the early 21st century, back during the Alzheimer's Era."
  - **Outcome**: While Lilly did face challenges, the company ultimately recovered and achieved significant growth, particularly through diabetes and weight loss drugs. The prediction of sustained "hard times" proved overly pessimistic.

• **Prediction**: The article implied ongoing struggles with the forecast of "two approvals a year" that never materialized.
  - **Outcome**: Lilly's pipeline productivity did improve post-2017, though the specific metric of two annual approvals remained less relevant than the quality and market impact of approvals achieved.

• **Prediction**: Concern about losing experienced employees through buyouts and the "slow and silent" effects of losing institutional knowledge.
  - **Outcome**: While difficult to quantify, Lilly's subsequent success suggests the restructuring didn't fundamentally damage the company's capabilities, though the impact of losing experienced personnel is inherently difficult to measure.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article captures an important moment in Big Pharma restructuring but proved to have limited predictive value about the company's long-term trajectory. It's moderately interesting as a snapshot of industry challenges during a specific period but became less significant as Lilly recovered and found success beyond Alzheimer's research.
