# The Magic of Peer Review (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary responds to a Vox article about problems in scientific peer review, arguing that peer review is not a "magic seal of approval" but rather one of several quality checks in science. The author emphasizes that science's foundation is reproducible experimental results, not peer review itself. 

The article highlights a case study in *Sensors and Actuators B* where papers from 2009-2015 contained apparently manipulated quantum dot images with obvious cut-and-paste repetition of particle images. These papers were identified through PubPeer discussions and Reddit forums, yet remained unaddressed by the journals despite being called out publicly. Several papers from the same research group showed similar image manipulation issues, including one where an author served as journal editor. The commentary criticizes Elsevier and Springer for maintaining weak quality control, suggesting publishers prioritize business models over scientific integrity, with problematic papers remaining in the literature for years without retraction or correction.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this article's publication, several developments reshaped peer review and research integrity:

**Post-publication peer review platforms grew significantly.** PubPeer, specifically mentioned in the article, expanded substantially and became a key venue for identifying problematic research. The platform faced legal challenges, including a 2021 lawsuit where a researcher sued PubPeer commenters, but ultimately prevailed, strengthening post-publication review protections.

**The reproducibility crisis deepened across scientific fields.** Systematic reviews revealed widespread inability to reproduce published results in psychology, cancer biology, and other fields. This led to institutional responses: journals adopted transparency requirements, funding agencies mandated data sharing, and research institutions implemented reproducibility training programs.

**Image manipulation detection became more sophisticated.** Tools like ImageTwin and Proofig emerged as commercial solutions for detecting duplicated images in manuscripts. Many journals began requiring raw image data submission and implemented automated screening software. Some publishers, including Nature family journals, mandated extensive image integrity checks before publication.

**Predatory journals proliferated.** The number of questionable journals exploded, with estimates reaching over 15,000 predatory journals publishing millions of papers by 2022. Many operated under legitimate publisher names, making detection difficult. This prompted initiatives like Think. Check. Submit. to help researchers identify reputable journals.

**Preprint servers expanded dramatically.** bioRxiv and medRxiv grew exponentially, with COVID-19 accelerating adoption. By 2024, preprints became standard practice in many fields, allowing immediate sharing of research results before peer review. Some funders and journals began accepting preprints for evaluation purposes.

**Research misconduct cases increased visibility.** High-profile cases like the Surgisphere COVID-19 retractions (2020) and Stanford President's research integrity issues (2023) attracted widespread attention. Scientific journals retracted over 50,000 papers between 2010-2024, with image manipulation being a leading cause. However, retraction rates remained low relative to estimated misconduct prevalence.

**Open peer review gained traction.** Journals like eLife, BMC series, and PLOS adopted more transparent review processes, publishing reviewer comments and author responses alongside articles. Some platforms experimented with crowd-sourced review and portable peer review concepts, though adoption remained moderate.

**AI-based screening emerged.** Publishers increasingly used artificial intelligence to screen manuscripts for plagiarism, image manipulation, and statistical irregularities before peer review. These tools became standard practice at major publishing houses by 2024.

Despite these developments, the fundamental issues described in the 2015 article persisted. A 2023 study found that only 20% of papers flagged on PubPeer received journal responses, and retraction rates for image manipulation allegations remained below 10%. The business model pressures mentioned in the original article continued, with major publishers maintaining profit margins above 30% while criticisms of quality control persisted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about peer review's trajectory:

- **That post-publication review would grow**: ✓ Correct. Platforms like PubPeer expanded significantly, and post-publication review became standard practice. Many journals now integrate PubPeer comments into their evaluation processes.

- **That transparency about peer review limitations would increase**: ✓ Correct. Major journals increasingly acknowledge peer review's limitations publicly, and transparency initiatives like open peer review gained adoption across publishers.

- **That business model pressures would continue affecting quality**: ✓ Correct. Major publishers maintained high profit margins (30-40%) while facing ongoing criticism for quality control. The rise of predatory journals and continued retraction delays supported this prediction.

- **Implicitly, that the scientific community would address these problems systematically**: ⚠ Partially correct. While many initiatives emerged (open science, post-publication review, transparency requirements), fundamental issues persisted. Image manipulation retractions remained rare relative to allegations, and many problems described in 2015 continued through 2024.

The article's skepticism about peer review as a "magic seal" proved prescient, as the following decade saw widespread recognition of peer review's limitations and the growth of complementary quality control mechanisms.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article correctly identified foundational issues in peer review that became central to science reform discussions. The specific case study prefigured widespread image manipulation problems that later affected major journals, and the emphasis on post-publication review anticipated its growth into a standard practice. The article's core arguments became increasingly relevant in the following decade's reproducibility crisis.
