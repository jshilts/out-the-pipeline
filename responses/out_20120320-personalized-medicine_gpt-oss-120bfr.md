# Personalized Medicine for Cancer? Try Every Cell. (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 NEJM paper examined four patients with metastatic renal‑cell carcinoma (RCC) by taking multiple spatially distinct biopsies from each primary tumor and from a chest‑wall metastasis. Deep‑sequencing of each region revealed extensive intratumoral heterogeneity: of 128 somatic mutations, only 40 were present in every region, 59 were shared by some but not all regions, and 29 were “private” to a single sample. The authors argued that a single biopsy cannot capture the full mutational landscape, that metastatic lesions arise from particular sub‑clones, and that convergent phenotypic evolution can mask underlying genetic diversity. They concluded that truly personalized cancer therapy would have to contend with this cellular mosaic—essentially “personalized medicine, cell by cell.”

## 2. HISTORY  
**Research advances (2012‑2026)**  
* **Multi‑region sequencing became a standard research tool.** Large consortia such as TRACERx (lung cancer), the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and numerous RCC‑focused studies performed systematic multi‑region sampling, confirming that most solid tumours harbour branched evolutionary trees.  
* **Single‑cell genomics exploded.** Droplet‑based scRNA‑seq (10x Genomics, Drop‑seq) and single‑cell DNA‑seq platforms made it feasible to profile thousands of individual tumour cells in a single experiment. By 2020, single‑cell atlases existed for RCC, breast, prostate and many other cancers, revealing sub‑clonal transcriptional programs and immune‑cell interactions.  
* **Clinical translation remained limited.** While research demonstrated the prevalence of heterogeneity, routine multi‑region biopsies have not become standard of care because of procedural risk, cost, and limited impact on approved therapeutic decisions.  
* **Liquid biopsies (circulating tumour DNA, ctDNA) gained traction.** ctDNA assays can capture a composite picture of tumour genetics from multiple sites, and by the mid‑2020s they were FDA‑cleared for monitoring EGFR‑mutant lung cancer and for minimal‑residual‑disease detection in colorectal cancer. In RCC, ctDNA sensitivity remains modest, so the approach has not replaced tissue sequencing.  
* **Therapeutic landscape for RCC.** Since 2012, the first‑line standard shifted from VEGF‑TKI monotherapy to combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab + ipilimumab, pembrolizumab + axitinib) that target a broader set of tumour phenotypes. These regimens improve response rates but do not rely on individual mutational profiles; instead they exploit the tumour‑immune interface, which is also heterogeneous.  
* **Resistance mechanisms linked to heterogeneity.** Clinical studies showed that resistance to TKIs and to checkpoint inhibitors often arises from pre‑existing sub‑clones harboring bypass mutations or alternative immune‑evasive pathways, confirming the article’s warning that a single biopsy can miss the “nastiest cells.”  

**Policy and industry impact**  
* No major regulatory mandates required multi‑region sampling, but the FDA issued guidance (2021) encouraging developers to consider intratumoral heterogeneity when designing biomarker‑driven trials.  
* Companies such as Foundation Medicine and Guardant Health expanded panels to include “heterogeneity scores” derived from ctDNA allele‑frequency distributions, but uptake has been modest compared with traditional single‑sample reports.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *A single biopsy is insufficient; clinicians will need to sample many regions to guide therapy.*  
  **Outcome:** Research confirmed the insufficiency, but routine clinical practice still relies on one or two core biopsies. Multi‑region sampling is used mainly in clinical trials or academic studies.  

- **Prediction:** *Personalized medicine will become “cell‑by‑cell,” requiring massive sequencing effort.*  
  **Outcome:** Single‑cell sequencing has become routine in research labs and is beginning to inform early‑phase trial designs (e.g., adaptive combination therapies), yet the scale of “cell‑by‑cell” profiling for every patient remains impractical.  

- **Prediction:** *Earlier biomarker attempts were naïve because they ignored heterogeneity.*  
  **Outcome:** True. Many early‑generation targeted‑therapy biomarkers (e.g., VHL loss in RCC) showed limited predictive power, leading to a shift toward pathway‑agnostic immunotherapies and combination regimens.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Understanding heterogeneity will lead to better drug development.*  
  **Outcome:** Drug developers now incorporate heterogeneity analyses in pre‑clinical models and in trial stratification (e.g., enrolling patients with high sub‑clonal diversity into combination‑therapy arms). However, no approved drug to date directly targets a specific sub‑clone identified by multi‑region sequencing.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article anticipated a fundamental shift in how we view tumour biology—an insight that has been borne out in research and has reshaped drug‑development thinking, even though the clinical implementation of “cell‑by‑cell” profiling remains limited. Its focus on RCC provided a concrete early example that helped catalyse the broader heterogeneity discourse.
