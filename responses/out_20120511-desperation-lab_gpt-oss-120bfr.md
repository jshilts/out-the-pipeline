# Desperation In the Lab (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary lampoons the trend of chemists resorting to ever‑more exotic, “desperate” reaction conditions in order to coax a transformation to work. Citing a blog post that listed outlandish additives such as bone meal and ground carrots, the author argues that many of these tricks are more novelty than practical methodology and that most synthetic chemists will never need to reach for such extremes. The tone is humorous but also cautionary, suggesting that the field should focus on reproducible, rational chemistry rather than gimmicky hacks.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since 2012 the broader conversation about unconventional reagents has evolved in several concrete ways:

* **Green and sustainable media** – The use of food‑derived or waste‑derived additives (e.g., citrus peel powders, spent coffee grounds) has grown, but primarily as **solvent or catalyst replacements** in green‑chemistry protocols rather than as mysterious “secret ingredients.” Academic papers and a handful of patents now report scalable processes that employ such materials, but they remain niche compared to conventional solvents.

* **Deep eutectic solvents (DES) and natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES)** – These mixtures, often composed of benign, food‑grade components (choline chloride + urea, sugars, amino acids), have become a recognized class of reaction media. By 2020‑2023 they were featured in dozens of peer‑reviewed studies and some commercial processes (e.g., metal extraction, biomass pretreatment). They fulfill the “unusual additive” idea but are deliberately designed, not ad‑hoc.

* **Biocatalysis and whole‑cell transformations** – The rise of engineered enzymes and microbial factories has made the use of **biological “ingredients”** (e.g., cell lysates, crude extracts) commonplace. While not the same as sprinkling bone meal into a flask, the principle of leveraging complex biological mixtures for synthetic advantage aligns with the spirit of the original list.

* **Commercial uptake** – No major pharmaceutical or fine‑chemical company has adopted bone meal, ground carrots, or similar literal foodstuffs as routine reagents. The few academic reports that experimented with such additives remained proof‑of‑concept studies and did not translate into FDA‑approved drugs or large‑scale processes.

* **Policy and funding** – Government agencies (e.g., the U.S. DOE’s “Catalysis for Sustainable Energy” program, EU’s Horizon Europe green‑chemistry calls) have explicitly encouraged the development of **renewable, low‑toxicity reagents**. This has indirectly supported research into unconventional, bio‑derived additives, but the emphasis is on **well‑characterized, scalable systems**.

Overall, the field has indeed explored more “unusual” media, but the shift has been systematic and chemistry‑driven rather than a scattershot collection of desperate hacks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not list explicit forecasts, but its implicit claim—that chemists will *rarely* need to resort to bizarre additives—can be evaluated:

- **Prediction (implicit):** “You’ll probably never be desperate enough to try bone meal, ground carrots, etc.”  
  **Outcome:** Largely true. Such literal food‑based powders have not entered mainstream synthetic protocols, and no FDA‑approved drug relies on them as reagents.

- **Prediction (implicit):** “The trend of exotic conditions is a passing curiosity.”  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While the specific examples cited (bone meal, carrots) remain curiosities, the broader trend toward **non‑traditional media** (DES, NADES, biocatalysis) has persisted and grown into a legitimate sub‑field.

- **Prediction (implicit):** “Chemists should focus on rational, reproducible methods rather than gimmicks.”  
  **Outcome:** Supported by the subsequent emphasis on **standardized green‑chemistry metrics** (E‑factor, PMI) and the rise of **process‑development platforms** that prioritize reproducibility.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **5/10**  

The piece is mildly entertaining and captures a snapshot of a cultural moment in synthetic chemistry, but its concrete impact on the field has been limited; the ideas it mocks have evolved into more systematic research areas rather than remaining mere anecdotes.
