# Gottlieb At the FDA (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary from April 2017 analyzes Scott Gottlieb's nomination as FDA Commissioner under the Trump administration. The article notes that Gottlieb's appointment was met with relief from biopharma executives and patient advocates who feared more radical alternatives. The author argues that criticism of the FDA as an overly burdensome regulator holding back a "flood" of new therapies is misguided. The real bottleneck in drug development is not regulatory but rather fundamental gaps in understanding human biology, with roughly 90% of investigational drugs still failing in clinical trials because they prove ineffective or unsafe. The piece predicts Gottlieb will face pressure from the White House to deregulate while managing complex challenges including user fee negotiations, budget cuts, and the opioid crisis.

## 2. HISTORY
Scott Gottlieb was confirmed as FDA Commissioner in May 2017 and served until April 2019. Under his leadership, the FDA did accelerate drug approvals—particularly through expanded use of priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designations. The agency approved record numbers of generic drugs, implemented the 21st Century Cures Act provisions, and streamlined some regulatory pathways. However, Gottlieb did not "wipe huge numbers of regulations off the books" as some had feared. Instead, he focused on modernizing regulatory approaches while maintaining safety standards. 

The fundamental structural issues identified in the article persisted. Clinical trial failure rates for novel drugs remained around 90%. Drug pricing continued escalating, and the relationship between regulatory burden and drug prices proved far more complex than simple deregulation advocates suggested. Gottlieb frequently clashed with the Trump administration over issues like drug importation and certain deregulation proposals. His resignation in 2019 was widely seen as a loss by the biopharma industry, which had come to view him as a pragmatic, science-based regulator. The opioid crisis intensified during his tenure, leading to new FDA restrictions and enforcement actions. User fee programs continued largely as before, contrary to predictions of major rewrites.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction that Gottlieb would be confirmed:** Accurate—he was confirmed in May 2017.
- **Prediction that he would face pressure from the White House to dismantle regulations:** Mixed accuracy. While there was pressure, Gottlieb resisted the most extreme deregulation demands and maintained that FDA standards impeded neither innovation nor patient access. He often publicly pushed back against administration proposals that he considered unsound, repeatedly making the point from this article that the main barriers were scientific, not regulatory.
- **Prediction that eliminating regulations would not automatically lower drug prices:** Confirmed accurate. Drug prices continued to rise under Gottlieb's tenure and beyond.
- **Prediction that smaller, faster trials would be inadequate to determine efficacy and safety:** Largely accurate. While adaptive trial designs and real-world evidence were adopted more during his tenure, the fundamental requirement for robust evidence of safety and efficacy remained. Gottlieb's reforms targeted efficiency rather than evidence standards.
- **Implicit prediction that fundamental biology gaps, not FDA bureaucracy, drive drug development challenges:** Well-supported. The 85-90% clinical failure rate remained essentially unchanged long past his tenure.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 8/10**

The article provides an unusually clear-eyed assessment of regulatory reform debates that aged remarkably well, identifying structural scientific rather than regulatory barriers to drug development that remained relevant years later when most commentary focused on easier targets like bureaucracy and cost.
