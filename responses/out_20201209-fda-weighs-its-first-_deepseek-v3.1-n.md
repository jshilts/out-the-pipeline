# The FDA Weighs Its First Coronavirus Vaccine (December 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reviews the FDA briefing documents for Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine ahead of an advisory committee meeting in December 2020. The author analyzes safety data showing no serious concerns, with 2 deaths in the vaccinated group versus 3 in placebo (both ~19,000 people) and generally balanced adverse events. Four Bell's palsy cases appeared in the vaccine group but at expected population rates.

On efficacy, the final analysis showed 95% vaccine efficacy (162/8 cases split, 95% CI: 90.3%-97.6%). The data revealed significant protection even after just one dose, with immunity appearing 10-14 days post-vaccination. The vaccine performed consistently across age, gender, BMI, and ethnic subgroups.

The author highlights key unknowns: effects on disease transmission, asymptomatic infection prevention, and duration of protection - all requiring further study. Despite these gaps, the author strongly supports Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), noting the overwhelmingly favorable risk/benefit ratio given the pandemic emergency with no alternatives.

## 2. HISTORY

The FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 11, 2020. The vaccine (marketed as Comirnaty) received full FDA approval on August 23, 2021.

**Real-world impact**: By early 2023, over 13 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered globally. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine became one of the most widely used, with hundreds of millions of doses administered in the US alone. The 95% efficacy held up broadly in real-world effectiveness studies, though effectiveness against symptomatic disease waned over time and varied against new variants.

**Safety surveillance**: Post-authorization monitoring identified rare but serious side effects not detected in trials. The most significant was myocarditis (heart inflammation), primarily in young males after mRNA vaccines, occurring at approximately 10-40 cases per million doses. While serious, most cases resolved with treatment, and the benefit-risk assessment remained favorable. The Bell's palsy concern mentioned did not materialize into a statistically significant safety signal.

**Clinical failures and successes**: The vaccine dramatically reduced severe disease, hospitalization, and death rates as rolled out. Studies confirmed it reduced transmission (though less so with variants like Delta and Omicron). However, it did not prevent all asymptomatic infection or transmission, particularly with later variants.

**Policy impact**: The EUA triggered massive vaccination campaigns globally. Many countries implemented vaccine mandates for certain occupations, schools, and travel. This created significant public health benefits but also intense political and social controversy about vaccine requirements.

**Business impact**: Pfizer's revenue from Comirnaty exceeded $36 billion in 2021 and $37 billion in 2022, making it one of the best-selling pharmaceutical products in history and transforming the financial position of both companies.

The scientific unknowns the author highlighted were gradually addressed through ongoing surveillance: duration of protection proved to be several months for preventing symptomatic disease, effectiveness against transmission was substantial for the original strain but diminished with variants, and asymptomatic infection prevention decreased over time and varied by variant.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **FDA Emergency Use Authorization**: The author predicted the FDA would grant EUA "very soon." **Outcome**: The FDA granted EUA on December 11, 2020 (two days after publication). This prediction was accurate and timely.

• **Effect on viral transmission**: The author stated it "seems very likely that this vaccination would cut down the transmission rate sharply" but noted "that has to be proven." **Outcome**: Partially correct. Studies did show substantial transmission reduction for the original strain and Alpha variant, but effectiveness against transmission decreased with Delta and especially Omicron variants, though some reduction persisted.

• **Asymptomatic infection prevention**: The author acknowledged uncertainty, noting "we don't know what the effectiveness of the vaccine is in preventing asymptomatic infections" and that the trial design couldn't answer this. **Outcome**: Correct about the uncertainty. Later studies showed vaccines reduced but didn't eliminate asymptomatic infection, with effectiveness varying by variant and time since vaccination.

• **Placebo group crossover concerns**: The author worried about effects of EUAs on other vaccine trials, particularly placebo group switching to vaccine. **Outcome**: This became a significant methodological challenge, as ethical considerations made continued placebo-controlled trials difficult, forcing many trials to modify designs or unblind participants.

• **Duration of protection**: The author correctly noted "we don't know what the duration of protection is" and that only time would tell. **Outcome**: Studies eventually showed protection against symptomatic disease lasted several months before waning, necessitating booster doses, while protection against severe disease proved more durable.

• **Rare adverse events**: The author warned that nasty side effects "at the one-in-a-million level" wouldn't appear in 38,000-person trials but would emerge after "a few hundred million people." **Outcome**: Prescient. Myocarditis emerged at roughly these rates, along with other rare events not detected in trials, validating the author's cautious approach to post-marketing surveillance.

• **Overall assessment of unknowns**: The author focused on legitimate uncertainties rather than hype. **Outcome**: This measured approach proved justified, as many uncertainties did require time and larger datasets to resolve, and some outcomes proved more complicated than initial optimism suggested.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about both the vaccine's success and the legitimate uncertainties that would need resolution through larger-scale real-world deployment, making it an outstanding example of evidence-based scientific commentary during a critical historical moment.
