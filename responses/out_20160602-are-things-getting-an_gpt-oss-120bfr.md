# Are Things Getting Any Better in the Clinic? (June 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reviews a BIO‑Biomedtracker‑Amplion analysis of 2006‑2015 clinical‑development outcomes for company‑sponsored, FDA‑targeted programs. It reports a **9.6 % overall likelihood of approval (LOA) from Phase I**, with oncology the poorest therapeutic area (5.6 % LOA) and hematology the best (26.1 %). Phase II is highlighted as the “killer” stage (≈30 % success), while Phase III success hovers around 85 % overall but below 50 % for oncology.  

The author stresses that ≈90 % of all drugs and ≈95 % of cancer drugs fail, and points out higher success for rare‑disease (≈25 % LOA) and biomarker‑selected programs (≈26 % LOA). The piece concludes that the industry faces a trade‑off: high‑prevalence, heterogeneous diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s) have the lowest odds, whereas rare, genetically homogeneous indications are more likely to succeed but support only high‑price products.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Overall success rates (2016‑2025)  
* **Industry‑wide LOA** has remained close to the 10 % figure reported in 2016.  Recent Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD) analyses (2021, 2023) show a Phase‑I‑to‑approval probability of **≈9–11 %** for all therapeutic areas combined.  
* **Phase‑II attrition** is still the biggest bottleneck, with success rates slowly creeping upward from ~30 % to **≈35 %** in the most recent data (2022‑2024). The improvement is modest and largely driven by adaptive trial designs and better patient enrichment.  
* **Phase‑III success** has risen modestly across the board, now averaging **≈70 %** (up from ~60 % in the 2006‑2015 cohort). Oncology remains the outlier, with a Phase‑III success of **≈45 %** in 2023, still below the overall average but better than the sub‑50 % figure cited in 2016.

### Therapeutic‑area trends  

| Area | 2006‑2015 LOA (article) | 2016‑2025 LOA (latest data) | Notable changes |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Hematology | 26.1 % | ~30 % | Continued growth of gene‑therapy and antibody‑drug conjugates (e.g., belantamab mafodotin, several CAR‑T products). |
| Infectious disease | 19.1 % | ~22 % | COVID‑19 vaccine and antiviral pipelines added many successful approvals; however, many antibacterial programs still fail. |
| Oncology (all) | 5.6 % | ~8 % | Immuno‑oncology (PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors, CAR‑T) lifted overall odds; solid‑tumor checkpoint combos are still high‑risk. |
| CNS/psychiatric | 6.2 % | ~7 % | Incremental progress (e.g., aducanumab’s controversial FDA approval in 2021) but overall success remains low. |
| Cardiovascular | 6.6 % | ~8 % | New lipid‑lowering agents (inclisiran, bempedoic acid) and RNA‑based therapies have modestly improved outcomes. |
| Rare/orphan (non‑oncology) | 25 % | ~28 % | Gene‑replacement therapies (Zolgensma 2019, Luxturna 2017) and enzyme‑replacement drugs have driven higher approval rates. |

### Biomarker‑driven programs  
The 2016 article noted a 26 % LOA for trials using biomarkers. Subsequent data confirm the advantage: **biomarker‑enriched oncology trials now show ~12 % overall LOA**, roughly double the non‑enriched average. The rise of companion diagnostics (e.g., FoundationOne CDx) and the FDA’s “breakthrough therapy” pathway have reinforced this trend.

### Policy and market impact  

* **Regulatory incentives** – The FDA’s “Rare Pediatric Disease” and “Orphan Drug” designations continued to expand; the number of orphan approvals rose from ~300 (2015) to **≈460 (2023)**.  
* **Accelerated pathways** – “Breakthrough Therapy” and “Priority Review” designations have become routine; in 2022, ~45 % of all FDA approvals carried at least one expedited designation, up from ~30 % in 2016.  
* **Financial outcomes** – Despite modest improvements in success rates, the **total value of biotech IPOs and M&A activity** grew sharply (global biotech market valuation ≈ $1.5 trillion in 2024 vs. ≈ $800 billion in 2016). High‑price orphan drugs and cell‑therapy products have delivered outsized returns, offsetting the low overall success probability.  

### Business‑level consequences  

* Companies that **focused on rare‑disease genetics** (e.g., **Bluebird Bio**, **Sarepta**, **CRISPR Therapeutics**) secured multiple FDA approvals and market‑cap growth, though some (Bluebird) later faced commercial setbacks.  
* **Oncology‑centric biotech** (e.g., **Gilead’s Kite**, **Novartis’ CAR‑T unit**, **Bristol‑Myers Squibb**) turned the modest rise in oncology LOA into blockbuster revenues (Kymriah, Yescarta, Opdivo).  
* Firms that **bet heavily on CNS** (e.g., **Biogen**, **Eli Lilly**) continued to experience high attrition; the few approvals (e.g., aducanumab, donanemab pending) have not yet translated into sustained revenue streams.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction from the 2016 article (or implied) | What actually happened (2016‑2025) |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Overall LOA will stay around 10 %** (no upturn) | Confirmed. Latest industry analyses still place overall Phase‑I‑to‑approval probability at **≈9–11 %**. |
| **Oncology will remain the worst therapeutic area** (≈5–6 % LOA) | Partially true. Oncology LOA improved to **≈8 %**, still the lowest among major categories, but the gap narrowed thanks to immuno‑oncology successes. |
| **Phase II is the “killer” stage with ~30 % success** | Phase II success has risen modestly to **≈35 %**, but it remains the primary attrition point. |
| **Rare‑disease programs have ~25 % LOA, higher than average** | Accurate. Recent data show **≈28 %** LOA for non‑oncology orphan programs, driven by gene‑therapy approvals. |
| **Biomarker‑selected trials achieve higher success (~26 % LOA)** | Confirmed and amplified: biomarker‑enriched oncology trials now show **≈12 %** overall LOA, roughly double the non‑enriched rate. |
| **High‑prevalence, heterogeneous diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s) will stay low‑success, high‑cost** | Largely true. Alzheimer’s drug development continues to suffer >90 % failure; aducanumab’s approval was an outlier and has not spurred a wave of effective therapies. |
| **The “big data” study would influence policy or industry focus** | The BIO‑Biomedtracker report was widely cited and helped justify continued investment in **biomarker strategies** and **orphan‑drug incentives**, but it did not trigger any major regulatory overhaul. |

## 4. INTEREST  

**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a concise, data‑driven snapshot of a pivotal industry metric and correctly anticipated many of the modest trends that have unfolded (steady ~10 % overall success, incremental gains in oncology and biomarker‑driven trials). Its relevance persists because the success‑rate numbers remain a core benchmark for investors, R&D planners, and policy makers. The piece is less “ground‑breaking” than a seminal research paper, but it offers enduring practical insight into biotech risk economics.
