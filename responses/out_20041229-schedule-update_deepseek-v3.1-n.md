# Schedule Update (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief blog post from December 29, 2004, in which the author announces a temporary hiatus from blogging for the New Year's holiday. The author states that blogging will resume on Monday night (EST) and promises two upcoming posts: first, a review of "what the last twelve months have been like in my line of work," followed by "something cheerful." The post also includes a call to action encouraging readers to donate to tsunami relief funds, providing a link to Google's tsunami relief page. The author signs off wishing readers a safe New Year's Eve and states they will return in a few days.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a routine personal blog update rather than a substantive article about the biotechnology industry. The tsunami referenced is the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that occurred on December 26, 2004, which killed approximately 230,000 people across 14 countries. The humanitarian response to this disaster was one of the largest in history, with billions of dollars donated worldwide through various relief organizations. However, this blog post itself contains no information about biotechnology developments, company activities, drug approvals, policy changes, or scientific discoveries that could be tracked over time. It is simply a scheduling announcement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The post contains no predictions about biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, regulatory changes, market trends, or scientific breakthroughs. There are no statements about future drug approvals, clinical trial outcomes, technological advancements, or business developments in the biotech sector. The author's only forward-looking statement is the promise to write about their work experience over the previous twelve months and then write "something cheerful," with no indication of what specific topics would be covered in those future posts.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This is not a biotechnology industry article - it is a personal blog scheduling update with no scientific or industry content. The post is completely off-topic relative to biotechnology and contains no information that could be analyzed for accuracy, impact, or predictive value in the biotech sector. While the tsunami relief reference reflects a significant historical humanitarian crisis, the article itself has no relevance to biotechnology developments or analysis.
