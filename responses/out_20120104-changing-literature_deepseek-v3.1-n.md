# The Changing Literature (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the emergence of Retraction Watch as a watchdog blog tracking scientific retractions and a Nature commentary by its founders Adam Marcus and Ivan Oransky. The piece highlights a concerning trend where retracted papers sometimes spawn new "corroborative" data without clear peer review status, calling for greater transparency in retraction notices. The central argument is that the traditional scientific paper format is becoming inadequate, and that the scientific community needs to shift away from overemphasizing individual papers toward a more comprehensive evaluation system. The proposed alternative would include additional materials like blog posts, media coverage, and download statistics as part of a study's complete record, with systems like Crossmark being tested to manage these expanded publication records.

## 2. HISTORY

Retraction Watch continued to grow significantly after 2012, becoming the most prominent retraction tracking resource in academia. The blog was acquired by the Center for Scientific Integrity in 2017, expanding its scope and resources. By 2023, Retraction Watch had documented over 20,000 retractions, and its database became a critical research tool for studying research integrity.

The transparency issues identified in 2012 evolved substantially. Major publishers like Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley began implementing more detailed retraction notices, though inconsistent practices persisted. The "arsenic bacteria" case mentioned in the article became a landmark example of post-publication peer review, with multiple follow-up studies ultimately disproving the original claims.

Crossmark, the system mentioned as being tested, was fully launched and adopted by CrossRef members, providing persistent identifiers and update information for scholarly content. However, it did not become the universal standard for tracking all post-publication activity that the article envisioned.

Post-publication review platforms flourished: PubMed Commons launched in 2013 (though discontinued in 2018), PubPeer gained prominence for anonymous post-publication commentary, and preprint servers like bioRxiv and arXiv expanded dramatically, shifting the landscape of scientific communication.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends, with preprint servers seeing massive traffic increases and expedited peer review processes revealing both the benefits and risks of rapid publication cycles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: Retraction Watch founders called for expanding the scientific record beyond individual papers to include blog posts, media coverage, and download statistics as part of meritocratic evaluation.

  **Reality**: Mixed outcome. Altmetrics emerged and gained institutional adoption (e.g., PLOS journals, many publishers display altmetric scores), but traditional citation-based metrics remain dominant. Researcher evaluation systems at universities largely still prioritize publication in high-impact journals over blog posts or media coverage. The "worthy blog posts" integration never materialized as part of formal evaluation systems.

• **Prediction**: Crossmark would become a system to keep up with extensions and link them to original papers during cases like the "arsenic bacteria" controversy.

  **Reality**: Partially realized. Crossmark launched and is used by CrossRef members, but it primarily provides basic metadata updates rather than comprehensive linking of all post-publication discussions. The broader ecosystem evolved differently through platforms like PubPeer and institutional repositories.

• **Prediction**: Authors would need to accept more public comment and criticism as tools enabled rapid, thorough responses.

  **Reality**: Fully realized. Social media, PubPeer, and institutional investigations have created an environment where controversial papers face immediate public scrutiny. The 2018 CRISPR babies controversy and various COVID-19-related papers demonstrated this intensification of real-time public scientific discourse.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in the transformation of scientific communication, accurately identifying tensions and trends that would substantially shape the next decade of academic publishing and research integrity oversight.
