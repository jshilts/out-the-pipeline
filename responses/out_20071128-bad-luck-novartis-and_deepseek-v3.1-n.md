# Bad Luck For Novartis - And For Diabetics (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the competitive landscape between Novartis and Merck in developing DPP-IV inhibitors for type 2 diabetes. Novartis appeared to have an early lead in this new class of diabetes drugs, having published extensively on their research while their lead compound (Galvus/vildagliptin) advanced through clinical trials. However, Merck had simultaneously been running their own quiet DPP-IV inhibitor program and ultimately beat Novartis to FDA approval and market launch with sitagliptin (Januvia). The article notes that Novartis's compound faced FDA concerns, particularly regarding potential liver toxicity, which raised questions about whether it would ever reach the US market. The author poses philosophical questions about whether these parallel-development drugs should be considered "me-too" compounds, argues that simultaneous development of similar drugs represents valid risk-taking rather than copycat behavior, and questions what alternative approaches critics would propose given the high failure rate of drug development.

## 2. HISTORY

**Market Outcomes:**
- **Merck's sitagliptin (Januvia)**: Was approved by the FDA in October 2006 and became a major commercial success, achieving blockbuster status with peak annual sales exceeding $6 billion. It remains widely prescribed globally as a first-line or add-on therapy for type 2 diabetes.

- **Novartis's vildagliptin (Galvus)**: Never received FDA approval in the United States due to the liver toxicity concerns mentioned in the article. However, it was approved in Europe and many other markets (but not the US) starting in 2007-2008. It achieved moderate commercial success internationally, generating annual sales in the hundreds of millions but never reaching blockbuster status like sitagliptin.

**Clinical and Scientific Developments:**
- The DPP-IV inhibitor class proved clinically effective and safe (with the exception of vildagliptin's hepatic concerns). Multiple other DPP-IV inhibitors entered the market after 2007, including saxagliptin (Onglyza), linagliptin (Tradjenta), and alogliptin (Nesina), validating the therapeutic approach.
- DPP-IV inhibitors became established as a well-tolerated oral option for type 2 diabetes, often used when metformin alone is insufficient or as initial combination therapy. They do not cause hypoglycemia or weight gain, making them attractive options.
- The mechanism proved robust: by inhibiting DPP-IV, these drugs increase levels of GLP-1 and GIP, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon.

**Business Impact:**
- Merck's Januvia became one of the most successful diabetes drugs of the late 2000s and 2010s, driving significant revenue for the company and establishing Merck as a major player in diabetes care.
- Novartis's failure to gain US approval for Galvus represented a substantial lost opportunity, likely costing billions in potential revenue, though the drug still contributed meaningfully to international sales.
- The competitive dynamic exemplified the high-stakes nature of pharmaceutical R&D, where even "winning" a race to market by months can determine market leadership.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Predictions embedded in or implied by the article:**

• **"It's looking very likely that Novartis's compound may never get to the market in the US at all"**
  - **Accuracy**: ✓ Correct. Vildagliptin never received FDA approval in the United States, though it did launch in Europe and other international markets.

• **The article questions whether DPP-IV inhibitors represent valuable innovation vs. "me-too" drugs**
  - **Outcome**: The DPP-IV inhibitor class proved to be genuinely innovative and clinically valuable. They offered a novel mechanism of action with favorable tolerability profiles, fundamentally different from existing diabetes medications. The market ultimately supported multiple drugs in this class, suggesting they weren't perceived as mere "me-too" products but as valuable additions to the diabetes treatment armamentarium.

• **Implicit prediction about the viability of simultaneous parallel development programs**
  - **Outcome**: The parallel development model proved sound. Having multiple companies pursue the same target simultaneously provided backup options (safety net for drug development failures) and ultimately gave physicians and patients multiple therapeutic choices within an effective drug class.

• **Implicit prediction about drug development risk**
  - **Outcome**: The article's emphasis on unforeseen toxicology problems proved prescient. Vildagliptin's specific issue (liver toxicity) emerged late in development and prevented US approval, validating the author's point that "any compound can fail at any time" and that the field needs redundancy and competition.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article's insights into competitive drug development, the unpredictability of clinical outcomes, and the "me-too" versus parallel innovation debate make it historically significant and analytically sharp. It captures a pivotal moment in diabetes drug development while raising enduring questions about pharmaceutical R&D strategy.
