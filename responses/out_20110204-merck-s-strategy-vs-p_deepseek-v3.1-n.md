# Merck's Strategy vs. Pfizer's (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This February 2011 commentary compares Merck's and Pfizer's strategic approaches to pharmaceutical R&D investment. The author highlights Merck CEO Ken Frazier's decision to pull the company's earnings-per-share guidance following setbacks with the cardiovascular drug vorapaxar (which showed bleeding complications in trials). Frazier positioned this as prioritizing long-term research investment over short-term earnings targets, explicitly contrasting with Pfizer's approach of cutting R&D to meet financial targets.

The article presents Frazier's arguments: Merck remained committed to innovation as a sustainable long-term strategy, citing historical precedent from Merck's 1970s when continued research investment during fallow periods eventually led to breakthrough drugs. Analysts were skeptical of the guidance withdrawal, questioning why a drug like vorapaxar (expected to launch in 2012) would require pulling EPS guidance when it should have been a predictable "drag on earnings." The core debate centered on pharmaceutical companies balancing investor expectations for consistent returns with the uncertain, long-term nature of drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

**Merck's Trajectory:**

Vorapaxar's outcome became clear by 2014. The drug (brand name Zontivity) eventually received FDA approval in May 2014, but with significant restrictions—it was approved only for patients with prior heart attack or peripheral artery disease, excluding those with history of stroke due to bleeding risk. The drug achieved only modest market penetration, with annual sales peaking around $30-40 million, far below initial blockbuster expectations. By 2020, Merck discontinued Zontivity in Europe and significantly curtailed its promotion.

Merck's R&D strategy evolved considerably. Despite Frazier's 2011 commitment to internal innovation, Merck increasingly relied on external innovation through partnerships and acquisitions. Notable deals included the $3.85 billion acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals (2014) for hepatitis C drugs, $17 billion for Cubist Pharmaceuticals (2014) for antibiotics, and extensive oncology partnerships. By the late 2010s, Merck's oncology portfolio (particularly Keytruda) became its primary growth driver, while traditional cardiovascular research declined markedly.

Frazier continued as CEO until June 2021, overseeing mixed results—Keytruda's success drove significant revenue growth, but pipeline productivity in other therapeutic areas remained challenging. The company maintained relatively high R&D spending compared to peers but shifted focus toward oncology and immunology rather than broad-based innovation.

**Pfizer's Evolution:**

Pfizer's cost-cutting strategy intensified. Under CEO Ian Read (2011-2018), the company implemented major restructuring, spinning off animal health (Zoetis) and eventually separating its established products business (Upjohn) through merger with Mylan. R&D spending declined from approximately $9 billion in 2010 to around $8 billion by 2019 (before COVID-19 investments), though this partially reflected business divestitures.

Pfizer's pipeline became more focused, with successes in oncology (Ibrance, Xtandi) and rare diseases. The company's COVID-19 vaccine partnership with BioNTech (2020-2021) generated unprecedented revenue ($37 billion in 2021), temporarily reversing earlier strategic concerns about pipeline productivity.

**Industry Context:**

The broader pharmaceutical landscape validated aspects of both strategies. Companies that maintained robust R&D investment (like Merck, Novartis, and Roche) generally achieved better long-term pipeline productivity. However, disciplined capital allocation proved equally important—major Phase III failures continued to impact companies regardless of R&D spending levels. Wall Street increasingly rewarded companies with clear therapeutic area focus over those maintaining broad discovery portfolios.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Merck's innovation-led strategy would prove sustainable long-term**: Frazier predicted that maintaining R&D investment would distinguish Merck from competitors cutting research budgets. Outcome: Mixed. Merck maintained higher R&D spending than many peers, but success came from specific areas (oncology) rather than broad-based innovation. Keytruda's success validated strategic choices, but the vorapaxar example showed that maintaining R&D spending alone doesn't guarantee success.

• **Vorapaxar could still be "very important drug going forward"**: Frazier remained optimistic despite trial setbacks, citing potential benefits to certain patient populations. Outcome: Largely incorrect. Zontivity achieved only niche market acceptance with restrictive labeling, never becoming the blockbuster initially envisioned.

• **Pfizer's R&D cuts would impair long-term competitiveness**: The article's author implicitly endorsed Merck's approach over Pfizer's cost-cutting. Outcome: Nuanced. Pfizer successfully focused its portfolio and achieved major commercial successes (particularly in oncology), while maintaining sufficient R&D to develop COVID-19 vaccine and other important drugs. Cost-cutting didn't prevent Pfizer from remaining a top-tier pharmaceutical company.

• **The Schering-Plough merger was problematic**: The author expressed skepticism about the merger's value. Outcome: Perhaps correct in some respects. While the merger brought some valuable assets (including early-stage oncology compounds), significant integration costs and cultural clashes likely reduced overall efficiency for several years.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important strategic crossroads in pharmaceutical industry evolution, highlighting the tension between shareholder demands for predictable returns and the inherently uncertain nature of drug discovery. While moderately interesting for corporate strategy analysis, it lacks broader implications beyond two specific companies during a particular business cycle.
