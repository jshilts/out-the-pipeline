# Lipitor Expiration Day (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article marks the November 30, 2011 patent expiration of Lipitor (atorvastatin), one of the most successful pharmaceutical drugs in history. The author references a Forbes overview by Matthew Herper that examines whether any future drug could replicate Lipitor's unprecedented commercial success. The piece briefly mentions CETP inhibitors as a class of drugs that pharmaceutical developers hoped might achieve similar blockbuster status in treating cardiovascular disease. The tone is reflective, acknowledging the end of an era for one of pharma's greatest financial successes.

## 2. HISTORY
The period following Lipitor's 2011 patent expiration saw exactly what was feared: a dramatic shift in the statin market. Generic atorvastatin became widely available at a fraction of the brand-name cost, causing Lipitor's annual sales to plummet from over $10 billion at peak to approximately $2 billion by 2012-2013 as patients and healthcare systems switched to low-cost generics.

The CETP inhibitors mentioned in the article—drugs designed to raise HDL ("good") cholesterol—experienced a catastrophic failure that reshaped cardiovascular drug development. Between 2006-2017, three major CETP inhibitors failed in clinical trials: Pfizer's torcetrapib (2006, terminated due to safety issues), Roche's dalcetrapib (2012, stopped for lack of efficacy), and Eli Lilly's evacetrapib (2015, failed to show cardiovascular benefit). The closest to success was Merck's anacetrapib, which showed modest benefit in the REVEAL trial (2017) but was never brought to market, likely due to the drug accumulating in adipose tissue.

This series of failures fundamentally changed pharmaceutical approaches to cardiovascular disease prevention. Rather than pursuing broad HDL-raising strategies, research pivoted toward more targeted approaches using genetic validation, ultimately leading to the success of PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab and alirocumab, FDA-approved in 2015). These drugs, which dramatically lower LDL cholesterol through a different mechanism, did achieve blockbuster status but never matched Lipitor's peak sales due to much higher costs and injection-based administration.

The post-2011 period also saw the generic statin market become highly commoditized, with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin all available as low-cost generics by the mid-2010s, substantially reducing healthcare costs but also eliminating the profit margins that drove statin development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in the article—it largely served as retrospective commentary on Lipitor's success. The implied question about whether another drug could match Lipitor's impact went unanswered at the time.

- **Implicit expectation of CETP inhibitor success**: The article's reference to CETP inhibitors as potential successors proved incorrect—all major candidates failed in clinical trials over the subsequent 6 years, representing one of pharmaceutical development's most expensive disappointments.
- **Lipitor's post-expiration performance**: While not explicitly predicted, the expectation was that generic competition would eliminate Lipitor's market dominance—this occurred exactly as anticipated, with rapid conversion to generic atorvastatin and dramatic sales declines.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4**

This article serves as a reasonable historical marker for an important pharmaceutical transition, but its brevity and lack of substantive analysis limit its long-term value. The CETP inhibitor mention provides some foreshadowing of a major drug development failure, but the article doesn't explore this angle deeply enough to merit higher interest ranking. It's primarily a brief commentary noting a significant commercial milestone rather than offering deep scientific or industry analysis.
