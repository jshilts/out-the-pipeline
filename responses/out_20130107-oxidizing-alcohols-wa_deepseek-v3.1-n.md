# Oxidizing Alcohols - With Water (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a new catalytic system reported by David Milstein's group at the Weizmann Institute for oxidizing alcohols to carboxylic acids using water as the oxygen donor, with hydrogen gas produced as a byproduct. The catalyst is a ruthenium complex operating under argon atmosphere with good turnover numbers (0.2% catalyst loading) but relatively slow reaction times (18 hours). A notable limitation is the catalyst's hydrogenation activity, which reduces alkenes due to the hydrogen present.

The author identifies potential industrial advantages, including eliminating metal reagents, avoiding pressurized oxygen, and opening new feedstock routes. Specific applications discussed include replacing the nitric acid-based production of adipic acid (used in nylon manufacturing) if sufficient hexanediol feedstock exists, though the author notes that hexanediol is typically made by reducing adipic acid, creating a circular dependency. The system's hydrogen byproduct is mentioned as potentially useful for integrated processes.

## 2. HISTORY

The Milstein catalyst system reported in the 2013 Nature Chemistry paper did not achieve widespread industrial adoption. The reaction remains primarily of academic interest rather than commercial implementation.

Carboxylic acid production continues to rely on established industrial processes. The article mentions several existing routes: hydroformylation followed by aldehyde oxidation, alkane oxidation in air, and alcohol carbonylation (Cativa process). These methods remain dominant due to their scalability, efficiency, and established infrastructure.

In adipic acid production specifically, the conventional nitric acid oxidation process continues to be the standard industrial method. No major shift to alternative feedstocks like hexanediol has occurred. Research into biological routes for diol production, mentioned as a potential pathway, has not resulted in commercially competitive bio-based adipic acid production at scale.

David Milstein's research group continued working on catalytic systems, publishing additional work on hydrogenation and dehydrogenation chemistry, but the specific water-based alcohol oxidation system did not displace established chemical manufacturing processes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Eliminating industrial metals and high-valent reagents**: The article suggested this would be "worth the trouble industrially." **Outcome**: The Milstein catalyst system was not adopted industrially, and established processes using metals and conventional oxidants remain standard.

• **Ditching pressurized oxygen requirements**: The author predicted industrial value in eliminating oxygen pressure. **Outcome**: Pressurized oxygen processes continue to be widely used and have not been replaced by this alternative.

• **Opening new industrial feedstock routes**: The article suggested this reaction "could open up some new industrial feedstock routes." **Outcome**: No new commercial routes based on this chemistry emerged; existing processes remained economically superior.

• **Replacing nitric acid route to adipic acid**: The author wondered about replacing the "foul nitric acid process" for nylon production. **Outcome**: The nitric acid process remains the dominant industrial method; no commercial alternative using hexanediol was implemented.

• **Finding uses for byproduct hydrogen**: The article mentioned potential for "two-for-one process" utilizing the hydrogen byproduct. **Outcome**: This did not materialize commercially, likely due to the reaction not being adopted at scale.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article describes scientifically interesting but commercially non-viable chemistry. While the catalyst system represents legitimate academic research, it did not lead to industrial adoption or practical applications, limiting its broader importance.
