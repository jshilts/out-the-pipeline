# Too Near the Sun? (December 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines the aftermath of Pfizer's torcetrapib failure—a CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibitor designed to raise HDL ("good") cholesterol. The author notes that while torcetrapib successfully raised HDL, Pfizer's decision to test it in combination with atorvastatin (Lipitor) led to fatal complications that terminated the drug's development. The central question posed is whether combination therapy was the problem, or whether the issue was inherent to the drug mechanism itself.

The piece then examines Roche's parallel CETP development program, noting that despite Roche not having its own statin to protect (unlike Pfizer with Lipitor), Roche was also testing their CETP inhibitor in combination with statins across multiple trials. The author identifies the strategic reason: monotherapy trials suggested CETP inhibitors might modestly lower LDL only in patients without high triglycerides, but since most target patients have elevated triglycerides, combination with proven LDL-lowering statins appeared necessary for market viability and clinical benefit.

## 2. HISTORY

**Pfizer's Torcetrapib Failure (2006):** The ILLUMINATE trial was terminated in December 2006 when torcetrapib showed increased all-cause mortality (82 vs 51 deaths) and cardiovascular events. Post-mortem analysis revealed the drug elevated blood pressure and aldosterone levels, causing the cardiovascular harm—mechanisms that were not fully understood during development.

**Roche's Dalcetrapib (JTT-705):** Roche continued development but terminated their dalcetrapib program in May 2012 after the dal-OUTCOMES trial showed no cardiovascular benefit despite raising HDL by 31-40%. The failure suggested that merely elevating HDL did not automatically translate to clinical outcomes—a major blow to the HDL hypothesis.

**Eli Lilly's Evacetrapib:** Development was halted in October 2015 after the ACCELERATE trial showed no cardiovascular benefit despite impressive HDL elevation (133%) and LDL reduction (37%). By this point, accumulating evidence suggested CETP inhibition could change lipoprotein levels without affecting cardiovascular outcomes.

**Merck's Anacetrapib:** Merck completed the REVEAL trial, which finally showed modest cardiovascular benefit in 2017—a 9% reduction in major coronary events over 4 years in patients already on statin therapy. However, the drug accumulated in adipose tissue with unknown long-term effects, and Merck decided not to pursue FDA approval, effectively ending anacetrapib's development in June 2017.

**Scientific Impact:** The CETP inhibitor saga fundamentally challenged the HDL hypothesis. Researchers realized that HDL is a heterogeneous collection of particles with complex functions, and simply raising total HDL levels doesn't guarantee cardiovascular protection. This led to revised understanding of HDL functionality, including reverse cholesterol transport efficiency, particle size distribution, and HDL's inflammatory/antioxidant properties as being more important than absolute HDL levels. The failures also reinforced the primacy of LDL reduction as the validated pathway for cardiovascular risk reduction.

**Business Consequences:** Pfizer lost over $800 million in torcetrapib development costs. The failures affected the entire cardiovascular drug development landscape, shifting emphasis toward LDL reduction (leading to PCSK9 inhibitors like evolocumab and alirocumab) and away from HDL elevation strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Implicit prediction: Roche might face similar safety issues as Pfizer.** This prediction proved mostly correct but took different forms. While Roche's dalcetrapib didn't show the same hypertensive toxicity as torcetrapib, it demonstrated efficacy futility—no cardiovascular benefit despite successful HDL elevation. Both outcomes represented similar dead ends, though the mechanism differed.

- **Implicit prediction: Statin combination would be necessary for commercial/clinical success.** This proved directionally correct but ultimately insufficient. All companies (including Roche) pursued statin combinations as the article noted they would, but even this strategy couldn't rescue the drug class from fundamental questions about HDL's causal role in atheroprotection.

- **Implicit prediction: The industry needed to understand whether CETP inhibition itself or the statin combination caused problems.** The answer that emerged was more nuanced: CETP inhibition itself appeared reasonably safe (no repeat of torcetrapib's specific toxicity), but the fundamental premise—that raising HDL via CETP inhibition would reduce cardiovascular events—was flawed.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in drug development and cardiovascular research, raising prescient questions about mechanism validation and combination therapy strategies that proved highly relevant to the subsequent decade of failures.
