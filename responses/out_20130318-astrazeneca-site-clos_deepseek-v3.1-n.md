# AstraZeneca Site Closings - And Openings (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reports on AstraZeneca's major R&D restructuring announced in March 2013. The company planned to concentrate its small molecule and biologics research activities into three strategic centers: Cambridge (UK), Gaithersburg (Maryland, US), and Mölndal (Sweden), with a planned $500 million investment in a new Cambridge facility that would also become the global corporate headquarters.

This consolidation meant significant site closures and job impacts: Alderley Park in the UK and the Paddington office in London would close, affecting 1,600 positions at Alderley Park alone. In the US, Wilmington would lose 1,200 roles as the Global Medicines Development group relocated, with an estimated 650 actual job losses. The restructuring was expected to be fully implemented by 2016, though many details remained unclear about how staff would transition to the new locations.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013 restructuring represented a pivotal moment for AstraZeneca that unfolded over the following years. The company did indeed establish its new global R&D center in Cambridge, UK, completing the biomedical research campus at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus by 2016. However, the transition was not without challenges.

Alderley Park, the historic site being closed, was subsequently developed into a science park called Alderley Park Life Sciences, housing various biotech companies and research organizations. This created a new innovation hub, though many former AZ employees faced difficult transitions.

The broader context was AstraZeneca's struggle with patent cliffs on major drugs like Crestor and Nexium, and the need to rebuild its R&D pipeline. The restructuring was part of CEO Pascal Soriot's broader turnaround strategy that included multiple acquisitions, including the later attempted (but ultimately failed) acquisition by Pfizer in 2014, and successful acquisitions of companies like MedImmune (already owned) and later Alexion in 2020.

The R&D strategy shift to biologics and targeted therapies led to some successes, including cancer drugs like Tagrisso and Lynparza, but the company continued to face pipeline challenges. The geographic consolidation did streamline operations, though the human capital transition was significant. The Boston site mentioned in the article (Waltham, Massachusetts area) has remained an important R&D location.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains several concrete predictions and plans, with these outcomes:

• **$500 million investment in Cambridge facility**: This investment was made, and the Cambridge Biomedical Campus was completed, becoming operational and serving as AZ's global headquarters and major R&D center.

• **Implementation by 2016**: The restructuring timeline was largely achieved, with the major transitions completed within the 2016 timeframe.

• **1,600 roles migrating from Alderley Park**: This job impact occurred as described, with the closure of the historic UK research site and relocation of functions to Cambridge, though this represented significant disruption to employees given the distance.

• **Gaithersburg, Maryland as biologics hub**: MedImmune's headquarters in Gaithersburg continued to expand as AZ's biologics center, aligning with the company's increased focus on biologic drugs.

• **Mölndal, Sweden as small molecule center**: The Swedish site continued operations but faced further restructuring over subsequent years as AZ continued adjusting its geographic footprint.

The bigger picture prediction was that this consolidation would improve R&D productivity and pipeline development. While AZ did achieve some successes (particularly in oncology), the fundamental challenge of sustaining innovation in pharmaceutical R&D remained.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important corporate restructuring that typified the broader pharmaceutical industry's response to patent cliffs and R&D productivity challenges. While significant for understanding industry dynamics, it represents one case study among many similar pharma restructurings.
