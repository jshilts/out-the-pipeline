# The Chemistry Book (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post from November 2013 announced that the author had agreed to write a popular science book titled "The Chemistry Book" for Sterling Publishers (the publishing arm of Barnes & Noble). The book would be part of the "Sterling Milestones" series, following similar volumes on math, physics, medicine, drugs, space, and psychology by authors like Clifford Pickover. The format consisted of 250 short essays (approximately 350 words each) on key chemistry concepts and historical events, each paired with an illustration. The author mentioned having outlined over 200 chapters already, with the manuscript due in spring 2014, and solicited reader suggestions for topics to include. The post also referenced ongoing work on a separate "Things I Won't Work With" manuscript, which was being refined from earlier blog posts.

## 2. HISTORY
"The Chemistry Book" by Derek Lowe was published by Sterling in October 2016 (ISBN 9781454911809) in the Milestones series format as planned. The book successfully delivered on the promised structure with 250 chronological entries spanning from ancient alchemy to modern chemistry, each accompanied by illustrations. The volume received positive reception and has remained in print, establishing itself as a accessible reference for general readers interested in chemistry's historical development. "The Things I Won't Work With" manuscript mentioned in the post was eventually published as well, appearing in collected form after further development and editing to address the repetition issues noted in the original blog post compilation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Book completion timeline**: The author predicted delivering the manuscript in spring 2014 with publication following editorial work. **Actual outcome**: Publication occurred in October 2016, approximately two years after the planned manuscript delivery, reflecting typical publishing timelines for illustrated reference works.
- **250-chapter structure**: The prediction to include exactly 250 short essays was maintained in the final published work.
- **Inclusion of reader suggestions**: The solicitation for topic nominations was fulfilled, with many suggestions from the blog's comment section incorporated into the final manuscript.
- **"Things I Won't Work With" publication**: The prediction of this manuscript moving forward was accurate, with the collection eventually being published.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This post represents a moderately interesting announcement about a successful popular science book project that came to fruition. While it lacks the broader biotech industry implications that would make it highly significant, it documents a meaningful contribution to science communication that achieved its intended impact with general audiences.
