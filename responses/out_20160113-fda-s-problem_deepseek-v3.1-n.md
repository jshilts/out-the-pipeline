# This is the FDA's Problem (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses the concerning trend of rising prices for off-patent generic medications in the United States. The author highlights that while generic drugs have traditionally been the cheapest in the industrialized world, prices have been rising "spectacularly, ridiculously so" in recent years, particularly for older drugs produced by only one or two manufacturers. The JAMA article cited identifies that reduced competition has led to both drug shortages and a "novel business strategy" where pharmaceutical companies dominate noncompetitive markets for older drugs and then substantially increase prices.

The author argues that this problem is largely regulatory, stemming from FDA's "glacial review" of generic drug applications. The FDA had a massive backlog of thousands of generic applications from before 2013, and even with the Generic Drug User Fee Act providing greater resources, the agency would still take years to review applications. This slow approval process prevents competitors from entering the market when prices spike. Additionally, the FDA was criticized for offering overly generous market exclusivity terms for older drugs, which combined with slow review times, creates monopolistic conditions.

The JAMA authors propose that the FDA prioritize review of generic applications for drugs that could help resolve shortages or prevent monopolistic price hikes. The suggestion is to either have FDA recognize that addressing monopolistic conditions falls under preventing future shortages, or have another HHS division identify applications to prioritize.

## 2. HISTORY

The trends identified in 2016 have largely persisted and in some cases worsened, despite regulatory interventions:

**Continued Price Hikes and Drug Shortages**: Drug shortages have remained a persistent problem in the United States. According to FDA data and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) tracking, drug shortages reached record highs in subsequent years, with 2023 seeing the highest number of active shortages since tracking began in 2001. Generic sterile injectables, particularly older cancer drugs and critical care medications, have remained disproportionately affected.

**FDA Response and Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA)**: The FDA did implement reforms through GDUFA II (reauthorized in 2017) and GDUFA III (2022), which included measures to expedite review of generic applications for drugs in shortage or with limited competition. The agency established priority review pathways and implemented the Competitive Generic Therapy (CGT) designation in 2017, providing 180-day exclusivity for generic drugs with limited competition. However, the backlog issue persisted, and critics argue these measures have been insufficient to address the scale of the problem.

**Continued Market Consolidation**: The business model described in 2016—acquiring older generic drugs with limited competition and raising prices—continued to be employed. Notable examples include Turing Pharmaceuticals (daraprim price hike from $13.50 to $750 per pill in 2015), Mylan's EpiPen pricing controversy, and various other instances where decades-old drugs saw dramatic price increases. However, some of these companies faced significant public backlash and congressional scrutiny.

**Legislative and Executive Actions**: The issue led to various policy responses:
- The CREATES Act (Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act) was passed in 2019, intended to make it easier for generic manufacturers to obtain samples needed for bioequivalence testing from brand-name companies that had been withholding samples.
- Several states implemented drug price transparency laws requiring manufacturers to justify significant price increases.
- Federal legislation proposals for drug importation programs gained traction in some states.
- The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included provisions allowing Medicare to negotiate certain drug prices.

**Business Failures and Consolidation**: The generic drug industry saw continued consolidation, with many smaller manufacturers exiting due to low margins, while others faced manufacturing quality issues that led to plant shutdowns and further shortages. The industry structure remained challenging, with many older generics having only one or two manufacturers.

The core problems identified in 2016—FDA review delays, limited competition for older drugs, and strategic price increases—largely persisted, though with some regulatory improvements and increased public attention.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains several implicit predictions about the consequences of inaction:

• **Continued price increases for older generic drugs**: This prediction proved accurate. Numerous older generic drugs have continued to see dramatic price increases, including cases where decades-old medications (some from the 1950s-1980s) increased in price by several hundred or thousand percent.

• **Ongoing drug shortages**: This prediction was correct. Drug shortages have remained a persistent problem, with critical shortages affecting cancer drugs, antibiotics, and other essential medications throughout the late 2010s and into the 2020s. The ASHP reported record numbers of active shortages in 2023.

• **FDA's continued regulatory challenges**: This was accurate. While the FDA implemented reforms through GDUFA reauthorizations, the generic drug review process has continued to face criticism for delays and inefficiencies in addressing competition issues for older drugs.

• **Systemic failure of the generic drug market**: This proved partially correct. While the generic drug system hasn't completely collapsed, significant dysfunction has persisted. The two-tier system (expensive patented drugs transitioning to affordable generics) has continued to experience stress, with the generic component becoming less reliable both in terms of availability and price stability.

• **Need for external intervention or prioritization system**: This has been addressed to some degree through various FDA priority review pathways and the CREATES Act, though many critics argue these measures haven't been sufficient to fundamentally solve the problem.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article identified a fundamental regulatory and market failure that remained highly relevant for nearly a decade, accurately predicting persistent problems with drug shortages and price spikes for essential generic medications that have affected millions of patients and cost the healthcare system billions of dollars.
