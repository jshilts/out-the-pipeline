# Cui Bono? (November 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Merck's decision to withdraw Vioxx (rofecoxib) from the market following evidence of elevated cardiovascular risks in long-term users. The author critiques Wall Street Journal columnist Holman Jenkins' view that Merck's withdrawal was a strategic blunder, arguing instead that Merck had little choice given the definitive clinical trial data showing cardiovascular problems, and that FDA intervention was likely imminent.

The central argument focuses on whether Vioxx should have been withdrawn entirely versus being relabeled with warnings and restricted to appropriate patient populations. The article suggests that Vioxx was not inherently defective but was seriously overprescribed—with two-thirds of COX-2 inhibitor users not actually needing them. This leads to a broader critique of pharmaceutical industry incentives shaped by third-party payment systems that encourage development of drugs for price-insensitive conditions (aches, pains, insecurities, erectile dysfunction) over more critical but less profitable areas like vaccines and antibiotics.

## 2. HISTORY

**Immediate Aftermath (2004-2007):**
- Merck faced approximately 27,000 lawsuits related to Vioxx between 2004-2007
- In 2007, Merck agreed to a $4.85 billion settlement to resolve most Vioxx-related product liability lawsuits
- The Vioxx case became a landmark example in pharmaceutical litigation and drug safety regulation

**Regulatory and Policy Changes:**
- The Vioxx withdrawal accelerated FDA reforms, including:
 - Enhanced post-marketing surveillance requirements (FDA Amendments Act of 2007)
 - Implementation of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for high-risk drugs
 - Strengthened FDA authority to mandate post-approval studies and safety labeling changes
- Increased scrutiny of COX-2 inhibitors specifically:
 - Celebrex (celecoxib) remained on market but with strengthened warnings
 - Bextra (valdecoxib) was withdrawn in 2005 over cardiovascular and skin reaction concerns
 - All remaining NSAIDs received updated cardiovascular risk warnings

**COX-2 Inhibitor Market Evolution:**
- Celebrex remained the sole COX-2 inhibitor in the US market with restricted prescribing patterns
- Physician prescribing behavior shifted toward more selective COX-2 inhibitor use, primarily for high gastrointestinal risk patients
- Generic NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) maintained dominance in pain management

**Scientific Understanding Development:**
- Subsequent research confirmed that cardiovascular risk is likely a class effect of COX-2 selective inhibitors
- Mechanisms involving prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance became better understood
- Guidelines evolved to recommend COX-2 inhibitors only for patients with high GI risk and low CV risk

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Prediction: COX-2 inhibitors would face market constraints vs. complete abandonment**
 - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. Celebrex remained available with warnings and REMS requirements, while Bextra was withdrawn entirely. The market became highly restricted by 2010.

• **Prediction: Physicians and insurance companies would face scrutiny for their roles**
 - **Outcome**: Accurate. Major investigations and lawsuits examined pharmaceutical company relationships with physicians (e.g., 2012 GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion settlement), leading to Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements.

• **Prediction: High drug development costs would continue driving focus toward profitable chronic diseases**
 - **Outcome**: Highly accurate. The decade following saw continued concentration on oncology, autoimmune diseases, and rare diseases with orphan drug pricing, while antibiotic development stalled. The 2020s saw some corrections through CARB-X, AMR Action Fund, and infectious disease focus post-COVID.

• **Prediction: Regulatory system would force recoupment of billion-dollar development costs in limited patent windows**
 - **Outcome**: Accurate. Between 2004-2024, average drug development costs continued rising (some analyses suggesting $2.6-3 billion), maintaining pressure for high-revenue drugs. Patent cliffs remained critical business events.

• **Prediction: Drug safety monitoring and post-market surveillance would strengthen**
 - **Outcome**: Accurate. FDA's Sentinel Initiative began in 2008, and post-marketing requirements became standard for new approvals.

• **Prediction: The dynamics described would persist because of third-party payment systems**
 - **Outcome**: Mixed. While third-party payment ecosystem largely continued, 2010 Affordable Care Act made preventive care more central, and value-based payment models emerged, though pharmaceutical pricing remained contentious.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates sophisticated understanding of pharmaceutical industry incentive structures and correctly predicted ongoing regulatory and market dynamics that shaped the subsequent two decades of drug development and safety monitoring. Its systemic analysis rather than simple condemnation of "big pharma" reflected deeper structural understanding.
