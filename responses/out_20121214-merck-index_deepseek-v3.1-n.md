# The Merck Index (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the Royal Society of Chemistry's acquisition of the Merck Index, a historical chemical reference work, and their plans to expand its online presence. The author expresses skepticism about this strategy's success, noting that despite having a personal copy, it rarely gets used. The main argument is that Wikipedia's chemical substance entries and other online resources have largely displaced traditional reference works like the Merck Index. While acknowledging that some professionals still prefer citing standard references over Wikipedia, the author questions whether there's sufficient market demand to support this initiative, suggesting that the optimal window for such a venture would have been a decade earlier when online reference colonization was more opportunistic.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2012 commentary, the Merck Index continued its transition under RSC ownership. The 15th edition was published in 2013, and RSC did indeed develop an online version. However, the broader trend of Wikipedia and other free online databases displacing traditional reference works accelerated significantly. Major pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted digital workflows and computational chemistry platforms, while researchers turned to databases like PubChem, ChEMBL, and ChemSpider for chemical information. The Merck Index Online exists today but operates in a highly competitive landscape dominated by free, comprehensive resources. Many academic institutions prioritize access to larger, more frequently updated databases over specialized historical references, and the Merck Index's role has largely shifted to that of a specialized heritage resource rather than a primary research tool. The market consolidation the author anticipated did occur, with Wikipedia becoming the default public reference for basic chemical information, though professional databases maintained their niche for rigorous research applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Primary prediction: RSC's attempt to raise the Merck Index's online profile would face limited success** - This proved largely accurate; while the Merck Index Online was launched, it never achieved the widespread adoption or prominence the RSC might have hoped for, remaining a specialized rather than mainstream resource.

• **Implicit prediction: Wikipedia and other online resources would continue displacing traditional reference works** - This prediction was strongly validated, as Wikipedia's chemistry coverage expanded dramatically, and free chemical databases became the primary research tools for most chemists and students.

• **Implicit prediction: The ideal timing for such an initiative had passed** - The market dynamics confirmed this concern; by 2012, the digital reference space was already mature, with established players and user expectations for free access to information.

• **Implicit prediction: Limited market existed beyond professionals who prefer standard references** - This proved accurate as the Merck Index maintained utility primarily for citation purposes and historical context rather than as a primary research database.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

The article addresses an important transitional moment in scientific information delivery but focuses on a relatively narrow reference work rather than broader transformative trends. While prescient about market dynamics, it lacks the broader implications of major biotechnological or pharmaceutical developments.
