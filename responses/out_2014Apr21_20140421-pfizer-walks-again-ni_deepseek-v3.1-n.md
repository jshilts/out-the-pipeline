I'll analyze the article using our benefit of hindsight to see how the concerns and speculations of 2014 played out.

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reacts to a Sunday Times report that Pfizer had attempted a bid for AstraZeneca, expressing surprise given CEO Ian Read's previous public stance against large-scale mergers. The piece notes that Read had been vocal about focusing on drug discovery and getting Pfizer to "the right size," making a major acquisition seem like a return to old habits. It points to shifting language from Read and positions the bid attempt as a signal that Pfizer may be "hungry for a big deal again," with implications that "no one is safe" in the industry.

## 2. HISTORY

**What actually happened:**
On May 18, 2014 - less than a month after this article - Pfizer made a formal £69.4 billion ($117 billion) hostile takeover bid for AstraZeneca, which was rejected. The merger failed primarily due to political and regulatory concerns about losing UK pharmaceutical leadership and research jobs.

**The continuing saga:**
- **2014**: Pfizer's pursuit of tax inversion strategies becomes clear - they were seeking UK domicile to reduce US corporate tax burden from roughly 25% to 21%
- **2015**: Instead of AZ, Pfizer acquired Hospira for $17 billion and announced a $160 billion merger with Allergan
- **2016**: The Allergan deal collapsed due to new US Treasury regulations targeting tax inversions
- **2019**: Pfizer completed a massive $11.4 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma, and later that year spun off its generics division into a new company (Viatris) while merging its established medicines division with Mylan

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Correct predictions:**
- The article was right that Pfizer's talk about "focusing" and being the "right size" was essentially rhetorical cover - they absolutely wanted major deals
- "No one is safe" - large pharma M&A continued aggressively throughout this period
- The surprise reversal of stated strategy was indeed the pattern going forward

**What was MISSED by this article:**
- The crucial tax inversion motive, which was probably the primary driver of the AZ deal structure
- How much Pfizer's actions were driven by shareholder pressure to reduce costs rather than any strategic vision for drug discovery
- That the AZ deal was part of a broader wave of pharma consolidation driven by tax and patent expiration concerns

**Wrong predictions:**
- Ian Read didn't, in fact, "swear off the practice" as suggested - tax inversions became a primary strategic focus throughout 2014-2016

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article captures a specific, important moment: when public statements about strategic focus collided with massive M&A ambitions. While the article slightly misses the tax inversion dynamic, it correctly identifies the strategic tension and the fact that traditional pharma was struggling with the "innovate vs. acquire" dilemma. 

However, the analysis lacks depth on the fundamental business drivers: patent cliffs, shareholder activism, and tax arbitrage. The real significance wasn't Pfizer's "return to old habits" but rather the industry's broader struggle to maintain profitability as blockbuster drugs went generic. Pfizer wasn't being hypocritical so much as brutally realistic about where value could be created in the 2010s pharmaceutical landscape - and it wasn't mainly through R&D.
