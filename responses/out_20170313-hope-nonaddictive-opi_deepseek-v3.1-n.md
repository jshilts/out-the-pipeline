# Hope For Nonaddictive Opioid Painkillers (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article addresses the urgent need for non-addictive opioid painkillers amid the opioid crisis. It describes how pain research has historically been challenging, with many promising candidates failing in clinical trials. The author highlights two approaches: searching for new pain mechanisms (which had led to numerous failures of ion-channel and other receptor targets) and finding ways to target opioid receptors without causing addiction.

The article focuses on two promising 2016-2017 developments. First, an orvinol derivative that simultaneously targets mu-opioid and nociceptin receptors showed analgesia without addictive potential in primate models. Second, a Berlin research team developed a pH-sensitive fentanyl derivative that exploits the fact that inflamed/injured tissues have lower pH than normal tissues. In rodent studies, this compound showed pain relief only at injury sites and lacked typical opioid side effects: no addiction potential, respiratory depression, GI effects, or sedation.

## 2. HISTORY

**The 2017 compounds and related approaches:**

The pH-sensitive fentanyl approach described in the Science paper faced significant translation challenges. While the concept was scientifically elegant, developing tissue-selective opioids that work only in acidic (inflamed) environments proved more complex in humans than in rodent models. These compounds did not lead to FDA-approved drugs in the subsequent years.

The dual mu-opioid/nociceptin approach has seen continued interest but limited clinical success. Several companies pursued nociceptin receptor (NOP) agonists, but none have achieved significant market success.

**Broader context and industry outcomes:**

The period following 2017 saw continued failures in pain drug development. Major pharmaceutical companies faced repeated Phase II and Phase III failures, leading many to scale back or exit pain research entirely. The biotech sector also struggled, with numerous companies focusing on novel pain mechanisms going bankrupt or pivoting to other therapeutic areas.

**Regulatory and policy developments:**

The FDA implemented more cautious approval standards for opioid medications, including requiring additional safety studies and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). This created higher barriers for any new opioid compounds, regardless of abuse-deterrent claims.

**Market realities:**

Rather than novel non-addictive mechanisms, the market saw growth in abuse-deterrent formulations of existing opioids (physical barriers, prodrugs, combination products), though these addressed abuse rather than fundamental addiction mechanisms. The pharmaceutical industry largely shifted focus away from developing fundamentally new pain drugs toward reformulating existing ones.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The author stated that the 2017 results were "very hopeful" and said, "I hope that such compounds advance to human trials as soon as possible... If we can get to the point of being able to regard classical opioid drugs as barbaric remnants of an earlier age, that would be a great improvement."

**Reality**: Neither of the specific 2017 approaches led to approved drugs. Classical opioids remain the standard of care for severe acute pain. The prediction that these compounds would quickly advance to human trials proved optimistic—developing non-addictive painkillers has remained stubbornly difficult, and no fundamentally new pain mechanism has achieved widespread clinical adoption since 2017.

• **Prediction**: The article suggested that finding ways to hit opioid receptors without causing addiction was a viable path forward.

**Reality**: Despite decades of research, separating analgesia from addiction potential at mu-opioid receptors has proven enormously challenging. The fundamental neurobiology linking pain relief and reward/addiction pathways has resisted easy separation, and biased agonists and other approaches have not delivered breakthrough therapies.

• **Bigger picture**: The underlying assumption that pharmacology could readily solve the problem through clever drug design underestimated the complexity of pain neuroscience and addiction biology. The article's optimism about quick translation from rodent models to human therapies was not borne out, reflecting a pattern seen across pain drug development.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article addresses a critical public health problem with clear explanation of two scientifically sophisticated approaches. While the specific compounds didn't translate to clinical success, the piece captured an important moment in pain research and highlighted the ongoing scientific challenge that remains highly relevant.
