# Article Title (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports that Codexis, an enzyme engineering company known for industrializing difficult enzymatic transformations and for its collaboration with Merck, accused a former employee Junhua (Alex) Tao and his new company EnzymeWorks of trade secret theft. Codexis alleged that EnzymeWorks' products were exact residue-for-residue copies of Codexis products, and that Tao stole a proprietary plasmid kept as a trade secret during a Pfizer collaboration. The author notes that the odds of achieving such perfect copies independently would be very small.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2016 lawsuit between Codexis and EnzymeWorks appears to have been resolved or settled out of court, though specific public outcomes are limited. EnzymeWorks continued operating and expanded their enzyme engineering capabilities. Codexis has since diversified beyond pharmaceuticals into areas like manufacturing APIs, with partnerships including collaborations on COVID-19 therapeutic development. Both companies remain active in the enzyme engineering space, suggesting the legal dispute did not significantly impact their long-term operations or market position.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Author's prediction that "the odds of perfect copies being obtained by other than theft are...very small indeed"**: The implied prediction that the lawsuit would likely substantiate Codexis's claims of IP theft. However, the lack of widely publicized court outcomes or decisive legal rulings makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of this prediction. Both companies continued operations, which suggests either settlement, dismissal, or continuation without definitive public resolution of the theft allegations.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
The article addresses a relatively routine IP dispute in the biotech sector, with limited broader scientific or policy implications. While enzyme engineering is important, this specific corporate legal matter has modest long-term significance.
