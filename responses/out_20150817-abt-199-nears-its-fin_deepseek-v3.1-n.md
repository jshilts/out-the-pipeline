# ABT-199 Nears Its Finish Line (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses ABT-199 (venetoclax), a Bcl-2 inhibitor being developed by AbbVie and Roche for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other blood cancers. The compound had shown such potent activity that it initially caused problems in clinical trials - rapid tumor cell death led to cellular debris overwhelming patients' kidneys. However, after protocol adjustments, the drug was meeting its trial endpoints by August 2015, with FDA filing imminent.

The article highlights the significance of ABT-199 as a pure protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor, representing a breakthrough for a historically challenging drug class. The author notes that while Bcl-targeted compounds benefit from a well-defined binding groove, PPI inhibition remains difficult. The piece expresses cautious optimism about the broader potential for PPI-based drug discovery, given the hundreds of thousands of protein interactions in cells, while acknowledging that most may not be druggable.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication, ABT-199 (venetoclax) received FDA approval in April 2016 for CLL patients with 17p deletion who had received at least one prior therapy. Over subsequent years, it gained multiple additional approvals and became a standard therapy:

- **April 2016**: Initial FDA accelerated approval for CLL with 17p deletion
- **June 2018**: Regular FDA approval for CLL based on improved overall survival data
- **November 2018**: FDA approval for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine
- **Multiple indications expanded**: Received approvals internationally for various combinations and patient populations

The drug became commercially successful, generating billions in annual revenue for AbbVie. However, clinical adoption revealed real-world challenges including tumor lysis syndrome (the kidney issue mentioned in the article), requiring careful dose escalation protocols. Venetoclax-based combinations became standard of care for certain CLL and AML patient populations.

The broader PPI inhibitor field has seen mixed progress. While venetoclax succeeded, many other PPI targets remained difficult to drug. Subsequent development has focused on other Bcl-2 family inhibitors and chemically similar approaches. Several companies continued pursuing PPI modulators, but widespread breakthroughs beyond specific privileged targets remained limited.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several predictions and observations:

• **Prediction: ABT-199 would receive FDA approval** ✓ **Accurate** - Approved April 2016
• **Prediction: This would be a step forward for CLL and potentially other leukemias/lymphomas** ✓ **Accurate** - Became standard therapy for CLL and received AML approval
• **Prediction: This would represent progress for medicinal chemistry and PPI inhibitors** ✓ **Partially accurate** - Venetoclax succeeded, but broader PPI drug discovery remained challenging with limited subsequent breakthroughs
• **Prediction: More organizations would pursue similar targets** ✓ **Accurate** - Continued research on Bcl-2 family proteins occurred
• **Observation: Only a small fraction of PPIs are likely druggable** - **Reasonable assessment** - Limited evidence of widespread PPI druggability since 2015
• **Hopes for breakthroughs making PPI drugs "more likely"** - **Partially realized** - Venetoclax provided proof-of-concept, but general methods for drugging PPIs remained elusive

The success was more target-specific than field-transforming. Venetoclax worked because Bcl-2 has favorable structural features; translating this to other PPIs remained challenging.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **8/10**

This article captured an important moment in oncology drug development, accurately predicting FDA approval of a breakthrough therapy and identifying key scientific challenges in PPI inhibition that remain relevant.
