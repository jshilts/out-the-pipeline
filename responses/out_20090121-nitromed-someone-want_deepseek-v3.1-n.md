# Nitromed: Someone Wants Them (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a 2009 takeover situation involving NitroMed, a biotechnology company. Deerfield Management, one of NitroMed's largest shareholders, objected to a proposed deal between NitroMed and Archemix that had been mentioned in November 2008. Instead of allowing that transaction, Deerfield made its own offer to acquire NitroMed outright. The bidding process involved multiple adjournments of shareholder meetings as Deerfield incrementally raised its offer from $0.50 to $0.80 per share. The article suggests some irony in Deerfield's negotiating tactics, noting they likely would have criticized similar behavior from other bidders.

## 2. HISTORY

The events described in this January 2009 article preceded the ultimate resolution of NitroMed's fate. **NitroMed ultimately accepted a buyout offer** from Deerfield Management. In March 2009, NitroMed agreed to be acquired by Deerfield for approximately $15.5 million in cash, or about $0.89 per share - slightly above the $0.80 mentioned in the article's bidding process.

Following the acquisition, NitroMed's main asset was **BiDil (isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine hydrochloride)**, an FDA-approved heart failure medication specifically indicated for African American patients. Despite the FDA approval, BiDil had faced significant commercial challenges including disappointing sales and insurance reimbursement issues, which contributed to NitroMed's financial struggles.

After the Deerfield acquisition, **NitroMed ceased to exist as an independent public company**. The BiDil patent expired in 2020, and the drug's limited market adoption reflected broader challenges in race-specific pharmaceutical treatments and the complexities of targeted cardiovascular therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself did not contain specific predictions about future outcomes, instead focusing on the contemporaneous bidding process and takeover dynamics. However, the implied trajectory was that NitroMed would ultimately be acquired, which proved accurate.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article represents a routine corporate takeover situation in the biotech sector rather than substantive scientific or medical developments. While it documents an interesting moment in NitroMed's corporate history, it lacks broader significance for biotechnology innovation or patient outcomes. The issues described are primarily financial and corporate governance matters rather than scientific or clinical breakthroughs.
